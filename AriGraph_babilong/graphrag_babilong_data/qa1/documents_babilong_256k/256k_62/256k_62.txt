‘The work at Reni is coming to an end, and we are to go to the front
 with the Serbian Division.I cannot write about it owing to censors
 and people.But I am going to risk this: the Serbs ought to be most
 awfully proud.The Russian General on the front is going to insist on
 having them “to stiffen up his Russian troops.” I think you people at
 home ought to know what magnificent fighting men these Serbs are, and
 so splendidly disciplined, simply worth their weight in gold.There
 are only two divisions of them after all.We have about thirty-five of
 them in hospital just now as sanitaries, and they are such a comfort;
 their quickness and their devotion is wonderful.The hospital was full
 and overflowing when I left--still Russians.Most of the cases were
 slight; a great many left hands, if you know what that _means_.I
 don’t think the British Army does know!‘We had a Red Cross inspecting officer down from Petrograd.He was
 very pleased with everything, and kissed my hand on departing, and
 said we were doing great things for the Alliance.I wanted to say many
 things, but thought I had better leave it alone.‘We are operating at 5 A.M.now, because the afternoons are so hot.The other day we began at 5, and had to go till 4 P.M.‘Matron and I had a delightful ride the other evening.Just as we
 had turned for home, an aeroplane appeared, and the first shot from
 the anti-aircraft guns close beside us was too much for our horses,
 who promptly bolted.However, there was nothing but the clear Steppe
 before us, so we just sat tight and went.After a little they
 recovered themselves, and really behaved very well.’

      ‘_Aug.28._

 ‘You dear, dear people, how sweet of you to send me a telegram for
 my birthday.You don’t know how nice it was to get it and to feel you
 were thinking of me.Miss G. brought it
 me with a very puzzled face, and said, “I cannot quite make out this
 telegram.” It was written in Russian characters.She evidently was not
 used to people doing such mad things as telegraphing the “Many happy
 returns of the day” half across the world.I understood it at once,
 and it nearly made me cry.It was good to get it, though I think the
 Food Controller or somebody ought to come down on you for wasting
 money in the middle of a war.‘I am finishing this letter in Reni.We closed the hospital yesterday,
 and joined our Division somewhere on Friday.The rush that had begun
 before I got to Odessa got much worse.They had an awfully busy time,
 a faint reminiscence of Galatz, though, as they were operating twelve
 hours on end, I don’t know it was so very faint.We had no more left
 hands, but all the bad cases.Everybody worked magnificently, but they
 always do in a push.The time a British unit goes to pieces is when
 there is nothing to do!‘So this bit of work ends, eight months.I am quite sorry to leave it,
 but quite quite glad to get back to our Division.‘Well, Amy dearest, good-bye for the present.Love to all you dear people.’

      ‘S.W.H.,
      ‘HADJI ABDUL, _Oct.‘I wonder if this is my last letter from Russia!We hope to be off
 in a very few days now.We have had a very pleasant time in this
 place with its Turkish name.We are with the Division, and were given this perfectly beautiful
 camping-ground, with trees, and a <DW72> towards the east.The question
 was whether we were going to Rumania or elsewhere.It is nice being
 back with these nice people.They have been most kind and friendly,
 and we have picnics and rides and _dances_, and dinners, and till this
 turmoil of the move began we had an afternoon reception every day
 under the walnut trees!Now, we are packed up and ready to go, and I
 mean to walk in on you one morning.‘We shall have about two months to refit, but one of those is my due
 as a holiday, _which I am going to take_.I’ll see you all soon.--Your
 loving aunt,

CHAPTER XI

THE MOORINGS CUT

    ‘Not I, but my Unit.’

    ‘My dear Unit, good-bye.’--Nov.‘Into the wide deep seas which we call God
    You plunged.This is not death,
    You seemed to say, but fuller life.’

The reports of Dr.Inglis as chief medical officer to the London
Committee were as detailed and foreseeing in the very last one that
she wrote as in the first from on board the transport that took her
and her unit out.She writes:--‘In view of the fact that we are in the
middle of big happenings I should like Dr.Laird to bring ½ ton cotton
wool, six bales moss dressings, 100 lb.ether, 20
gallons rectified spirits.I wonder what news of the river boat for
Mesopotamia?’ After they had landed and were at work:--‘I have wired
asking for another hospital for the base.I know you have your hands
full, but I also know that if the people at home realise what their
help would mean out here just now, we would not have to ask twice.And
again:--’Keep the home fires burning and let us feel their warmth.’ She
soon encountered the usual obstacles:--‘I saw that there was no good in
the world talking about regular field hospitals to them until they had
tried our mettle.The ordinary male disbelief in our capacity cannot
be argued away.It can only be worked away.’ So she acted.Russia
created disbelief, but the men at arms of all nations saw and believed.In November she wrote back incredulously:--‘Rumours of falling back.Anxious about the equipment.’ In bombardments, in
retreat, and evacuations the equipment was her one thought.‘Stand by
the equipment’ became a joke in her unit.On one occasion one of the
orderlies had a heavy fall from a lorry on which she was in charge of
the precious stuff.Dusty and shaken, she was gathering herself up,
when the voice of the chief rang out imperatively urgent, ‘Stand by the
equipment.’ On the rail certain trucks, bearing all the equipment, got
on a wrong line, and were carried away:--‘The blue ribbon belongs to
Miss Borrowman and Miss Brown.They saw our wagons disappearing with
a refugee train, whereupon these two ran after it and jumped on, and
finally brought the equipment safely to Galatz.They invented a General
Popovitch who would be very angry if it did not get through.Without
those two girls and their ingenuity, the equipment would not have got
through.’

She details all the difficulties of packing up and evacuating after
the despatch rider came with the order that the hospitals were to
fall back to Galatz.The only method their own, all else chaotic and
helpless, working night and day, the unit accomplished everything.At
the station, packed with a country and army in flight, Dr.Inglis had a
talk with a Rumanian officer.He told her that he had been in Glasgow,
and had there been invited out to dinner, and had seen ‘English
customs.’ ‘It was good to feel those English customs were still going
on quietly, whatever was happening here, breakfast coming regularly and
hot water for baths, and everything as it should be.It was probably
absurd, but it came like a great wave of comfort to feel that England
was there quiet and strong and invincible behind everything and
everybody.’

As we read these natural vivid diary reports, we too can feel it was
good of England that Dr.Inglis was to the last on that front--

    ‘Ambassador from Britain’s Crown,
      And type of all her race.’

Dr.Inglis never lost sight of the Army she went out to serve.She
refused to return unless they were brought away from the Russian front
with her.‘I wonder if a proper account of what happened then went home to
 the English papers?The Serbian Division went into the fight 15,000
 strong.They were in the centre--the Rumanians on their left, and the
 Russians on their right.The Rumanians broke, and they fought for
 twenty-four hours on two fronts.They came out of the fight, having
 lost 11,000 men.It is almost incredible, and that is when we ought to
 have been out, and could have been out if we had not taken so long to
 get under way.’

In the last Report, dated October 29, 1917, she tells her Committee she
has been ‘tied by the leg to bed.’ There are notes on coming events:--

 ‘There really seems a prospect of getting away soon.The Foreign
 Office knows us only too well.Only 6000 of the Division go in this
 lot, the rest (15,000) to follow.’

There is a characteristic last touch.‘I have asked Miss Onslow to get English paper-back novels for the
 unit on their journey.At a certain shop, they can be got for a rouble
 each, and good ones.’

To members of that unit, doctors, sisters, orderlies, we are indebted
for many personal details, and for the story of the voyage west,
when for her the sun was setting.Her work was accomplished when on
the transport with her and her unit were the representatives of that
Serbian Army with whom she served, faithful unto death.Miss Arbuthnot, the granddaughter of Sir William Muir, the friend of
John Inglis, was one of those who helped to nurse Dr.Inglis:--

 ‘I sometimes looked after her when the Sister attending her was
 off duty.Her consideration and kindness were quite extraordinary,
 while her will and courage were quite indomitable.To die as she did
 in harness, having completed her great work in getting the Serbs away
 from Russia, is what she would have chosen.Inglis at Hadji Abdul, a small mud village about ten
 miles from Galatz.She was looking very ill, but was always busy.For
 some time she had been ill with dysentery, but she never even stayed
 in bed for breakfast till it was impossible for her to move from bed.‘During our time at Hadji we had about forty Serbian patients, a few
 wounded, but mostly sick.Inglis did a few minor operations, but
 her last major one was a gastro-enterotomy performed on one of our own
 chauffeurs, a Serb, Joe, by name.The operation took three hours and
 was entirely satisfactory, although Dr.Inglis did not consider him
 strong enough to travel back to England.She was particularly fond of
 this man, and took no end of trouble with him.Even after she became
 so very ill she used constantly to visit him.‘The Serbs entertained us to several picnics, which we duly returned.Inglis was always an excellent hostess, so charming and genial
 to every one, and so eager that both entertainers and entertained
 should equally enjoy themselves.Provided her permission was asked
 first, and duty hours or regular meals not neglected, she was always
 keen every one should enjoy themselves riding, walking, or going for
 picnics.If any one was ill, she never insisted on their getting up
 in spite of everything, as most doctors, and certainly all matrons,
 wish us to do.She was strict during duty hours, and always required
 implicit obedience to her orders--whatever they were.She was always
 so well groomed--never a hair out of place.One felt so proud of her among the dirty and generally
 unsuitably dressed women in other hospitals.She was very independent,
 and would never allow any of us to wait on her.The cooks were not
 allowed to make her any special dishes that the whole unit could not
 share.As long as she could, she messed with the unit, and there was
 no possibility of avoiding her quick eye; anything which was reserved
 for her special comfort was rejected.Once, a portion of chicken was
 kept as a surprise for her.She asked whether there had been enough
 for all, and when the cooks reluctantly confessed there was only the
 one portion she sent it away.‘During one of the evacuations, an order had been given that there
 were only two blankets allowed in each valise.Some one, mindful of
 her weakness, stuffed an extra one into Dr.Inglis’ bag, because in
 her emaciated condition she suffered much from the cold.It stirred
 her to impetuous anger, and with something of the spirit of David, as
 he poured out the water brought him at the peril of the lives of his
 followers, she flung the blanket out of the railway carriage, as a
 lesson to those of her unit who had disobeyed an order.Inglis read the Church service with great dignity
 and simplicity.On the weekday evenings, before she became so ill,
 she would join us in a game of bridge, and played nearly every night.During the retreats when nothing more could be done, and she felt
 anxious, she would sit down and play a game of patience.During the
 weeks of uncertainty, when the future of the Serbs was doubtful, and
 she was unable to take any active part, she fretted very much.‘After endless conflicting rumours and days of waiting, the
 news arrived that they were to go to England.Her delight was
 extraordinary, for she had lain in her bed day after day planning how
 she could help them, and sending endless wires to those in authority
 in England, but feeling herself very impotent.Once the good news
 arrived, her marvellous courage and tenacity helped her to recover
 sufficiently, and prepare all the details for the journey with the
 Serbs.We left on the 29th October, with the H.G.Staff and two
 thousand Serbian soldiers, in a special train going to Archangel.Inglis spent fifteen days on the train, in a second-class
 compartment, with no proper bed.Her strength varied, but she was
 compelled to lie down a great deal, although she insisted on dressing
 every morning.On two occasions she walked for five minutes on the
 station platform; each time it absolutely exhausted her.Though she
 suffered much pain and discomfort, she never complained.She could
 only have benger, chicken broth and condensed milk, and she often
 found it impossible to take even these.If one happened to bring her
 tea, or her food, she thanked one so charmingly.‘At Archangel there was no means of carrying her on to the boat, so
 with help (one orderly in front, and one lifting her behind), she
 climbed a ladder twenty feet high, from the platform to the deck of
 the transport.She was a good sailor, and had a comfortable cabin on
 the ship.She improved on board slightly, and used to sit in the small
 cabin allotted to us on the upper deck.She played patience, and was
 interested in our sea-sick symptoms.There was a young naval officer
 very seriously ill on the boat.Our people were nursing him, and she
 constantly went to prescribe; she feared he would not live, and he
 died before we reached our port.Inglis had a relapse; violent pain set
 in, and she had to return to bed.Even then, a few days before we
 reached England, she insisted on going through all the accounts,
 and prepared fresh plans to take the unit on to join the Serbs at
 Salonika.In six weeks she expected to be ready to start.She sent for
 each of us in turn, and asked if we would go with her.Needless to
 say, only those who could not again leave home, refused, and then with
 the deepest regret.Inglis
 had a violent attack of pain, and had no sleep all night.Next morning
 she insisted on getting up to say good-bye to the Serbian staff.‘It was a wonderful example of her courage and fortitude, to see her
 standing unsupported--a splendid figure of quiet dignity.Her face
 ashen and drawn like a mask, dressed in her worn uniform coat, with
 the faded ribbons that had seen such good service.As the officers
 kissed her hand, and thanked her for all she had done for them, she
 said to each of them a few words accompanied with her wonderful smile.’

As they looked on her, they also must have understood, ‘sorrowing most
of all, that they should see her face no more.’

 ‘After that parting was over, Dr.She left the boat Sunday afternoon, 25th November, and
 arrived quite exhausted at the hotel.I was allowed to see her for
 a minute before the unit left for London that night.She could only
 whisper, but was as sweet and patient as she ever was.She said we
 should meet soon in London.’

After her death, many who had watched her through these strenuous
years, regretted that she did not take more care of herself.Symptoms
of the disease appeared so soon, she must have known what overwork and
war rations meant in her state.This may be said of every follower of
the One who saved others, but could not save Himself.The life story
of Saint and Pioneer is always the same.To continue to ill-treat
‘brother body’ meant death to St.Francis; to remain in the fever
swamps of Africa meant death to Livingstone.The poor, and the freedom
of the slave, were the common cause for which both these laid down
their lives.Of the same spirit was this daughter of our race.Had she
remained at home on her return from Serbia she might have been with us
to-day, but we should not have the woman we now know, and for whom we
give thanks on every remembrance of her.Miss Arbuthnot makes no allusion to
its dangers.Everything written by the ‘unit’ is instinct with the
high courage of their leader.We know now how great were the perils
surrounding the transports on the North seas.Old, and unseaworthy, the
menace below, the storm above, through the night of the Arctic Circle,
she was safely brought to the haven where all would be.More than once
death in open boats was a possibility to be faced; there were seven
feet of water in the engine-room, and only the stout hearts of her
captain and crew knew all the dangers of their long watch and ward.As the transport entered the Tyne a blizzard swept over the country.We who waited for news on shore wondered where on the cold grey seas
laboured the ship bringing home ‘Dr.Elsie and her unit.’

In her last hours she told her own people of the closing days on
board:--

 ‘When we left Orkney we had a dreadful passage, and even after we got
 into the river it was very rough.We were moored lower down, and,
 owing to the high wind and storm, a big liner suddenly bore down upon
 us, and came within a foot of cutting us in two, when our moorings
 broke, we swung round, and were saved.I said to the one who told
 me--“Who cut our moorings?” She answered, “No one cut them, they
 broke.”’

There was a pause, and then to her own she broke the knowledge that she
had heard the call and was about to obey the summons.‘The same hand who cut our moorings then is cutting mine now, and I am
 going forth.’

Her niece Evelyn Simson notes how they heard of the arrival:--

 ‘A wire came on Friday from Aunt Elsie, saying they had arrived in
 Newcastle.We tried all Saturday to get news by wire and ’phone,
 but got none.We think now this was because the first news came by
 wireless, and they did not land till Sunday.‘Aunt Elsie answered our prepaid wire, simply saying, “I am in bed, do
 not telephone for a few days.” I was free to start off by the night
 train, and arrived about 2 A.M.were
 at the Station Hotel, and I saw Aunt Elsie’s name in the book.I did
 not like to disturb her at that hour, and went to my room till 7.30.I
 found her alone; the night nurse was next door.She was surprised to
 see me, as she thought it would be noon before any one could arrive.She looked terribly wasted, but she gave me such a strong embrace that
 I never thought the illness was more than what might easily be cured
 on land, with suitable diet.‘I felt her pulse, and she said.“It is not very good, Eve dear, I
 know, for I have a pulse that beats in my head, and I know it has been
 dropping beats all night.” She wanted to know all about every one, and
 we had a long talk before any one came in.Ward had been to her, always, and we arranged that Dr.Aunt Elsie then packed me off to get some breakfast, and
 Dr.Ward told me she was much worse than she had been the night before.‘I telephoned to Edinburgh saying she was “very ill.” When Dr.Williams came, I learnt that there was practically no hope of her
 living.They started injections and oxygen, and Aunt Elsie said, “Now
 don’t think we didn’t think of all these things before, but on board
 ship nothing was possible.”

 ‘It was not till Dr.Williams’ second visit that she asked me if the
 doctor thought “this was the end.” When she saw that it was so, she
 at once said, without pause or hesitation, “Eve, it will be grand
 starting a new job over there,”--then, with a smile, “although there
 are two or three jobs here I would like to have finished.” After this
 her whole mind seemed taken up with the sending of last messages to
 her committees, units, friends, and relations.It simply amazed me how
 she remembered every one down to her grand-nieces and nephews.When I
 knew mother and Aunt Eva were on their way, I told her, and she was
 overjoyed.Early in the morning she told me wonderful things about
 bringing back the Serbs.I found it very hard to follow, as it was an
 unknown story to me.I clearly remember she went one day to the Consul
 in Odessa, and said she must wire certain things.She was told she
 could only wire straight to the War Office--“and so I got into touch
 straight with the War Office.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren at one moment commented--“You have done magnificent
 work.” Back swiftly came her answer, “Not I, but my unit.”

 ‘Mrs.M‘Laren says: ‘Mrs.Simson and I arrived at Newcastle on Monday
 evening.It was a glorious experience to be with her those last two
 hours.She was emaciated almost beyond recognition, but all sense
 of her bodily weakness was lost in the grip one felt of the strong
 alert spirit, which dominated every one in the room.She was clear
 in her mind, and most loving to the end.The words she greeted us
 with were--“So, I am going over to the other side.” When she saw we
 could not believe it, she said, with a smile, “For a long time I
 _meant_ to live, but now I _know_ I am going.” She spoke naturally
 and expectantly of going over.Certainly she met the unknown with a
 cheer!As the minutes passed she seemed to be entering into some great
 experience, for she kept repeating, “This is wonderful--but this is
 wonderful.” Then, she would notice that some one of us was standing,
 and she would order us to sit down--another chair must be brought if
 there were not enough.To the end, she would revert to small details
 for our comfort.As flesh and heart failed, she seemed to be breasting
 some difficulty, and in her own strong way, without distress or fear,
 she asked for help, “You must all of you help me through this.” We
 repeated to her many words of comfort.Again and again she answered
 back, “I know.” One, standing at the foot of the bed, said to her,
 “You will give my love to father”; instantly the humorous smile lit
 her face, and she answered, “Of course I will.”

 ‘At her own request her sister read to her words of the life
 beyond--“Let not your heart be troubled--In my Father’s house are many
 mansions; if it were not so I would have told you,” and, even as they
 watched her, she fell on sleep.‘After she had left us, there remained with those that loved her only
 a great sense of triumph and perfect peace.The room seemed full of a
 glorious presence.One of us said, “This is not death; it makes one
 wish to follow after.”’

As ‘We’ waited those anxious weeks for the news of the arrival of Dr.Inglis and her Army, there were questionings, how we should welcome
and show her all love and service.The news quickly spread she was not
well--might be delayed in reaching London; the manner of greeting her
must be to ensure rest.The storm had spent itself, and the moon was riding high in a cloudless
heaven, when others waiting in Edinburgh on the 26th learnt the news
that she too had passed through the storm and shadows, and had crossed
the bar.That her work here was to end with her life had not entered the minds
of those who watched for her return, overjoyed to think of seeing her
face once more.She had concealed her mortal weakness so completely,
that even to her own the first note of warning had come with the words
that she had landed, but was in bed:--‘then we thought it was time one
of us should go to her.’

Her people brought her back to the city of her fathers, and to the
hearts who had sent her forth, and carried her on the wings of their
strong confidence.There was to be no more going forth of her active
feet in the service of man, and all that was mortal was carried for
the last time into the church she had loved so well.Then we knew and
understood that she had been called where His servants shall serve Him.The Madonna lilies, the lilies of France and of the fields, were placed
around her.Over her hung the torn banners of Scotland’s history.The
Scottish women had wrapped their country’s flag around them in one of
their hard-pressed flights.On her coffin, as she lay looking to the
East in high St.Giles’, were placed the flags of Great Britain and
Serbia.She had worn ‘the faded ribbons’ of the orders bestowed on her by
France, Russia, and Serbia.It has often been asked at home and abroad
why she had received no decorations at the hands of her Sovereign.It
is not an easy question to answer.Inglis was buried, amid marks of respect
and recognition which make that passing stand alone in the history of
the last rites of any of her fellow-citizens.Great was the company
gathered within the church.The chancel was filled by her family and
relatives--her Suffrage colleagues, representatives from all the
societies, the officials of the hospitals and hostels she had founded
at home, the units whom she had led and by whose aid she had done great
things abroad.Last and first of all true-hearted mourners the people
of Serbia represented by their Minister and members of the Legation.The chief of the Scottish Command was present, and by his orders
military honours were paid to this happy warrior of the Red Cross.The service had for its keynote the Hallelujah Chorus, which was played
as the procession left St.It was a thanksgiving instinct with
triumph and hope.The Resurrection and the Life was in prayer and
praise.The Dean of the Order of the Thistle revealed the thoughts of
many hearts in his farewell words:--

 ‘We are assembled this day with sad but proud and grateful hearts to
 remember before God a very dear and noble lady, our beloved sister,
 Elsie Inglis, who has been called to her rest.We mourn only for
 ourselves, not for her.She has died as she lived, in the clear light
 of faith and self-forgetfulness, and now her name is linked for ever
 with the great souls who have led the van of womanly service for God
 and man.A wondrous union of strength and tenderness, of courage
 and sweetness, she remains for us a bright and noble memory of high
 devotion and stainless honour.Especially to-day, in the presence of
 representatives of the land for which she died, we think of her as an
 immortal link between Serbia and Scotland, and as a symbol of that
 high courage which will sustain us, please God, till that stricken
 land is once again restored, and till the tragedy of war is eradicated
 and crowned with God’s great gifts of peace and of righteousness.’

The buglers of the Royal Scots sounded ‘the Reveille to the waking
morn,’ and the coffin with the Allied flags was placed on the gun
carriage.Women were in the majority of the massed crowd that awaited
the last passing.‘Why did they no gie her the V.C.?’ asked the
shawl-draped women holding the bairns of her care: these and many
another of her fellow-citizens lined the route and followed on foot
the long road across the city.As the procession was being formed,
Dr.Inglis’ last message was put into the hands of the members of the
London Committee for S.W.H.It ran:--

      ‘_November 26, 1917._

 ‘So sorry I cannot come to London.Will send Gwynn in a day or two with
 explanations and suggestions.Colonel Miliantinovitch and Colonel
 Tcholah Antitch were to make appointment this week or next from
 Winchester; do see them, and also as many of the committee as possible
 and show them every hospitality.They have been very kind to us, and
 whatever happens, dear Miss Palliser, do beg the Committee to make
 sure that they (the Serbs) have their hospitals and transport, for
 they do need them.‘Many thanks to the Committee for their kindness to me and their
 support of me.‘Dictated to Miss Evelyn Simson.’

How the people loved her!was the thought, as she passed through the
grief-stricken crowds.These, who knew her best, smiled as they said
one to another, ‘How all this would surprise her!’

Edinburgh is a city of spires and of God’s acres, the graves cut in
the living rock, within gardens and beside running waters.Across the
Water of Leith the long procession wound its way.Within sight of the
grave, it was granted to her grateful brethren, the representatives
of the Serbian nation, to carry her coffin, and lower it to the place
where the mortal in her was to lie in its last rest.Her life’s story
was grouped around her--the Serbian officers, the military of her own
nation at war, the women comrades of the common cause, the poor and
suffering--to one and all she had been the inspiring succourer.November mists had drifted all day across the city, veiling the
fortress strength of Scotland, and the wild wastes of seas over which
she had returned home to our island strength.Even as we turned and
left her, the grey clouds at eventide were transfused and glorified by
the crimson glow of the sunset on the hills of Time.Printed in Great Britain by T. and A. CONSTABLE, Printers to His

Transcriber’s note:

Illustrations have been moved to be near the text they illustrate.A very few changes have been made to punctuation for consistency.On page 210 “C’état” has been changed to “C’était” in “C’était
magnifique, magnifique!Ils sont les héros”.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y.I did doze once, and then I had a frightful dream.I dreamt that Dandy
had sold himself to a circus, and that they were hooting him because
he had lost his tail.Don't, don't--be a man, George, be a man![_Shutting her umbrella._] I know I'm dreadfully effeminate.Ah, Tris--don't think me soft, old man.I'm a lonely, unlucky woman,
and the tail end of this horse is all that's left me in the world to
love and to cling to!I'm not such a mean cur as that!Swop halves and take his
head, George, my boy.I'm like a doating mother to my share of Dandy, and it's all
the dearer because it's an invalid.[_Turning towards the window, she following him, he
suddenly stops and looks at her, and seizes her hand._] George, I
never guessed that you were so tender-hearted.And you've robbed me to-night of an old friend--a pal.I mean that I seem to have dropped the acquaintance of George Tidd,
Esquire, forever.I have--but I've got an introduction to his twin-sister, Georgiana![_Snatching her hand away angrily._] Stay where you are; I'll nurse my
half alone.[_She goes towards the window, then starts back._] Hush![_Pointing to the window._] There.[_Peeping through the curtains._] You're right.[_SIR TRISTRAM takes the candlestick and they go out leaving the room
in darkness.The curtains at the window are pushed aside, and SALOME
and SHEBA enter; both in their fancy dresses._

SALOME.[_In a rage, lighting the candles on the mantelpiece._] Oh!If we only had a brother to avenge us!I shall try and borrow a brother to-morrow!Cold, wretched, splashed, in debt--for nothing!To think that we've had all the inconvenience of being wicked and
rebellious and have only half done it!It serves us right--we've been trained for clergymen's wives.Gerald Tarver's nose is inclined to pink--may it deepen and deepen
till it frightens cows![_Voices are heard from the curtained window recess._

DARBEY.[_Outside._] Miss Jedd--Sheba![_Outside._] Pray hear two wretched men![_In a whisper._] There they are.Shall we grant them a dignified interview?You curl your lip better than I--I'll dilate my nostrils.They are
both very badly and shabbily dressed as Cavaliers._

TARVER.[_A most miserable object, carrying a carriage umbrella._] Oh, don't
reproach us, Miss Jedd.It isn't our fault that the Military were
summoned to St.You don't blame officers and gentlemen for responding to the sacred
call of duty?We blame officers for subjecting two motherless girls to the shock of
alighting at the Durnstone Athenaeum to find a notice on the front
door: "Ball knocked on the head--Vivat Regina."We blame gentlemen for inflicting upon us the unspeakable agony of
being jeered at by boys.I took the address of the boy who suggested that we should call again
on the fifth of November.It is on the back of your admission card.We shall both wait on the boy's mother for an
explanation.Oh, smile on us once again, Miss Jedd--a forced, hollow smile, if you
will--only smile._GEORGIANA enters._

GEORGIANA.[_Weeping._] No, Aunt, no![_Advancing to TARVER._] How dare you encourage these two simple
children to enjoy themselves!How dare you take them out--without
their Aunt!Do you think _I_ can't keep a thing quiet?[_Shaking TARVER._] I'm speaking to you--Field-Marshal.We shall be happy to receive your representative in the morning.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan" Inn.You mustn't distract our
attention.Guarding the ruins of the "Swan," are you?[_SIR TRISTRAM appears._] Tris, I'm a feeble woman, but I
hope I've a keen sense of right and wrong.Run these outsiders into
the road, and let them guard their own ruins.[_SALOME and SHEBA shriek, and throw themselves at the feet of TARVER
and DARBEY.clinging to their legs._

SALOME.You shall not harm a hair of their heads.[_SIR TRISTRAM twists TARVER'S wig round so that it covers his face.The gate bell is heard ringing violently._

GEORGIANA, SALOME _and_ SHEBA.[_GEORGIANA runs to the door and opens it._

SALOME.[_To TARVER and DARBEY._] Fly![_TARVER and DARBEY disappear through the curtains at the window._

SHEBA.[_Falling into SALOME'S arms._] We have saved them!Oh, Tris, your man from the stable![_HATCHAM, carrying the basin with the bolus, runs in
breathlessly--followed by BLORE._

HATCHAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.The villain that set fire to the "Swan," sir--in the hact of
administering a dose to the 'orse!Topping the constable's collared him, Sir--he's taken him in a cart to
the lock-up!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_In agony._] They've got the Dean!The first scene is the interior of a country Police Station, a quaint
old room with plaster walls, oaken beams, and a gothic mullioned
window looking on to the street.A massive door, with a small sliding
wicket and an iron grating, opens to a prisoner's cell.The room is
partly furnished as a kitchen, partly as a police station, a copy of
the Police Regulations and other official documents and implements
hanging on the wall.It is the morning after the events of the
previous act._HANNAH, a buxom, fresh-looking young woman, in a print gown, has been
engaged in cooking while singing gayly._

HANNAH.[_Opening a door and calling with a slight dialect._] Noah darling![_From another room--in a rough, country voice._] Yaas!You'll have your dinner before you drive your prisoner over to
Durnstone, won't ye, darling?[_Closing the door._] Yaas!Noah's in a nice temper to-day over
summat.Ah well, I suppose all public characters is liable to
irritation.[_There is a knock at the outer door.HANNAH opening it,
sees BLORE with a troubled look on his face._] Well I never![_Entering and shaking hands mournfully._] How do you do, Mrs.And how is the dear Dean, bless him; the sweetest soul in the world?[_To HANNAH._] I--I 'aven't seen him this morning!Well, this is real kind of you, calling on an old friend, Edward.When
I think that I were cook at the Deanery seven years, and that since I
left you, to get wedded, not a soul of you has been nigh me, it do
seem hard.Well, you see, 'Annah, the kitchen took humbrage at your marryin' a
policeman at Durnstone.Topping's got the appointment of Head Constable at St.Marvells, what's that regarded as?A rise on the scales, 'Annah, a decided rise--but still you've honly
been a week in St.Marvells and you've got to fight your way hup.I think I'm as hup as ever I'm like to be.'Owever, Jane and Sarah and Willis the stable boy 'ave hunbent so far
as to hask me to leave their cards, knowin' I was a callin'.[_He produces from an old leather pocket-book three very dirty pieces
of paste-board, which he gives to HANNAH._

HANNAH.[_Taking them in her apron with pride._] Thank 'em kindly.We receive on Toosdays, at the side gate.[_Kissing her cheek._

HANNAH.When you was Miss Hevans there wasn't these social barriers,
'Annah!Noah's jealous of the very apron-strings what go round my
waist.I'm not so free and 'andy with my kisses now, I can tell you.Topping isn't indoors
now, surely![_Nodding her head._] Um--um!Why, he took a man up last night!Why, I thought that when hany harrest was made in St.Marvells, the
prisoner was lodged here honly for the night and that the 'ead
Constable 'ad to drive 'im over to Durnstone Police Station the first
thing in the morning.That's the rule, but Noah's behindhand to-day, and ain't going into
Durnstone till after dinner.And where is the hapartment in question?The "Strong-box" they call it in St.[_Whimpering to himself._] And 'im
accustomed to his shavin' water at h'eight and my kindly hand to
button his gaiters.'Annah, 'Annah, my dear, it's this very prisoner what I 'ave called on
you respectin'.Oh, then the honor ain't a compliment to me, after all, Mr.I'm killing two birds with one stone, my dear.[_Throwing the cards into BLORE'S hat._] You can take them back to the
Deanery with Mrs.[_Shaking the cards out of his hat and replacing them in his
pocket-book._] I will leave them hon you again to-morrow, 'Annah.But,
'Annah deary, do you know that this hunfortunate man was took in our
stables last night.No, I never ask Noah nothing about Queen's business.He don't want
_two_ women over him!Then you 'aven't seen the miserable culprit?I was in bed hours when Noah brought 'im 'ome.They tell us it's only a wretched poacher or a
petty larcery we'll get in St.My poor Noah ain't never
likely to have the chance of a horrid murder in a place what returns a
Conservative.[_Kneeling to look into the oven._

BLORE.But, 'Annah, suppose this case you've got 'old of now is a case
what'll shake old England to its basis!Suppose it means columns in
the paper with Topping's name a-figurin'!Suppose as family readin',
it 'old its own with divorce cases!You know something about this arrest, you do!I merely wish to encourage
you, 'Annah; to implant an 'ope that crime may brighten your wedded
life.[_Sitting at the table and referring to an official book._] The man
was found trespassing in the Deanery Stables with intent--refuses to
give his name or any account of 'isself.[_To himself._] If I could honly find hout whether Dandy Dick had any
of the medicine it would so guide me at the Races.It
doesn't appear that the 'orse in the stables--took it, does it?[_Looking up sharply._] Took what?You're sure there's no confession of any sort, 'Annah
dear?[_As he is bending over HANNAH, NOAH TOPPING appears.NOAH is a
dense-looking ugly countryman, with red hair, a bristling heard, and a
vindictive leer.He is dressed in ill-fitting clothes, as a rural
Police Constable._

NOAH.[_Fiercely._] 'Annah![_Starting and replacing the book._] Oh don't!Blore from
the Deanery come to see us--an old friend o' mine![_BLORE advances to NOAH with a nervous smile, extending his hand._

NOAH.[_Taking BLORE'S hand and holding it firmly._] A friend of hern is a
friend o' mian!She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week, since we coom to
St.Of course, dear 'Annah was a lovin' favorite with heverybody.Well then, as her friends be mian, I'm takin' the liberty, one by
one, of gradually droppin' on 'em all.[_Getting his hand away._] Dear me!And if I catch any old fly a buzzin' round my lady I'll venture to
break his 'ead in wi' my staff![_Preparing to depart._] I--I merely called to know if hanything had
been found hout about the ruffian took in our stables last night!He's the De-an, ain't he?[_Fiercely._] Shut oop, darlin'.Topping's
respects to the Dean, and say I'll run up to the Deanery and see him
after I've took my man over to Durnstone.Thank you--I 'ope the Dean will be at 'ome.[_Offering his hand, into which NOAH significantly places his
truncheon.BLORE goes out quickly._

HANNAH.[_Whimpering._] Oh, Noah, Noah, I don't believe as we shall ever get a
large circle of friends round us![_Selecting a pair of handcuffs and examining them
critically._] Them'll do.[_Slipping them into his pocket, and turning
upon HANNAH suddenly._] 'Annah!Yes, Noahry----

NOAH.Brighten oop, my darlin', the little time you 'ave me at 'ome with
you.[_She bustles about and begins to lay the cloth._

NOAH.I'm just a' goin' round to the stable to put old Nick in the cart.Oh, dont'ee trust to Nick, Noah dear--he's such a vicious brute.Nick can take me on to the edge o' the hill in half
the time.Ah, what d'ye think I've put off taking my man to Durnstone to now
for?Why, I'm a goin' to get a glimpse of the racin', on my way over.[_Opening the wicket in the cell door and looking in._] There he is![_To HANNAH._] Hopen the hoven door, 'Annah, and let the smell
of the cookin' get into him.Oh, no, Noah--it's torture![_She opens the oven door._] Torture!Whenever I get a 'old of a darned obstinate
creature wot won't reveal his hindentity I hopens the hoven door.[_He goes out into the street, and as he departs, the woful face of
THE DEAN appears at the wicket, his head being still enveloped in the
fur cap._

HANNAH.[_Shutting the oven door._] Not me!Torturing prisoners might a' done
for them Middling Ages what Noah's always clattering about, but not
for my time o' life.[_Crossing close to the
wicket, her face almost comes against THE DEAN'S.She gives a cry._]
The Dean![_He disappears._

HANNAH.[_Tottering to the wicket
and looking in._] Master!It's 'Annah, your poor faithful
servant, 'Annah![_The face of THE DEAN re-appears._

THE DEAN.[_In a deep sad voice._] Hannah Evans.It's 'Annah Topping, Knee Evans, wife o' the Constable what's goin' to
take you to cruel Durnstone.[_Sinking weeping upon the ground at the
door._] Oh, Mr.Dean, sir, what have you been up to?Woman, I am the victim of a misfortune only partially merited.[_On her knees, clasping her hands._] Tell me what you've done, Master
dear; give it a name, for the love of goodness

THE DEAN.My poor Hannah, I fear I have placed myself in an equivocal position.[_With a shriek of despair._] Ah!Is it a change o' cooking that's brought you to such ways?I cooked
for you for seven 'appy years!you seem to have lost none of your culinary skill.[_With clenched hands and a determined look._] Oh![_Quickly locking
and bolting the street door._] Noah can't put that brute of a horse to
under ten minutes.The dupplikit key o' the Strong Box![_Producing a
large key, with which she unlocks the cell door._] Master, you'll give
me your patrol not to cut, won't you?Under any other circumstances, Hannah, I should resent that
insinuation.[_Pulling the door which opens sufficiently to let out THE DEAN._

THE DEAN.[_As he enters the room._] Good day, Hannah; you have bettered
yourself, I hope?[_Hysterically flinging herself upon THE DEAN._] Oh, Master, Master![_Putting her from him sternly._] Hannah!Oh, I know, I know, but crime levels all, dear sir!You appear to misapprehend the precise degree of criminality which
attaches to me, Mrs.In the eyes of that majestic, but
imperfect instrument, the law, I am an innocent if not an injured man.Stick to it, if you think it's likely to serve
your wicked ends![_Placing bread with other things on the table._

THE DEAN.My good woman, a single word from me to those at the Deanery, would
instantly restore me to home, family, and accustomed diet.Ah, they all tell that tale what comes here.Why don't you send word,
Dean dear?Because it would involve revelations of my temporary moral aberration![_Putting her apron to her eyes with a howl._] Owh!Because I should return to the Deanery with my dignity--that priceless
possession of man's middle age!--with my dignity seriously impaired!Oh, don't, sir, don't!How could I face my simple children who have hitherto, not
unreasonably, regarded me as faultless?How could I again walk erect
in the streets of St.Marvells with my name blazoned on the Records of
a Police Station of the very humblest description?[_Sinking into a chair and snatching up a piece of breads which he
begins munching._

HANNAH.[_Wiping her eyes._] Oh, sir, it's a treat to hear you, compared with
the hordinary criminal class.But, master, dear, though my Noah don't
recognize you--through his being a stranger to St.Marvells--how'll
you fare when you get to Durnstone?I have one great buoyant hope--that a word in the ear of the Durnstone
Superintendent will send me forth an unquestioned man.You and he will
be the sole keepers of my precious secret.May its possession be a
lasting comfort to you both.Master, is what you've told me your only chance of getting off
unknown?It is the sole remaining chance of averting a calamity of almost
national importance.Then you're as done as that joint in my oven!The Superintendent at Durnstone--John Ruggles--also the two
Inspectors, Whitaker and Parker----

THE DEAN.Them and their wives and families are chapel folk![_THE DEAN totters across to a chair, into which he sinks with
his head upon the table._] Master!I was well fed and kept seven years at the
Deanery--I've been wed to Noah Topping eight weeks--that's six years
and ten months' lovin' duty doo to you and yours before I owe nothing
to my darling Noah.Master dear, you shan't be took to Durnstone!Hannah Topping, formerly Evans, it is my duty to inform you
that your reasoning does more credit to your heart than to your head.The Devil's always in a woman's heart because it's
the warmest place to get to![_Taking a small key from the table
drawer._] Here, take that![_Pushing the key into the pocket of his
coat._] When you once get free from my darling Noah that key unlocks
your handcuffs!How are you to get free, that's the question now, isn't it?My Noah drives you over to Durnstone with old Nick in the cart.Now Nick was formerly in the Durnstone Fire Brigade,
and when he 'ears the familiar signal of a double whistle you can't
hold him in.[_Putting it into THE DEAN'S
pocket._] Directly you turn into Pear Tree Lane, blow once and you'll
see Noah with his nose in the air, pullin' fit to wrench his 'ands
off.Jump out--roll clear of the wheel--keep cool and 'opeful and blow
again.Before you can get the mud out of your eyes Noah and the horse
and cart will be well into Durnstone, and may Providence restore a
young 'usband safe to his doatin' wife![_Recoiling horror-stricken._

HANNAH.[_Crying._] Oh--ooh--ooh!Is this the fruit of your seven years' constant cookery at the
Deanery?I wouldn't have done it, only this is your first offence!You're not too old; I want to give you another start in life!Woman, do you think I've no conscience?Do you think I
don't realize the enormity of the--of the difficulties in alighting
from a vehicle in rapid motion?[_Opening the oven and taking out a small joint in a baking tin, which
she places on the table._] It's 'unger what makes you feel
conscientious![_Waving her away._] I have done with you!With me, sir--but not with the joint!You'll feel wickeder when you've
had a little nourishment.[_He looks hungrily at the dish._] That's
right, Dean, dear--taste my darling Noah's favorite dish.[_Advancing towards the table._] Oh, Hannah Topping--Hannah Topping![_Clutching the carving-knife despairingly._] I'll have no more women
cooks at the Deanery![_Sitting and carving with desperation._

HANNAH.You can't blow that whistle on an empty
frame.[_THE DEAN begins to eat._] Don't my cooking carry you back,
sir?Ah, if every mouthful would carry me back one little hour I would
finish this joint![_NOAH TOPPING, unperceived by HANNAH and THE DEAN, climbs in by the
window, his eyes bolting with rage--he glares round the room, taking
in everything at a glance._

NOAH.[_Under his breath._] My man o' mystery--a waited on by my nooly made
wife--a heating o' my favorite meal.[_Touching HANNAH on the arm, she turns and faces him, speechless with
fright._

THE DEAN.[_Still eating._] If my mind were calmer this would be an
all-sufficient repast.[_HANNAH tries to speak, then clasps her hands
and sinks on her knees to NOAH._] Hannah, a little plain cold water in
a simple tumbler, please.[_Grimly--folding his arms._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_HANNAH gives a
cry and clings to NOAH'S legs._

THE DEAN.[_Calmly to NOAH._] Am I to gather, constable, from your respective
attitudes that you object to these little kindnesses extended to me by
your worthy wife?I'm wishin' to know the name o' my worthy wife's friend.A friend o'
hern is a friend o' mian.She's gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends since we coom to St.I made this gentleman's acquaintance through the wicket, in a
casual way.Cooks and railins--cooks and railins!I might a guessed my wedded
life 'ud a coom to this.He spoke to me just as a strange gentleman ought to speak to a lady!Didn't you, sir--didn't you?Hannah, do not let us even under these circumstances prevaricate; such
is not quite the case![_NOAH advances savagely to THE DEAN.There is a knocking at the
door.--NOAH restrains himself and faces THE DEAN._

NOAH.Noa, this is neither the toime nor pla-ace, wi' people at the door and
dinner on t' table, to spill a strange man's blood.I trust that your self-respect as an officer of the law will avert
anything so unseemly.You've touched me on my point o' pride.There ain't
another police-station in all Durnstone conducted more strict and
rigid nor what mian is, and it shall so continue.You and me is a
goin' to set out for Durnstone, and when the charges now standin' agen
you is entered, it's I, Noah Topping, what'll hadd another![_There is another knock at the door._

HANNAH.The charge of allynating the affections o' my wife, 'Annah!Ay, and worse--the embezzlin' o' my mid-day meal prepared by her
'ands.[_Points into the cell._] Go in; you 'ave five minutes more in
the 'ome you 'ave ruined and laid waste.[_Going to the door and turning to NOAH._] You will at least receive
my earnest assurance that this worthy woman is extremely innocent?[_Points to the joint on the table._] Look theer![_THE
DEAN, much overcome, disappears through the cell door, which NOAH
closes and locks.To HANNAH,
pointing to the outer door._] Hunlock that door![_Weeping._] Oh, Noahry, you'll never be popular in St.[_HANNAH unlocks the door, and admits GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM, both
dressed for the race-course._

GEORGIANA.Sandra went back to the garden.Take a chair, lady, near the fire.[_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Sit
down, sir.This is my first visit to a police-station, my good woman; I hope it
will be the last.Oh, don't say that, ma'am.We're honly hauxilliary 'ere, ma'am--the
Bench sets at Durnstone.I must say you try to make everybody feel at home.[_HANNAH curtseys._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HANNAH._] Perhaps this is only a police-station for the young?No, ma'am, we take ladies and gentlemen like yourselves.[_Who has not been noticed, surveying GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM,
gloomily._] 'Annah, hintrodooce me.[_Facing NOAH._] Good gracious!'Annah's a gettin' me a lot o' nice noo friends this week since we
coom to St.Noah, Noah--the lady and gentlemen is strange.Ay; are you seeing me on business or pleasure?Do you imagine people come here to see you?Noa--they generally coom to see my wife.'Owever, if it's business
[_pointing to the other side of the room_] that's the hofficial
side--this is domestic.SIR TRISTRAM _and_ GEORGIANA.[_Changing their seats._

SIR TRISTRAM.Tidman is the
sister of Dr.She's profligate--proceedins are pendin'![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] Strange police station![_To NOAH._] Well, my good man, to come to the point.My poor friend
and this lady's brother, Dr.Jedd, the Dean, you know--has
mysteriously and unaccountably disappeared.Now, look 'ere--it's no good a gettin' 'asty and irritable with the
law.I'll coom over to yer, officially.[_Putting the baking tin under his arm he crosses over to SIR TRISTRAM
and GEORGIANA._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Putting his handkerchief to his face._] Don't bring that horrible
odor of cooking over here.It's evidence against my profligate wife.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA exchange looks of impatience._

GEORGIANA.Do you realize that my poor brother the Dean is missing?Touching this missin' De-an.I left him last night to retire to rest.'As it struck you to look in 'is bed?GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.It's only confusin'--hall doin' it![_GEORGIANA puts her handkerchief to her eyes._

SIR TRISTRAM.This is his sister--I am his
friend!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.A the'ry that will put you all out o' suspense!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I've been a good bit about, I read a deal, and I'm a shrewd
experienced man.I should say this is nothin' but a hordinary case of
sooicide.[_GEORGIANA sits faintly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_Savagely to NOAH._] Get out of the way!Oh, Tris, if this were true how could we break it to the girls?I could run oop, durin' the evenin', and break it to the girls.[_Turns upon NOAH._] Look here, all you've got to do is to hold your
tongue and take down my description of the Dean, and report his
disappearance at Durnstone.[_Pushing him into a chair._] Go on!The Very Reverend Augustin Jedd, Dean of St.[_Softly to GEORGIANA._] Lady, lady.[_NOAH prepares to write, depositing the baking-tin on the table._

GEORGIANA.[_Speaks to GEORGIANA excitedly._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To NOAH._] Have you got that?[_Writing laboriously with his legs curled round the chair and his
head on the table._] Ay.I suppose he was jest the hordinary sort o' lookin' man.[_Turning from HANNAH, excitedly._] Description--a little, short, thin
man, with black hair and a squint![_To GEORGIANA._] No, no, he isn't.I'm Gus's sister--I ought to know what he's like!Good heavens, Georgiana--your mind is not going?[_Clutching SIR TRISTRAM'S arm and whispering in his ear, as she
points to the cell door._] He's in there!Gus is the villain found dosing Dandy Dick last night![_HANNAH seizes SIR TRISTRAM and talks to him
rapidly._] [_To NOAH._] What have you written?I've written "Hanswers to the name o' Gus!"[_Snatching the paper from him._] It's not wanted.I'm too busy to bother about him this week.Look here--you're the constable who took the man in the Deanery
Stables last night?[_Looking out of the window._] There's my cart outside ready to
take the scoundrel over to Durnstone.[_He tucks the baking-tin under his arm and goes up to the cell door._

GEORGIANA.[_To herself._] Oh, Gus, Gus![_Unlocking the door._] I warn yer.[_NOAH goes into the cell, closing the door after him._

Tris!What was my brother's motive in bolusing Dandy last night?The first thing to do is to get him out of this hole.But we can't trust to Gus rolling out of a flying dogcart!Why, it's
as much as I could do!Oh, yes, lady, he'll do it.There's another--a awfuller charge hangin' over his
reverend 'ead.To think my own stock should run vicious like this.[_NOAH comes out of the cell with THE DEAN, who is in handcuffs._

GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_Raising his eyes, sees SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA, and recoils with
a groan, sinking on to a chair._] Oh!I am the owner of the horse stabled at the Deanery.I
make no charge against this wretched person.[_To THE DEAN._] Oh man,
man!I was discovered administering to a suffering beast a simple remedy
for chills.The analysis hasn't come home from the chemist's yet.[_To NOAH._] Release this man.He was found trespassin' in the stables of the la-ate
De-an, who has committed sooicide.I----

SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.The Diseased De-an is the honly man wot can withdraw one charge----

THE DEAN.SIR TRISTRAM, GEORGIANA _and_ HANNAH.And I'm the honly man wot can withdraw the other.I charge this person unknown with allynating the affections o' my wife
while I was puttin' my 'orse to.And I'm goin' to drive him over to
Durnstone with the hevidence.Oh lady, lady, it's appearances what is against us.[_Through the opening of the door._] Woa![_Whispering to THE DEAN._] I am disappointed in you, Angustin.Have
you got this wretched woman's whistle?[_Softly to THE DEAN._] Oh Jedd, Jedd--and these are what you call
Principles![_Appearing in the doorway._] Time's oop.May I say a few parting words in the home I have apparently wrecked?In setting out upon a journey, the termination of which is
problematical, I desire to attest that this erring constable is the
husband of a wife from whom it is impossible to withhold respect, if
not admiration.As for my wretched self, the confession of my weaknesses must be
reserved for another time--another place.[_To GEORGIANA._] To you,
whose privilege it is to shelter in the sanctity of the Deanery, I
give this earnest admonition.Within an hour from this terrible
moment, let the fire be lighted in the drawing-room--let the missing
man's warm bath be waiting for its master--a change of linen prepared.[_NOAH takes him by the arm and leads him out._

GEORGIANA.Oh, what am I to think of my brother?[_Kneeling at GEORGIANA'S feet._] Think!That he's the beautifullest,
sweetest man in all Durnshire!It's I and my whistle and Nick the fire-brigade horse what'll bring
him back to the Deanery safe and unharmed.Not a soul but we three'll
ever know of his misfortune.[_Rushing to the door and looking out._] He's done
for!GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.Noah's put Kitty in the cart, and
left Old Nick at home!_The second scene is the Morning Room at the Deanery again._

_SALOME and SHEBA are sitting there gloomily._

SALOME.In the meantime it is such a comfort to feel that we have no
cause for self-reproach.[_Clinging to SALOME._] If I should pine and ultimately die of this
suspense I want you to have my workbox.[_Shaking her head and sadly turning away._] Thank you, dear, but if
Papa is not home for afternoon tea you will outlive me.[_Turning towards the window as MAJOR TARVER and MR.DARBEY appear
outside._

DARBEY.[_SALOME unfastens the window._

DARBEY.Don't be shocked when you see Tarver._TARVER and DARBEY enter, dressed for the Races, but DARBEY is
supporting TARVER, who looks extremely weakly._

TARVER.You do well, gentlemen, to intrude upon two feeble women at a moment
of sorrow.One step further, and I shall ask Major Tarver, who is nearest the
bell, to ring for help.[_TARVER sinks into a chair._

DARBEY.[_Standing by the side of TARVER._] There now.Miss Jedd,
that Tarver is in an exceedingly critical condition.Feeling that he
has incurred your displeasure he has failed even in the struggle to
gain the race-course.Middleton and I
explained that Major Tarver loved with a passion [_looking at SHEBA_]
second only to my own.[_Sitting comfortably on the settee._] Oh, we cannot listen to you,
Mr.[_The two girls exchange looks._

DARBEY.The Doctor made a searching examination of the Major's tongue and
diagnosed that, unless the Major at once proposed to the lady in
question and was accepted, three weeks or a month at the seaside would
be absolutely imperative.We are curious to see to what lengths you will go.The pitiable condition of my poor friend speaks for itself.I beg your pardon--it does nothing of the kind.[_Rising with difficulty and approaching SALOME._] Salome--I have
loved you distractedly for upwards of eight weeks.[_Going to him._] Oh, Major Tarver, let me pass; [_holding his coat
firmly_] let me pass, I say.[_DARBEY follows SHEBA across the room._

TARVER.To a man in my condition love is either a rapid and fatal malady, or
it is an admirable digestive.Accept me, and my merry laugh once more
rings through the Mess Room.Reject me, and my collection of vocal
music, loose and in volumes, will be brought to the hammer, and the
bird, as it were, will trill no more.And is it really I who would hush the little throaty songster?[_Taking a sheet of paper from his pocket._] I have the
Doctor's certificate to that effect.[_Both reading the certificate they walk into Library._

SHEBA.Darbey, I have never thought of marriage seriously.People never do till they _are_ married.Pardon me, Sheba--but what is your age?Oh, it is so very little--it is not worth mentioning.Cannot we remain
friends and occasionally correspond?Well, of course--if you insist----

SHEBA.No, no, I see that is impracticable.All I ask
is time--time to ponder over such a question, time to know myself
better.[_They separate as TARVER and SALOME re-enter the room.TARVER is
glaring excitedly and biting his nails._

TARVER.I never thought I should live to be accepted by anyone.DARBEY _and_ TARVER.Oh, what do you think of it, Mr.Shocking, but we oughtn't to condemn him unheard.[_At the window._] Here's Aunt Georgiana![_Going out quickly._

SALOME.[_Pulling TARVER after her._] Come this way and let us take cuttings
in the conservatory.[_They go out._

SHEBA.Darbey, wait for me--I have decided._Yes._

[_She goes out by the door as GEORGIANA enters excitedly at the
window._

GEORGIANA.[_Waving her handkerchief._] Come on, Tris!_SIR TRISTRAM and HATCHAM enter by the window carrying THE DEAN.They
all look as though they have been recently engaged in a prolonged
struggle._

SIR TRISTRAM.That I will, ma'am, and gladly.[_They deposit THE DEAN in a chair and GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM each
seize a hand, feeling THE DEAN'S pulse, while HATCHAM puts his hand on
THE DEAN'S heart._

THE DEAN.[_Opening his eyes._] Where am I now?SIR TRISTRAM _and_ HATCHAM

[_Quietly._] Hurrah![_To HATCHAM._] We can't shout here; go and cheer
as loudly as you can in the roadway by yourself.[_HATCHAM runs out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_Gradually recovering._] Georgiana--Mardon.How are you, Jedd, old boy?I feel as if I had been walked over carefully by a large concourse of
the lower orders![_HATCHAM'S voice is heard in the distance cheering.They all listen._

SIR TRISTRAM.That's Hatcham; I'll raise his wages.Do I understand that I have been forcibly and illegally rescued?A woman who would have been a heroine in any age--Georgiana!Georgiana, I am bound to overlook it, in a relative, but never let
this occur again.You found out that that other woman's plan went lame, didn't you?I discovered its inefficacy, after a prolonged period of ineffectual
whistling.But we ascertained the road the genial constable was going to follow.He was bound for the edge of the hill, up Pear Tree Lane, to watch the
Races.Directly we knew this, Tris and I made for the Hill.Bless your
soul, there were hundreds of my old friends there--welshers,
pick-pockets, card-sharpers, all the lowest race-course cads in the
kingdom.In a minute I was in the middle of 'em, as much at home as a
Duchess in a Drawing-room.Instantly
there was a cry of "Blessed if it ain't George Tidd!"Tears of real
joy sprang to my eyes--while I was wiping them away Tris had his
pockets emptied and I lost my watch.Ah, Jedd, it was a glorious moment!Tris made a back, and I stood on it, supported by a correct-card
merchant on either side."Dear friends," I said; "Brothers!You should have heard the shouts of honest welcome.Before I could obtain silence my field glasses had gone on their long
journey."A very dear relative of mine has
been collared for playing the three-card trick on his way down from
town.""He'll be on the brow of the
Hill with a bobby in half-an-hour," said I, "who's for the rescue?"A
dead deep silence followed, broken only by the sweet voice of a young
child, saying, "What'll we get for it?""A pound a-piece," said I.
There was a roar of assent, and my concluding words, "and possibly six
months," were never heard.At that moment Tris' back could stand it no
longer, and we came heavily to the ground together.[_Seizing THE DEAN
by the hand and dragging him up._] Now you know whose hands have led
you back to your own manger.[_Embracing him._] And oh, brother,
confess--isn't there something good and noble in true English sport
after all?But whence
is the money to come to reward these dreadful persons?I cannot
reasonably ask my girls to organize a bazaar or concert.Well, I've cleared fifteen hundred over the Handicap.Then the horse who enjoyed the shelter of the
Deanery last night----

SIR TRISTRAM.All the rest nowhere, and Bonny Betsy walked in
with the policeman.[_To himself._] Five hundred pounds towards the Spire!Oh, where is Blore with the good news!Sir Tristram, I am under the impression that your horse swallowed
reluctantly a small portion of that bolus last night before I was
surprised and removed.By the bye, I am expecting the analysis of that concoction every
minute.Spare yourself the trouble--the secret is with me.I seek no
acknowledgment from either of you, but in your moment of deplorable
triumph remember with gratitude the little volume of "The Horse and
its Ailments" and the prosaic name of its humane author--John Cox.[_He goes out through the Library._

GEORGIANA.But oh, Tris Mardon, what can I ever say to you?Why, you were the man who hauled Augustin out of the
cart by his legs!And when his cap fell off, it was you--brave
fellow that you are--who pulled the horse's nose-bag over my brother's
head so that he shouldn't be recognized.My dear Georgiana, these are the common courtesies of every-day life.They are acts which any true woman would esteem.Gus won't readily
forget the critical moment when all the cut chaff ran down the back of
his neck--nor shall I.

SIR TRISTRAM.Nor shall I forget the way in which you gave Dandy his whisky out of a
soda water bottle just before the race.That's nothing--any lady would do the same.You looked like the Florence Nightingale of the paddock!Oh,
Georgiana, why, why, why won't you marry me?Because you've only just asked me, Tris![_Goes to him cordially._

SIR TRISTRAM.But when I touched your hand last night, you reared!Yes, Tris, old man, but love is founded on mutual esteem; last night
you hadn't put my brother's head in that nose-bag.[_They go together to the fireplace, he with his arm round her waist._

SHEBA.[_Looking in at the door._] How annoying!There's Aunt and Sir
Tristram in this room--Salome and Major Tarver are sitting on the hot
pipes in the conservatory--where am I and Mr.[_She withdraws quickly as THE DEAN enters through the Library
carrying a paper in his hand; he has now resumed his normal
appearance._

THE DEAN.Home, with the secret of my
sad misfortune buried in the bosoms of a faithful few.Home, with the sceptre of my dignity still
tight in my grasp!What is this I have picked up on the stairs?[_Reads with a horrified look, as HATCHAM enters at the window._

HATCHAM.The chemist has just brought the annal_i_sis.[_SIR TRISTRAM and GEORGIANA go out at the window, following HATCHAM._

THE DEAN.[_Reading._] "Debtor to Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to
the Queen, Bow Street--Total, Forty pounds, nineteen!"There was a
fancy masked ball at Durnstone last night!Salome--Sheba--no, no![_Bounding in and rushing at THE DEAN._] Papa, Papa![_SALOME seizes his hands, SHEBA his coat-tails, and turn him round
violently._

SALOME.Papa, why have you tortured us with anxiety?Before I answer a question, which, from a child to its parent,
partakes of the unpardonable vice of curiosity, I demand an
explanation of this disreputable document.[_Reading._] "Debtor to
Lewis Isaacs, Costumier to the Queen."[_SHEBA sits aghast on the table--SALOME distractedly falls on the
floor._

THE DEAN.I will not follow this legend in all its revolting intricacies.Suffice it, its moral is inculcated by the mournful total.[_Looking from one to the other._]
There was a ball at Durnstone last night.I trust I was better--that is, otherwise employed.[_Referring
to the bill._] Which of my hitherto trusted daughters was a lady--no,
I will say a person--of the period of the French Revolution?[_SHEBA points to SALOME._

THE DEAN.And a flower-girl of an unknown epoch.[_SALOME points to SHEBA._] To
your respective rooms![_The girls cling together._] Let your blinds
be drawn.At seven porridge will be brought to you.Papa, we, poor girls as we are, can pay the bill.Through the kindness of our Aunt----

SALOME.Is there no
conscience that is clear--is there no guilessness left in this house,
with the possible exception of my own![_Sobbing._] We always knew a little more than you gave us credit for,
Papa.[_Handing SHEBA the bill._] Take this horrid thing--never let it meet
my eyes again.As for the scandalous costumes, they shall be raffled
for in aid of local charities.Confidence, that precious pearl in the
snug shell of domesticity, is at an end between us.I chastise you
both by permanently withholding from you the reason of my absence from
home last night.[_The girls totter out as SIR TRISTRAM enters quickly at the window,
followed by GEORGIANA, carrying the basin containing the bolus.SIR
TRISTRAM has an opened letter in his hand._

SIR TRISTRAM.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.[_To GEORGIANA._] How dare you confront me without even the semblance
of a blush--you who have enabled my innocent babies, for the first
time in their lives, to discharge one of their own accounts.There isn't a blush in our family--if there were, you'd want it.[_SHEBA and SALOME appear outside the window, looking in._

SIR TRISTRAM.Jedd, you were once my friend, and you are to be my relative.[_Looking at GEORGIANA._] My sister![_To SIR TRISTRAM._] I offer no
opposition.But not even our approaching family tie prevents my designating you as
one of the most atrocious conspirators known in the history of the
Turf.As the owner of one-half of Dandy Dick, I denounce you!As the owner of the other half, _I_ denounce you!_SHEBA and SALOME enter, and remain standing in the recess,
listening._

SIR TRISTRAM.The chief ingredient of your infernal preparation is known.It contains nothing that I would not cheerfully administer to my own
children.[_Pointing to the paper._] Strychnine![_Clinging to each other terrified._] Oh!Summon my devoted servant Blore, in whose presence the
innocuous mixture was compounded.[_GEORGIANA rings the bell.The
girls hide behind the window curtains._] This analysis is simply the
pardonable result of over-enthusiasm on the part of our local chemist.You're a disgrace to the pretty little police station where you slept
last night![_BLORE enters and stands unnoticed._

THE DEAN.I will prove that in the Deanery Stables the common laws of
hospitality have never been transgressed.[_GEORGIANA hands THE DEAN the basin from the table._] A simple remedy
for a chill.GEORGIANA _and_ SIR TRISTRAM.I, myself, am suffering from the exposure of last night.[_Taking the
remaining bolus and opening his mouth._] Observe me![_Rushing forward, snatching the basin from THE DEAN and sinking on to
his knees._] No, no!You wouldn't 'ang the holdest
servant in the Deanery.I 'ad a honest fancy for Bonny Betsy, and I wanted this
gentleman's 'orse out of the way.And while you was mixing the dose
with the best ecclesiastical intentions, I hintroduced a foreign
element.[_Pulling BLORE up by his coat collar._] Viper!Oh sir, it was hall for the sake of the Dean.The dear Dean had only Fifty Pounds to spare for sporting purposes,
and I thought a gentleman of 'is 'igh standing ought to have a
certainty.I can conceal it no longer--I--I instructed this unworthy creature to
back Dandy Dick on behalf of the Restoration Fund.[_Shaking BLORE._] And didn't you do it?In the name of that tottering Spire, why not?Oh, sir, thinking as you'd given some of the mixture to Dandy I put
your cheerful little offering on to Bonny Betsy.[_SALOME and SHEBA disappear._

THE DEAN.[_To BLORE._] I could have pardoned everything but this last act
of disobedience.If I leave the Deanery, I shall give my reasons, and then what'll
folks think of you and me in our old age?Not if sober, sir--but suppose grief drove me to my cups?I must save you from intemperance at any cost.Remain in my service--a
sad, sober and, above all, a silent man![_SALOME and SHEBA appear as BLORE goes out through the window._

SALOME.Darbey!----

THE DEAN.If you have sufficiently merged all sense of moral rectitude as to
declare that I am not at home, do so.Papa; we have accidentally discovered that you, our parent,
have stooped to deception, if not to crime.We are still young--the sooner, therefore, we are removed from any
unfortunate influence the better.We have an opportunity of beginning life afresh.These two gallant gentlemen have proposed for us.[_He goes out rapidly, followed by SALOME and SHEBA.Directly they
have disappeared, NOAH TOPPING, looking dishevelled, rushes in at the
window, with HANNAH clinging to him._

NOAH.[_Glaring round the room._] Is this 'ere the Deanery?[_GEORGIANA and SIR TRISTRAM come to him._

HANNAH.Theer's been a man rescued from my lawful custody while my face was
unofficially held downwards in the mud.The villain has been traced
back to the Deanery.The man was a unknown lover of my nooly made wife!You mustn't bring your domestic affairs here; this is a subject for
your own fireside of an evening.[_THE DEAN appears outside the window with SALOME, SHEBA, TARVER and
DARBEY._

THE DEAN.[_Outside._] Come in, Major Tarver--come in, Mr._THE DEAN enters, followed by SALOME, TARVER, SHEBA and DARBEY._

NOAH.[_Confronting THE DEAN._] My man.I'm speaking to the man I took last night--the culprit as 'as
allynated the affections of my wife.[_Going out at the window._

[_SALOME and TARVER go into the Library and sit at the writing-table.DARBEY sits in an arm-chair with SHEBA on the arm._

THE DEAN.[_Mildly._] Do not let us chide a man who is conscientious even in
error.[_Looking at HANNAH._] I think I see Hannah Evans, once an
excellent cook under this very roof.Topping now, sir--bride o' the constable.And oh, do forgive
him--he's a mass o' ignorance.[_HANNAH returns to NOAH.as SIR TRISTRAM re-enters with HATCHAM._

SIR TRISTRAM.[_To HATCHAM._] Hatcham--[_pointing to THE DEAN_]--Is that the man you
and the Constable secured in the stable last night?Bless your 'art, sir, that's the Dean 'imself.[_To NOAH._] Why, our man was a short, thin individual![_HATCHAM goes out at the window._

THE DEAN.[_To NOAH._] I trust you are perfectly satisfied.[_Wiping his brow and looking puzzled._] I'm doon.I withdraw unreservedly any charge against this
unknown person found on my premises last night.I attribute to him the
most innocent intentions.Hannah, you and your worthy husband will
stay and dine in my kitchen.[_Turning angrily to HANNAH._] Now then, you don't know a real
gentleman when you see one.Why don't 'ee thank the Dean warmly?[_Kissing THE DEAN'S hands with a curtsey._] Thank you, sir.[_Benignly._] Go--go.[_They back out, bowing and curtseying._

GEORGIANA.Well, Gus, you're out of all your troubles.My family influence gone forever--my dignity crushed out of all
recognition--the genial summer of the Deanery frosted by the winter of
Deceit.Ah, Gus, when once you lay the whip about the withers of the horse
called Deception he takes the bit between his teeth, and only the
devil can stop him--and he'd rather not.Shall I tell you who has been
riding the horse hardest?[_SHEBA sits at the piano and plays a bright air softly--DARBEY
standing behind her--SALOME and TARVER stand in the archway._

GEORGIANA.[_Slapping THE DEAN on the back._] Look here, Augustin, George Tidd
will lend you that thousand for the poor, innocent old Spire.[_Taking her hand._] Oh, Georgiana!On one condition--that you'll admit there's no harm in our laughing at
a Sporting Dean.My brother Gus doesn't want us to be merry at his expense.[_They both laugh._

THE DEAN.[_Trying to silence them._] No, no!Why, Jedd, there's no harm in laughter, for those who laugh or those
who are laughed at.Provided always--firstly, that it is Folly that is laughed at and not
Virtue; secondly, that it is our friends who laugh at us, [_to the
audience_] as we hope they all will, for our pains.THE END

in the text of the play it almost always does not.The inconsistency
has been allowed to stand in the Introductory Note, but the apostrophe
has been removed in the few instances in the text.25: "_THE DEAN gives DARBEY a severe look..._"--A bracket has
been added to the beginning of this line.--The second "No" has been changed to lower

in the handling of stage directions enclosed by brackets on at least
one side.In general, the
stage directions were typeset in the printed text as follows:

left margin as hanging paragraphs.How much the stage directions were
indented varied.In the etext, all stage directions not before or within dialogue are
placed on the next line, indented the same amount from the left
margin, and coded as hanging paragraphs.demanded Professor Scotch, in a shaking
tone of voice.Frank's hand fell on the professor's arm, and the three listened
intently, hearing something that gave them no little surprise.From far away through the night came the sound of hoarse voices singing
a wild, doleful song."Pwhat the Ould Nick does thot mane?""Let's see if we can understand the words
they are singing."We sailed away from Gloucester Bay,
      And the wind was in the west, yo ho!And her cargo was some New England rum;
      Our grog it was made of the best, yo ho!""A sailor's song," decided Frank, "and those are sailors who are
singing.We are not alone in the Everglades.""They're all drunk," declared the professor."You can tell that by the
sound of their voices."They're a blamed soight betther than none, fer it's loikely they know
th' way out av this blissed swamp," said Barney."They may bub-bub-be pup-pup-pup-pirates!""What sticks me," said Frank, "is how a party of sailors ever made their
way in here, for we are miles upon miles from the coast."Are ye fer takin' a look at th' loikes av thim, Frankie?""I am not going near those ruffianly and bloodthirsty pirates.""Then you may stay here with the spooks, while Barney and I go."This was altogether too much for the professor, and, when he found they
really intended to go, he gave in.Frank loaded the rifles and the shotgun, and took along his bow and
arrows, even though Barney made sport of him for bothering with the
last.They slipped the canoe into the water, and, directed by Frank, the
professor succeeded in getting in without upsetting the frail affair."Oi hope we won't run inther the ghost," uttered the Irish boy."The sound of that singing comes from the direction in which the old man
seemed to point," said Frank.The singing continued, sometimes sinking to a low, droning sound,
sometimes rising to a wild wail that sounded weirdly over the marshland."Ready," said Frank, and the canoe slipped silently over the dark
surface of the water course.The singing ceased after a time, but they were still guided by the sound
of wrangling voices."This is tut-tut-terrible!"Suddenly the sound of a pistol shot came over the rushes, followed by a
feminine shriek of pain or terror!As soon as he
could recover, Frank asked:

"Did you hear that?""It sounded very much like the voice of a woman or girl," said Professor
Scotch, who was so amazed that he forgot for the moment that he was
scared."That's what it was," declared Frank; "and it means that our aid is
needed in that quarter at once.""There's no telling
what kind of a gang we may run into."grated Barney Mulloy, quivering with eagerness."There's a female in nade av hilp."directed Frank, giving utterance to his old maxim.The professor was too agitated to handle a paddle, so the task of
propelling the canoe fell to the boys, who sent it skimming over the
water, Frank watching out for snags.In a moment the water course swept round to the left, and they soon saw
the light of a fire gleaming through the rushes.The sounds of a conflict continued, telling them that the quarrel was
still on, and aiding them in forming their course.In a moment they came in full view of the camp-fire, by the light of
which they saw several struggling, swaying figures.Frank's keen eyes seemed to take in everything at one sweeping glance.Six men and a girl were revealed by the light of the fire.Five of the
men were engaged in a fierce battle, while the sixth was bound, in a
standing position, to the trunk of a tree.The girl, with her hands bound behind her back, was standing near the
man who was tied to the tree, and the firelight fell fairly on the faces
of man and girl.A low exclamation of the utmost astonishment broke from Frank's lips."It can't be--it is an impossibility!""Pwhat is it, me b'y?"That is Captain Justin Bellwood,
whose vessel was lost in the storm off Fardale coast!"An' th' girrul is----"

"Elsie Bellwood, his daughter!""Th' wan you saved from th' foire, Frankie?""Captain Bellwood
has a new vessel, and he would not be here."But how----"

"There has been some kind of trouble, and they are captives--that is
plain enough.Those men are sailors--Captain Bellwood's sailors!It's
likely there has been a mutiny."We must land while those ruffians are fighting.If
we can get ashore, we'll set the captain free, and I fancy we'll be able
to hold our own with those ruffians, desperate wretches though they
are.""Perhaps they will kill each other,
and then our part will be easy."Frank was not for waiting, but, at that moment, something happened that
caused him to change his plan immediately.The fighting ruffians were using knives in a deadly way, and one man,
bleeding from many wounds, fell exhausted to the ground.Another, who
seemed to be this one's comrade, tore himself from the other three,
leaped to the girl, caught her in his arms, and held her in front of
him, so that her body shielded his.Then, pointing a revolver over her
shoulder, he snarled:

"Come on, and I'll bore the three of ye!You can't shoot me, Gage,
unless you kill ther gal!"The youngest one of the party, a mere boy, but a fellow with the air of
a desperado, stepped to the front, saying swiftly:

"If you don't drop that girl, Jaggers, you'll leave your carcass in this
swamp!Frank clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from uttering a great shout
of amazement.The next moment he panted:

"This is fate!by the eternal skies, that is Leslie Gage,
my worst enemy at Fardale Academy, and the fellow who ran away to keep
from being expelled.It was reported that he had gone to sea.""Ye're roight, Frankie," agreed the no less excited Irish lad."It's
thot skunk, an' no mistake!""It is Leslie Gage," agreed the professor."He was ever a bad boy, but I
did not think he would come to this.""An' Oi always thought he would come to some bad ind.It wur thot
spalpane thot troied to run Frank through with a sharpened foil wan
toime whin they wur fencing.He had black murder in his hearrut thin,
an' it's not loikely th' whilp has grown inny betther since."The man with the girl laughed defiantly, retorting:

"You talk big, Gage, but it won't work with me.I hold the best hand
just at present, and you'll have to come to terms."You don't dare shoot," returned the young desperado, as he took still
another step toward the sailor.In a moment the man placed the muzzle of the revolver against the temple
of the helpless girl, fiercely declaring:

"If you come another inch, I'll blow her brains out!"I will fix him, or
my name is not Merriwell!"He drew an arrow from the quiver, and fitted the notch to the
bow-string.His nerves were steady, and he was determined.He waited
till the man had removed the muzzle of the weapon from the girl's
temple, and then he lifted the bow.They longed to check
Frank, but dared not speak for fear of causing him to waver and send the
arrow at the girl.The bow was bent, the line was taut, the arrow was drawn to the head,
and then----

Twang!The arrow sped through the air, but it was too dark for them to
follow its flight with their eyes.With their hearts in their mouths,
they awaited the result.Of a sudden, the ruffian uttered a cry of pain, released his hold on the
girl, and fell heavily to the ground.The firelight showed the arrow sticking in his shoulder.grunted a voice close beside the canoe."Very good shot for a
white boy.The trio turned in amazement and alarm, and, within three feet of them,
they saw a shadowy canoe that contained a shadowy figure.There was but
one person in the strange canoe, and he immediately added:

"There is no need to fear Socato, the Seminole, for he will not harm
you.He is the friend of all good white men."It was an Indian, a Seminole, belonging to the remnant of the once great
nation that peopled the Florida peninsula.Frank realized this in a
moment, and, knowing the Seminoles were harmless when well treated, felt
no further alarm.The Indian had paddled with the utmost silence to their side, while they
were watching what was taking place on shore.The arrow had produced consternation in the camp.The fellow who was
wounded tried to draw it from his shoulder, groaning:

"This is not a fair deal!Give me a fair show, and I'll fight you all!"The two canoes were beyond the circle of firelight, so they could not be
seen from the shore.Gage's two companions were overcome with terror."We've been attacked
by a band of savages!"Gage spoke a few words in a low tone, and then sprang over the prostrate
form of the man who had been stricken down by the arrow, grasped the
girl, and retreated into the darkness.His companions also scudded
swiftly beyond the firelight, leaving Captain Bellwood still bound to
the tree, while one man lay dead on the ground, and another had an arrow
in his shoulder.Close to Frank's ear the voice of Socato the Seminole sounded:

"Light bother them.They git in the dark and see us from the shore.gasped Professor Scotch, "I don't care to stay here,
and have them shoot at me!""Of course we will pay," hastily answered Frank."Can you aid us in
saving her?If you can, you shall be----"

"Socato save her.White man and two boys go back to cabin of Great White
Phantom.Stay there, and Socato come with the girl."Oi don't loike thot," declared Barney."Oi'd loike to take a
hand in th' rescue mesilf.""Socato can do better alone," asserted the Seminole.But Frank was not inclined to desert Elsie Bellwood in her hour of
trouble, and he said:

"Socato, you must take me with you.Professor, you and Barney go back to
the hut, and stay there till we come."The Indian hesitated, and then said:

"If white boy can shoot so well with the bow and arrow, he may not be in
the way.I will take him, if he can step from one canoe to the other
without upsetting either.""That's easy," said Frank, as he deliberately and safely accomplished
the feat."Well done, white boy," complimented the strange Indian."Pass me one of those rifles," requested Frank."White boy better leave rifle; take bow and arrows," advised Socato."Rifle make noise; bow and arrow make no noise."Return to the hut, Barney, and stay there
till we show up.""But th' spook----"

"Hang the spook!We'll know where to find you, if you go there.""The Great White Phantom will not harm those who offer him no harm,"
declared the Indian."I am not so afraid of spooks as I am of---- Jumping Jupiter!"There was a flash of fire from the darkness on shore, the report of a
gun, and a bullet whirred through the air, cutting the professor's
speech short, and causing him to duck down into the canoe."Those fellows have located us," said Frank, swiftly.Socato's paddle dropped without a sound into the water, and the canoe
slid away into the night.The professor and Barney lost no time in moving, and it was well they
did so, for, a few seconds later, another shot came from the shore, and
the bullet skipped along the water just where the canoes had been.Frank trusted everything to Socato, even though he had never seen or
heard of the Seminole before.Something about the voice of the Indian
convinced the boy that he was honest, for all that his darkness was such
that Frank could not see his face and did not know how he looked.The Indian sent the canoe through the water with a speed and silence
that was a revelation to Frank Merriwell.The paddle made no sound, and
it seemed that the prow of the canoe scarcely raised a ripple, for all
that they were gliding along so swiftly.whispered Frank, observing that they were leaving
the camp-fire astern."If I didn't, I shouldn't be here.Socato take him round to place where we can come up
behind bad white men.The light of the camp-fire died out, and then, a few moments later,
another camp-fire seemed to glow across a strip of low land.What party is camped there--friends of yours, Socato?"We left that fire behind us, Socato.""And we have come round by the water till it is before us again."This was true, but the darkness had been so intense that Frank did not
see how their course was changing."I see how you mean to come up behind them," said the boy."You are
going to land and cross to their camp."Soon the rushes closed in on either side, and the Indian sent the canoe
twisting in and out amid their tall stalks like a creeping panther.He
seemed to know every inch of the way, and followed it as well as if it
were broad noonday.Frank's admiration for the fellow grew with each moment, and he felt
that he could, indeed, trust Socato."If we save that girl and the old man, you shall be well paid for the
job," declared the boy, feeling that it was well to dangle a reward
before the Indian's mental vision."It is good," was the whispered retort.In a few moments they crept through the rushes till the canoe lay close
to a bank, and the Indian directed Frank to get out.The camp-fire could not be seen from that position, but the boy well
knew it was not far away.Taking his bow, with the quiver of arrows slung to his back, the lad
left the canoe, being followed immediately by the Seminole, who lifted
the prow of the frail craft out upon the bank, and then led the way.Passing round a thick mass of reeds, they soon reached a position where
they could see the camp-fire and the moving forms of the sailors.Just
as they reached this position, Leslie Gage was seen to dash up to the
fire and kick the burning brands in various directions."He has done that so that the firelight might not reveal them to us,"
thought Frank."They still believe us near, although they know not where
we are."Crouching and creeping, Socato led the way, and Frank followed closely,
wondering what scheme the Indian could have in his head, yet trusting
everything to his sagacity.In a short time they were near enough to hear the conversation of the
bewildered and alarmed sailors.The men were certain a band of savages
were close at hand, for they did not dream that the arrow which had
dropped Jaggers was fired by the hand of a white person."The sooner we get away from here, the better it will be for us,"
declared Leslie Gage."We'll have to get away in the boats," said a grizzled
villainous-looking, one-eyed old sailor, who was known as Ben Bowsprit."Fo' de Lawd's sake!"gasped the third sailor, who was a <DW64>, called
Black Tom; "how's we gwine to run right out dar whar de critter am dat
fired de arrer inter Jack Jaggers?""The 'critter' doesn't seem to be there any longer," assured Gage."Those two shots must have frightened him away.""That's right," agreed Bowsprit."This has been an unlucky stop fer us,
mates.Tomlinson is dead, an' Jaggers----"

"I ain't dead, but I'm bleedin', bleedin', bleedin'!"moaned the fellow
who had been hit by Frank's arrow."There's a big tear in my shoulder,
an' I'm afeared I've made my last cruise.""It serves you right," came harshly from the boy leader of the ruffianly
crew."Tomlinson attempted to set himself up as head of this crew--as
captain over me.All the time, you knew I was the leader
in every move we have made.""And a pretty pass you have led us to!""Where's the money you said the captain had stored away?Where's the
reward we'd receive for the captain alive and well?We turned mutineers
at your instigation, and what have we made of it?We've set the law
agin' us, an' here we are.The _Bonny Elsie_ has gone up in smoke----"

"Through the carelessness of a lot of drunken fools!"But for that, we wouldn't be here now,
hiding from officers of the law.""Well, here we are," growled Ben Bowsprit, "an' shiver my timbers if we
seem able to get out of this howlin' swamp!The more we try, the more we
seem ter git lost.""Fo' goodness, be yo' gwine to stan' roun' an' chin, an' chin, an'
chin?""The fire's out, and we can't be seen," spoke Gage, swiftly, in a low
tone.Sandra went to the hallway.You two are to take the old man in one; I'll
take the girl in the other.""It's the gal you've cared fer all the time," cried Jaggers, madly."It
was for her you led us into this scrape."You can't make me shut up, Gage.""Well, you'll have a chance to talk to yourself and Tomlinson before
long."I saw you strike the
blow, and I'll swear to that, my hearty!""It's not likely you'll be given a chance to swear to it, Jaggers.I may
have killed him, but it was in self-defense.He was doing his best to
get his knife into me.""Yes, we was tryin' to finish you," admitted Jaggers."With you out of
the way, Tomlinson would have been cap'n, and I first mate.You've kept
your eyes on the gal all the time.I don't believe you thought the cap'n
had money at all.It was to get the gal you led us into this business.She'd snubbed you--said she despised you, and you made up your mind to
carry her off against her will.""If that was my game, you must confess I succeeded very well.But I
can't waste more time talking to you.Put Cap'n Bellwood in the larger, and look out for
him."Boy though he was, Gage had resolved
to become a leader of men, and he had succeeded.The girl, quite overcome, was prostrate at the feet of her father, who
was bound to the cypress tree.There was a look of pain and despair on the face of the old captain.His
heart bled as he looked down at his wretched daughter, and he groaned:

"Merciful Heaven!It were better that she
should die than remain in the power of that young villain!""What are you muttering about, old man?"coarsely demanded Gage, as he
bent to lift the girl."You seem to be muttering to yourself the greater
part of the time.""Do you
think you can escape the retribution that pursues all such dastardly
creatures as you?"I have found out that the goody-good people do
not always come out on top in this world.Besides that, it's too late
for me to turn back now.I started wrong at school, and I have been
going wrong ever since.It's natural for me; I can't help it.""If you harm her, may the wrath of Heaven fall on your head!"I will be very tender and considerate with her.He attempted to lift her to her feet, but she drew from him, shuddering
and screaming wildly:

"Don't touch me!""Now, don't be a little fool!""You make me sick with
your tantrums!But she screamed the louder, seeming to stand in the utmost terror of
him.With a savage exclamation, Gage tore off his coat and wrapped it about
the girl's head so that her cries were smothered."Perhaps that will keep you still a bit!"he snapped, catching her up in
his arms, and bearing her to the smaller boat, in which he carefully
placed her.As her hands were bound behind her, she could not
remove the coat from about her head, and she sat as he placed her, with
it enveloping her nearly to the waist.Somebody
take Tomlinson's weapons.He may need them when we
are gone.""Don't leave me here to die alone!"piteously pleaded the wounded
sailor."I'm pretty well gone now, but I don't want to be left here
alone!"Gage left the small boat for a moment, and approached the spot where the
pleading wretch lay."Jaggers," he said, "it's the fate you deserve.You agreed to stand by
me, but you went back on your oath, and tried to kill me.""And now you're going to leave me here to bleed to death or starve?"The tables are turned on you, my fine fellow.""Well, I'm sure you won't leave me."Jaggers flung up his hand, from which a spout of flame seemed to leap,
and the report of a pistol sounded over the marsh.Leslie Gage fell in a heap to the ground.Well, he is dead already, for I shot
him through the brain!""That's where you are mistaken, Jaggers," said the cool voice of the
boyish leader of the mutineers."I saw your move, saw the revolver, and
dropped in time to avoid the bullet."A snarl of baffled fury came from the lips of the wounded sailor."See if you can dodge this
bullet!"He would have fired again, but Gage leaped forward in the darkness,
kicked swiftly and accurately, and sent the revolver spinning from the
man's hand."I did mean to have
you taken away, and I was talking to torment you.Now you will stay
here--and die like a dog!"He turned from Jaggers, and hurried back to the boat, in which that
muffled figure silently sat.Captain Bellwood had been released from the tree, and marched to the
other boat, in which he now sat, bound and helpless.They pushed off, settled into their seats, and began rowing.Gage was not long in following, but he wondered at the silence of the
girl who sat in the stern.It could not be that she had fainted, for she
remained in an upright position."Any way to get out of this," was the answer."We will find another
place to camp, but I want to get away from this spot."Not a sound came from beneath the muffled coat."It must be close," thought Gage."I wonder if she can breathe all
right.At last, finding he could keep up with his companions without trouble,
and knowing he would have very little difficulty in overtaking them,
Gage drew in his oars and slipped back toward the muffled figure in the
stern."You must not think too hard of me, Miss Bellwood," he said, pleadingly.I love you far too much for that,
Elsie."He could have sworn that the sound which came from the muffling folds of
the coat was like a smothered laugh, but he knew she was not laughing at
him."I have been wicked and desperate," he went on; "but I was driven to the
life I have led.When I shipped on
your father's vessel it was because I had seen you and knew you were to
be along on the cruise.I loved you at first sight, and I vowed that I
would reform and do better if you loved me in return, Elsie."He was speaking swiftly in a low tone, and his voice betrayed his
earnestness.He passed an arm around the muffled figure, feeling it
quiver within his grasp, and then he continued:

"You did not take kindly to me, but I persisted.Then you repulsed
me--told me you despised me, and that made me desperate.I swore I would
have you, Elsie.Then came the mutiny and the burning of the vessel.Now
we are here, and you are with me.Elsie, you know not how I love you!I
have become an outcast, an outlaw--all for your sake!It must be that he was beginning to break down that icy barrier.She
realized her position, and she would be reasonable."Do not scream, Elsie--do not draw away, darling.Say that you will love
me a little--just a little!"He pulled the coat away, and something came out of the folds and touched
cold and chilling against his forehead.commanded a voice that was full of chuckling laughter."If
you chirp, I'll have to blow the roof of your head off, Gage!"Leslie Gage caught his breath and nearly collapsed into the bottom of
the boat.Indeed, he would have fallen had not a strong hand fastened on
his collar and held him."I don't want to shoot you, Gage," whispered the cool voice."I don't
feel like that, even though you did attempt to take my life once or
twice in the past.You have made me very good natured within the past
few moments.How gently you murmured, 'Do not draw
away, darling; say that you love me a little--just a little!'Really, Gage, you gave me such amusement that I am more than
satisfied with this little adventure.""Still, I can't
place you.""Indeed, you are forgetful, Gage.But it is rather dark, and I don't
suppose you expected to see me here."And you are--Frank Merriwell!"Gage would have shouted the name in his amazement, but Frank's fingers
suddenly closed on the fellow's throat and held back the sound in a
great measure."Now you have guessed it," chuckled Frank.I can forgive you
for the past since you have provided me with so much amusement to-night.How you urged me to learn to love you!But that's too much, Gage; I can
never learn to do that."Leslie ground his teeth, but he was still overcome with unutterable
amazement and wonder.That Frank Merriwell, whom he hated, should appear
there at night in the wilds of the Florida Everglades was like a
miracle.Had some magic of that wild and
dreary region changed her into Frank Merriwell?Little wonder that Gage was dazed and helpless."How in the name of the Evil One did you come here?"he finally asked,
recovering slightly from his stupor.It was the same old merry, boyish laugh
that Gage had heard so often at Fardale, and it filled him with intense
anger, as it had in the days of old."I know you did not expect to see me," murmured Frank, still laughing."I assure you that the Evil One had nothing to do with my appearance
here."I left her in the boat a few moments."I will let you speculate over that question for a while, my fine
fellow.In the meantime, I fancy it will be a good idea to tie you up so
you will not make any trouble.Remember I have a revolver handy, and I
promise that I'll use it if you kick up a row."At this moment, one of the sailors in the other boat called:

"Hello, there, Mr.Gage was tempted to shout for help, but the muzzle of the cold weapon
that touched his forehead froze his tongue to silence.Ben Bowsprit was growing impatient and wondering why Leslie did not
answer.It had occurred to the old tar that it was possible the boy had
deserted them.The voice of Black Tom was heard to say:

"He oughter be right near by us, Ben.'Smighty strange dat feller don'
seem to answer nohow.""We'll pull back, my hearty, and
take a look for our gay cap'n."They were coming back, and Gage was still unbound, although a captive in
Frank Merriwell's clutch.There would not be enough time to bind Gage and
get away.Something must be done to prevent the two sailors from turning
about and rowing back."Gage," whispered Frank, swiftly, "you must answer them.Say, it's all
right, boys; I'm coming right along."Gage hesitated, the longing to shout for help again grasping him.hissed Frank, and the muzzle of the revolver seemed
to bore into Gage's forehead, as if the bullet longed to seek his brain.With a mental curse on the black luck, Gage uttered the words as his
captor had ordered, although they seemed to come chokingly from his
throat."Well, what are ye doing back there so long?""Tell them you're making love," chuckled Frank, who seemed to be hugely
enjoying the affair, to the unspeakable rage of his captive."Ask them
if they don't intend to give you a show at all."Gage did as directed, causing Bowsprit to laugh hoarsely.cackled the old sailor, in the darkness."But
this is a poor time to spend in love-makin', cap'n.Wait till we git
settled down ag'in.Tom an' me'll agree not ter watch ye.""Say, all right; go on," instructed Frank, and Gage did so.In a few seconds, the sound of oars were heard, indicating that the
sailors were obeying instructions.At that moment, while Frank was listening to this sound, Gage believed
his opportunity had arrived, and, being utterly desperate, the young
rascal knocked aside Frank's hand, gave a wild shout, leaped to his
feet, and plunged headlong into the water.It was done swiftly--too swiftly for Frank to shoot, if he had intended
such a thing.But Frank Merriwell had no desire to shoot his former
schoolmate, even though Leslie Gage had become a hardened and desperate
criminal, and so, having broken away, the youthful leader of the
mutineers stood in no danger of being harmed.Frank and Socato had been close at hand when Gage placed Elsie Bellwood
in the boat, and barely was the girl left alone before she was removed
by the Seminole, in whose arms she lay limp and unconscious, having
swooned at last.Then it was that a desire to capture Gage and a wild longing to give the
fellow a paralyzing surprise seized upon Frank."Socato," he whispered, "I am going to trust you to take that girl to
the hut where my friends are to be found.Remember that you shall be
well paid; I give you my word of honor as to that."Have a little racket on my own hook," was the reply."If I lose my
bearings and can't find the hut, I will fire five shots into the air
from my revolver.Have one of my friends answer in a similar manner."Frank took the coat; stepped into the boat, watched till Gage was
approaching, and then muffled his head, sitting in the place where Elsie
had been left.In the meantime, the Seminole was bearing the girl swiftly and silently
away.Thus it came about that Gage made love to Frank Merriwell, instead of
the fair captive he believed was muffled by the coat.When Gage plunged into the water, the small boat rocked and came near
upsetting, but did not go over.But the fellow's cry and the splash had brought the sailors to a halt,
and they soon called back:

"What's the matter?"I rather fancy it will be a good plan to make myself scarce in this
particular locality," muttered Frank.Gage swam under water for some distance, and then, coming to the
surface, he shouted to the men in the leading boat:

"Bowsprit, Black Tom, help!There is an enemy here,
but he is alone!"You will have a fine time
catching me.You have given me great amusement, Gage.I assure you that
I have been highly entertained by your company, and hereafter I shall
consider you an adept in the gentle art of making love."fiercely shouted Gage from the water."You are having your turn
now, but mine will soon come!""I have heard you talk like that before, Gage.It does not seem that you
have yet learned 'the way of the transgressor is hard.'""You'll learn better than to meddle with me!I have longed to meet you
again, Frank Merriwell, and I tell you now that one of us will not leave
this swamp alive!""This is not the first time you have made a promise that you were not
able to keep.Before I leave you, I have this to say: If Captain
Bellwood is harmed in the least, if he is not set at liberty with very
little delay, I'll never rest till you have received the punishment
which your crimes merit."Frank could hear the sailors rowing back, and he felt for the oars,
having no doubt that he would be able to escape them with ease, aided by
the darkness.When Gage stopped rowing to make love to the supposed Elsie he had left
the oars in the rowlocks, drawing them in and laying them across the
boat.In the violent rocking of the boat when the fellow leaped
overboard one of the oars had been lost.Frank was left with a single oar, and his enemies were bearing down upon
him with great swiftness."I wonder if there's a chance to scull this boat?"he coolly speculated,
as he hastened to the stern and made a swift examination.To his satisfaction and relief, he found there was, and the remaining
oar was quickly put to use.Even then Frank felt confident that he would be able to avoid his
enemies in the darkness that lay deep and dense upon the great swamp.He
could hear them rowing, and he managed to skull the light boat along
without making much noise.He did not mind that Gage had escaped; in fact, he was relieved to get
rid of the fellow, although it had been his intention to hold him as
hostage for Captain Bellwood.It was the desire for adventure that had led Frank into the affair, and,
now that it was over so far as surprising Gage was concerned, he was
satisfied to get away quietly.He could hear the sailors calling Gage, who answered from the water, and
he knew they would stop to pick the fellow up, which would give our hero
a still better show of getting away.All this took place, and Frank was so well hidden by the darkness that
there was not one chance in a thousand of being troubled by the
ruffianly crew when another astonishing thing happened.From a point amid the tall rushes a powerful white light gleamed out and
fell full and fair upon the small boat and its single occupant,
revealing Frank as plainly as if by the glare of midday sunlight."What is the meaning of this,
I would like to know?"He was so astonished that he nearly dropped the oar.The sailors were astonished, but the light showed them distinctly, and
Gage snarled."Give me your pistol, Bowsprit!He snatched the weapon from the old tar's hand, took hasty aim, and
fired.Frank Merriwell was seen to fling up his arms and fall heavily into the
bottom of the boat!grated the triumphant young rascal, flourishing the revolver.The mysterious light vanished in the twinkling of an eye, but it had
shone long enough for Gage to do his dastardly work.The sailors were alarmed by the light, and wished to row away; but Gage
raved at them, ordering them to pull down toward the spot where the
other boat lay.After a time, the men recovered enough to do as directed, and the
smaller boat was soon found, rocking lightly on the surface.Running alongside, Gage reached over into the small boat, and his hand
found the boy who was stretched in the bottom.cried the young rascal, gleefully."I'll bet anything I
put the bullet straight through his heart!"And then, as if his own words had brought a sense of it all to him, he
suddenly shuddered with horror, faintly muttering:

"That was murder!"The horror grew upon him rapidly, and he began to wonder that he had
felt delight when he saw Frank Merriwell fall.The shooting had been the
impulse of the moment, and, now that it was done and he realized what it
meant, he would have given much to recall that bullet."I swore that one of us should not leave this
swamp alive, and my oath will not be broken.I hated Frank Merriwell the
first time I saw him, and I have hated him ever since.Now he is out of
my way, and he will never cross my path again."There was a slight stir in the small boat, followed by something like a
gasping moan."He don't seem to be dead yet, cap'n," said Ben Bowsprit."I guess your
aim wasn't as good as you thought.""Oh, I don't think he'll recover very fast," said the youthful rascal,
harshly.He rose and stepped over into the smaller boat."I want to take a look at the chap."You'll find I'm not dead yet!"returned a weak voice, and Frank
Merriwell sat up and grappled with Gage.A snarl of fury came from the lips of the boy desperado."You'll have to fight before you finish me!"But Merriwell seemed weak, and Gage did not find it difficult to handle
the lad at whom he had shot.He forced Frank down into the bottom of the
boat, and then called to his companions:

"Give me some of that line.A piece of rope was handed to him, and Black Tom stepped into the boat
to aid him.Between them, they succeeded in making Frank fast, for the
boy's struggles were weak, at best."At Fardale Frank
Merriwell triumphed.He disgraced me, and I was forced to fly from the
school.""You disgraced yourself," declared the defiant captive."You cheated at
cards--you fleeced your schoolmates."Oh, yes, I was rather flip with the papers,
and I should not have been detected but for you, Merriwell.When I was
exposed, I knew I would be shunned by all the fellows in school, and so
I ran away.But I did not forget who brought the disgrace about, and I
knew we should meet some time, Merriwell.How you came here
I do not know, and why my bullet did not kill you is more than I can
understand.""It would have killed me but for a locket and picture in my pocket,"
returned Frank."It struck the locket, and that saved me; but the shock
robbed me of strength--it must have robbed me of consciousness for a
moment.""It would have been just as well for you if the locket had not stopped
the bullet," declared Gage, fiercely."By that I presume you mean that you intend to murder me anyway?""I have sworn that one of us shall never leave this swamp alive.""Go ahead, Gage," came coolly from the lips of the captive."Luck seems
to have turned your way.Make the most of it while you have an
opportunity.""We can't spend time in gabbing here," came nervously from Bowsprit."Yes," put in Black Tom; "fo' de Lawd's sake, le's get away before dat
light shine some mo'!""That's right," said the old tar."Some things happen in this swamp that
no human being can account for."Gage was ready enough to get away, and they were soon pulling onward
again, with Frank Merriwell, bound and helpless, in the bottom of the
smaller boat.For nearly an hour they rowed, and then they succeeded in finding some
dry, solid land where they could camp beneath the tall, black trees.They were so overcome with alarm that they did not venture to build a
fire, for all that Gage was shivering in his wet clothes.Leslie was still puzzling over Frank Merriwell's astonishing appearance,
and he tried to question Frank concerning it, but he could obtain but
little satisfaction from the boy he hated.Away to the west stretched the Everglades, while to the north and the
east lay the dismal cypress swamps.The party seemed quite alone in the heart of the desolate region.Leslie started out to explore the strip of elevated land upon which they
had passed the night, and he found it stretched back into the woods,
where lay great stagnant pools of water and where grew all kinds of
strange plants and vines.Gage had been from the camp about thirty minutes when he came running
back, his face pale, and a fierce look in his eyes.cried Bowsprit, with an attempt at cheerfulness.What is it you have heard about, my hearty?""The serpent vine," answered Gage, wildly.I did not believe there was such a thing, but it tangled
my feet, it tried to twine about my legs, and I saw the little red
flowers opening and shutting like the lips of devils.""Fo' de Lawd's sake!de boss hab gone stark, starin' mad!"cried Black
Tom, staring at Leslie with bulging eyes."But I have thought of a way to
dispose of Frank Merriwell.Frank had listened to all this, and he noted that Gage actually seemed
like a maniac.Captain Bellwood, securely bound, was near Frank, to whom he now spoke:

"God pity you, my lad!He was bad enough before, but he seems to have
gone mad."Well, if that's to be the end of me, I'll have to take my medicine,"
came grimly from the lips of the undaunted boy captive.She is with friends of mine, and they will
fight for her as long as they are able to draw a breath."Now I care not if these wretches murder me!""I scarcely think they will murder you, captain.They have nothing in
particular against you; but Gage hates me most bitterly."snarled Leslie, who had overheard Frank's last words."I do hate you, and my hatred seems to have increased tenfold since last
night.I have been thinking--thinking how you have baffled me at every
turn whenever we have come together.I have decided that you are my evil
genius, and that I shall never have any luck as long as you live.One of us will not leave this swamp alive, and you
will be that one!""Go ahead with the funeral," said Frank, stoutly."If you have made up
your mind to murder me, I can't help myself; but one thing is
sure--you'll not hear me beg.""Wait till you know what your fate is to be.Boys, set his feet free,
and then follow me, with him between you."The cords which held Frank's feet were released, and he was lifted to a
standing position.Then he was marched along after Gage, who led the
way.Into the woods he was marched, and finally Gage came to a halt,
motioning for the others to stop.he cried, pointing; "there is the serpent vine!"On the ground before them, lay a mass of greenish vines, blossoming over
with a dark red flower.Harmless enough they looked, but, as Gage drew a
little nearer, they suddenly seemed to come to life, and they began
reaching toward his feet, twisting, squirming, undulating like a mass of
serpents.shouted Leslie--"there is the vine that feeds on flesh and
blood!See--see how it reached for my feet!It longs to grasp me, to
draw me into its folds, to twine about my body, my neck, to strangle
me!"The sailors shuddered and drew back, while Frank Merriwell's face was
very pale."It did fasten upon me," Gage continued."If I had not been ready and
quick with my knife, it would have drawn me into its deadly embrace.I
managed to cut myself free and escape."Then he turned to Frank, and the dancing light in his eyes was not a
light of sanity."Merriwell," he said, "the serpent vine will end your life, and you'll
never bother me any more!"He leaped forward and clutched the helpless captive, screaming:

"Thus I keep my promise!"And he flung Frank headlong into the clutch of the writhing vine!With his hands bound behind his back, unable to help himself, Frank
reeled forward into the embrace of the deadly vine, each branch of which
was twisting, curling, squirming like the arms of an octopus.He nearly plunged forward upon his face, but managed to recover and keep
on his feet.He felt the vine whip about his legs and fasten there tenaciously, felt
it twist and twine and crawl like a mass of serpents, and he knew he was
in the grasp of the frightful plant which till that hour he had ever
believed a creation of some romancer's feverish fancy.A great horror seemed to come upon him and benumb
his body and his senses.He could feel the horrid vines climbing and coiling about him, and he
was helpless to struggle and tear them away.He knew they were mounting
to his neck, where they would curl about his throat and choke the breath
of life from his body.It was a fearful fate--a terrible death.And there seemed no possible
way of escaping.Higher and higher climbed the vine, swaying and squirming, the blood-red
flowers opening and closing like lips of a vampire that thirsted for his
blood.A look of horror was frozen on Frank's face.His eyes bulged from his
head, and his lips were drawn back from his teeth.He did not cry out,
he did not seem to breathe, but he appeared to be turned to stone in the
grasp of the deadly plant.It was a dreadful sight, and the two sailors, rough and wicked men
though they were, were overcome by the spectacle.Shuddering and
gasping, they turned away.For the first time, Gage seemed to fully realize what he had done.He
covered his eyes with his hand and staggered backward, uttering a low,
groaning sound.Merriwell's staring eyes seemed fastened straight upon him with that
fearful stare, and the thought flashed through the mind of the wretched
boy that he should never forget those eyes."They will haunt me as long as I live!"Already he was seized by the pangs of remorse.Once more he looked at Frank, and once more those staring eyes turned
his blood to ice water.Then, uttering shriek after shriek, Gage turned and fled through the
swamp, plunging through marshy places and jungles, falling, scrambling
up, leaping, staggering, gasping for breath, feeling those staring eyes
at his back, feeling that they would pursue him to his doom.Scarcely less agitated and overcome, Bowsprit and the <DW64> followed,
and Frank Merriwell was abandoned to his fate.Frank longed for the use of his hands to tear away those fiendish vines.It was a horrible thing to stand and let them creep up, up, up, till
they encircled his throat and strangled him to death.Through his mind flashed a picture of himself as he would stand there
with the vines drawing tighter and tighter about his throat and his face
growing blacker and blacker, his tongue hanging out, his eyes starting
from their sockets.He came near shrieking for help, but the thought that the cry must reach
the ears of Leslie Gage kept it back, enabled him to choke it down.He had declared that Gage should not hear him beg for mercy or aid.Not
even the serpent vine and all its horrors could make him forget that
vow.The little red flowers were getting nearer and nearer to his face, and
they were fluttering with eagerness.He felt a sucking, drawing,
stinging sensation on one of his wrists, and he believed one of those
fiendish vampire mouths had fastened there.He swayed his body, he tried to move his feet, but he seemed rooted to
the ground.He did not have the strength to drag himself from that fatal
spot and from the grasp of the vine.His senses were in a maze, and the whole
world was reeling and romping around him.The trees became a band of
giant demons, winking, blinking, grinning at him, flourishing their arms
in the air, and dancing gleefully on every side to the sound of wild
music that came from far away in the sky.Then a smaller demon darted out from amid the trees, rushed at him,
clutched him, slashed, slashed, slashed on every side of him, dragged at
his collar, and panted in his ear:

"White boy fight--try to git away!Was it a dream--was it an hallucination?He
tore at the clinging vines, he fought with all his remaining strength,
he struggled to get away from those clinging things.All the while that other figure was slashing and cutting with something
bright, while the vine writhed and hissed like serpents in agony.How it was accomplished Frank could never tell, but he felt himself
dragged free of the serpent vine, dragged beyond its deadly touch, and
he knew it was no dream that he was free!A black mist hung before his eyes, but he looked through it and faintly
murmured:

"Socato, you have saved me!""Yes, white boy," replied the voice of the Seminole, "I found you just
in time.A few moments more and you be a dead one.""That is true, Socato--that is true!I can never
pay you for what you have done!"In truth the Indian had appeared barely in time to rescue Frank from the
vine, and it had been a desperate and exhausting battle.In another
minute the vine would have accomplished its work."I hear white boy cry out, and I see him run from this way," explained
the Seminole.Sailor men follow, and then I
come to see what scare them so.You knew how to fight the vine--how to cut
it with your knife, and so you saved me.""We must git 'way from here soon as can," declared the Indian."Bad
white men may not come back, and they may come back.They may want to
see what has happen to white boy."Frank knew this was true, but for some time he was not able to get upon
his feet and walk.At length the Indian assisted him, and, leaning on
Socato's shoulder, he made his way along.Avoiding the place where the sailors were camped, the Seminole proceeded
directly to the spot where his canoe was hidden.Frank got in, and
Socato took the paddle, sending the light craft skimming over the water.Straight to the strange hut where Frank and his companions had stopped
the previous night they made their way.The sun was shining into the heart of the great Dismal Swamp, and Elsie
Bellwood was at the door to greet Frank Merriwell.Elsie held out both hands, and there was a welcome light in her eyes.It
seemed to Frank that she was far prettier than when he had last seen her
in Fardale."Frank, I am so glad to see you!"He caught her hands and held them, looking into her eyes.The color came
into her cheeks, and then she noted his rumpled appearance, saw that he
was very pale, and cried:

"What is it, Frank?Socato grunted in a knowing way, but said nothing."It is nothing, Miss Bellwood," assured the boy."I have been through a
little adventure, that's all.He felt her fingers trembling in his clasp, and an electric thrill ran
over him.He remembered that at their last parting she had said it were
far better they should never meet again; but fate had thrown them
together, and now--what?He longed to draw her to him, to kiss her, to tell her how happy he was
at finding her, but he restrained the impulse.Then the voice of Barney Mulloy called from within the hut:

"Phwat ye goin' to do me b'y--shtand out there th' rist av th' doay?Whoy don't yez come in, Oi dunno?""Come in, Frank--come in," cried Professor Scotch."We have been worried
to death over you.Thought you were lost in the Everglades, or had
fallen into the hands of the enemy.""Your second thought was correct," smiled Frank, as he entered the hut,
with Elsie at his side.shouted the Irish boy, in astonishment."Ye don't mane
to say thim spalpanes caught yez?""That's what they did, and they came near cooking me, too."Frank then related the adventures that had befallen him since he started
out on his own hook to give Leslie Gage a surprise.He told how Gage had
made love to him in the boat, and Barney shrieked with laughter.Then he
related what followed, and how his life had been saved by the locket he
carried, and the professor groaned with dismay.Following this, he
related his capture by Gage and how the young desperado flung him, with
his hands bound, into the clutch of the serpent vine.The narrative first amused and then thrilled his listeners.Finally they
were horrified and appalled by the peril through which he had passed."It's Satan's own scum thot Gage is!""Iver let
me get a crack at th' loike av him and see phwat will happen to th'
whilp!"Then Frank explained how he had been saved by Socato, and the Seminole
found himself the hero of the hour."Soc, ould b'y," cried Barney, "thot wur th' bist job ye iver did, an'
Oi'm proud av yez!Ye'll niver lose anything by thot thrick, ayther."roared the little professor, wiping his eyes.Then the Seminole had his hand shaken in a manner and with a heartiness
that astonished him greatly."That was nothing," he declared, "Socato hates the snake vine--fight it
any time.When all had been told and the party had recovered from the excitement
into which they had been thrown, Barney announced that breakfast was
waiting.Elsie, for all of her happiness at meeting Frank, was so troubled about
her father that she could eat very little.Socato ate hastily, and then announced that he would go out and see what
he could do about rescuing Captain Bellwood.Barney wished to go with the Seminole, but Socato declared that he could
do much better alone, and hurriedly departed.Then Frank did his best to cheer Elsie, telling her that everything was
sure to come out all right, as the Indian could be trusted to outwit the
desperadoes and rescue the captain.Seeing Frank and Elsie much together, Barney drew the professor aside,
and whispered:

"It's a bit av a walk we'd better take in th' open air, Oi think.""But I don't need a walk," protested the little man."Yis ye do, profissor," declared the Irish boy, soberly."A man av your
studious habits nivver takes ixercoise enough.""But I do not care to expose myself outdoors.""Phwat's th' matther wid out dures, Oi dunno?""There's danger that Gage and his gang will appear."We can get back here aheed av thim, fer we won't go
fur enough to be cut off.""Then the exercise will not be beneficial, and I will remain here.""Profissor, yer head is a bit thick.Can't ye take a hint, ur is it a
kick ye nade, Oi dunno?""Young man, be careful what kind of language you use to me!""Oi'm spakin' United States, profissor; no Irishmon wauld iver spake
English av he could hilp it.""But such talk of thick heads and kicks--to me, sir, to me!""Well, Oi don't want to give yez a kick, but ye nade it.Ye can't see
thot it's alone a bit Frank an' th' litthle girrul would loike to be."did ye iver think ye'd loike to be alone wid a pretty swate
girrul, profissor?Come on, now, before Oi pick ye up an' lug ye out."So Barney finally induced the professor to leave the hut, but the little
man remained close at hand, ready to bolt in through the wide open door
the instant there was the least sign of danger.Left to themselves, Frank and Elsie chatted, talking over many things of
mutual interest.They sat very near together, and more and more Frank
felt the magnetism of the girl's winning ways and tender eyes.He drew
nearer and nearer, and, finally, although neither knew how it happened,
their hands met, their fingers interlocked, and then he was saying
swiftly, earnestly:

"Elsie, you cannot know how often I have thought of you since you left
me at Fardale.There was something wrong about that parting, Elsie, for
you refused to let me know where you were going, refused to write to me,
expressed a wish that we might never meet again."Her head was bowed, and her cheeks were very
pale."All the while," she softly said, "away down in my heart was a hope I
could not kill--a hope that we might meet again some day, Frank.""When we have to part again,
Elsie, you will not leave me as you did before?She was looking straight into his eyes now, her face was near his, and
the temptation was too great for his impulsive nature to resist.In a
moment his arm was about her neck, and he had kissed her.She quickly released herself from his hold and sprang to her feet, the
warm blood flushing her cheeks."We cannot always be right," she admitted; "but we should be right when
we can.Frank, Inza Burrage befriended me.She thinks more of you than
any one else in the wide world.He lifted his hand to a round hole in his coat where a bullet from
Leslie Gage's revolver had cut through, and beneath it he felt the
ruined and shattered locket that held Inza's picture.The forenoon passed, and the afternoon was well advanced, but still
Socato the Seminole did not return.But late in the afternoon a boat and a number of canoes appeared.In the
boat was Leslie Gage and the two sailors, Black Tom and Bowsprit."Phwat th'
dickens does this mane, Oi dunno?""It means trouble," said Frank, quickly."Have the rifles ready, and be
prepared for hot work.""Those must be Seminoles," said Frank."It is scarcely likely that they
are very dangerous."The boat containing the three white persons ran boldly up to the shore,
and Leslie Gage landed.Advancing a short distance toward the hut, the
door of which was securely closed, he cried:

"Hello in there!""Talk with him, Barney," Frank swiftly directed."The fellow does not
know I am alive, and I do not wish him to know it just now."So Barney returned:

"Hello, yersilf, an' see how ye loike it.""You people are in a bad trap," declared Gage, with a threatening air."Look," and he motioned toward the water, where the canoes containing
the Indians were lying, "these are my backers.There are twenty of them,
and I have but to say the word to have them attack this hut and tear it
to the ground.""Well, Oi dunno about thot," coolly retorted the Irish lad."We moight
have something to say in thot case.It's arrumed we are, an' we know how
to use our goons, me foine birrud.""If you were to fire a shot at one of these Indians it would mean the
death of you all."Well, we are arrumed with Winchester repeaters, an' it
moight make the death av thim all av we began shootin'.""They do not look very dangerous," said Frank."I'll wager something
Gage has hired the fellows to come here and make a show in order to
scare us into submitting.The chances are the Indians will not fight at
all.""You're not fools," said Gage, "and you will not do anything that means
the same as signing your death warrant.If you will come to reason,
we'll have no trouble.We want that girl, Miss Bellwood, and we will
have her.If you do not----"

He stopped suddenly, for there was a great shouting from the Indians.they cried, in tones that betokened the
greatest terror.Then they took to flight, paddling as if their very lives depended on
it.At the same time, the mysterious white canoe, still apparently without
an occupant, was seen coming swiftly toward them, gliding lightly over
the water in a most unaccountable manner.Exclamations of astonishment broke from the two sailors, and Leslie Gage
stared at the singular craft in profound astonishment.When the attention of the crowd was on the remarkable sight, Frank
unfastened the door and before Gage was aware of it, our hero was right
upon him.Frank shouted, pointing a revolver at the
fellow.Gage saw the boy he believed he had destroyed, uttered a wild shriek,
threw up his hands, and fell in a senseless heap to the ground.Frank swiftly lifted the fellow, and then ran into the cabin with him,
placing him on the couch.In fact, they seemed almost as badly
scared as the Indians, and they got away in their boat, rowing as if for
their very lives, soon passing from sight.exclaimed Barney Mulloy; "this is phwat Oi call a
ragion av wonders.It's ivery doay and almost ivery hour something
happens to astonish ye."Gage was made secure, so he could not get away when he recovered from
the swoon into which he seemed to have fallen.A short time after, Socato was seen returning, but he was alone in his
canoe."He has not found my father--my poor father!""Let's hear what he has to say."The bad white men leave their captive alone," said Socato, "and I
should have set him free, but the great white phantom came, and then the
white captive disappeared."Whom do you mean by the great white phantom?""The one who owns the canoe that goes alone--the one who built this
house and lives here sometimes.My people say he is
a phantom, for he can appear and disappear as he likes, and he commands
the powers of light and darkness.Socato knew that the bad white man had
hired a hunting party of my people to come here and appear before the
house to frighten you, but he knew you would not be frightened, and the
bad men could not get my people to aid them in a fight.Socato also knew
that the great white phantom sent his canoe to scare my people away, but
he does not know what the great white phantom has done with the man who
was a prisoner.""Well, it is possible the great white phantom will explain a few things
we do not understand," said Frank, "for here he comes in his canoe.""And father--my father is with him in the canoe!"screamed Elsie
Bellwood, in delight.The white canoe was approaching, still gliding noiselessly
over the water, without any apparent power of propulsion, and in it were
seated two men.One had a long white beard and a profusion of white
hair.He was dressed entirely in white, and sat in the stern of the
canoe.The other was Captain Justin Bellwood, quite unharmed, and
looking very much at his ease.The little party flocked to the shore to greet the captain, who waved
his hand and called reassuringly to Elsie.As soon as the canoe touched
and came to a rest, he stepped out and clasped his daughter in his arms,
saying, fervently:

"Heaven be thanked!we have come through many dangers, and we are free
at last!Neither of us has been harmed, and we will soon be out of this
fearful swamp."The man with the white hair and beard stepped ashore and stood regarding
the girl intently, paying no heed to the others.Captain Bellwood turned
to him, saying:

"William, this is my daughter, of whom I told you.Elsie, this is your
Uncle William, who disappeared many years ago, and has never been heard
from since till he set me free to-day, after I was abandoned by those
wretches who dragged us here.""And so I believed, but he still lives.Professor Scotch, I think we had
the pleasure of meeting in Fardale.Permit me to introduce you to
William Bellwood, one of the most celebrated electricians living
to-day."As he said this, Captain Bellwood made a swift motion which his brother
did not see.He touched his forehead, and the signal signified that
William Bellwood was not right in his mind.This the professor saw was
true when he shook hands with the man, for there was the light of
madness in the eyes of the hermit."My brother," continued Captain Bellwood, "has explained that he came
here to these wilds to continue his study of electricity alone and
undisturbed.He took means to keep other people from bothering him.This
canoe, which contains a lower compartment and a hidden propeller, driven
by electricity, was his invention.He has arrangements whereby he can
use a powerful search-light at night, and----"

"That search-light came near being the death of me," said Frank."He
turned it on me last night just in time to show me to my enemy.""He has many other contrivances," Captain Bellwood went on."He has
explained that, by means of electricity, he can make his canoe or
himself glow with a white light in the darkest night.""And he also states that he has wires connecting various batteries in
yonder hut, so that he can frighten away superstitious hunters who
otherwise might take possession of the hut and give him trouble.""Thot ixplains th' foire-allarum an' th' power
thot throwed me inther th' middle av th' flure!Oi nivver hearrud th'
bate av it!"At this moment, a series of wild shrieks came from the hut, startling
them all.Gage was still on the couch,
and he shrieked still louder when he saw Frank; an expression of the
greatest terror coming to his face.Then he began to rave incoherently, sometimes frothing at the mouth.Two days later a party of eight persons emerged from the wilds of the
great Dismal Swamp and reached a small settlement.They were Frank
Merriwell, Barney Mulloy, Professor Scotch, Leslie Gage, Captain
Bellwood and his brother William, Socato the Seminole, and last, but far
from least, Elsie Bellwood."He shall be given shelter and medical treatment," declared Frank; "and
I will see that all the bills are paid.""Thot's the only thing Oi have against ye, me b'y.Ye wur always letting
up on yer inemies at Fardale, an' ye shtill kape on doin' av it.""If I continue to do so, I shall have nothing to trouble my conscience."Frank did take care of Gage and see that he was given the best medical
aid that money could procure, and, as a result, the fellow was saved
from a madhouse, for he finally recovered.He seemed to appreciate the
mercy shown him by his enemy, for he wrote a letter to Frank that was
filled with entreaties for forgiveness and promised to try to lead a
different life in the future."That," said Frank, "is my reward for being merciful to an enemy."If Jack Jaggers did not perish in the Everglades, he disappeared.Ben
Bowsprit and Black Tom also vanished, and it is possible that they left
their bones in the great Dismal Swamp.William Bellwood, so long a hermit in the wilds of Florida, seemed glad
to leave that region.Leaving their friends in Florida, Frank, Barney and the professor next
moved northward toward Tennessee, Frank wishing to see some of the
battlegrounds of the Civil War.The boys planned a brief tour afoot and were soon on their way among the
Great Smoky Mountains.Professor Scotch had no heart for a "tour afoot" through the mountains,
and so he had stopped at Knoxville, where the boys were to join him
again in two or three weeks, by the end of which period he was quite
sure they would have enough of tramping.Frank and Barney were making the journey from Gibson's Gap to Cranston's
Cove, which was said to be a distance of twelve miles, but they were
willing to admit that those mountain miles were most disgustingly long.They had paused to rest, midway in the afternoon, where the road curved
around a spur of the mountain.Below them opened a vista of valleys and
"coves," hemmed in by wild, turbulent-appearing masses of mountains,
some of which were barren and bleak, seamed with black chasms, above
which threateningly hung grimly beetling crags, and some of which were
robed in dense wildernesses of pine, veiling their faces, keeping them
thus forever a changeless mystery.From their eyrie position it seemed that they could toss a pebble into
Lost Creek, which wound through the valley below, meandered for miles
amid the ranges, tunneling an unknown channel beneath the rock-ribbed
mountains, and came out again--where?Both boys had been silent and awe-stricken, gazing wonderingly on the
impressive scene and thinking of their adventures in New Orleans and in
Florida, when a faint cry seemed to float upward from the depths of the
valley.They listened, and some moments passed in silence, save for the peeping
cry of a bird in a thicket near at hand.Oi belave it wur imagination, Frankie," said the Irish lad, at
last."I do not think so," declared Frank, with a shake of his head."It was a
human voice, and if we were to shout it might be---- There it is again!"There could be no doubt this time, for they both heard the cry
distinctly."It comes from below," said Frank, quickly."Roight, me lad," nodded Barney."Some wan is in difficulty down there,
and' it's mesilf thot don't moind givin' thim a lift."Getting a firm hold on a scrub bush, Frank leaned out over the verge and
looked down into the valley."Look, Barney--look down there amid those
rocks just below the little waterfall.""She has seen us, and is signaling for us to come down.""Instanter, as they say out West."The boys were soon hurrying down the mountain road, a bend of which
quickly carried them beyond view of the person near the waterfall.It was nearly an hour later when Frank and Barney approached the little
waterfall, having left the road and followed the course of the stream.anxiously asked Barney, who was behind."Can't tell yet," was the reply."Will be able to see in a minute, and
then---- She is there, sure as fate!"In another moment they came out in full view of a girl of eighteen or
nineteen, who was standing facing the waterfall, her back toward a great
rock, a home-made fishing pole at her feet.The girl was dressed in homespun, the skirt being short and reaching
but a little below the knees, and a calico sunbonnet was thrust half off
her head.Frank paused, with a low exclamation of admiration, for the girl made a
most strikingly beautiful picture, and Frank had an eye for beauty.Nearly all the mountain girls the boys had seen were stolid and
flat-appearing, some were tall and lank, but this girl possessed a
figure that seemed perfect in every detail.Her hair was bright auburn, brilliant and rich in tint, the shade that
is highly esteemed in civilization, but is considered a defect by the
mountain folk.Frank thought it the most beautiful hair he had ever
seen.Her eyes were brown and luminous, and the color of health showed through
the tan upon her cheeks.Her parted lips showed white, even teeth, and
the mouth was most delicately shaped.gasped Barney, at Frank's shoulder."Phwat have we struck, Oi
dunno?"Then the girl cried, her voice full of impatience:

"You-uns has shorely been long enough in gittin' har!"Frank staggered a bit, for he had scarcely expected to hear the uncouth
mountain dialect from such lips as those but he quickly recovered,
lifted his hat with the greatest gallantry, and said:

"I assure you, miss, that we came as swiftly as we could."Ef you-uns had been maounting boys, you'd been har in
less'n half ther time.""I presume that is true; but, you see, we did not know the shortest way,
and we were not sure you wanted us.""Wal, what did you 'low I whooped at ye fur ef I didn't want ye?I
nighly split my throat a-hollerin' at ye before ye h'ard me at all."Frank was growing more and more dismayed, for he had never before met a
strange girl who was quite like this, and he knew not what to say."Now that we have arrived," he bowed, "we shall be happy to be of any
possible service to you.""Dunno ez I want ye now," she returned, with a toss of her head.gurgled Barney, at Frank's ear."It's a doaisy she is,
me b'y!"Frank resolved to take another tack, and so he advanced, saying boldly
and resolutely:

"Now that you have called us down here, I don't see how you are going to
get rid of us.You want something of us, and we'll not leave you till we
find out what it is."The girl did not appear in the least alarmed.Instead of that, she
laughed, and that laugh was like the ripple of falling water."Wal, now you're talkin'!"she cried, with something like a flash of
admiration."Mebbe you-uns has got some backbone arter all."I have not looked at mine for so long that I am not sure what condition
it is in, but I know I have one.""Then move this rock har that hez caught my foot an' holds it.That's
what I wanted o' you-uns."She lifted her skirt a bit, and, for the first time, they saw that her
ankle had been caught between two large rocks, where she was held fast."Kinder slomped in thar when I war fishin'," she explained, "an' ther
big rock dropped over thar an' cotched me fast when I tried ter pull
out.That war nigh two hour ago, 'cordin' ter ther sun.""And you have been standing like that ever since?"cried Frank, in
dismay."Lively, Barney--get hold here!we must have her
out of that in a hurry!""Thot's phwat we will, ur we'll turrun th' ould mountain over!"shouted
the Irish lad, as he flew to the aid of his friend.The girl looked surprised and pleased, and then she said:

"You-uns ain't goin' ter move that rock so easy, fer it's hefty.""But your ankle--it must have crushed your ankle."Ye see it couldn't pinch harder ef it tried, fer them rocks
ain't built so they kin git nigher together; but it's jest made a
reg'ler trap so I can't pull my foot out."It was no easy thing for the boys to get hold of the rock in a way to
exert their strength, but they finally succeeded, and then Frank gave
the word, and they strained to move it.It started reluctantly, as if
loath to give up its fair captive, but they moved it more and more, and
she was able to draw her foot out.Then, when she was free, they let go,
and the rock fell back with a grating crash against the other."You-uns have done purty fair fer boys," said the girl, with a saucy
twinkle in her brown eyes."S'pose I'll have ter thank ye, fer I mought
a stood har consider'bul longer ef 'tadn't bin fer ye.an' whar be ye goin'?"Frank introduced himself, and then presented Barney, after which he
explained how they happened to be in the Great Smoky Mountains.She watched him closely as he spoke, noting every expression, as if a
sudden suspicion had come upon her, and she was trying to settle a doubt
in her mind.When Frank had finished, the girl said:

"Never heard o' two boys from ther big cities 'way off yander comin' har
ter tromp through ther maountings jest fer ther fun o' seein' ther
scenery an' ther folks.I s'pose we're kinder curi's 'pearin' critters
ter city folks, an' you-uns may be har ter cotch one o' us an' put us in
a cage fer exhibition."She uttered the words in a way that brought a flush to Frank's cheeks,
and he hastened to protest, halting in confusion when he tried to speak
her name, which he did not know as yet.A ripple of sunshine seemed to break over her face, and she laughed
outright, swiftly saying:

"Don't you-uns mind me.I'm p'izen rough, but I don't mean half I say.I
kin see you is honest an' squar, though somebody else mought think by
yer way that ye warn't.My name's Kate Kenyon, an' I live down toward
ther cove.I don't feel like fishin' arter this, an' ef you-uns is goin'
that way, I'll go 'long with ye."She picked up her pole, hooked up the line, and prepared to accompany
them.They were pleased to have her as a companion.Indeed, Frank was more
than pleased, for he saw in this girl a singular character.Illiterate
though she seemed, she was pretty, vivacious, and so bright that it was
plain education and refinement would make her most fascinating and
brilliant.The boys did not get to Cranston's Cove that night, for Kate Kenyon
invited them to stop and take supper at her home, and they did so.Kate's home was much like the rough cabins of other mountain folks,
except that flowering vines had been trained to run up the sides and
over the door, while two large bushes were loaded with roses in front of
the house.Kate's mother was in the doorway as they approached.She was a tall,
angular woman, with a stolid, expressionless face."Har, mammy, is some fellers I brung ter see ye," said this girl.Merriwell, an' that un is Mr.The boys lifted their hats, and bowed to the woman as if she were a
society queen."What be you-uns doin' 'round these parts?"Frank explained, seeing a look of suspicion and distrust deepening in
her face as he spoke."An' what do you-uns want o'
me?""Your daughter invited us to call and take supper," said Frank, coolly."I ain't uster cookin' flip-flaps fer city chaps, an' I don't b'lieve
you kin eat the kind o' fodder we-uns is uster."The boys hastened to assure her that they would be delighted to eat the
plainest of food, and their eagerness brought a merry laugh from the
lips of the girl."You-uns is consid'ble amusin'," she said.I
asked 'em to come, mammy.It's no more'n fair pay fer what they done fer
me."Then she explained how she had been caught and held by the rocks, and
how the boys had seen her from the mountain road and come to her
rescue.The mother's face did not soften a bit as she listened, but, when Kate
had finished, she said:

"They're yore comp'ny.So the boys were asked into the cabin, and Kate herself prepared supper.It was a plain meal, but Frank noticed that everything looked neat and
clean about the house, and both lads relished the coarse food.Indeed,
Barney afterward declared that the corn bread was better than the finest
cake he had ever tasted.Frank was particularly happy at the table, and the merry stories he told
kept Kate laughing, and, once or twice, brought a grim smile to the face
of the woman.After supper they went out in front of the cabin, where they could look
up at the wild mass of mountains, the peaks of which were illumined by
the rays of the setting sun.Kenyon filled and lighted a cob pipe.She sat and puffed away,
staring straight ahead in a blank manner.Just how it happened Frank himself could not have told, but Barney fell
to talking to the woman in his whimsical way, while Frank and Kate
wandered away a short distance, and sat on some stones which had been
arranged as a bench in a little nook near Lost Creek.From this position
they could hear Barney's rich brogue and jolly laugh as he recounted
some amusing yarn, and, when the wind was right, a smell of the black
pipe would be wafted to them."Do you know," said Frank, "this spot is so wild and picturesque that it
fascinates me.I should like to stop here two or three days and rest.""Better not," said the girl, shortly."Wal, it mought not be healthy.""I wonder ef you air so ignerent, or be you jest makin' it?""Honestly and truly, I do not understand you.""Wal, I kinder 'low you-uns is all right, but thar's others might not
think so.S'pose you know what moonshine is?""Yes; it is illicitly distilled whiskey."Wal, ther revenues say thar's moonshine made round these
parts.They come round ev'ry little while to spy an' cotch ther folks
that makes it.""By revenues you mean the officers of the government?""Wal, they may be officers, but they're a difrrunt kind than Jock
Hawkins.""He's ther sheriff down to ther cove.Jock Hawkins knows better'n to
come snoopin' 'round, an' he's down on revenues ther same as ther rest
o' us is.""Then you do not like the revenue officers?"cried the girl, starting up, her eyes seeming to blaze in
the dusky twilight."I hate 'em wuss'n pizen!An' I've got good cause
fer hatin' 'em."The boy saw he had touched a tender spot, and he would have turned the
conversation in another channel, but she was started, and she went on
swiftly:

"What right has ther gover'ment to take away anybody's honest means o'
earnin' a livin'?What right has ther gover'ment to send spies up har
ter peek an' pry an' report on a man as is makin' a little moonshine ter
sell that he may be able ter git bread an' drink fer his fam'ly?What
right has ther gover'ment ter make outlaws an' crim'nals o' men as
wouldn't steal a cent that didn't b'long ter them if they was starvin'?"Frank knew well enough the feeling of most mountain folks toward the
revenue officers, and he knew it was a useless task to attempt to show
them where they were in the wrong."Yes, I has good right to hate ther revenues, an' I do!Didn't they
pester my pore old daddy fer makin' moonshine!Didn't they hunt him
through ther maountings fer weeks, an' keep him hidin' like a dog!An'
didn't they git him cornered at last in Bent Coin's old cabin, an' when
he refused ter come out an' surrender, an' kep' 'em off with his gun,
didn't they shoot him so he died three days arter in my arms!Wal, I've got good reason ter hate 'em!"Kate was wildly excited, although she held her voice down, as if she did
not wish her mother to hear what she was saying.Frank was sitting so
near that he felt her arm quivering against his."I has more than that to hate 'em fer!Whar is my brother Rufe, ther best boy that ever drored a breath?Ther
revenues come fer him, an' they got him.Thar war a trial, an' they
proved ez he'd been consarned in makin' moonshine.He war convicted, an'
he's servin' his time.Wal, thar's nuthin' I hate wuss on this
earth!""You have had hard luck," said Frank, by way of saying something."It's
lucky for us that we're not revenues.""Yer right thar," she nodded."I didn't know but ye war at first, but I
changed my mind later.""Wal, ye're young, an' you-uns both has honest faces."I don't suppose they have been able to check the making of
moonshine--that is, not to any extent?""He makes more whiskey in a week than all ther others in this region
afore him made in a month.""He must be smarter than the others before him.""Wal, he's not afeared o' ther revenues, an' he's a mystery to ther men
ez works fer him right along.""None o' them has seen his face, an' they don't know Who he is.They
ain't been able to find out."Daniel went back to the garden."Wal, Con Bean war shot through ther shoulder fer follerin' Muriel, an'
Bink Mower got it in ther leg fer ther same trick.""I rather admire this Muriel," laughed Frank."He may be in unlawful
business, but he seems to be a dandy.""He keeps five stills runnin' all ther time, an' he has a way o' gittin'
ther stuff out o' ther maountings an' disposin' of it.But I'm talkin'
too much, as Wade would say.""He's Wade Miller, a partic'lar friend o' our'n sence Rufe war tooken by
ther revenues.Wade has been good to mammy an' me."If I lived near, I might try to bother Wade
somewhat."It was now duskish, but he was so near that
he could see her eyes through the twilight."I dunno what you-uns means," she said, slowly, her voice falling."Wade
would be powerful bad to bother.He's ugly sometimes, an' he's jellus o'
me.""Wal, he's tryin' ter, but I don't jes' snuggle ter him ther way I might
ef I liked him right.Thar's something about him, ez I don't edzac'ly
like.""That makes it rather one-sided, and makes me think all the more that I
should try to bother him if I lived near.Do you know, Miss Kenyon, that
you are an exceptionally pretty girl?""Hair that would make you the envy of a society belle.It is the
handsomest hair I ever saw.""Now you're makin' fun o' me, an' I don't like that."She drew away as if offended, and he leaned toward her, eager to
convince her of his sincerity."Indeed, I am doing nothing of the sort," he protested."The moment I
saw you to-day I was struck by the beauty of your hair.But that is not
the only beautiful feature about you, Miss Kenyon.Your mouth is a
perfect Cupid's bow, and your teeth are like pearls, while you have a
figure that is graceful and exquisite.""Never nobody talked to me like that afore," she murmured."Round har
they jes' say, 'Kate, you'd be a rippin' good looker ef it warn't fer
that red hair o' yourn.'An' they've said it so much that I've come to
hate my hair wuss'n pizen."Her hand found his, and they were sitting very near together."I took to you up by ther fall ter-day," she went on, in a low tone."Now, don't you git skeered, fer I'm not goin' to be foolish, an' I know
I'm not book-learned an' refined, same ez your city gals.We kin be
friends, can't we?"Frank had begun to regret his openly expressed admiration, but now he
said:

"To be sure we can be friends, Miss Kenyon.""I am sure I shall esteem your friendship very highly.""Wall, partic'ler friends don't call each other miss an' mister.I'll
agree ter call you Frank, ef you'll call me Kate.""I am going away to-morrow," he thought.A fierce exclamation close at hand, the cracking of a twig, a heavy
step, and then a panther-like figure leaped out of the dusk, and flung
itself upon Frank.[Illustration: "Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and with
astonishing strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad."(See page
218)]




CHAPTER XL.The attack was so sudden and fierce that the boy was hurled to the
ground before he could make a move to protect himself.A hand fastened on his throat, pinning him fast.The man's knee crushed
into his stomach, depriving him of breath.The man's other hand snatched
out something, and lifted it aloft.A knife was poised above Frank's heart, and in another moment the blade
would have been buried to the hilt in the lad's bosom.Without uttering a sound, Kate Kenyon grasped the wrist of the
murderous-minded man, gave it a wrench with all her strength, which was
not slight, and forced him to drop the knife."You don't murder anybody, Wade Miller!""I'll choke ther life outen him!"snarled the fellow, as he tried to
fasten both hands on Frank's throat.By this time the boy had recovered from the surprise and shock, and he
was ready to fight for his life.Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and, with astonishing
strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad.In the twinkling of an eye, Frank came to his feet, and he was ready for
a new assault.Snarling and growling like a mad dog, the man scrambled up and lunged
toward the boy, trying to grasp him.Frank was a skillful boxer, and now his skill came into play, for he
dodged under the man's right arm, whirled like a cat, and struck the
fellow behind the ear.sounded the blow, sending the assailant staggering, and Frank
followed it up by leaping after him and striking him again, the second
blow having the force of the lad's strength and the weight of his body.It seemed that the man was literally knocked "spinning," and he did not
stop till he landed in the creek."Wal," exclaimed the girl, "I 'low you kin take keer o' yerself now!""I rather think so," came coolly from the boy."He caught me foul, and I
did not have a show at first."It was a case of jealousy, and he had aroused the worst
passions of the man who admired Kate Kenyon.Miller came scrambling and
snorting from the water, and Barney Mulloy rushed toward the spot,
crying:

"Pwhat's th' row, Frankie, me b'y?Do ye nade inny av me hilp?"So far, I am all right, thanks to Miss Kenyon."breathed the mountain maid, in sincere admiration."I didn't s'pose city chaps knowed how ter fight.""Some do," laughed Frank, keeping his eyes on Miller.panted the man, springing toward Frank, and then
halting suddenly, and throwing up his hand.Frank knew this well enough, and he was expecting just such a move, so
it happened that the words had scarcely left the girl's lips when the
revolver was sent flying from Wade Miller's hand.The boy had leaped forward, and, with one skillful kick, disarmed his
foe by knocking the weapon out of his hand.Miller seemed dazed for a moment, and then he started for Frank, once
more grinding his teeth."Oh, let me take a hand in this!"cried Barney Mulloy, who was eager for
a fight."Me blud is gittin' shtagnant.""Well, you have tried that trick twice, but I do not see that you have
succeeded to any great extent.""I'll hammer yer life out o' yer carcass with my bare hands!""Possibly that will not be such a very easy trick to do."The boy's coolness seemed to add to the fury of his assailant, and the
man made another rush, which was easily avoided by Frank, who struck
Miller a stinging blow."You'd better stop, Wade," advised the girl."He-uns is too much fer
you-uns, an' that's plain enough.""Oh, I'll show ye--I'll show ye!"There was no longer any reason in the man's head, and Frank saw that he
must subdue the fellow some way.Miller was determined to grapple with
the boy, and Frank felt that he would find the mountaineer had the
strength of an ox, for which reason he must keep clear of those grasping
hands.For some moments Frank had all he could do to avoid Miller, who seemed
to have grown stolid to the lad's blows.At last, Frank darted in,
caught the man behind, lifted him over one hip, and dashed him headlong
to the ground."Wal, that's the beatenest I ever saw!"cried Kate Kenyon, whose
admiration for Frank now knew no bounds."You-uns is jes' a terror!""Whoy, thot's fun fer Frankie," he declared.Miller groaned, and sat up, lifting his hands to his head, and looking
about him in a dazed way."Ye run ag'in' a fighter this time, Wade," said the girl."He done ye,
an' you-uns is ther bully o' these parts!""It was an accident," mumbled the man."I couldn't see ther critter
well, an' so he kinder got----"

"That won't go, Wade," half laughed the girl."He done you fa'r an'
squar', an' it's no us' ter squawk.""An' ye're laffin' 'bout it, be ye, Kate?"Better let him erlone, Wade.You-uns has made fool enough o' yerself.Ye tried ter kill me, an'----"

"What I saw made me do it!""He war makin' love ter ye,
Kate--an' you-uns liked it!""Wal, Wade Miller, what is that ter you-uns?""He has a right ter make love ter me ef he wants ter.""Oh, yes, he has a right, but his throat'll be slit before long, mark
what I say!""Ef anything o' that kind happens, Wade Miller, I'll know who done it,
an' I swa'r I'll never rest till I prove it agin' ye.""I don't keer, Kate," muttered the man, getting on his feet and standing
there sulkily before them."Ef I can't hev ye, I sw'ar no other critter
shall!"I've stood all I kin from you, an' from now on
I don't stan' no more.Arter this you-uns an' me-uns ain't even
friends."He fell back a step, as if he had been struck a blow, and then he
hoarsely returned:

"All right, Kate.I ain't ter be thrown
aside so easy.As fer them city chaps, ther maountings ain't big enough
ter hold them an' me.Wade Miller has some power, an' I wouldn't give a
snap for their lives.The Black Caps don't take ter strangers much, an'
they know them critters is hyar.I'm goin' now, but that don't need ter
mean that I'll stay away fer long."He turned, and, having picked up his revolver, strode away into the
darkness, quickly disappearing.Kate's trembling hand fell on Frank's arm, and she panted into his ear:

"You-uns must git out o' ther maountings quick as you kin, fer Wade
Miller means what he says, an' he'll kill ye ef you stay hyar!"Frank Merriwell's blood was aroused, and he did not feel like letting
Wade Miller drive him like a hunted dog from the mountains."By this time I should think you would have confidence in my ability to
take care of myself against this man Miller," he said, somewhat testily."Yo're ther best fighter I ever saw, but that won't'mount ter anything
agin' ther power Miller will set on yer.He's pop-ler, is Wade Miller,
an' he'll have ther hull maountings ter back him.""I shall not run for Miller and all his friends.Right is right, and I
have as good right here as he."cried Kate, admiringly; "hang me ef I don't like you-uns'
pluck.You may find that you'll need a friend afore yo're done with
Wade.Ef ye do--wal, mebbe Kate Kenyon won't be fur off.""It is a good thing to know I shall have one
friend in the mountains."Kenyon was seen stolidly standing in
the dusk."Mebbe you-uns will find my Kate ther best friend ye could
have.Come, gal, it's time ter g'win."So they entered the cabin, and Barney found an opportunity to whisper to
Frank:

"She's a corker, me b'y!an' Oi think she's shtuck on yez.Kenyon declared she was tired,
and intended to go to bed.She apologized for the bed she had to give
the boys, but they assured her that they were accustomed to sleeping
anywhere, and that the bed would be a positive luxury."Such slick-tongued chaps I never did see before," declared the old
woman."They don't seem stuck up an' lofty, like most city fellers.Really, they make me feel right to home in my own house!"She said this in a whimsical way that surprised Frank, who fancied Mrs.Kate bade them good-night, and they retired, which they were glad to do,
as they were tired from the tramp of the day.Frank was awakened by a sharp shake, and his first thought was of
danger, but his hand did not reach the revolver he had placed beneath
the pillow, for he felt something cold against his temple, and heard a
voice hiss:

"Be easy, you-uns!Ef ye make a jowl, yo're ter be shot!"Barney was awakened at the same time, and the boys found they were in
the clutches of strong men.The little room seemed filled with men, and
the lads instantly realized they were in a bad scrape.Through the small window sifted the white moonlight, showing that every
man wore a black, pointed cap and hood, which reached to his shoulders.In this hood arrangement great holes were cut for the eyes, and some had
slits cut for their mouths.was the thought that flashed through Frank's mind.The revolvers pressed against the heads of the boys kept them from
defending themselves or making an outcry.They were forced to get up and
dress, after which they were passed through the open window, like
bundles, their hands having been tied behind them.Other black-hooded men were outside, and horses were near at hand.But when he thought how tired they had been, he did not wonder that both
had slept soundly while the men slipped into the house by the window,
which had been readily and noiselessly removed.It did not take the men long to get out as they had entered.Then Frank
and Barney were placed on horses, being tied there securely, and the
party was soon ready to move.They rode away, and the horses' feet gave out no sound, which explained
why they had not aroused anybody within the cabin.The hoofs of the animals were muffled.Frank wondered what Kate Kenyon would think when morning came and she
found her guests gone."She will believe we rose in the night, and ran away.I hate to have her
believe me a coward."Then he fell to wondering what the men would do with himself and Barney.They will not dare to do anything more than
run us out of this part of the country."Although he told himself this, he was far from feeling sure that the men
would do nothing else.He had heard of the desperate deeds perpetrated
by the widely known "White Caps," and it was not likely that the Black
Caps were any less desperate and reckless.As they were leaving the vicinity of the cabin, one of the horses
neighed loudly, causing the leader of the party to utter an exclamation
of anger."Ef that 'rousts ther gal, she's li'bul ter be arter us in a hurry," one
of the men observed.The party hurried forward, soon passing from view of the cabin, and
entering the shadow that lay blackly in the depths of the valley.They rode about a mile, and then they came to a halt at a command from
the leader, and Frank noticed with alarm that they had stopped beneath a
large tree, with wide-spreading branches."This looks bad for us, old man," he whispered to Barney."Thot's pwhat it does, Frankie," admitted the Irish lad."Oi fale
throuble coming this way."The horsemen formed a circle about the captives, moving at a signal from
the leader, who did not seem inclined to waste words."Brothers o' ther Black Caps," said the leader, "what is ther fate
we-uns gives ter revenues?"Every man in the circle uttered the word, and they spoke all together."Now, why are we assembled ter-night?""Ter dispose o' spies," chorused the Black Caps.Each one of the black-hooded band extended a hand and pointed straight
at the captive boys."They shall be hanged," solemnly said the men.cried the leader, as if well satisfied.In a moment one of the men brought forth a rope.This was long enough to
serve for both boys, and it was quickly cut in two pieces, while
skillful hands proceeded to form nooses."Frankie," said Barney Mulloy, sadly, "we're done for.""It looks that way," Frank was forced to admit."Oi wouldn't moind so much," said the Irish lad, ruefully, "av we could
kick th' booket foighting fer our loives; but it is a bit harrud ter go
under widout a chance to lift a hand.""That's right," cried Frank, as he strained fiercely at the cords which
held his hands behind his back."It is the death of a criminal, and I
object to it."The leader of the Black Caps rode close to the boys, leaned forward in
his saddle, and hissed in Frank's ear:

"It's my turn now!""We-uns is goin' ter put two revenues
out o' ther way, that's all!""It's murder," cried Frank, in a ringing tone."You know we are not
revenue spies!We can prove that we are what we
claim to be--two boys who are tramping through the mountains for
pleasure.Will you kill us without giving us a chance to prove our
innocence?""It's ther same ol' whine," he said."Ther revenues alwus cry baby when
they're caught.You-uns can't fool us, an' we ain't got time ter waste
with ye.About the boys' necks the fatal ropes were quickly adjusted."If you murder us, you will find you have not
killed two friendless boys.We have friends--powerful friends--who will
follow this matter up--who will investigate it.You will be hunted down
and punished for the crime."Do you-uns think ye're stronger an' more
po'erful than ther United States Gover'ment?Ther United States
loses her spies, an' she can't tell who disposed o' 'em.We won't be
worried by all yore friends."He made another movement, and the rope ends were flung over a limb that
was strong enough to bear both lads.Hope was dying within Frank Merriwell's breast.At last he had reached
the end of his adventurous life, which had been short and turbulent.He
must die here amid these wild mountains, which flung themselves up
against the moonlit sky, and the only friend to be with him at the end
was the faithful friend who must die at his side.Frank's blood ran cold and sluggish in his veins.The spring night had
seemed warm and sweet, filled with the droning of insects; but now there
was a bitter chill in the air, and the white moonlight seemed to take on
a crimson tinge, as of blood.The boy's nature rebelled against the thought of meeting death in such a
manner.It was spring-time amid the mountains; with him it was the
spring-time of life.He had enjoyed the beautiful world, and felt strong
and brave to face anything that might come; but this he had not reckoned
on, and it was something to cause the stoutest heart to shake.Over the eastern mountains, craggy, wild, barren or pine-clad, the
gibbous moon swung higher and higher.The heavens were full of stars,
and every star seemed to be an eye that was watching to witness the
consummation of the tragedy down there in that little valley, through
which Lost Creek flowed on to its unknown destination.The silence was broken by a sound that made every black-hooded man start
and listen.Sweet and mellow and musical, from afar through the peaceful night, came
the clear notes of a bugle.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!A fierce exclamation broke from the lips of the leader of the Black
Caps, and he grated:

"Muriel, by ther livin' gods!Quick, boys--finish this
job, an' git!""If that is Muriel, wait
for him--let him pronounce our fate.He is the chief of you all, and he
shall say if we are revenue spies."You-uns know too much, fer ye've called my name!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!From much nearer, came the sound of the bugle, awakening hundreds of
mellow echoes, which were flung from crag to crag till it seemed that
the mountains were alive with buglers.The clatter of a horse's iron-shod feet could be heard, telling that the
rider was coming like the wind down the valley."Cut free ther feet o' ther pris'ners!"panted the leader of the Black
Caps.Muriel will be here in a few shakes, an' we-uns must
be done.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Through the misty moonlight a coal-black horse, bearing a rider who once
more awakens the clamoring echoes with his bugle, comes tearing at a mad
gallop.repeats Wade Miller, fiercely, as the black-hooded men
seem to hesitate.One of the men utters the command, and his companions hesitate."Muriel is death on revernues," says the one who had spoken, "an' thar
ain't any reason why we-uns shouldn't wait fer him."More than half the men agree with the one who has interrupted the
execution, filling Wade Miller with unutterable rage.snarled the chief ruffian of the party."I am leadin' you-uns
now, an' ye've gotter do ez I say.I order ye ter string them critters
up!"Nearer and nearer came the clattering hoof-beats."Av we can have wan minute more!""Half a minute will do," returned Frank."We refuse ter obey ye now," boldly spoke the man who had commanded his
companions to stop."Muriel has signaled ter us, an' he means fer us ter
wait till he-uns arrives."He snatched out a revolver, pointed it straight at Frank's breast, and
fired!Just as the desperate ruffian was pulling the trigger, the man nearest
him struck up his hand, and the bullet passed through Frank's hat,
knocking it to the ground.Miller was furious as a maniac, but, at this moment, the black horse
and the dashing rider burst in upon the scene, plunged straight through
the circle, halting at the side of the imperiled lads, the horse being
flung upon its haunches."Wal, what be you-uns doin'?""What work
is this, that I don't know erbout?"Wade Miller cowered before the chief of the
moonshiners, trying to hide the revolver.Muriel's eyes, gleaming through the twin holes of the mask he wore,
found Miller, and the clear voice cried:

"You-uns has been lettin' this critter lead ye inter somethin'!An' it's
fair warnin' I gave him ter keep clear o' meddlin' with my business."The boys gazed at the moonshiner chief in amazement, for Muriel looked
no more than a boy as he sat there on his black horse, and his voice
seemed the voice of a boy instead of that of a man.Yet it was plain
that he governed these desperate ruffians of the mountains with a hand
of iron, and they feared him."We-uns war 'bout ter hang two revernues," explained Miller."How long sence ther gover'ment has
been sendin' boys hyar ter spy on us?""They know what happens ter ther men they send," muttered Miller."Wal, 'tain't like they'd be sendin' boys arter men failed.""That's ther way they hope ter fool us.""An' how do you know them-uns is revernues?""We jest s'picions it.""An' you-uns war hangin' 'em on s'picion, 'thout lettin' me know?""We never knows whar ter find ye, Muriel.""That is nary excuse, fer ef you-uns had held them-uns a day I'd knowed
it.It looks like you-uns war in a monstr'us hurry.""It war he-uns," declared one of the black hoods, pointing to Miller."We don't gener'ly waste much time in dinkerin' 'roun' with anybody
we-uns thinks is revernues," said Miller."Wal, we ain't got ther record o' killin' innercent boys, an' we don't
begin now.Two men hastened to obey the order, while Miller sat and grated his
teeth.As this was being done, Muriel asked:

"What war you-uns doin' with that revolver when I come?I heard ye
shoot, an' I saw ther flash.Miller stammered and stuttered till Muriel repeated the question, his
voice cold and hard, despite its boyish caliber."Wal," said Wade, reluctantly, "I'll have ter tell yer.I shot at
he-uns," and he pointed at Frank."I thought so," was all Muriel said.When the ropes were removed from the necks of the boys, Muriel directed
that their feet be tied again, and their eyes blindfolded.These orders were attended to with great swiftness, and then the
moonshiner chief said:

"Follow!"Out they rode from beneath the tree, and away through the misty
moonlight.Frank and Barney could not see, but they felt well satisfied with their
lot, for they had been saved from death for the time being, and,
somehow, they felt that Muriel did not mean to harm them."Frank," whispered Barney, "are yez there?""Here," replied Frank, close at hand."It's dead lucky we are to be livin', me b'y."I feel like singing a song of praise and
thanksgiving.But we're not out of the woods yet.""Thot Muriel is a dandy, Frankie!Oi'm shtuck on his stoyle."I wonder how he happened to appear at such an
opportune moment?""Nivver a bit do Oi know, but it's moighty lucky fer us thot he did."Frank fell to speculating over the providential appearance of the
moonshiner chief.It was plain that Muriel must have known that
something was happening, and he had signaled with the bugle to the Black
Caps.In all probability, other executions had taken place beneath that
very tree, for the young chief came there direct, without hesitation.For nearly an hour they seemed to ride through the night, and then they
halted.The boys were removed from the horses and compelled to march
into some kind of a building.After some moments, their hands were freed, and, tearing away the
blindfolds, they found themselves in a low, square room, with no
windows, and a single door.With his back to the door, stood Muriel.The light of a swinging oil lamp illumined the room.Muriel leaned gracefully against the door, his arms folded, and his eyes
gleaming where the lamplight shone on them through the twin holes in the
sable mask.The other moonshiners had disappeared, and the boys were alone in that
room with the chief of the mountain desperadoes.There was something strikingly cool and self-reliant in Muriel's
manner--something that caused Frank to think that the fellow, young as
he was, feared nothing on the face of the earth.At the same time there was no air of bravado or insolence about that
graceful pose and the quiet manner in which he was regarding them.Instead of that, the moonshiner was a living interrogation point,
everything about him seeming to speak the question that fell from his
lips."You must know
that we will lie if we are, and so you will hear our denial anyway."Look hyar--she tol' me fair an' squar' that you-uns warn't revernues,
but I dunno how she could tell."Frank fancied that he knew, but he put the question, and Muriel
answered:

"Ther gal that saved yore lives by comin' ter me an' tellin' me ther
boys had taken you outer her mammy's house."She did save our lives, for if you had been one minute
later you would not have arrived in time.Muriel moved uneasily, and he did not seem pleased by Frank's words,
although his face could not be seen.It was some moments before he
spoke, but his voice was strangely cold and hard when he did so."It's well ernough fer you-uns ter remember her, but ye'd best take car'
how ye speak o' her.She's got friends in ther maountings--true
friends."Frank was startled, and he felt the hot blood rush to his face.Then, in
a moment, he cried:

"Friends!Well, she has no truer friends than the boys she saved
to-night!I hope you will not misconstrue our words, Mr.A sound like a smothered laugh came from behind that baffling mask, and
Muriel said:

"Yo're hot-blooded.I war simply warnin' you-uns in advance, that's all.We esteem Miss Kenyon too highly to say
anything that can give a friend of hers just cause to strike against
us.""Wal, city chaps are light o' tongue, an' they're apt ter think that
ev'ry maounting girl is a fool ef she don't have book learnin'.Some
city chaps make their boast how easy they kin'mash' such gals.Anything
like that would count agin' you-uns."Frank was holding himself in check with an effort."It is plain you do not know us, and you have greatly misjudged us.We
are not in the mountains to make'mashes,' and we are not the kind to
boast of our conquests.""Thot's right, me jool!"growled Barney, whose temper was started a bit."An' it's mesilf thot loikes to be suspected av such a thing.It shtirs
me foighting blud."The Irish lad clinched his fist, and felt of his muscle, moving his
forearm up and down, and scowling blackly at the cool chief of
moonshiners, as if longing to thump the fellow.This seemed to amuse Muriel, but still he persisted in further arousing
the lads by saying, insinuatingly:

"I war led ter b'lieve that Kate war ruther interested in you-uns by her
manner.Thar don't no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers
fer nothin'!"Frank bit his lip, and Barney looked blacker than ever.It seemed that
Muriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort, and they were
growing suspicious.Had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued
them that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the
way?The boys were silent, and Muriel forced a laugh."Wal, ye won't talk about that, an' so we'll go onter somethin' else.I
judge you-uns know yo're in a po'erful bad scrape?"exclaimed Barney, feeling of his neck, and
making a wry face, as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection."It is a scrape that you-uns may not be able ter git out of easy,"
Muriel said."I war able ter save yer from bein' hung 'thout any show at
all, but ye're not much better off now.""If you were powerful enough to save us in the first place, you should
be able to get us out of the scrape entirely.""You-uns don't know all about it.Moonshiners have laws an' regulations,
an' even ther leader must stan' by them."Frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that Muriel was
their enemy, after all that had happened.He felt that they must guard
their tongues, for there was no telling what expression the fellow might
distort and turn against them.Seeing neither of the lads was going to speak, Muriel went on:

"Yes, moonshiners have laws and regulations.Ther boys came nigh
breakin' one o' ther laws by hangin' you-uns ter-night 'thout givin' ye
a show.""Then we are to have a fair deal?""Ez fair ez anybody gits," assured Muriel, tossing back a lock of his
coal-black hair, which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his
coat."Ain't that all ye kin ask?"That depends on what kind of a deal it is.""Wall, ye'll be given yore choice."If it is proven that we are revenue spies,
we'll have to take our medicine.But if it is not proven, we demand
immediate release.""Take my advice; don't demand anything o' ther Black Caps.Ther more ye
demand, ther less ye git.""We have a right to demand a fair deal.""Right don't count in this case; it is might that holds ther fort.You-uns stirred up a tiger ag'in' ye when you made Wade Miller mad.It's
a slim show that ye escape ef we-uns lets yer go instanter.He'd foller
yer, an' he'd finish yer somewhar."We have taken care of ourselves so
far, and we think we can continue to do so.All we ask is that we be set
at liberty and given our weapons.""An' ye'd be found with yer throats cut within ten miles o' hyar.""Wal, 'cordin' to our rules, ye can't be released onless ther vote ur
ther card sez so.""Wal, it's like this: Ef it's put ter vote, one black bean condemns
you-uns ter death, an' ev'ry man votes black ur white, as he chooses.I
don't judge you-uns care ter take yer chances that way?""Oi sh'u'd soay not!Ixchuse us from thot, me hearty!""There would be one
vote against us--one black bean thrown, at least.""Pwhat av th' carruds?""Two men will be chosen, one ter hold a pack o' cards, and one to draw a
card from them.Ef ther card is red, it lets you-uns off, fer it means
life; ef it is black, it cooks yer, fer it means death."The boys were silent, dumfounded, appalled.Muriel stood watching them, and Frank fancied that his eyes were
gleaming with satisfaction.The boy began to believe he had mistaken the
character of this astonishing youth; Muriel might be even worse than his
older companions, for he might be one who delighted in torturing his
victims.Frank threw back his head, defiance and scorn written on his handsome
face."It is a clean case of murder, at best!"he cried, his voice ringing out
clearly."We deserve a fair trial--we demand it!""Wal," drawled the boy moonshiner, "I warned you-uns that ther more yer
demanded, ther less yer got."We're in fur it, Frankie, me b'y!""If we had our revolvers, we'd give them a stiff fight for it!""They would not murder us till a few of them had eaten
lead!""You-uns has stuff, an' when I tell yer that ye'll have ter sta' ter
vote ur take chances with ther cards, I don't judge you'll hesitate."Then, make it the cards," said Frank, hoarsely."That will give us an
even show, if the draw is a fair one.""I'll see ter that," assured Muriel.Without another word, he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room.They heard him bar the door, and then they stood looking into each
other's faces, speechless for a few moments."It's a toss-up, Barney," Frank finally observed."Thot's pwhat it is, an' th' woay our luck is runnin' Oi think it's a
case av heads they win an' tails we lose.""But there is no way out of it."Pwhat do yez think av thot Muriel?""Worse than thot, me b'y--he's a cat's cradle toied in a hundred an'
sivintane knots.""It is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the
worst foe we have in these mountains.""Oi wonder how Kate Kenyon knew where to foind him so quick?"She must have found him in a very short time
after we were taken from the cabin.""An' she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we
wur gone, me b'y.It may have aroused Kate and her
mother, and caused them to investigate.""Loikely thot wur th' case, fer it's not mesilf thot would think she'd
kape shtill an' let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it.""No; I believe her utterly fearless, and it is plain that Wade Miller is
not the only one in love with her.""Mebbe ye're roight, Frankie."The fellow tried to lead me into a trap--tried
to get me to boast of a mash on her.I could see his eyes gleam with
jealousy.In her eagerness to save us--to have him aid her in the
work--she must have led him to suspect that one of us had been making
love to her."Barney whistled a bit, and then he shyly said:

"Oi wunder av wan of us didn't do a bit av thot?""We talked in a friendly manner--in fact, she
promised to be a friend to me.I may have expressed admiration for her
hair, or something of the sort, but I vow I did not make love to her.""Well, me b'y, ye have a thrick av gettin' all th' girruls shtuck on yez
av ye look at thim, so ye didn't nade ter make love.""It's nivver a fault at all, at all, me lad.Oi wish Oi wur built th'
soame woay, but it's litthle oice I cut wid th' girruls.This south av
Oireland brogue thot Oi foind mesilf unable to shake counts against me a
bit, Oi belave.""I should think Miller and Muriel would clash.""It's plain enough that Miller is afraid av Muriel.""And Muriel intends to keep him thus.I fancy it was a good thing for us
that Kate Kenyon suspected Wade Miller of having a hand in our capture,
and told Muriel that we had been carried off by him, for I fancy that is
exactly what happened.Muriel was angry with Miller, and he seized the
opportunity to call the fellow down.But for that, he might not have
made such a hustle to save us.""Thin we should be thankful thot Muriel an' Miller do not love ache
ither."The boys continued to discuss the situation for some time, and then they
fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned.It did not
seem to have a window anywhere, and the single door appeared to be the
only means of entering or leaving the place."There's little show of escaping from this room," said Frank."This wur built to kape iverything safe
thot came in here."A few minutes later there was a sound at the door, and Muriel came in,
with two of the Black Caps at his heels."Ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o' ther cards," said the
boy moonshiner."An' yo're goin' ter have a fair an' squar' deal.""We will have to submit," said Frank, quietly."You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this
room," said Muriel.The men each held the end of a stout rope, and the boys were forced to
submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them.Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say
anything.When their hands were tied, Muriel said:

"Follow."He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily
along at his heels.They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was
lighted by three oil lamps.The room was well filled with the
black-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent
circle, with their backs against the walls.Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched.The door closed,
and Muriel addressed the Black Caps."It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther
cards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only
one objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind.Now we mean ter
have this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out
an' see that it is.Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards
an' one ter draw.Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he
believed one of them was Wade Miller.A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that
told of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men.Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,
should there be any fraud.An awed hush seemed to settle over the room.The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of
them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack.Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was
silent, standing stiff and straight.Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes
in his mask like twin stars.The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller
reached out his hand to draw.Then Frank suddenly cried:

"Wait!That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this
matter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?"Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man
who held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:

"Stop!Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards.He shuffled
them, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel.He
"shook them up" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who
was to hold them.Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless.Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the
draw, holding the fateful card up for all to see.From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man
beheld the black card which was exposed to view.Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no
sound came from his lips.Barney Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve.Indeed, the Irish lad
laughed recklessly as he cried:

"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie.Th' snakes had it
fixed fer us all th' toime."The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a
spring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand.Let's give ther critters a fair
show.""Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?""Not knowin' it," answered Muriel."But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther
same."One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther
nine o' hearts."Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot
into Frank Merriwell's heart.Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be
done with ther spies.""Them boys is goin' ter
have a squar' show."It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check.His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon
Muriel.The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand
of the man who had held them."Release one of the prisoners," was his command."The cards shall be
shuffled again."Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him
to shuffle.He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them
back to Muriel.Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second
drawing."Be careful an' not get two cards this time," warned Muriel as he faced
Miller."This draw settles ther business fer them-uns."The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped
forward to draw.Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the
card that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the
captives stood still.He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against
him.For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a
muttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to
view.Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the
floor.Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath.It was plain that
some were disappointed, and some were well satisfied."They-uns won't be put out o'
ther way ter-night.""An' I claim that it don't," returned the youthful moonshiner, without
lifting his voice in the least."You-uns all agreed ter ther second
draw, an' that lets them off.""But
them critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!""By that yer mean--jes' what?""They're not liable ter git out alive.""Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at
ther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!"Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but
it was plain that he meant every word."Wal," muttered Miller, "what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn
'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?"I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther
maountings.Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'.Ter-morrer night it can be done."He seemed to know it was useless to make further
talk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger.The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly
peril they had passed through, and Muriel nodded in a satisfied way when
he had looked them over."Come," he said, in a low tone, "you-uns will have ter go back ter ther
room whar ye war a bit ago."They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief
that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment.Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys
free."Suspecting you of double-dealing."It seemed that you had saved us from being
hanged, but that you intended to finish us here.""Ef that war my scheme, why did I take ther trouble ter save ye at all?""It looked as if you did so to please Miss Kenyon.You had saved us, and
then, if the men disposed of us in the regular manner, you would not be
to blame."Muriel shook back his long, black hair, and his manner showed that he
was angry.He did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been
doubted."Wal," he said, slowly, "ef it hadn't been fer me you-uns would be gone
<DW53>s now.""You-uns know I saved ye, but ye don't know how I done it."There was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the
youthful moonshiner.He continued:

"I done that fer you I never done before fer no man.I wouldn't a done
it fer myself!""Do you-uns want ter know what I done?""When I snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o' ther man what
drawed it.It war ther ace o' spades, an' it condemned yer ter die."Thar war one card drawed, an' that war all!""That war whar I cheated," he said, simply."I had ther red card in my
hand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed.In that way I
knowed I could give yer two shows ter escape death."The boys were astounded by this revelation, but they did not doubt that
Muriel spoke the truth.His manner showed that he was not telling a
falsehood.And this strange boy--this remarkable leader of moonshiners--had done
such a thing to save them!More than ever, they marveled at the fellow.Once more Muriel's arms were folded over his breast, and he was leaning
gracefully against the door, his eyes watching their faces.For several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and
surprise.Frank was not a little confused, thinking as he did how he had
misunderstood this mysterious youth.It seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two
lads who were utter strangers to him.A sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask, and Muriel
flung out one hand, with an impatient gesture."I know what you-uns is thinkin' of," declared the young moonshiner."Ye
wonder why I done so.Wal, I don't jes' know myself, but I promised Kate
ter do my best fer ye."cried Frank, "kept it nobly!Muriel, you
may be a moonshiner, you may be the leader of the Black Caps, but I am
proud to know you!I believe you are white all the way through!"exclaimed the youth, with a show of satisfaction, "that makes me
feel better.But it war Kate as done it, an' she's ther one ter thank;
but it ain't likely you-uns'll ever see her ag'in.""Then, tell her," said Frank, swiftly, "tell her for us that we are very
thankful--tell her we shall not forget her.He seemed about to speak, and then checked
himself."I'll tell her," nodded Muriel, his voice sounding a bit strange."Is
that all you-uns want me ter tell her?""Tell her I would give much to see her again," came swiftly from Frank's
lips."She's promised to be my friend, and right well has she kept that
promise.""Then I'll have ter leave you-uns now.Breakfast will be brought ter ye, and when another night comes, a guard
will go with yer out o' ther maountings.He held out a hand, and Muriel seemed to hesitate.After a few moments,
the masked lad shook his head, and, without another word, left the room.cried Barney, scratching his head, "thot felly is worse than
Oi thought!Oi don't know so much about him now as Oi did bafore Oi met
him at all, at all!"They made themselves as
comfortable as possible, and talked over the thrilling events of the
night."If Kate Kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a
convict, I should think this Muriel must be her brother," said Frank."Av he's not her brither, it's badly shtuck on her he must be, Oi
dunno," observed Barney."An' av he be shtuck on her, pwhoy don't he git
onter th' collar av thot Miller?"Finally, when they had tired
of talking, the boys lay down and tried to sleep.Frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight
rustling in that very room, and his eyes flew open in a twinkling.He
started up, a cry of wonder surging to his lips, and being smothered
there.Kate Kenyon stood within ten feet of him!As Frank started up, the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips,
warning him to be silent.Frank sprang to his feet, and Barney Mulloy sat up, rubbing his eyes and
beginning to speak."Pwhat's th' matter now, me b'y?Are yez---- Howly shmoke!"Barney clasped both hands over his mouth, having caught the warning
gestures from Frank and the girl.Still the exclamation had escaped his
lips, although it was not uttered loudly.Swiftly Kate Kenyon flitted across the room, listening with her ear to
the door to hear any sound beyond.After some moments, she seemed
satisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had
happened within that room, and she came back, standing close to Frank,
and whispering:

"Ef you-uns will trust me, I judge I kin git yer out o' this scrape."exclaimed Frank, softly, as he caught her hand."We have
you to thank for our lives!Kate--your pardon!--Miss Kenyon, how can we
ever repay you?""Don't stop ter talk 'bout that now," she said, with chilling
roughness."Ef you-uns want ter live, an' yer want ter git erway frum
Wade Miller, git reddy ter foller me.""But how are we to leave this room?She silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner, and they saw that
a small trapdoor was standing open."We kin git out that way," she said.The boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they
examined the place, but there was no time for investigation.Kate Kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening.Pausing beside it, she
pointed downward, saying:

"Go ahead; I'll foller and close ther door."The boys did not hesitate, for they placed perfect confidence in the
girl now.Barney dropped down in advance, and his feet found some rude
stone steps.In a moment he had disappeared, and then Frank followed.As lightly as a fairy, Kate Kenyon dropped through the opening, closing
the door behind her.The boys found themselves in absolute darkness, in some sort of a
narrow, underground place, and there they paused, awaiting their guide.Her hand touched Frank as she slipped past, and he
caught the perfume of wild flowers.To him she was like a beautiful wild
flower growing in a wilderness of weeds.The boys heard the word, and they moved slowly forward through the
darkness, now and then feeling dank walls on either hand.For a considerable distance they went on in this way, and then the
passage seemed to widen out, and they felt that they had entered a cave."Keep close ter me," directed the girl.Now you-uns can't git astray."At last a strange smell came to their nostrils, seemingly on the wings
of a light breath of air."Ther mill whar ther moonshine is made."Never for a moment did she
hesitate; she seemed to have the eyes of an owl.All at once they heard the sound of gently running water."Lost Creek runs through har," answered the girl.So the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern, and the cave was
near one of the illicit distilleries.Frank cared to know no more, for he did not believe it was healthy to
know too much about the makers of moonshine.It was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave.They saw
the opening before them, and then, of a sudden, a dark figure arose
there--the figure of a man with a gun in his hands!FRANK'S SUSPICION.Kate uttered the words, and the boys began to recover from their alarm,
as she did not hesitate in the least.I put him thar ter watch
out while I war in hyar."Of a sudden, Kate struck a match, holding it so the
light shone on her face, and the figure at the mouth of the cave was
seen to wave its hand and vanish."Ther coast is clear," assured the girl."But it's gittin' right nigh
mornin', an' we-uns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light.The boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible.They passed out of the dark cavern into the cool, sweet air of a spring
morning, for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness, and
the birds were twittering from the thickets.The phantom of a moon was in the sky, hanging low down and half-inverted
as if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep
in Lost Creek Valley.The sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air, and
from some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful
watchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring."Thar's somethin' stirrin' at 'Bize Wiley's, ur his dorg wouldn't be
kickin' up all that racket," observed Kate Kenyon."He lives by ther
road that comes over from Bildow's Crossroads.Folks comin' inter ther
maountings from down below travel that way."The boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of
the cave, but they saw nothing of him.He had slipped away into the
bushes which grew thick all around the opening."Come on," said the girl, after seeming strangely interested in the
barking of the dog."We'll git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin.Foller me, an' be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen."Now that they could see her, she led them forward at a swift pace, which
astonished them both.She did not run, but she seemed to skim over the
ground, and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered
some deep, lowland pines.Through this strip of woods she swiftly led them, and they came near to
Lost Creek, where it flowed down in the dismal valley.There they found the ruins of an old mill, the moss-covered water-wheel
forever silent, the roof sagging and falling in, the windows broken out
by mischievous boys, the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted
appearance.The road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown
with weeds.Later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks.Wild
sassafras grew along the roadside."That's whar you-uns must hide ter-day," said Kate, motioning toward the
mill."We are not criminals, nor are we
revenue spies.I do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog.""It's better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion.Ef you-uns'll take my
advice, you'll come inter ther mill thar, an' ye'll keep thar all day,
an' keep mighty quiet.I know ye're nervy, but thar ain't no good in
bein' foolish.It'll be known that you-uns have escaped, an' then Wade
Miller will scour ther country.Ef he come on yer----"

"Give us our arms, and we'll be ready to meet Mr."But yer wouldn't meet him alone; thar'd be others with him, an' you-uns
wouldn't have no sorter show."Kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth,
and they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill.She led them into the mill, which was dank and dismal.The imperfect
light failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet, but
she warned them, and they escaped injury.The miller had lived in the mill, and the girl took them to the part of
the old building that had served as a home."Har," she said, opening a closet door, "I've brung food fer you-uns, so
yer won't starve, an' I knowed ye'd be hongry.""You are more than thoughtful, Miss Kenyon.""Yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other, Frank."She spoke the words in a tone of reproach.Barney turned away, winking uselessly at nothing at all, and kept his
back toward them for some moments.But Frank Merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl
of the mountains.She had promised to be his friend; she had proved
herself his friend, and as no more than a friend did he propose to
accept her.That he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in Kate
Kenyon's breast seemed evident, and the girl was so artless that she
could not conceal her true feelings toward him.They stood there, talking in a low tone, while the morning light stole
in at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room.As he did so a new thought
came to him--a thought that was at first a mere suspicion, which he
scarcely noted at all.This suspicion grew, and he found himself asking:

"Kate, are you sure your brother is still wearing a convict's suit?""You do not know that he is dead--you have not heard of his death?"Her eyes flashed, and a look of pride swept across her face."Folks allus 'lowed Rufe Kenyon wa'n't afeard o' ary two-legged critter
livin', an' they war right."She clutched his arm, beginning to pant, as she asked:

"What makes you say that?I knowed he'd try it some day, but--but, have
you heard anything?The suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye.If Rufe
Kenyon was not at liberty, then he must be right in what he thought."I do not know that your brother has tried to escape.I did think that he might be Muriel, the
moonshiner.""You-uns war plumb mistooken thar," she said, positively."Rufe is not
Muriel.""Then," cried Frank, "you are Muriel yourself!""Have you-uns gone plumb dafty?"asked the girl, in a dazed way."But you are--I am sure of it," said Frank, swiftly.Of course I'm not Muriel; but he's ther best
friend I've got in these maountings."Frank was far from satisfied, but he was too courteous to insist after
this denial.Kate laughed the idea to scorn, saying over and over that
the boy must be "dafty," but still his mind was unchanged.To be sure, there were some things not easily explained, one being how
Muriel concealed her luxurious red hair, for Muriel's hair appeared to
be coal-black.Another thing was that Wade Miller must know Muriel and Kate were one
and the same, and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch
his victims from his maws.Barney Mulloy had been more than astounded by Frank's words; the Irish
youth was struck dumb.When he could collect himself, he softly
muttered:

"Well, av all th' oideas thot takes th' cake!"Having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought
there, Kate said:

"Har is two revolvers fer you-uns.Don't use 'em unless yer have ter,
but shoot ter kill ef you're forced."Oi'm ready fer th' spalpanes!"cried Barney, as he grasped one
of the weapons."Next time Wade Miller and his
gang will not catch us napping.""Roight, me b'y; we'll be sound awake, Frankie."Kate bade them good-by, assuring them that she would return with the
coming of another night, and making them promise to await her, and then
she flitted away, slipped out of the mill, soon vanishing amid the
pines."It's dead lucky we are ter be living, Frankie," observed Barney."I quite agree with you," laughed Merriwell."This night has been a
black and tempestuous one, but we have lived through it, and I do not
believe we'll find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the
Tennessee mountains."They were hungry, and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been
provided for them.When breakfast was over, Barney said:

"Frankie, it's off yer trolley ye git sometoimes.""What do you mean by that, Barney?Oi wur thinkin' av pwhat yez said about Kate Kenyon being
Mooriel, th' moonshoiner.""I was not off my trolley so very much then.""G'wan, me b'y!"You think so, but I have made a study of Muriel and of Kate Kenyon.I
am still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise.""An' Oi say ye're crazy.No girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does,
an' no band av min loike th' moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul
loike Kate Kenyon ter boss thim.""They do not know Muriel is a girl.That is, I am sure the most of them
do not know it--do not dream it.""Thot shows their common sinse, fer Oi don't belave it mesilf.""I may be wrong, but I shall not give it up yet.""Whoy, think pwhat a divvil thot Muriel is!An' th' color av his hair is
black, whoile the girrul's is red.""I have thought of those things, and I have wondered how she concealed
that mass of red hair; still I am satisfied she does it.""Well, it's no use to talk to you at all, at all."However, they did discuss it for some time.Finally they fell to exploring the old mill, and they wandered from one
part to another till they finally came to the place where they had
entered over a sagging plank.They were standing there, just within the
deeper shadow of the mill, when a man came panting and reeling from the
woods, his hat off, his shirt torn open at the throat, great drops of
perspiration standing on his face, a wild, hunted look in his eyes, and
dashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old
mill.Frank clutched Barney, and the boys fell back a step, watching the man,
who was looking back over his shoulder and listening, the perfect
picture of a hunted thing."They're close arter me--ther dogs!"came in a hoarse pant from the
man's lips."But I turned on 'em--I doubled--an' I hope I fooled 'em.It's my last chance, fer I'm dead played, and I'm so nigh starved that
it's all I kin do ter drag one foot arter t'other."He listened again, and then, as if overcome by a sudden fear of being
seen there, he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the
mill.In the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace,
struggling desperately.He tried to hurl Frank to the floor, and he would have succeeded had he
been in his normal condition, for he was a man of great natural
strength; but he was exhausted by flight and hunger, and, in his
weakened condition, the man found his supple antagonist too much for
him.A gasp came from the stranger's lips as he felt the boy give him a
wrestler's trip and fling him heavily to the floor.When he opened his eyes, Frank and
Barney were bending over him."Wal, I done my best," he said, huskily; "but you-uns trapped me at
last.I dunno how yer knew I war comin' har, but ye war on hand ter meet
me.""You have made a mistake," said Frank, in a reassuring tone."We are not
your enemies at all.""We are not your enemies; you are not trapped."The man seemed unable to believe what he heard."Fugitives, like yourself," assured Frank, with a smile.He looked them over, and shook his head.I'm wore ter ther bone--I'm a
wreck!Oh, it's a cursed life I've led sence they dragged me away from
har!Night an' day hev I watched for a chance ter break away, and' I war
quick ter grasp it when it came.They shot at me, an' one o' their
bullets cut my shoulder har.It war a close call, but I got away.Then
they follered, an' they put houn's arter me.Twenty times hev they been
right on me, an' twenty times hev I got erway.But it kep' wearin' me
weaker an' thinner.My last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an'
fight fer me, an' I came har--back home!I tried ter git inter 'Bije
Wileys' this mornin', but his dorg didn't know me, I war so changed, an'
ther hunters war close arter me, so I hed ter run fer it."exclaimed Barney; "we hearrud th' dog barruckin'.""So we did," agreed Frank, remembering how the creature had been
clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak."I kem har," continued the man, weakly."I turned on ther devils, but
when I run in har an' you-uns tackled me, I judged I had struck a trap.""It was no trap, Rufe Kenyon," said Frank, quietly.The hunted man started up and slunk away."An' still ye say you-uns are not my enemies.""No; but we have heard of you.""She saved us from certain death last night, and she brought us here to
hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country.""I judge you-uns is givin' it ter me straight," he said, slowly; "but I
don't jes' understan'."What had moonshiners agin' you-uns?"Well, we are not spies; but we were unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of Wade Miller, and he has sworn to end our lives."cried Rufe, showing his teeth in an ugly manner."An' I
s'pose he's hangin' 'roun' Kate, same as he uster?""He is giving her more or less trouble.""Wal, he won't give her much trouble arter I git at him.I'm goin' ter tell you-uns somethin'.Miller allus pretended
ter be my friend, but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me
an' got me arrested!He done it because I tol' him Kate war too good fer
him.I know it, an' one thing why I wanted ter git free war ter come har
an' fix ther critter so he won't ever bother Kate no more.I hev swore
ter fix him, an' I'll do it ef I live ter meet him face ter face!"He had grown wildly excited, and he sat up, with his back against a
post, his eyes gleaming redly, and a white foam flecking his lips.At
that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog.When Kenyon was calmer, Frank told the story of the adventures which had
befallen the boys since entering Lost Creek Valley.The fugitive
listened quietly, watching them closely with his sunken eyes, and,
having heard all, said:

"I judge you-uns tells ther truth.Ef I kin keep hid till Kate gits
har--till I see her--I'll fix things so you won't be bothered much.Wade
Miller's day in Lost Creek Valley is over."The boys took him up to the living room of the old mill, where they
furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast.He ate like a famished thing, washing the dry bread down with great
swallows of water.When he had finished and his hunger was satisfied, he
was quite like another man.he cried; "now I am reddy fer anything!"And you'll tell me ef thar's danger?"So the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep.He slept soundly
for some hours, and, when he opened his eyes, his sister had her arms
about his neck.He sat up and clasped her in his arms, a look of joy on his face.It is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting.The boys
had left brother and sister alone together, and the two remained thus
for nearly an hour, at the end of which time Rufe knew all that had
happened since he was taken from Lost Creek Valley, and Kate had also
been made aware of the perfidy of Wade Miller."I judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back,"
said Kate, when the four were together."Now looker how I helped
you-uns, an' then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer
Rufe.He found ye har, an' you-uns hev fed him an' watched while he
slept.""An' I hev tol' Kate all about Wade Miller," said the fugitive."That settles him," declared the girl, with a snap."Kate says ther officers think I hev gone on over inter ther next cove,
an' they're arter me, all 'ceptin' two what have been left behind.They'll be back, though, by night.""But you are all right now, for your friends will be on hand by that
time.""Yes; Kate will take word ter Muriel, an' he'll hev ther boys ready ter
fight fer me.Ther officers will find it kinder hot in these parts.""I'd better be goin' now," said the girl."Ther boys oughter know all
about it soon as possible.""That's right," agreed Rufe."This ain't ther best place fer me ter
hide.""No," declared Kate, suddenly; "an' yer mustn't hide har longer, fer
ther officers may come afore night.It
won't do fer ther boys ter go thar, but you kin all right.Ther boys is
best off har, fer ther officers wouldn't hurt 'em."This seemed all right, and it was decided on.Just as they were on the point of descending, Barney gave a cry, caught
Frank by the arm, and drew him toward a window."Phwat do yez think av it
now?"A horseman was coming down the old road that led to the mill.He
bestrode a coal-black horse, and a mask covered his face, while his
long, black hair flowed down on the collar of the coat he wore.He sat
the horse jauntily, riding with a reckless air that seemed to tell of a
daring spirit."An' it's your trate, me lad.""I will treat," said Frank, crestfallen."I am not nearly so smart as I
thought I was."cried Kate, dashing to the window.She did not hesitate to appear in the window and signal to the dashing
young moonshiner, who returned her salute, and motioned for her to come
out."He wants ter see me in er hurry," said the girl."I sent word ter him
by Dummy that ther boys war har, an' that's how he happened ter turn up.Come, Rufe, go out with me.Muriel will be glad to see yer.""And I shall be glad ter see him," declared the escaped convict.Kate bade the boys remain there, telling them she would call them if
they were wanted, and then, with Rufe following, she hurried down the
stairs, and hastened to meet the boy moonshiner, who had halted on the
bank at some distance from the old mill.Watching from the window, Frank and Barney saw her hasten up to Muriel,
saw her speak swiftly, although they could not hear her words, saw
Muriel nod and seem to reply quite as swiftly, and then saw the young
leader of the Black Caps shake her hand in a manner that denoted
pleasure and affection."Ye're a daisy, Frankie, me b'y," snickered Barney Mulloy; "but fer
wance ye wur badly mishtaken.""I was all of that," confessed Frank, as if slightly ashamed."I thought
myself far shrewder than I am."As they watched, they saw Rufe Kenyon suddenly leap up behind Muriel,
and then the doubly burdened horse swung around and went away at a hot
pace, while Kate came flitting back into the mill."The officers are returnin'," she explained."Muriel will take Rufe whar
thar ain't no chance o' their findin' him.You-uns will have ter stay
har.I have brung ye more fodder, an' I judge you'll git along all
right."So she left them hurriedly, being greatly excited over the return of her
brother and his danger.The day passed, and the officers failed to appear in the vicinity of the
mill, although the boys were expecting to see them.When night came Frank and Barney grew impatient, for they were far from
pleased with their lot, but they could do nothing but wait.Two hours after nightfall a form suddenly appeared in the old mill,
rising before the boys like a phantom, although they could not
understand how the fellow came there.In a flash Frank snatched out a revolver and pointed it at the intruder,
crying, sternly:

"Stand still and give an account of yourself!Who are you, and what do
you want?"The figure moved into the range of the window, so that the boys could
see him making strange gestures, pointing to his ears, and pressing his
fingers to his lips."If you don't keep still, I shall shoot.Still the intruder continued to make those strange gestures, pointing to
his ears, and touching his lips.That he saw Frank's revolver glittering
and feared the boy would shoot was evident, but he still remained
silent."Whoy don't th' spalpane spake?""Is it no tongue he has,
Oi dunno?""Perhaps he cannot speak, in which case he is the one Kate calls Dummy.It happened that the sign language of mutes was one of Frank's
accomplishments, he having taken it up during his leisure moments.He
passed the revolver to Barney, saying:

"Keep the fellow covered, while I see if I can talk with him."Frank moved up to the window, held his hands close to the intruder's
face, and spelled:

"You from Kate?"He put up his hands and spelled back:

"Kate send me.Frank interpreted for Barney's benefit, and the Irish lad cried:

"Thin let's be movin'!It's mesilf that's ready ter git out av thase
parruts in a hurry, Oi think."For a moment Frank hesitated about trusting the mute, and then he
decided that it was the best thing to do, and he signaled that they were
ready.Dummy led the way from the mill, crossing by the plank, and plunging
into the pine woods."He sames to be takin' us back th' woay we came, Frankie," said the
Irish lad, in a low tone."He said the horses were waiting for
us.The mute flitted along with surprising silence and speed, and they found
it no easy task to follow and keep close enough to see him.Now and then
he looked back to make sure they were close behind.At last they came to the termination of the pines, and there, in the
deep shadows, they found three horses waiting.Frank felt disappointed, for he wished to see the girl before leaving
the mountains forever.He did not like to go away without touching her
hand again, and expressing his sense of gratitude for the last time.It was his hope that she might join them before they left the mountains.The horses were saddled and bridled, and the boys were about to mount
when a strange, low cry broke from Dummy's lips.There was a sudden stir, and an uprising of dark forms on all sides.Frank tried to snatch out his revolver, but it was too late.He was
seized, disarmed, and crushed to the earth."Did you-uns think ye war goin'
ter escape?Wal, yer didn't know Wade Miller very well.I knowed Kate'd
try ter git yer off, an' all I hed ter do war watch her.I didn't waste
my time runnin' round elsewhar."They were once more in Miller's clutches!He blamed himself for falling
into the trap, and still he could not see how he was to blame.Surely he
had been cautious, but fate was against him.He had escaped Miller
twice; but this was the third time, and he feared that it would prove
disastrous.The hands of the captured boys were tied behind their backs, and then
they were forced to march swiftly along in the midst of the Black Caps
that surrounded them.They were not taken to the cave, but straight to one of the hidden
stills, a little hut that was built against what seemed to be a wall of
solid rock, a great bluff rising against the face of the mountain.Thick
trees concealed the little hut down in the hollow.Some crude candles were lighted, and they saw around them the outfit for
making moonshine whiskey.cried Miller, triumphantly; "you-uns will never go out o' this
place.Ther revernues spotted this still ter-day, but it won't be har
ter-morrer."He made a signal, and the boys were thrown to the floor, where they were
held helpless, while their feet were bound.When this job was finished Miller added:

"No, ther revernues won't find this still ter-morrer, fer it will go up
in smoke.Moonshine is good stuff ter burn, an' we'll see how you-uns
like it."At a word a keg of whiskey was brought to the spot by two men."Let 'em try ther stuff," directed Miller.he's goin' ter fill us up bafore he finishes us!"But that was not the intention of the revengeful man.A plug was knocked from a hole in the end of the keg, and then the
whiskey was poured over the clothing of the boys, wetting them to the
skin.The men did not stop pouring till the clothing of the boys was
thoroughly saturated.said Miller, with a fiendish chuckle, "I reckon you-uns is ready
fer touchin' off, an' ye'll burn like pine knots.Ther way ye'll holler

whiskey-soaked clothing!The flame almost touched Frank's clothing when the boy rolled
over swiftly, thus getting out of the way for the moment.At the same instant the blast of a bugle was heard at the very front of
the hut, and the door fell with a crash, while men poured in by the
opening.rang out a clear voice; "but Muriel!"The boy chief of the Black Caps was there."An' Muriel is not erlone!""Rufe Kenyon is

who had betrayed him.Miller staggered, his face turning pale as if struck a heavy blow, and a
bitter exclamation of fury came through his clinched teeth.roared Kate Kenyon's brother, as a long-bladed knife
glittered in his hand, and he thrust back the sleeve of his shirt till
his arm was bared above the elbow."I swore ter finish yer, Miller; but
I'll give ye a squar' show!Draw yer knife, an' may ther best man win!"With the snarl that might have come from the throat of a savage beast,
Miller snatched out a revolver instead of drawing a knife.he screamed; "but I'll shoot ye plumb through ther
heart!"He fired, and Rufe Kenyon ducked at the same time.There was a scream of pain, and Muriel flung up both hands, dropping
into the arms of the man behind.Rufe Kenyon had dodged the bullet, but the boy chief of the Black Caps
had suffered in his stead.Miller seemed dazed by the result of his shot.The revolver fell from
his hand, and he staggered forward, groaning:

"Kate!--I've killed her!"Rufe Kenyon forgot his foe, dropping on one knee beside the prostrate
figure of Muriel, and swiftly removing the mask.panted her brother, "be ye dead?Her eyes opened, and she faintly said:

"Not dead yit, Rufe."Then the brother shouted:

"Ketch Wade Miller!It seemed that every man in the hut leaped to obey.Miller struggled like a tiger, but he was overpowered and dragged out of
the hut, while Rufe still knelt and examined his sister's wound, which
was in her shoulder.Frank and Barney were freed, and they hastened to render such assistance
as they could in dressing the wound and stanching the flow of blood."You-uns don't think that'll be fatal, do yer?"asked Rufe, with
breathless anxiety."There is no reason why it should," assured Frank."She must be taken
home as soon as possible, and a doctor called.I think she will come
through all right, for all of Miller's bullet."The men were trooping back into the hut.roared Rufe, leaping to his feet."He is out har under a tree," answered one of the men, quietly."Who's watchin' him ter see that he don't git erway?"Why, ther p'izen dog will run fer it!""I don't think he'll run fur."Wal, ter make sure he wouldn't run, we hitched a rope around his neck
an' tied it up ter ther limb o' ther tree.Unless ther rope stretches,
he won't be able ter git his feet down onter ther ground by erbout
eighteen inches."muttered Rufe, with a sad shake of his head."I wanted ter
squar 'counts with ther skunk."Kate Kenyon was taken home, and the bullet was extracted from her
shoulder.The wound, although painful, did not prove at all serious, and
she began to recover in a short time.Frank and Barney lingered until it seemed certain that she would
recover, and then they prepared to take their departure.After all, Frank's suspicion had proved true, and it had been revealed
that Muriel was Kate in disguise.Frank chaffed Barney a great deal about it, and the Irish lad took the
chaffing in a good-natured manner.Rufe Kenyon was hidden by his friends, so that his pursuers were forced
to give over the search for him and depart.One still was raided, but not one of the moonshiners was captured, as
they had received ample warning of their danger.On the evening before Frank and Barney were to depart in the morning,
the boys carried Kate out to the door in an easy-chair, and they sat
down near her.Kenyon sat on the steps and smoked her black pipe, looking as
stolid and indifferent as ever."Kate," said Frank, "when did you have your hair cut short?Where is
that profusion of beautiful hair you wore when we first saw you?""Why, my har war cut more'n a year ago.I had it
made inter a'switch,' and I wore it so nobody'd know I had it cut.""You did that in order that you might wear the black wig when you
personated Muriel?""You could do that easily over your short hair.""Well, you played the part well, and you made a dashing boy.But how
about the Muriel who appeared while you were in the mill with us?""You-uns war so sharp that I judged I'd make yer think ye didn't know
so much ez you thought, an' I fixed it up ter have another person show
up in my place."He is no bigger than I, an' he is a good mimic."It's mesilf thot wur chated, an'
thot's not aisy.""You are a shrewd little girl," declared Frank; "and you are dead lucky
to escape with your life after getting Miller's bullet.But Miller won't
trouble you more."Kenyon rose and went into the hut, while Barney lazily strolled
down to the creek, leaving Frank and Kate alone.Half an hour later, as he was coming back, the Irish lad heard Kate
saying:

"I know I'm igerent, an' I'm not fitten fer any educated man.Still, you
an' I is friends, Frank, an' friends we'll allus be.""Friends we will always be," said Frank, softly.It was not long before our friends left the locality, this time bound
for Oklahoma, Utah and California.What Frank's adventures were in those
places will be told in another volume, entitled, "Frank Merriwell's
Bravery.""We are well out of that," said Frank, as they journeyed away."To tell the whole thruth,

DELAYED THAT SAME AFTERNOON

BEVERLY HOUSE, MAY 18, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The artillery massing in the meadow gives to this view the interest of an
impending tragedy.In the foreground the officers, servants, and orderlies
of the headquarters mess camp are waiting for the command to strike their
tents, pack the wagons, and move on.But at the very time this photograph
was taken they should have been miles away.Grant had issued orders the
day before that should have set these troops in motion.However, the
Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These are some of the men for whom waiting women wept--the ones who never
came back.They belonged to Ewell's Corps, who attacked the Federal lines
so gallantly on May 18th.There may be some who will turn from this
picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

to hide the dreadful work of bullet and shot and shell.No feeling of
bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]

artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

Telegraph Road crosses the North Anna, was "Walk your horses."The wooden
structure was referred to by the military as Chesterfield bridge.Here
Hancock's Corps arrived toward evening of May 23d, and the Confederate
entrenchments, showing in the foreground, were seized by the old "Berry
Brigade."In the heat of the charge the Ninety-third New York carried
their colors to the middle of the bridge, driving off the Confederates
before they could destroy it.When the Federals began crossing next day
they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

after 1862, they continued to supply many delicacies, and luxuries such as
crutches, which did not form part of the regular medical corps
paraphernalia.The effect of their work can be seen here, and also the
appearance of men after the shock of gunshot wounds.All injuries during
the war practically fell under three headings: incised and punctured
wounds, comprising saber cuts, bayonet stabs, and sword thrusts;
miscellaneous, from falls, blows from blunt weapons, and various
accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

operation of a most important function--the "screening" of the army's
movements.The troopers are guarding the evacuation of Port Royal on the
Rappahannock, May 30, 1864.After the reverse to the Union arms at
Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

24th.Thus was completed the passage to the south of the stream of the two
wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The End of the Gray Line at Cold Harbor.Here at the extreme left of the
Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

[Illustration: WHERE TEN THOUSAND FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The battle of Cold Harbor on June 3d was the third tremendous engagement
of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Grant's assault at Cold Harbor was marked by the gallantry of General
Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the
concentrated artillery of the Confederates; they took the position and
held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

April, 1865, City Point, at the juncture of the Appomattox and the James,
was a point of entry and departure for more vessels than any city of the
South including even New Orleans in times of peace.Here landed supplies
that kept an army numbering, with fighting force and supernumeraries,
nearly one hundred and twenty thousand well-supplied, well-fed,
well-contented, and well-munitioned men in the field.This was the
marvelous base--safe from attack, secure from molestation.It was meals
and money that won at Petersburg, the bravery of full stomachs and
warm-clothed bodies against the desperation of starved and shivering
outnumbered men.There is no
need of rehearsing charges, countercharges, mines, and counter-mines.Here
lies the reason--Petersburg had to fall.As we look back with a
retrospective eye on this scene of plenty and abundance, well may the
American heart be proud that only a few miles away were men of their own
blood enduring the hardships that the defenders of Petersburg suffered in
the last campaign of starvation against numbers and plenty.[Illustration: THE FORCES AT LAST JOIN HANDS

infinite relief that Grant saw the advance of the Army of the Potomac
reach this point on June 14th.His last flanking movement was an extremely
hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On the balcony of this little cottage at Graysville, Georgia, stands
General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted
at Dalton.Sherman's cavalry forces under Stoneman and Garrard were not
yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

speaks of the peculiarly depressing effect that the weather had upon his
troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also
General Wagner.[Illustration: FEDERAL ENTRENCHMENTS AT THE FOOT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN

took part in the operations about Marietta and against Kenesaw Mountain in
June and July.The
battery did not go into this campaign without previous experience.It had
already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

until he is actually farther from Atlanta than Sherman's right flank.Who
will reach the Chattahoochee first?There, if anywhere, Johnston must make
his stand; he must hold the fords and ferries, and the fortifications
that, with the wisdom of a far-seeing commander, he has for a long time
been preparing.The rustic work in the photograph, which embowers the
tents of the commanding general and his staff, is the sort of thing that
Civil War soldiers had learned to throw up within an hour after pitching
camp.[Illustration: PALISADES AND _CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE_ GUARDING ATLANTA

keypoints in the Confederate defense, the fort at the head of Marietta
Street, toward which the Federal lines were advancing from the northwest.The old Potter house in the background, once a quiet, handsome country
seat, is now surrounded by bristling fortifications, palisades, and double
lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Johnston's parrying of Sherman's mighty strokes was "a model of defensive
warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A Federal picket post on the lines before Atlanta.This picture was taken
shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.It was Sherman's experienced railroad wreckers that finally drove Hood out
of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows

[Illustration]

BLAIR, OF MISSOURI

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At
Gettysburg, Colonel Cross commanded a brigade, which included the Fifth
New Hampshire, and was killed at the head of it near Devil's Den, on July
2, 1863.LEADERS IN SECURING VOLUNTEERS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN

the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

ramparts, and a surgeon who stood by his side was wounded.These works
were feebly garrisoned, and General Gordon declared in his memoirs that

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]General William Mahone, C. S. A. It was through the promptness and valor
of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Crater, torn by the mine within Elliott's Salient.At dawn of July 30,
1864, the fifty thousand Federal troops waiting to make a charge saw a
great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

stretched for ten miles around Petersburg.Fort Mahone was situated
opposite the Federal Fort Sedgwick at the point where the hostile lines
converged most closely after the battle of the Crater.Owing to the
constant cannonade which it kept up, the Federals named it Fort Damnation,
while Fort Sedgwick, which was no less active in reply, was known to the
Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the
Confederate line, is notable as the point in front of which General John

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a
favorite protection against attack much employed by the Confederates.[Illustration: AN AFTERNOON CONCERT AT THE OFFICERS' QUARTERS, HAREWOOD

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Savannah was better protected by nature from attack by land or water than
any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on

and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

time--fifty-five ships of war, including five ironclads, altogether
carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the

catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

days of buckles and small clothes; it wears an aggrieved and surprised
look, as if wondering why it should have received such buffetings as its
pierced walls, its shattered windows and doorway show.Yet it was more
fortunate than some of its near-by neighbors, which were never again after
the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of
these handsome residences were utterly destroyed, their fixtures shattered
beyond repair; their wainscoting, built when the Commonwealth of Virginia
was ruled over by the representative of King George, was torn from the
walls and, bursting into flames, made a funeral pyre of past comforts and
magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

Federals, returning the compliment, had dubbed "Fort Damnation."Between
the two lines, separated by only fifty yards, sallies and counter-sallies
were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the
other frequently captured the opposing pickets before alarm could be

used by both besiegers and besieged along the lines south of the
Appomattox.Those shown in this picture were in front of the entrenchments

infantry.Not far from here lies the excavation of the Crater.[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON, C. S.To this gallant young Georgia officer, just turned thirty-three at the
time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen

General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William

[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS
RETREATING ARMY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At this railroad point, three miles from the Court House, a Confederate
provision train arrived on the morning of April 8th.The supplies were
being loaded into wagons and ambulances by a detail of about four thousand
men, many of them unarmed, when suddenly a body of Federal cavalry charged
upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

AND WAITING SHIPMENT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Never again to be used by brother against brother, these Confederate guns
captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

horse, _Peach Blossom_, fell and broke its neck in the high jump, at
the Horse Show; Terry came out easier--he broke only his collar-bone.Mattison is the little bounder he always was--a month hasn't changed
him--except for the worse.Colloden is the
same bully fellow; he is disconsolate, now, because he is beginning to
take on flesh.""Danridge is back from the North
Cape, via Paris, with a new drink he calls _The Spasmodic_--it's made
of gin, whiskey, brandy, and absinthe, all in a pint of sarsaparilla.He says it's great--I've not sampled it, but judging from those who
have he is drawing it mild.... Betty Whitridge and Nancy Wellesly have
organized a Sinners Class, prerequisites for membership in which are
that you play Bridge on Sundays and have abstained from church for at
least six months.They filled it the first
morning, and have a waiting list of something over seventy-five....
That is about all I can think of that's new."Croyden asked--with the lingering
desire one has not to be forgot.Macloud shot a questioning glance at him."Beyond the fact that the bankruptcy schedules show you were pretty
hard hit, I've heard no one comment," he said.Elaine Cavendish is sponsor for that report--she says you told
her you were called, suddenly, abroad."Then, after a pause:

"Any one inclined to play the devoted, there?""Plenty inclined--plenty anxious," replied Macloud."I'm looking a bit
that way myself--I may get into the running, since you are out of it,"
he added.Croyden made as though to speak, then bit off the words."Yes, I'm out of it," he said shortly."But you're not out of it--if you find the pirate's treasure.""Wait until I find it--at present, I'm only an 'also ran.'""Who had the field, however, until withdrawn," said Macloud."But things have changed with me, Macloud;
I've had time for thought and meditation.I'm not sure I should go back
to Northumberland, even if the Parmenter jewels are real.Had I stayed
there I suppose I should have taken my chance with the rest, but I'm
becoming doubtful, recently, of giving such hostages to fortune.It's
all right for a woman to marry a rich man, but it is a totally
different proposition for a poor man to marry a rich woman.Even with
the Parmenter treasure, I'd be poor in comparison with Elaine Cavendish
and her millions--and I'm afraid the sweet bells would soon be jangling
out of tune.""Would you condemn the girl to spinsterhood, because there are few men
in Northumberland, or elsewhere, who can match her in wealth?"I mean, only, that the man should be able to support her
according to her condition in life.--In other words, pay all the bills,
without drawing on her fortune.""Those views will never make you the leader of a popular propaganda!"said Macloud, with an amused smile."In fact, you're alone in the
woods."But the views are not irrevocable--I may change, you know.In the meantime, let us go down to Fleet Street and interview Casey.And then, if you're good, I'll take you to call on Miss Carrington.""Come along, man, come
along!"VII

GREENBERRY POINT


There was no trouble with Casey--he had been mighty glad to take them.And, at about noon of the following day, they drew in to the ancient
capital, having made a quick and easy run from Hampton.It was clear, bright October weather, when late summer seems to linger
for very joy of staying, and all nature is in accord.The State House,
where Washington resigned his commission--with its chaste lines and
dignified white dome, when viewed from the Bay (where the monstrosity
of recent years that has been hung on behind, is not visible) stood out
clearly in the sunlight, standing high above the town, which slumbers,
in dignified ease, within its shadow.A few old mansions, up the Spa,
seen before they landed, with the promise of others concealed among the
trees, higher up, told their story of a Past departed--a finished
city."Yonder, sir, on the far side of the Severn--the strip of land which
juts out into the Bay.""First hypothesis, dead as a musket!""There isn't
a house in sight--except the light-house, and it's a bug-light.""No houses--but where are the trees?""It seems
pretty low," he said, to the skipper; "is it ever covered with water?""I think not, sir--the water's just eating it slowly away."Croyden nodded, and faced townward."What is the enormous white stone building, yonder?""The Naval Academy--that's only one of the buildings, sir, Bancroft
Hall.The whole Academy occupies a great stretch of land along the
Severn."They landed at the dock, at the foot of Market Place and inquired the
way to Carvel Hall--that being the hotel advised by Dick.They were
directed up Wayman's alley--one of the numerous three foot
thoroughfares between streets, in which the town abounds--to Prince
George Street, and turning northward on it for a block, past the once
splendid Brice house, now going slowly to decay, they arrived at the
hotel:--the central house of English brick with the wings on either
side, and a modern hotel building tacked on the rear.was Macloud's comment, as they ascended the steps
to the brick terrace and, thence, into the hotel."Isn't this an old
residence?"he inquired of the clerk, behind the desk.It's the William Paca (the Signer) mansion, but it served as
the home of Dorothy Manners in _Richard Carvel_, and hence the name,
sir: Carvel Hall.We've many fine houses here: the Chase House--he
also was a Signer; the Harwood House, said to be one of the most
perfect specimens of Colonial architecture in America; the Scott House,
on the Spa; the Brice House, next door; McDowell Hall, older than any
of them, was gutted by fire last year, but has been restored; the Ogle
mansion--he was Governor in the 1740's, I think.this was the Paris
of America before and during the Revolution.Why, sir, the tonnage of
the Port of Annapolis, in 1770, was greater than the tonnage of the
Port of Baltimore, to-day."What's
happened to it since 1770?""Nothing, sir--that's the trouble, it's progressed backward--and
Baltimore has taken its place.""It's being served now, sir--twelve-thirty to two.""Order a pair of saddle horses, and have them around at one-thirty,
please.""There is no livery connected with the hotel, sir, but I'll do what I
can.There isn't any saddlers for hire, but we will get you a pair of
'Cheney's Best,' sir--they're sometimes ridden.However, you had
better drive, if you will permit me to suggest, sir.""No!--we will try the horses," he said.It had been determined that they should ride for the reasons, as urged
by Macloud, that they could go on horseback where they could not in a
conveyance, and they would be less likely to occasion comment.The
former of which appealed to Croyden, though the latter did not.Macloud had borrowed an extra pair of riding breeches and puttees, from
his friend, and, at the time appointed, the two men passed through the
office.Two <DW64> lads were holding a pair of rawboned nags, that resembled
saddlers about as much as a cigar-store Indian does a sonata.Croyden
looked them over in undisguised disgust."If these are Cheney's Best," he commented, "what in Heaven's name are
his worst?"said Macloud, adjusting the stirrups."Get aboard and leave
the kicking to the horses, they may be better than they look."Straight up to the College green," he replied, pointing; "then one
square to the right to King George Street, and on out it, across
College Creek, to the Marine Barracks.The road forks there; you turn
to the right; and the bridge is at the foot of the hill.""He ought to write a guide book," said Croyden."Well paved
streets,--but a trifle hard for riding.""And more than a trifle dirty," Croyden added."My horse isn't so
bad--how's yours?""He'll do!--This must be the Naval Academy," as they passed along a
high brick wall--"Yonder, are the Barracks--the Marines are drilling in
front."They clattered over the creek, rounded the quarters of the
"Hermaphrodites," and saw below them the wide bridge, almost a half a
mile long, which spans the Severn.The draw was open, to let a motor
boat pass through, but it closed before they reached it.Macloud exclaimed, drawing rein,
midway."Look at the high bluff, on the farther shore, with the view up
the river, on one side, and down the Bay, and clear across on the
other.... Now," as they wound up on the hill, "for the first road to
the right."laughed Croyden, as the road swung
abruptly westward and directly away from Greenberry Point."Let us go a little farther," said Macloud."There must be a way--a
bridle path, if nothing better--and, if we must, we can push straight
through the timber; there doesn't seem to be any fences.You see, it
was rational to ride."as one unexpectedly took off to the right,
among the trees, and bore almost immediately eastward.Presently they were startled by a series of explosions, a short
distance ahead.said Croyden, with mock
seriousness.We must be a mile and more from the Point.It's
some one blasting, I think.""It wasn't sufficiently muffled," Croyden answered.They waited a few moments: hearing no further noises, they proceeded--a
trifle cautiously, however.A little further on, they came upon a wood
cutter."He doesn't appear at all alarmed," Croyden observed."What were the
explosions, a minute ago?""They weren't nothing," said the man, leaning on his axe."The Navy's
got a'speriment house over here.Yer don't
need be skeered.If yer goin' to the station, it's just a little ways,
now," he added, with the country-man's curiosity--which they did not
satisfy.They passed the buildings of the Experiment Station and continued on,
amid pine and dogwood, elms and beeches.They were travelling parallel
with the Severn, and not very distant, as occasional glimpses of blue
water, through the trees, revealed.The
river became plainly visible with the Bay itself shimmering to the
fore.Then the trees ended abruptly, and they came out on Greenberry
Point: a long, flat, triangular-shaped piece of ground, possibly two
hundred yards across the base, and three hundred from base to point."Somewhere near here, possibly just where your horse is standing, is
the treasure," said Macloud.laughed Croyden, "and that appears to be my only chance,
for I can't see a trace of the trees which formed the square.""Remember, you didn't expect to
find things marked off for you."It's amazingly easier than I dared to hope."we can't dig six feet deep over all of forty acres.We
shall have the whole of Annapolis over to help us before we've done a
square of forty feet.""The instructions say: seven hundred and fifty feet
back, from the extreme tip of Greenberry Point, is the quadrangle of
trees.That was in 1720, one hundred and ninety years ago.They must
have been of good size then--hence, they would be of the greater size,
now, or else have disappeared entirely.There isn't a single tree which
could correspond with Parmenter's, closer than four hundred yards, and,
as the point would have been receding rather than gaining, we can
assume, with tolerable certainty, that the beeches have
vanished--either from decay or from wind storms, which must be very
severe over in this exposed land.Hence, must not our first quest be
for some trace of the trees?""That sounds reasonable," said Croyden, "and, if the Point has receded,
which is altogether likely, then we are pretty near the place.""Yes!--if the Point has simply receded, but if it has shifted
laterally, as well, the problem is not so simple.""Let us go out to the Point, and look at the ruins of the light-house.If we can get near enough to ascertain when it was built, it may help
us.Evidently there was none erected here, in Parmenter's time, else
he would not have chosen this place to hide his treasure."But the light-house was a barren yield.It was a crumbling mass of
ruins, lying out in water, possibly fifty feet--the real house was a
bug-light farther out in the Bay."Well, there's no one to see us, so why shouldn't we make a search for
the trees?"He went out on the extreme edge, faced about, and taking a line at
right angles to it, stepped two hundred and fifty paces.He ended in
sand--and, for another fifty paces, sand--sand unrelieved by aught save
some low bushes sparsely scattered here and there."Somewhere hereabout, according to present conditions, the trees should
be," he said."Not very promising," was Croyden's comment."Let us assume that the diagonal lines drawn between the trees
intersect at this point," Macloud continued, producing a compass."Then, one hundred and ten paces North-by-North-East is the place we
seek."He stepped the distance carefully--Croyden following with the
horses--and sunk his heel into the sand beside a clump of wire grass."Here is the old buccaneer's hoard!"[Illustration: HE WENT OUT ON THE EXTREME EDGE, FACED ABOUT, AND STEPPED
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES]

"You dig--I'll hold the horses; your hands are tougher than mine."You mean, you would try to purchase
it?""Yes, as a site for a house, ostensibly.I might buy a lot beginning,
say one hundred and fifty yards back from the Point, and running, at an
even width of two hundred yards, from the Severn to the Bay."If the present owner will sell," appended Croyden--"and if his price
isn't out of all reason.I can't go much expense, you know.""Never mind the expense--that can be arranged.If he will sell, the
rest is easy."And we will share equally, then," said Croyden."I've got more money than I want, let me have
some fun with the excess, Croyden.And this promises more fun than I've
had for a year--hunting a buried treasure, within sight of Maryland's
capital.Moreover, it won't likely be out of reach of your own
pocketbook, this can't be very valuable land.""Let us ride around over the intended site, and prospect--we may
discover something."But, though, they searched for an hour, they were utterly unsuccessful.The four beech trees had disappeared as completely as though they never
were."I'm perfectly confident, however," Macloud remarked as they turned
away toward town, "that somewhere, within the lines of your proposed
lot, lie the Parmenter jewels.Once you have title to
it, you may plow up the whole thing to any depth you please, and no one
may gainsay you.""I'm not so sure," replied Croyden."My knowing that the treasure was
on it when purchased, may make me liable to my grantor for an
accounting.""Yet, I have every reason to believe--the letter is most specific.""Suppose, after you've paid a big price for the land, you don't find
the treasure, could you make him take it back and refund the purchase
money?""No, most assuredly, no," smiled Croyden.You must account for what you find--if you
don't find it, you must keep the land, anyway."It's predicated on the proposition that I have knowingly deceived him
into selling something for nothing.However, I'm not at all clear about
it; and we will buy if we can--and take the chances.But we won't go to
work with a brass band, old man."At the top of the hill, beyond the Severn, there was a road which took
off to the left."This parallels the road by the Marine Barracks, suppose we turn in
here," Macloud said.A little way on, they passed what was evidently a fine hospital, with
the United States flag flying over it.Just beyond, occupying the point
of land where College Creek empties into the Severn, was the Naval
Cemetery."They have the place of interment
exceedingly handy to the hospital.he asked,
indicating a huge dome, hideously ornate with gold and white, that
projected above the trees, some distance ahead."Unless it's a custard-and-cream pudding
for the Midshipmen's supper.I
recollect now: the Government has spent millions in erecting new
Academy buildings; and someone in the Navy remarked, 'If a certain chap
_had_ to kill somebody, he couldn't see why he hadn't selected the
fellow who was responsible for them--his work at Annapolis would have
been ample justification.'Judging from the atrocity to our fore, the
officer didn't overdraw it."They took the road along the officers' quarters on Upshur Row, and came
out the upper gate into King George Street, thereby missing the Chapel
(of the custard-and-cream dome) and all the other Smith buildings."The real estate agent is more
important now."It was the quiet hour when they got back to the hotel, and the clerk
was standing in the doorway, sunning himself."It wasn't bad," returned Croyden."Can you tell me
who owns Greenberry Point?"The Government owns it--they bought it for the Rifle
Range.""Yes, sir!--from the Point clear up to the Experiment Station.""That's the end of the purchase idea!""I thought it was'most
too good to last.""It got punctured very early," Macloud agreed."And the question is, what to do, now?Titles in a small
town are known, particularly, when they're in the United States.However, it's easy to verify--we'll hunt up a real estate
office--they'll know."But when they had dressed, and sought a real estate office, the last
doubt vanished: it confirmed the clerk."If you haven't anything particularly pressing," said Macloud, "I
suggest that we remain here for a few days and consider what is best to
do.""My most pressing business is to find the treasure!"then we're on the job until it's found--if it takes a year or
longer."And when Croyden looked his surprise: "I've nothing to do, old
chap, and one doesn't have the opportunity to go treasure hunting more
than once in a lifetime.Picture our satisfaction when we hear the pick
strike the iron box, and see the lid turned back, and the jewels
coruscating before us.""But what if there isn't any coruscating--that's a good word, old
man--nor any iron box?""Don't be so pessimistic--_think_ we're going to find it, it will help
a lot.""How about if we _don't_ find it?""Then, at least, we'll have had a good time in hunting, and have done
our best to succeed.""It's a new thing to hear old cynical Macloud preaching optimism!"laughed Croyden--"our last talk, in Northumberland, wasn't particularly
in that line, you'll remember.""Our talk in Northumberland had to do with other people and
conditions.This is an adventure, and has to do solely with ourselves.Some difference, my dear Croyden, some difference!What do you say to
an early breakfast to-morrow, and then a walk over to the Point.It's
something like your Eastern Shore to get to, however,--just across the
river by water, but three miles around by the Severn bridge.We can
have the whole day for prospecting.""I'm under your orders," said Croyden."You're in charge of this
expedition."They had been passing numerous naval officers in uniform, some well
set-up, some slouchy."The uniform surely does show up the man for what he is," said Macloud."Look at these two for instance--from the stripes on the sleeves, a
Lieutenant-Commander and a Senior Lieutenant.Did you ever see a real
Bowery tough?--they are in that class, with just enough veneer to
deceive, for an instant.Observe the dignity, the snappy walk, the inherent air
of command.""Isn't it the fault of the system?""Every Congressman
holds a competitive examination in his district; and the appointment
goes to the applicant who wins--be he what he may.For that reason, I
dare say, the Brigade of Midshipmen contains muckers as well as
gentlemen--and officers are but midshipmen of a larger growth."To be a commissioned officer, in
either Army or Navy, ought to attest one's gentle birth.""It raises a presumption in their favor, at least."do you think the two who passed us could hide behind that
presumption longer than the fraction of an instant?"I was accounting for it, not defending it.It's a pity, of course, but that's one of the misfortunes of a Republic
where all men are equal.""Men aren't equal!--they're born to
different social scales, different intellectualities, different
conditions otherwise.For the purpose of suffrage they may, in the
theory of our government, be equal--but we haven't yet demonstrated it.We have included the <DW64>, only
within the living generation--and it's entirely evident, now, we made a
monstrous mistake by doing it.laughed Macloud, as they ascended the steps of the
hotel."For my part, I'm for the Moslem's Paradise and the Houris who
attend the Faithful.And, speaking of houris!--see who's here!"Croyden glanced up--to see Elaine Cavendish and Charlotte Brundage
standing in the doorway.VIII

STOLEN


"This is, truly, a surprise!""Who would ever
have thought of meeting you two in this out-of-the-way place.""From abroad?--I haven't gone," said Croyden.She looked at him steadily a moment--Macloud was talking to Miss
Brundage."I don't know--it's difficult of
adjustment.--What brings you here, may I inquire?""We were in Washington and came over with the Westons to the Officers'
Hop to-night--given for the Secretary of something.He's one of the
Cabinet."Oh, I see," he answered; the relief in his voice would have missed a
less acute ear."To a tea at the Superintendent's, when the Westons join us."I haven't acquired the Washington habit,--yet!""Then go to the dance with us--Colin!"We're not invited--if that cuts any figure."Weston, I've presumed to ask Mr.Croyden to join our party to-night.""The Admiral and I shall be delighted to have them," Mrs.Weston
answered--"Will they also go with us to the tea?Macloud and Croyden accompanied them to the Academy gates, and then
returned to the hotel.In the narrow passage between the news-desk and the office, they
bumped, inadvertently, into two men.There were mutual excuses, and the
men went on.An hour or so later, Macloud, having changed into his evening clothes,
came into Croyden's room and found him down on his knees looking under
the bureau, and swearing vigorously.he said; "you _are_ a true pirate's heir!Old Parmenter,
himself, couldn't do it better."And incidentally searching for this, I suppose?"picking up a pearl
stud from under the bed."And when you've sufficiently recovered your equanimity," Macloud went
on, "you might let me see the aforesaid Parmenter's letter.I want to
cogitate over it."grinding in the stud--"my coat's on the chair,
yonder."exclaimed Croyden, ramming the last stud
home."Where would you think it is--in the small change pocket?""I'll do it with----" He stopped.said Macloud, holding up the coat.Croyden's fingers flew to the breast pocket--empty!to the other
pockets--no wallet!He seized his trousers; then his waistcoat--no
wallet."I had it when we left the Weston party--I felt
it in my pocket, as I bent to tie Miss Cavendish's shoe.""Then, it oughtn't to be difficult to find--it's lost between the
Sampson Gate and the hotel.I'm going out to search, possibly in the
fading light it has not been noticed.You telephone the office--and
then join me, as quickly as you can get into your clothes."He dashed out and down the stairs into the Exchange, passing midway,
with the barest nod, the Weston party, nor pausing to answer the
question Miss Cavendish flung after him.Once on the rear piazza, however, he went slowly down the broad white
steps to the broad brick walk--the electric lights were on, and he
noted, with keen regret, how bright they made it--and thence to the
Sampson Gate.He inquired of the guard stationed there,
and that, too, proving unavailing, left directions for its return, if
found.If any one reads that letter, the jig is up for us....
Here!boys," to a crowd of noisy urchins, sitting on the coping along
the street, "do you want to make a dollar?"The enthusiasm of the response, not to mention its unanimity,
threatened dire disaster to Macloud's toilet.You all can have a chance for
it.I've lost a wallet--a pocketbook--between the gate yonder and the
hotel.A moment later Croyden came down the
walk."I haven't got it," Macloud said, answering his look."I've been over
to the gate and back, and now I've put these gamins to work.They will
find it, if it's to be found."And what's more, there won't
be anything doing here--we shall never find the letter, Macloud.""That's my fear," Macloud admitted."Somebody's _stolen_ it," Croyden answered."Precisely!--do you recall our being jostled by two men in the narrow
corridor of the hotel?Well, then is when I lost my wallet.I wasn't in a position to drop it from my pocket."Macloud's hand sought his own breast pocket and stopped."I forgot to change, when I dressed.Maybe the other fellow made off
with mine.I'll go and investigate--you keep an eye on the boys."He flung them some small coins, thereby precipitating a scramble and a
fight, and they went slowly in."There is just one chance," he continued."Pickpockets usually abstract
the money, instantly, and throw the book and papers away.It may be the case here--they, likely, didn't
examine the letter, just saw it _was_ a letter and went no further.""That won't help us much," said Croyden."It will be found--it's only a
question of the pickpockets or some one else.""But the some one else may be honest."The finder may advertise--may look you up at the hotel--may----"

"May bring it back on a gold salver!"Our only hope is that the thief threw away the letter, and that
no one finds it until after we have the treasure.The man isn't born
who, under the circumstances, will renounce the opportunity for a half
million dollars.""Well, at the worst, we have an even chance!We know the
directions without the letter.Don't be discouraged, old man--we'll win
out, yet."It was sport--an adventure and a problem to work out, nothing
more.Now, if we have some one else to combat, so much greater the
adventure, and more intricate the problem.""Or isn't it well to get
them into it?"If we could jug the thieves quickly, and
recover the plunder, it might be well.On the other hand, they might
disclose the letter to the police or to some pal, or try even to treat
with us, on the threat of publicity.On the whole, I'm inclined to
secrecy--and, if the thieves show up on the Point, to have it out with
them.There are only two, so we shall not be overmatched.Moreover, we
can be sure they will keep it strictly to themselves, if we don't force
their hands by trying to arrest them."We will simply
advertise for the wallets to-morrow, as a bluff--and go to work in
earnest to find the treasure."They had entered the hotel again; in the Exchange, the rocking chair
brigade and the knocker's club were gathered."Why can't a hotel ever be free of
them?""Let's go in to dinner--I'm
hungry."The tall head-waiter received them like a host himself, and conducted
them down the room to a small table.A moment later, the Weston party
came in, with Montecute Mattison in tow, and were shown to one nearby,
with Harvey's most impressive manner.An Admiral is some pumpkins in Annapolis, when he is on the _active_
list.Weston and the young ladies looked over and nodded; Croyden and
Macloud arose and bowed.They saw Miss Cavendish lean toward the
Admiral and say a word."We would be glad to have you join us," said he, with a man's fine
indifference to the fact that their table was, already, scarcely large
enough for five."I am afraid we should crowd you, sir.Thank you!--we'll join you
later, if we may," replied Macloud.A little time after, they heard Mattison's irritating voice, pitched
loud enough to reach them:

"I wonder what Croyden's doing here with Macloud?""I
thought you said, Elaine, that he had skipped for foreign parts, after
the Royster smash, last September."Mattison, I _thought_ he had gone abroad, but I most
assuredly did not say, nor infer, that he had _skipped_, nor connect
his going with Royster's failure!""If you
must say unjust and unkind things, don't make other people responsible
for them, please.Then he shot a look
at his friend."I don't mind," said Croyden."They may think what they please--and
Mattison's venom is sprinkled so indiscriminately it doesn't hurt.They dallied through dinner, and finished at the same time as the
Westons.Croyden walked out with Miss Cavendish."I couldn't help overhearing that remark of Mattison's--the beggar
intended that I should," said he--"and I want to thank you, Elaine, for
your 'come back' at him.""I'm sorry I didn't come back harder," said she."And if you prefer me not to go with you to the Hop to-night don't
hesitate to say so--I'll understand, perfectly.The Westons may have
got a wrong impression----"

"The Westons haven't ridden in the same motor, from Washington to
Annapolis, with Montecute for nothing; but I'll set you straight, never
fear.We are going over in the car--there is room for you both, and
Mrs.It's the fashion to
go early, here, it seems."Zimmerman was swinging his red-coated military band through a dreamy,
sensuous waltz, as they entered the gymnasium, where the Hops, at the
Naval Academy, are held.The bareness of the huge room was gone
entirely--concealed by flags and bunting, which hung in brilliant
festoons from the galleries and the roof.Myriads of variegated lights
flashed back the glitter of epaulet and the gleam of white shoulders,
with, here and there, the black of the civilian looking strangely
incongruous amid the throng that danced itself into a very kaleidoscope
of color.The Secretary was a very ordinary man, who had a place in the Cabinet
as a reward for political deeds done, and to be done.He represented a
State machine, nothing more.Quality, temperament, fitness, poise had
nothing to do with his selection.His wife was his equivalent, though,
superficially, she appeared to better advantage, thanks to a Parisian
modiste with exquisite taste, and her fond husband's bottomless bank
account.Having passed the receiving line, the Westons held a small reception of
their own.The Admiral was still upon the active list, with four years
of service ahead of him.He was to be the next Aide on Personnel, the
knowing ones said, and the orders were being looked for every day.Therefore he was decidedly a personage to tie to--more important even
than the Secretary, himself, who was a mere figurehead in the
Department.And the officers--and their wives, too, if they were
married--crowded around the Westons, fairly walking over one another in
their efforts to be noticed.Croyden asked Miss Cavendish as they joined
the dancing throng.they're hailing the rising sun," she said--and explained:
"They would do the same if he were a mummy or had small-pox.(The watchword, in the Navy, is "grease."From the moment you enter the
Academy, as a plebe, until you have joined the lost souls on the
retired list, you are diligently engaged in greasing every one who
ranks you and in being greased by every one whom you rank.And the more
assiduous and adroit you are at the greasing business, the more
pleasant the life you lead.The man who ranks you can, when placed over
you, make life a burden or a pleasure as his fancy and his disposition
dictate.Consequently the "grease," and the higher the rank the greater
the "grease," and the number of "greasers.")"Well-named!--dirty, smeary, contaminating business," said Croyden."And the best 'greasers' have the best places, I reckon.I prefer the
unadorned garb of the civilian--and independence.I'll permit those
fellows to fight the battles and draw the rewards--they can do both
very well."He did not get another dance with her until well toward the end--and
would not then, if the lieutenant to whom it belonged had not been a
second late--late enough to lose her."We are going back to Washington, in the morning," she said."Much as I'd like to do it.""Are you sure you would like to do it?""Geoffrey!--what is this business which keeps you here--in the East?""Which means, I must not ask, I suppose.""Will you tell me one thing--just one?""Has Royster &
Axtell's failure anything to do with it?""And is it true that you are seriously embarrassed--have lost most of
your fortune?"They danced half the length of the room before he replied.She, alone, deserved to know--and, if she cared, would
understand."I am not, however, in
the least embarrassed--I have no debts.""And is it 'business,' which keeps you?--will you ever come back to
Northumberland?""Yes, it is business that keeps me--important business.Whether or not
I shall return to Northumberland, depends on the outcome of that
business.""Why did you leave without a word of farewell to your friends?""Has any of my friends
cared--sincerely cared?Has any one so much as inquired for me?""They thought you were called to Europe, suddenly," she replied."For which thinking you were responsible, Elaine.""It was because of the failure," she said."You were the largest
creditor--you disappeared--there were queries and rumors--and I thought
it best to tell."On the contrary," he said, "I am very, very grateful to know that some
one thought of me."Another moment, and he might
have said what he knew was folly.Her body close to his, his arm around
her, the splendor of her bared shoulders, the perfume of her hair, the
glory of her face, were overcoming him, were intoxicating his senses,
were drugging him into non-resistance.The spell was broken not an
instant too soon.He shook himself--like a man rousing from dead
sleep--and took her back to their party.The next instant, as she was whirled away by another, she shot him an
alluringly fascinating smile, of intimate camaraderie, of
understanding, which well-nigh put him to sleep again."I would that I might get such a smile," sighed Macloud."She has the same smile for all
her friends, so don't be silly.""Moreover, if it's a different smile, the field is open."Can a man be scratched _after_ he has won?"Croyden retorted, as he turned away to search for his
partner.When the Hop was over, they said good-night at the foot of the stairs,
in the Exchange."We shall see you in the morning, of course--we leave about ten
o'clock," said Miss Cavendish."We shall be gone long before you are awake," answered Croyden.And,
when she looked at him inquiringly, he added: "It's an appointment that
may not be broken.""Well, till Northumberland, then!"But Elaine Cavendish's only reply was a meaning nod and another
fascinating smile.As they entered their own rooms, a little later, Macloud, in the lead,
switched on the lights--and stopped!"Hello!--our wallets, by all that's good!"cried Croyden, springing in, and stumbling over Macloud in
his eagerness.He seized his wallet!--A touch, and the story was told.No need to
investigate--it was as empty as the day it came from the shop, save for
a few visiting cards, and some trifling memoranda."You didn't fancy you would find it?""No, I didn't, but damn!"But the pity is that
won't help us.They've got old Parmenter's letter--and our ready cash
as well; but the cash does not count.""It counts with me," said Croyden."I'm out something over a
hundred--and that's considerable to me now.he asked.... "Thank you!--The
office says, they were found by one of the bell-boys in a garbage can
on King George Street.""If they mean fight, I reckon we can
accommodate them.IX

THE WAY OUT


"I've been thinking," said Croyden, as they footed it across the Severn
bridge, "that, if we knew the year in which the light-house was
erected, we could get the average encroachment of the sea every year,
and, by a little figuring, arrive at where the point was in 1720.It
would be approximate, of course, but it would give us a
start--something more definite than we have now.For all we know
Parmenter's treasure may be a hundred yards out in the Bay.""And if we don't find the date, here," he added, "we
can go to Washington and get it from the Navy Department.An inquiry
from Senator Rickrose will bring what we want, instantly.""At the same time, why shouldn't we get permission to camp on the Point
for a few weeks?""It would make it easy for us to
dig and investigate, and fish and measure, in fact, do whatever we
wished.Having a permit from the Department, would remove all
suspicion."We're fond of the open--with a town convenient!""I know Rickrose well, we can go down this afternoon and see
him.He will be so astonished that we are not seeking a political
favor, he will go to the Secretary himself and make ours a personal
request.Then we will get the necessary camp stuff, and be right on the
job."They had passed the Experiment Station and the Rifle Range, and were
rounding the shoal onto the Point, when the trotting of a rapidly
approaching horse came to them from the rear."Suppose we conceal ourselves, and take a look," suggested Macloud.He pointed to some rocks and bushes that lined the roadway.The next
instant, they had disappeared behind them.A moment more, and the horse and buggy came into view.In it were two
men--of medium size, dressed quietly, with nothing about them to
attract attention, save that the driver had a hook-nose, and the other
was bald, as the removal of his hat, an instant, showed."Yes--I'll bet a hundred on it!""Greenberry Point seems far off," said the driver--"I wonder if we can
have taken the wrong road?""This is the only one we could take," the other answered, "so we must
be right."Cussing himself for----" The rest was lost in the noise of the team.said Croyden, lifting himself from a bed of stones
and vines.And if I had a gun, I'd give the
Coroner a job with both of you.""It would be most effective," he said."But could we carry it off
cleanly?The law is embarrassing if we're detected, you know.""I never was more so," the other answered."I'd shoot those scoundrels
down without a second's hesitation, if I could do it and not be
caught.""However, your idea isn't
half bad; they wouldn't hesitate to do the same to us."They won't hesitate--and, what's more, they have the nerve to
take the chance.They waited until they could no longer hear the horse's hoof-falls nor
the rumble of the wheels.Then they started forward, keeping off the
road and taking a course that afforded the protection of the trees and
undergrowth.Presently, they caught sight of the two men--out in the
open, their heads together, poring over a paper, presumably the
Parmenter letter."It is not as easy finding the treasure, as it was to pick my pocket!""There's the letter--and there are the men who stole
it.And we are helpless to interfere, and they know it.It's about as
aggravating as----" He stopped, for want of a suitable comparison.Hook-nose went on to the Point, and
stood looking at the ruins of the light-house out in the Bay; the other
turned and viewed the trees that were nearest."Much comfort you'll get from either," muttered Croyden.Hook-nose returned, and the two held a prolonged conversation, each of
them gesticulating, now toward the water, and again toward the timber.Finally, one went down to the extreme point and stepped off two hundred
and fifty paces inland.Bald-head pointed to the trees, a hundred yards away, and shook his
head.Then they produced a compass, and ran the
additional distance to the North-east."You'll have to work your brain a bit," Croyden added."The letter's
not all that's needed, thank Heaven!You've stolen the one, but you
can't steal the other."The men, after consulting together, went to the buggy, took out two
picks and shovels, and, returning to the place, fell to work.After a short while, Bald-head threw down his pick and hoisted himself
out of the hole."He's got a glimmer of intelligence, at last," Croyden muttered.The discussion grew more animated, they waved their arms toward the
Bay, and toward the Severn, and toward the land.Hook-nose slammed his
pick up and down to emphasize his argument."They'll be doing the war dance, next!""'When thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,'" Croyden
quoted."_More_ honest men, you mean--the comparative degree.""Life is made up of comparatives," said Croyden.as Bald-head faced about and stalked back to the buggy."He has simply quit digging a hole at random," Macloud said."My Lord,
he's taking a drink!"Bald-head, however, did not return to his companion.Instead, he went
out to the Bay and stood looking across the water toward the bug-light.Then he turned and looked back toward the timber.The land had been driving inward by the
encroachment of the Bay--the beeches had, long since, disappeared, the
victims of the gales which swept the Point.There was no place from
which to start the measurements.Beyond the fact that, somewhere near
by, old Parmenter had buried his treasure, one hundred and ninety years
before, the letter was of no definite use to anyone.From the Point, he retraced his steps leisurely to his companion, who
had continued digging, said something--to which Hook-nose seemingly
made no reply, save by a shovel of sand--and continued directly toward
the timber."I think not--these bushes are ample protection.Lie low.... He's not
coming this way--he's going to inspect the big trees, on our left....
They won't help you, my light-fingered friend; they're not the right
sort."After a time, Bald-head abandoned the search and went back to his
friend.Throwing himself on the ground, he talked vigorously, and,
apparently, to some effect, for, presently, the digging ceased and
Hook-nose began to listen.At length, he tossed the pick and shovel
aside, and lifted himself out of the hole.After a few more
gesticulations, they picked up the tools and returned to the buggy.said Croyden, as they drove away.At the first heavy
undergrowth, they stopped the horse and proceeded carefully to conceal
the tools.This accomplished, they drove off toward the town."I wish we knew," Croyden returned."It might help us--for quite
between ourselves, Macloud, I think we're stumped.""Our first business is to move on Washington and get the permit,"
Macloud returned."Hook-nose and his friend may have the Point, for
to-day; they're not likely to injure it.They were passing the Marine Barracks when Croyden, who had been
pondering over the matter, suddenly broke out:

"We've got to get rid of those two fellows, Colin!""We agree that we dare not have them arrested--they would blow
everything to the police.And the police would either graft us for all
the jewels are worth, or inform the Government.""Yes, but we may have to take the risk--or else divide up with the
thieves."There is another way--except killing them,
which, of course, would be the most effective.Why shouldn't we
imprison them--be our own jailers?"Macloud threw away his cigarette and lit another before he replied,
then he shook his head."Too much risk to ourselves," he said."Somebody would likely be killed
in the operation, with the chances strongly favoring ourselves.I'd
rather shoot them down from ambush, at once.""That may require an explanation to a judge and jury, which would be a
trifle inconvenient.I'd prefer to risk my life in a fight.Then, if it
came to court, our reputation is good, while theirs is in the rogues'
gallery."Think over it, while we're going to
Washington and back; see if you can't find a way out.Either we must
jug them, securely, for a week or two, or we must arrest them.On the
whole, it might be wiser to let them go free--let them make a try for
the treasure, unmolested.When they fail and retire, we can begin.""Your last alternative doesn't sound particularly attractive to me--or
to you, either, I fancy.""This isn't going to be a particularly attractive quest, if we want to
succeed," said Croyden."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways, I
reckon--blood and violence and sudden death.We'll try to play it
without death, however, if our opponents will permit.Such title, as
exists to Parmenter's hoard, is in me, and I am not minded to
relinquish it without a struggle.I wasn't especially keen at the
start, but I'm keen enough, now--and I don't propose to be blocked by
two rogues, if there is a way out.""And the way out, according to your notion, is to be our own jailers,
think you?""Well, we can chew on it--the manner of
procedure is apt to keep us occupied a few hours."They took the next train, on the Electric Line, to Washington, Macloud
having telephoned ahead and made an appointment with Senator
Rickrose--whom, luckily, they found at the Capital--to meet them at the
Metropolitan Club for luncheon.At Fourteenth Street, they changed to a
Connecticut Avenue car, and, dismounting at Seventeenth and dodging a
couple of automobiles, entered the Pompeian brick and granite building,
the home of the Club which has the most representative membership in
the country.Macloud was on the non-resident list, and the door-man, with the memory
for faces which comes from long practice, greeted him, instantly, by
name, though he had not seen him for months.Macloud, Senator Rickrose just came in," he said.He was very tall, with a tendency
to corpulency, which, however, was lost in his great height; very
dignified, and, for one of his service, very young--of immense
influence in the councils of his party, and the absolute dictator in
his own State.Inheriting a superb machine from a "matchless
leader,"--who died in the harness--he had developed it into a well
nigh perfect organization for political control.All power was in his
hands, from the lowest to the highest, he ruled with a sway as absolute
as a despot.His word was the ultimate law--from it an appeal did not
lie.he said to Macloud, dropping a hand on his
shoulder."I haven't seen you for a long time--and, Mr.Croyden, I
think I have met you in Northumberland.I'm glad, indeed, to see you
both."said Macloud, a little later, when they had finished
luncheon."I want to ask a slight favor--not political however--so it
won't have to be endorsed by the organization.""In that event, it is granted before you ask."Have the Secretary of the Navy issue us a permit to camp on Greenberry
Point.""Across the Severn River from Annapolis."Rickrose turned in his chair and glanced over the dining-room.Then he
raised his hand to the head waiter."Has the Secretary of the Navy had luncheon?""Yes, sir--before you came in.""We would better go over to the Department, at once, or we shall miss
him," he said."Chevy Chase is the drawing card, in the afternoon."The reception hour was long passed, but the Secretary was in and would
see Senator Rickrose.He came forward to meet him--a tall, middle-aged,
well-groomed man, with sandy hair, whose principal recommendation for
the post he filled was the fact that he was the largest contributor to
the campaign fund in his State, and his senior senator needed him in
his business, and had refrigerated him into the Cabinet for safe
keeping--that being the only job which insured him from being a
candidate for the Senator's own seat.said Rickrose, "my friends want a permit to camp for
two weeks on Greenberry Point."said the Secretary, vaguely--"that's somewhere out
in San Francisco harbor?""Not the Greenberry Point they mean," the Senator replied."It's down
at Annapolis--across the Severn from the Naval Academy, and forms part
of that command, I presume.It is waste land, unfortified and wind
swept."Why wouldn't the Superintendent give you a
permit?""We didn't think to ask him," said Macloud."We supposed it was
necessary to apply direct to you.""They are not familiar with the customs of the service," explained
Rickrose, "and, as I may run down to see them, just issue the permit to
me and party.The Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee is inspecting
the Point, if you need an excuse."none whatever--however, a duplicate will be forwarded to the
Superintendent.If it should prove incompatible with the interests of
the service," smiling, "he will inform the Department, and we shall
have to revoke it."He rang for his stenographer and dictated the permit.When it came in,
he signed it and passed it over to Rickrose."Anything else I can do for you, Senator?""Not to-day, thank you, Mr.asked Macloud, when they were in
the corridor.Hunting the Parmenter
treasure, with the Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee as a
disinterested spectator, was rather startling, to say the least."The campaign opens next week, and I'm drawn as
a spell-binder in the Pacific States.That figurehead was ruffling his
feathers on you, just to show himself, so I thought I'd comb him down a
bit.If you do, wire me, and
I'll get busy.I've got to go over to the State Department now, so I'll
say good-bye--anything else you want let me know.""Next for a sporting goods shop," said Macloud as they went down the
steps into Pennsylvania Avenue; "for a supply of small arms and
ammunition--and, incidentally, a couple of tents.We can get a few
cooking utensils in Annapolis, but we will take our meals at Carvel
Hall.I think neither of us is quite ready to turn cook.""We can hire a horse and
buggy by the week, and keep them handy--better get a small tent for the
horse, while we're about it."They went to a shop on F Street, where they purchased three tents of
suitable size, two Winchester rifles, and a pair of Colt's military
revolvers with six-and-a-half inch barrels, and the necessary
ammunition.These they directed should be sent to Annapolis
immediately.Cots and blankets could be procured there, with whatever
else was necessary.They were bound up F Street, toward the Electric Station, when Macloud
broke out."If we had another man with us, your imprisonment idea would not be so
difficult--we could bag our game much more easily, and guard them more
securely when we had them.As it is, it's mighty puzzling to
arrange."said Croyden, "but where is the man who is
trustworthy--not to mention willing to take the risk, of being killed
or tried for murder, for someone else's benefit?They're not many like
you, Colin."A man, who was looking listlessly in a window just ahead, turned away.He bore an air of dejection, and his clothes, while well cut, were
beginning to show hard usage and carelessness.Macloud observed--"and on his uppers!""He is down hard, a little money
with a small divide, if successful, will get him.Axtell saw them; he hesitated, whether to speak or to go on.Axtell grasped it, as a drowning man a straw.Mighty kind in one who lost so much
through us.""You were not to blame--Royster's responsible, and he's gone----"

"To hell!""Meanwhile, can I do anything for
you?You're having a run of hard luck, aren't you?"For a moment, Axtell did not answer--he was gulping down his thoughts."I've just ten dollars to my name.I came here
thinking the Congressmen, who made piles through our office, would get
me something, but they gave me the marble stare.I was good enough to
tip them off and do favors for them, but they're not remembering me
now.Do you know where I can get a job?""Yes--I'll give you fifty dollars and board, if you will come with us
for two weeks."Will I take it?--Well, rather!""What you're to do, with Mr.Macloud and myself, we will disclose
later.If, then, you don't care to aid us, we must ask you to keep
silence about it.""I'll do my part, and ask
no questions--and thank you for trusting me.You're the first man since
our failure, who hasn't hit me in the face--don't you think I
appreciate it?"nodding toward
a small bag, which Axtell had in his hand."Then, come along--we're bound for Annapolis, and the car leaves in ten
minutes."X

PIRATE'S GOLD BREEDS PIRATE'S WAYS


That evening, in the seclusion of their apartment at Carvel Hall, they
took Axtell into their confidence--to a certain extent (though, again,
he protested his willingness simply to obey orders).They told him, in
a general way, of Parmenter's bequest, and how Croyden came to be the
legatee--saying nothing of its great value, however--its location, the
loss of the letter the previous evening, the episode of the thieves on
the Point, that morning, and their evident intention to return to the
quest."Now, what we want to know is: are you ready to help us--unaided by the
law--to seize these men and hold them prisoners, while we search for
the treasure?""We may be killed in the attempt, or we
may kill one or both of them, and have to stand trial if detected.If
you don't want to take the risk, you have only to decline--and hold
your tongue."said Axtell, "I don't want you to pay me a
cent--just give me my board and lodging and I'll gladly aid you as long
as necessary.It's a very little thing to do for one who has lost so
much through us.You provide for our defense, if we're apprehended by
the law, and _that_" (snapping his fingers) "for the risk.""We'll shake hands on that, Axtell, if you please," he said; "and, if
we recover what Parmenter buried, you'll not regret it."The following morning saw them down at the Point with the equipage and
other paraphernalia.The men, whom they had brought from Annapolis for
the purpose, pitched the tents under the trees, ditched them, received
their pay, climbed into the wagons and rumbled away to town--puzzled
that anyone should want to camp on Greenberry Point when they had the
price of a hotel, and three square meals a day."It looks pretty good," said Croyden, when the canvases were up and
everything arranged--"and we shan't lack for the beautiful in nature.This is about the prettiest spot I've ever seen, the Chesapeake and the
broad river--the old town and the Academy buildings--the warships at
anchor--the _tout ensemble!_ We may not find the treasure, but, at
least, we've got a fine camp--though, I reckon, it is a bit breezy when
the wind is from the Bay.""I wonder if we should have paid our respects to the Superintendent
before poaching on his preserves?""Hum--hadn't thought of that!""Better go in and show
ourselves to him, this afternoon.He seems to be something of a
personage down here, and we don't want to offend him.These naval
officers, I'm told, are sticklers for dignity and the prerogatives due
their rank.""On that score, we've got some rank
ourselves to uphold."the Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, of the
United States Senate, is with us.According to the regulations, is it
his duty to call _first_ on the Superintendent?--that's the point.""However, the Superintendent has a copy
of the letter, and he will know the ropes.We will wait a day, then, if
he's quiescent, it's up to us.""You should have been a diplomat,
Croyden--nothing less than an Ambassadorship for you, my boy!""A motor boat would be mighty convenient to go back and forth to
Annapolis," he said."Look at the one cutting through the water there,
midway across!"It came nearer, halted a little way off in deep water, and an officer
in uniform swept the tents and them with a glass.Then the boat put
about and went chugging upstream."We didn't seem to please him," remarked Macloud, gazing after the
boat.Suddenly it turned in toward shore and made the landing at the
Experiment Station."We are about to be welcomed or else ordered off--I'll take a bet
either way," said Macloud."Otherwise, they wouldn't have
despatched an officer--it would have been a file of marines instead.You haven't lost the permit, Macloud!"Presently, the officer appeared, walking rapidly down the roadway.As
soon as he sighted the tents, he swung over toward them.Macloud went a
few steps forward to meet him."Senator Rickrose isn't coming until later.I am
one of his friends, Colin Macloud, and this is Mr."The
Superintendent presents his compliments and desires to place himself
and the Academy at your disposal."(He was instructed to add, that
Captain Boswick would pay his respects to-morrow, having been called to
Washington to-day by an unexpected wire, but the absence of the
Chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee rendered it unnecessary.)"Thank Captain Boswick, for Senator Rickrose and us, and tell him we
appreciate his kindness exceedingly," Macloud answered."We're camping
here for a week or so, to try sleeping in the open, under sea air.Then they took several drinks, and the aide departed."So far, we're making delightful progress," said Croyden; "but there
are breakers ahead when Hook-nose and his partner get in the game.Suppose we inspect the premises and see if they have been here in our
absence."They went first to the place where they had seen them conceal the
tools--these were gone; proof that the thieves had paid a second visit
to the Point.But, search as they might, no evidence of work was
disclosed."Not very likely," replied Macloud, "with half a million at stake.They
probably are seeking information; when they have it, we shall see them
back again.""Suppose they bring four or five others to help them?""They won't--never fear!--they're not sharing the treasure with any one
else.Rather, they will knife each other for it.Honor among thieves is
like the Phoenix--it doesn't exist.""If the knifing business were to occur before the finding, it would
help some!""Meantime, I'm going to look at the ruins
of the light-house.I discovered in an almanac I found in the hotel
last night, that the original light-house was erected on Greenberry
Point in 1818.They went out to the extreme edge, and stood gazing across the shoals
toward the ruins."What do you make the distance from the land?""About one hundred yards--but it's very difficult to estimate over
water.It may be two hundred for all I can tell.""It is exactly three hundred and twenty-two feet from the Point to the
near side of the ruins," said Croyden."Why not three hundred and twenty-two and a half feet!""I measured it this morning while you were dawdling over your
breakfast," answered Croyden."Hitched a line to the land and waded out, I suppose.""Not exactly; I measured it on the Government map of the Harbor.It
gives the distance as three hundred and twenty-two feet, in plain
figures.""Now, what's the rest
of the figures--or haven't you worked it out?""The calculation is of value only on the
assumption--which, however, is altogether reasonable--that the
light-house, when erected, stood on the tip of the Point.It is now
three hundred and twenty-two feet in water.Therefore, dividing
ninety-two--the number of years since erection--into three hundred and
twenty-two, gives the average yearly encroachment of the Bay as three
and a half feet.Parmenter buried the casket in 1720, just a hundred
and ninety years ago; so, multiplying a hundred and ninety by three and
a half feet gives six hundred and sixty-five feet.In other words, the
Point, in 1720, projected six hundred and sixty-five feet further out
in the Bay than it does to-day.""Then, with the point moved in six hundred and sixty-five feet
Parmenter's beeches should be only eighty-five feet from the shore
line, instead of seven hundred and fifty!""As the Point from year to year slipped
into the Bay, the fierce gales, which sweep up the Chesapeake,
gradually ate into the timber.It is seventy years, at least, since
Parmenter's beeches went down.""Why shouldn't the Duvals have noticed the encroachment of the Bay, and
made a note of it on the letter?""Probably, because it was so gradual they did not observe it.They,
likely, came to Annapolis only occasionally, and Greenberry Point
seemed unchanged--always the same narrow stretch of sand, with large
trees to landward.""Next let us measure back eighty-five feet," said Croyden, producing a
tape-line.... "There!this is where the beech tree should stand.But
where were the other trees, and where did the two lines drawn from them
intersect?"...said Macloud--"where were the trees, and where
did the lines intersect?You had a compass yesterday, still got
it?"Macloud drew it out and tossed it over."I took the trouble to make a number of diagrams last night, and they
disclosed a peculiar thing.With the location of the first tree fixed,
it matters little where the others were, in determining the direction
of the treasure.The _objective point_ will
change as you change the position of the trees, but the _direction_
will vary scarcely at all.It is self-evident, of course, to those who
understand such things, but it was a valuable find for me.Now, if we
are correct in our assumption, thus far, the treasure is buried----"

He opened the compass, and having brought North under the needle, ran
his eye North-by-North-east.A queer look passed over his face, then he
glanced at Macloud and smiled."The treasure is buried," he repeated--"the treasure is buried--_out in
the Bay_.""Looks as if wading would be a bit difficult," he said dryly.Croyden produced the tape-line again, and they measured to the low
bluff at the water's edge."Two hundred and eighty-two feet to here," he said, "and Parmenter
buried the treasure at three hundred and thirty feet--therefore, it's
forty-eight feet out in the Bay.""Then your supposition is that, since Parmenter's time, the Bay has not
only encroached on the Point, but also has eaten in on the sides.""It's hard to dig in water," Macloud remarked."It's apt to fill in the
hole, you know.""Don't be sarcastic," Croyden retorted."I'm not responsible for the
Bay, nor the Point, nor Parmenter, nor anything else connected with the
fool quest, please remember.""Except the present measurements and the theory on which they're
based," Macloud replied."And as the former seem to be accurate, and
the latter more than reasonable, we'd best act on them.""At least, I am satisfied that the treasure lies either in the Bay, or
close on shore; if so, we have relieved ourselves from digging up the
entire Point.""You have given us a mighty plausible start," said Macloud.as a
buggy emerged from among the timber, circled around, and halted before
the tents."It is Hook-nose back again," said Macloud."Come to pay a social call,
I suppose!"They're safe--I put them under the blankets.""Come to treat with us--to share the treasure."By this time, they had been observed by the men in the buggy who,
immediately, came toward them.said Croyden, and they sauntered
along landward."And make them stop us--don't give the least indication that we know
them," added Macloud.As the buggy neared, Macloud and Croyden glanced carelessly at the
occupants, and were about to pass on, when Hook-nose calmly drew the
horse over in front of them."Which of you men is named Croyden?""Well, you're the man we're lookin' for.Geoffrey is the rest of your
handle, isn't it?""You have the advantage of me," Croyden assured him."Yes, I think I have, in more ways than your name.Where can we have a
little private talk?"said Croyden, stepping quickly around the horse and
continuing on his way--Macloud and Axtell following."If you'd rather have it before your friends, I'm perfectly ready to
accommodate you," said the fellow."I thought, however, you'd rather
keep the little secret.Well, we'll be waiting for you at the tents,
all right, my friend!""Macloud, we are going to bag those fellows right now--and easy, too,"
said Croyden."When we get to the tents, I'll take them into one--and
give them a chance to talk.When you and Axtell have the revolvers,
with one for me, you can join us.They are armed, of course, but only
with small pistols, likely, and you should have the drop on them before
they can draw.Come, at any time--I'll let down the tent flaps on the
plea of secrecy (since they've suggested it), so you can approach with
impunity.""This is where _we_ get killed, Axtell!""I would that I
were in my happy home, or any old place but here.But I've enlisted for
the war, so here goes!If you think it will do any good to pray, we can
just as well wait until you've put up a few.I'm not much in that line,
myself.""I can't," said Macloud."But there seem to be no rules to the game
we're playing, so I wanted to give you the opportunity."As they approached the tents, Hook-nose passed the reins to Bald-head
and got out."Leave it to me, I'll get them together," Croyden answered.... "You
wish to see me, privately?""I wish to see you--it's up to you whether to make it private or not."said Croyden, leading the way toward the tent, which was
pitched a trifle to one side.... "Now, sir, what is it?"as the flaps
dropped behind them."You've a business way about you, which I like----" began Hook-nose."Come to the point--what do
you want?""There's no false starts with you, my friend, are there!"You lost a letter recently----"

"Not at all," Croyden cut in."I had a letter _stolen_--you, I suppose,
are the thief.""I, or my pal--it matters not which," the fellow replied easily."Now,
what we want, is to make some arrangement as to the division of the
treasure, when you've found it.""Well, let me tell you there won't
be any arrangement made with you, alone.You must get your pal here--I
don't agree with one."Oh, very well, I'll have him in, if you wish."Hook-nose went to the front of the tent and raised the flap.he called, "hitch the horse and come in."And Macloud and Axtell heard and understood.While Hook-nose was summoning his partner, Croyden very naturally
retired to the rear of the tent, thus obliging the rogues to keep their
backs to the entrance."I'm glad to make your acquaint----" began Smith."There is no need for an introduction," Croyden interrupted curtly."You're thieves, by profession, and blackmailers, in addition.Get down
to business, if you please!""You're not overly polite, my friend--but we'll pass that by.You're
hell for business, and that's our style.You understand, I see, that
this treasure hunt has got to be kept quiet.If anyone peaches, the
Government's wise and Parmenter's chest is dumped into its strong
box--that is, as much as is left after the officials get their own
flippers out.Now, my idea is for you people to do the searching, and,
when the jewels is found, me and Bill will take half and youn's half.Then we all can knock off work, and live respectable.""Rather a good bargain for you," said Croyden."We supply the
information, do all the work and give up half the spoils--for what,
pray?""For our silence, and an equal share in the information.You have
doubtless forgot that we have the letter now.""Better
half a big loaf than no loaf at all.""I see what's in your mind, all right.But it won't work, and you know
it.You can have us arrested, yes--and lose your plunder.Parmenter's
money belongs to the United States because it's buried in United States
land.A word to the Treasury Department, with the old pirate's letter,
and the jig is up.We'll risk your giving us to the police, my friend!""If you're one to throw away good money, I miss
my guess.""I forgot to say, that as you're fixed so comfortable here, me and Bill
might as well stay with you--it will be more convenient, when you
uncover the chest, you know; in the excitement, you're liable to forget
that we come in for a share."His ears were
primed, and they told him that Macloud and Axtell were coming--"Let us
have them all, so I can decide--I want no afterthoughts.""You've got them all--and very reasonable they are!"Just then, Macloud and Axtell stepped noiselessly into the tent.Something in Croyden's face caused Hook-nose's laugh to end abruptly.He swung sharply around--and faced Macloud's leveled revolver--Axtell's
covered his pal.--Croyden cried--"None of that,
Hook-nose!--make another motion to draw a gun, and we'll scatter your
brains like chickenfeed."His own big revolver was sticking out of
Macloud's pocket."Now, I'll look after you, while my
friends tie up your pal, and the first one to open his head gets a
bullet down his throat.""Hands behind your back, Bald-head," commanded Axtell, briskly.Macloud is wonderfully easy on the trigger.He produced a pair of nippers, and snapped them on."Now, lie down and put your feet together--closer!"Now, I'll do for you," Axtell remarked, turning toward Hook-nose.With Croyden's and Macloud's guns both covering him, the fellow was
quickly secured."With your permission, we will search you," said Croyden."Macloud, if
you will look to Mr.Smith, I'll attend to Hook-nose.We'll give them a
taste of their own medicine.""I don't care to shoot a prisoner, but I'll do
it without hesitation.It's going to be either perfect quiet or
permanent sleep--and you may do the choosing."He slowly went through Hook-nose's clothes--finding a small pistol,
several well-filled wallets, and, in his inside waistcoat pocket, the
Parmenter letter.Macloud did the same for Bald-head."You stole one hundred and seventy-nine dollars from Mr.Macloud and
one hundred and eight from me," said Croyden."You may now have the
privilege of returning it, and the letter.If you make no more trouble,
lie quiet and take your medicine, you'll receive no further harm.If
you're stubborn, we'll either kill you and dump your bodies in the Bay,
or give you up to the police.The latter would be less trouble, for,
without the letter, you can tell your story to the Department, or
whomever else you please--it's your word against ours--and you are
thieves!""How long are you going to hold us prisoners?"asked Bald-head--"till
you find the treasure?"And luck is with you," Hook-nose sneered."At present, it _is_ with us--very much with us, my friend," said
Croyden."You will excuse us, now, we have pressing business,
elsewhere."When they were out of hearing, Macloud said:

"Doesn't our recovery of Parmenter's letter change things very
materially?""It seems to me it does," Croyden answered."Indeed, I think we need
fear the rogues no longer--we can simply have them arrested for the
theft of our wallets, or even release them entirely.""Arrest is preferable," said Macloud."It will obviate all danger of
our being shot at long range, by the beggars.Let us put them where
they're safe, for the time.""But the arrest must not be made here!""We can't
send for the police: if they find them here it would give color to
their story of a treasure on Greenberry Point.""Then Axtell and I will remain on guard, while you go to town and
arrange for their apprehension--say, just as they come off the Severn
bridge."What if they don't cross the Severn--what if they scent our game, and
keep straight on to Baltimore?They can abandon their team, and catch a
Short Line train at a way station.""Then the Baltimore police can round them up.They've lost Parmenter's letter; haven't anything to substantiate their
story.Furthermore, we have a permit for the Chairman of the Naval
Affairs Committee and friends to camp here.I think that, now, we can
afford to ignore them--the recovery of the letter was exceedingly
lucky."said Macloud--"you're the one to be satisfied; it's a
whole heap easier than running a private prison ourselves."Croyden looked the other's horse over carefully, so he could describe
it accurately, then they hitched up their own team and he drove off to
Annapolis."I told the Mayor we had passed two men on
the Severn bridge whom we identified as those who picked our pockets,
Wednesday evening, in Carvel Hall--and gave him the necessary
descriptions.He recognized the team as one of 'Cheney's Best,' and
will have the entire police force--which consists of four men--waiting
at the bridge on the Annapolis side.""They are
there, now, so we can turn the prisoners loose."Croyden and Macloud resumed their revolvers, and returned to the
tent--to be greeted with a volley of profanity which, for fluency and
vocabulary, was distinctly marvelous.Gradually, it died away--for want
of breath and words."In the cuss line, you two are the real
thing.Why didn't you open up sooner?--you shouldn't hide such
proficiency from an admiring world."Whereat it flowed forth afresh from Hook-nose.Bald-head, however,
remained quiet, and there was a faint twinkle in his eyes, as though he
caught the humor of the situation.They were severely cramped, and in
considerable pain, but their condition was not likely to be benefited
by swearing at their captors.said Croyden, as Hook-nose took a fresh start.Now, if you'll be quiet a moment, like
your pal, we will tell you something that possibly you'll not be averse
to hear.... So, that's better.We're about to release you--let you go
free; it's too much bother to keep you prisoners.These little toy guns
of yours, however, we shall throw into the Bay, in interest of the
public peace.Now, you may arise and shake yourselves--you'll, likely,
find the circulation a trifle restricted, for a few minutes."Hook-nose gave him a malevolent look, but made no reply, Bald-head
grinned broadly."Now, if you have sufficiently recovered, we will escort you to your
carriage!And with the two thieves in front, and the three revolvers bringing up
the rear, they proceeded to the buggy.XI

ELAINE CAVENDISH


"May we have seen the last of you!"said Macloud, as the buggy
disappeared among the trees; "and may the police provide for you in
future.""And while you're about it," said Croyden, "you might pray that we find
the treasure--it would be quite as effective."Now, to resume where those rogues interrupted us.We had the jewels located, somewhere, within a radius of fifty feet.They must be, according to our theory, either on the bank or in the
Bay.We can't go at the water without a boat.Shall we tackle the land
at once?or go to town and procure a boat, and be ready for either in
the morning.""I have an idea," said Macloud."Don't let it go to waste, old man, let's have it!""If you can give up hearing yourself talk, for a moment, I'll try!""It is conceded, I believe, that digging on the Point
by day may, probably will, provoke comment and possibly investigation
as well.Then as soon as dusky
Night has drawn her robes about her----"

"Oh, Lord!"ejaculated Croyden, with upraised hands."Then, as soon as dusky Night has drawn her robes about her," Macloud
repeated, imperturbably, "we set to work, by the light of the silvery
moon.We arouse no comment--provoke no investigation.When morning
dawns, the sands are undisturbed, and we are sleeping as peacefully as
guinea pigs.""And if there isn't a moon, we will set to work by the light of the
silvery lantern, I reckon!""And, when we tackle the water, it will be in a silver boat and with
silver cuirasses and silver helmets, a la Lohengrin.""And I suppose, our swan-song will be played on silver flutes!""There won't be a swan-song--we're going to find Parmenter's treasure,"
said Macloud.Leaving Axtell in camp, they drove to town, stopping at the North end
of the Severn bridge to hire a row-boat,--a number of which were drawn
up on the bank--and to arrange for it to be sent around to the far end
of the Point.At the hotel, they found a telephone call from the
Mayor's office awaiting them.The thieves had been duly captured, the Mayor said, and they had been
sent to Baltimore.The Chief of Detectives happened to be in the
office, when they were brought in, and had instantly recognized them as
well-known criminals, wanted in Philadelphia for a particularly
atrocious hold-up.He had, thereupon, thought it best to let the Chief
take them back with him, thus saving the County the cost of a trial,
and the penitentiary expense--as well as sparing Mr.Croyden and his
friend much trouble and inconvenience in attending court.He had had
them searched, but found nothing which could be identified.Croyden assured him it was more than satisfactory.That night, and every night for the
next three weeks, they kept at it.They dug up the entire zone
of suspicion--it being loose sand and easy to handle.On the plea that
a valuable ruby ring had been lost overboard while fishing, they
dragged and scraped the bottom of the Bay for a hundred yards around.Nothing smiled on them but the weather--it had
remained uniformly good until the last two days before.Then there had
set in, from the North-east, such a storm of rain as they had never
seen.The very Bay seemed to be gathered up and dashed over the Point.They had sought refuge in the hotel, when the first chilly blasts of
wind and water came up the Chesapeake.As it grew fiercer,--and a <DW64>
sent out for information returned with the news that their tents had
been blown away, and all trace of the camp had vanished--it was
decided that the quest should be abandoned."We knew from the first it
couldn't succeed.""But we wanted to prove that it couldn't succeed," Macloud observed."If you hadn't searched, you always would have thought that, maybe, you
could have been successful.Now, you've had your try--and you've
failed.It will be easier to reconcile yourself to failure, than not to
have tried.""In other words, it's better to have tried and lost, than never to have
tried at all," Croyden answered.it's over and there's no profit
in thinking more about it.We have had an enjoyable camp, and the camp
is ended.I'll go home and try to forget Parmenter, and the jewel box
he buried down on Greenberry Point.""I think I'll go with you," said Macloud."To Hampton--if you can put up with me a little longer."A knowing smile broke over Croyden's face."Maybe!--and maybe it is just you.At any rate, I'll come if I may."You know you're more than welcome, always!""I'll go out to Northumberland to-night, arrange a few
matters which are overdue, and come down to Hampton as soon as I can
get away."*       *       *       *       *

The next afternoon, as Macloud was entering the wide doorway of the
Tuscarora Trust Company, he met Elaine Cavendish coming out.There isn't a handy dinner man around, with you and Geoffrey
both away.Dine with us this evening, will you?--it will be strictly
_en famille_, for I want to talk business."he thought, as, having accepted, he went on
to the coupon department."It has to do with that beggar Croyden, I
reckon."*       *       *       *       *

And when, the dinner over, they were sitting before the open grate
fire, in the big living room, she broached the subject without
timidity, or false pride."You are more familiar with Geoffrey Croyden's affairs than any one
else, Colin," she said, crossing her knees, in the reckless fashion
women have now-a-days, and exposing a ravishing expanse of blue silk
stockings, with an unconscious consciousness that was delightfully
naive."And I want to ask you something--or rather, several things."Macloud blew a whiff of cigarette smoke into the fire, and waited."I, naturally, don't ask you to violate any confidence," she went on,
"but I fancy you may tell me this: was the particular business in which
Geoffrey was engaged, when I saw him in Annapolis, a success or a
failure?""Did he tell you anything concerning
it?""Only that his return to Northumberland would depend very much on the
outcome.""Well, it wasn't a success; in fact, it was a complete failure.""I do not mean, where is he this minute, but where
is he in general--where would you address a wire, or a letter, and know
that it would be received?"He threw his cigarette into the grate and lit another."I am not at liberty to tell," he said."Then, it is true--he is concealing himself.""Not exactly--he is not proclaiming himself----"

"Not proclaiming himself or his whereabouts to his Northumberland
friends, you mean?""Are there such things as friends, when one
has been unfortunate?""I can answer only for myself," she replied earnestly."I believe you, Elaine----"

"Then tell me this--is he in this country or abroad?""In this country," he said, after a pause."Is he in want,--I mean, in want for the things he has been used to?""He is not in want, I can assure you!--and much that he was used to
having, he has no use for, now."Why did he leave Northumberland so suddenly?"He was forced to give up the old life, so he chose
wisely, I think--to go where his income was sufficient for his needs."She was silent for a while, staring into the blaze.He did not
interrupt--thinking it wise to let her own thoughts shape the way."You will not tell me where he is?"she said suddenly, bending her blue
eyes hard upon his face.I ought not to have told you he was not abroad.""This business which you and he were on, in Annapolis--it failed, you
say?""And is there no chance that it may succeed, some time?""But may not conditions change--something happen----" she began."It is the sort that does not happen.In this case, abandonment spells
finis.""Did he know, when we were in Annapolis?""On the contrary, he was very sanguine--it looked most promising
then."He blew ring after ring of smoke, and
waited, patiently.He was the friend, he saw, now.Croyden was the lucky fellow--and would not!Well, he had
his warning and it was in time.Since she was baring her soul to him,
as friend to friend, it was his duty to help her to the utmost of his
power.Suddenly, she uncrossed her knees and sat up."I have bought all the stock, and the remaining bonds of the Virginia
Development Company, from the bank that held them as collateral for
Royster & Axtell's loan," she said.I didn't
appear in the matter--my broker bought them in _your_ name, and paid
for them in actual money."She arose, and bending swiftly over, kissed him on the cheek."I am, also, Geoffrey Croyden's friend, but
there are temptations which mortal man cannot resist."she smiled, leaning over the back of his chair, and
putting her head perilously close to his--"but I trust you--though I
shan't kiss you again--at least, for the present.Now, you have been so
_very_ good about the bonds, I want you to be good some more.He held his hands before him, to put them out of temptation."Ask me to crawl in the grate, and see how quickly I do it!""It might prove my power, but I should lose my friend," she whispered.it's
already granted, that you should know, Elaine.""You're a very sweet boy," she said, going back to her seat.But that you're a very sweet girl, needs no
proof--unless----" looking at her with a meaning smile."I should accept it as such," he averred--"whenever you choose to
confer it.""_Confer_ smacks of reward for service done," she said."Will it bide
till then?""Wait--If you choose such pay, the----"

"I choose no pay," he interrupted."Then, the reward will be in kind," she answered enigmatically."I want
you----" She put one slender foot on the fender, and gazed at it,
meditatively, while the firelight stole covert glances at the silken
ankles thus exposed."I want you to purchase for me, from Geoffrey
Croyden, at par, his Virginia Development Company bonds," she said.I will give you a check, now----"

"Wait!"he said; "wait until he sells----"

"You think he won't sell?""I think he will have to be satisfied, first, as to the purchaser--in
plain words, that it isn't either you or I. We can't give Geoffrey
money!The bonds are practically worthless, as he knows only too
well.""I had thought of that," she said, "but, isn't it met by this very
plan?Your broker purchases the bonds for your account, but he,
naturally, declines to reveal the identity of his customer.You can,
truthfully, tell Geoffrey that _you_ are not buying them--for you're
not.And _I_--if he will only give me the chance--will assure him that
I am _not_ buying them from him--and you might confirm it, if he
asked."It's juggling with the facts--though true on the face," said
Macloud, "but it's pretty thin ice we're skating on."He may take the two hundred
thousand and ask no question.""You don't for a moment believe that!""It _is_ doubtful," she admitted."And you wouldn't think the same of him, if he did.""So, we are back to the thin ice.I'll do what I can; but, you forgot,
I am not at liberty to give his address to my brokers.I shall have to
take their written offer to buy, and forward it to him, which, in
itself will oblige me, at the same time, to tell him that _I_ am not
the purchaser.""I leave it entirely to you--manage it any way you see fit.All I ask,
is that you get him to sell.It's horrible to think of Geoffrey being
reduced to the bare necessities of life--for that's what it means, when
he goes 'where his income is sufficient for his needs.'""It's unfortunate, certainly: it would be vastly worse for a woman--to
go from luxury to frugality, from everything to relatively nothing is
positively pathetic.However, Croyden is not suffering--he has an
attractive house filled with old things, good victuals, a more than
competent cook, and plenty of society.He has cut out all the
non-essentials, and does the essentials economically.""You speak of your own knowledge,
not from his inferences?""Our own in the aggregate
or differentiated?"he laughed; "but quite the equal of our own
differentiated.If Croyden were a marrying man--with sufficient income
for two--I should give him about six months, at the outside.""And how much would you give one with sufficient for two--_yourself_,
for instance?""Just long enough to choose the girl--and convince her of the propriety
of the choice.""And do you expect to join Geoffrey, soon?""As soon as I can get through here,--probably in a day or two.""Then, we may look for the new Mrs.Macloud in time for the holidays, I
presume.--Sort of a Christmas gift?""About then--if I can pick among so many, and she ratifies the pick.""No!--there are so many I didn't have time to more than look them over.When I go back, I'll round them up, cut out the most likely, and try to
tie and brand her.""One would think, from your talk, that
Geoffrey was in a cowboy camp, with waitresses for society."He grinned, and lighted a fresh cigarette."And nothing can induce you to tell me the location of the camp?""Let us try the bond matter, first.If
he sells, I think he will return; if not, I'll then consider telling.""You're a good fellow, Colin, dear!"she whispered, leaning over and
giving his hand an affectionate little pat."You're so nice and
comfortable to have around--you never misunderstand, nor draw
inferences that you shouldn't.""Which means, I'm not to draw inferences now?""Nor at any other time," she remarked."Will be forthcoming," with an alluring smile."I've a mind to take part payment now," said he, intercepting the hand
before she could withdraw it.whisking it loose, and darting around a table.With a swift movement, she swept up her skirts and fled--around chairs,
and tables, across rugs, over sofas and couches--always manoeuvring to
gain the doorway, yet always finding him barring the way;--until, at
last, she was forced to refuge behind a huge davenport, standing with
one end against the wall.he demanded, coming slowly toward her in the
cul de sac."I'll be merciful," he said."It is five steps, until I reach
you--One!--Will you yield?""Four----"

Quick as thought, she dropped one hand on the back of the davenport;
there was a flash of slippers, lingerie and silk, and she was across
and racing for the door, now fair before her, leaving him only the echo
of a mocking laugh.she counted, tauntingly, from the hall."Why don't you
continue, sir?""I'll be good for to-night, Elaine--you
need have no further fear."She tossed her head ever so slightly, while a bantering look came into
her eyes."I'm not much afraid of you, now--nor any time," she answered."But you
have more courage than I would have thought, Colin--decidedly more!"XII

ONE LEARNED IN THE LAW


It was evening, when Croyden returned to Hampton--an evening which
contained no suggestion of the Autumn he had left behind him on the
Eastern Shore.It was raw, and damp, and chill, with the presage of
winter in its cold; the leaves were almost gone from the trees, the
blackening hand of frost was on flower and shrubbery.As he passed up
the dreary, deserted street, the wind was whistling through the
branches over head, and moaning around the houses like spirits of the
damned.He turned in at Clarendon--shivering a little at the prospect.He was
beginning to appreciate what a winter spent under such conditions
meant, where one's enjoyments and recreations are circumscribed by the
bounds of comparatively few houses and few people--people, he
suspected, who could not understand what he missed, of the hurly-burly
of life and amusement, even if they tried.Their ways were sufficient
for them; they were eminently satisfied with what they had; they could
not comprehend dissatisfaction in another, and would have no patience
with it.He could imagine the dismalness of Hampton, when contrasted with the
brightness of Northumberland.The theatres, the clubs, the constant
dinners, the evening affairs, the social whirl with all that it
comprehended, compared with an occasional dinner, a rare party,
interminable evenings spent, by his own fireside, alone!To be sure, Miss Carrington, and Miss Borden, and Miss Lashiel, and
Miss Tilghman, would be available, when they were home.But the winter
was when they went visiting, he remembered, from late November until
early April, and, at that period, the town saw them but little.There
was the Hampton Club, of course, but it was worse than nothing--an
opportunity to get mellow and to gamble, innocent enough to those who
were habituated to it, but dangerous to one who had fallen, by
adversity, from better things....

However, Macloud would be there, shortly, thank God!And the dear girls
were not going for a week or so, he hoped.And, when the worst came, he
could retire to the peacefulness of his library and try to eke out a
four months' existence, with the books, and magazines and papers.Moses held open the door, with a bow and a flourish, and the lights
leaped out to meet him.It was some cheer, at least, to come home to a
bright house, a full larder, faithful servants--and supper ready on the
table, and tuned to even a Clubman's taste."Moses, do you know if Miss Carrington's at home?"he asked, the coffee
on and his cigar lit.her am home, seh, I seed she herse'f dis mornin' cum down
de parf from de front poach wid de dawg, seh."Croyden nodded and went across the hall to the telephone.Miss Carrington, herself, answered his call.--Yes, she intended to be
home all evening.She would be delighted to see him and to hear a full
account of himself.He was rather surprised at his own alacrity, in finishing his cigar and
changing his clothes--and he wondered whether it was the girl, or the
companionship, or the opportunity to be free of himself?A little of
all three, he concluded.... But, especially, the _girl_, as she came
from the drawing-room to meet him."So you have really returned," she said, as he bowed over her slender
fingers."We were beginning to fear you had deserted us.""You are quite too modest," he replied."You don't appreciate your own
attractions."The "you" was plainly singular, but she refused to see it."Our own attractions require us to be modest," she returned; "with
a--man of the world.""Whatever I may have been, I am, now, a man of
Hampton.""You can never be a man of Hampton.""Why not, if I live among you?""If you live here--take on our ways, our beliefs, our mode of thinking,
you may, in a score of years, grow like us, outwardly; but, inwardly,
where the true like must start, _never_!"You've been bred differently, used to
different things, to doing them in a different way.We do things
slowly, leisurely, with a fine disregard of time, you, with the modern
rush, and bustle, and hurry.You are a man of the world--I repeat
it--up to the minute in everything--never lagging behind, unless you
wish.You never put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.We never
do anything to-day that can be put off till to-morrow.""And which do you prefer, the to-day or the to-morrow?""It depends on my humor, and my location, at the time--though, I must
admit, the to-day makes for thrift, and business, and success in
acquiring wealth.""And success also in getting rid of it.It is a return toward the
primitive condition--the survival of the fittest.There must be losers
as well as acquirers."she exclaimed, "that one must lose in order
that another may gain.""But as we are not in Utopia or Altruria," he smiled, "it will continue
so to be.Why, even in Baltimore, they----"

"Oh, Baltimore is only an overgrown country town!""With half a million population, it is as
provincial as Hampton, and thanks God for it--the most smug,
self-satisfied, self-sufficient municipality in the land, with its
cobblestones, its drains-in-the-gutters, its how much-holier-than-thou
air about everything.""Because it happens to be on the main line between Washington and the
North.""At least, the people are nice, barring a few mushrooms who are making
a great to-do.""Yes, the people _are_ delightful!--And, when it comes to mushrooms,
Northumberland has Baltimore beaten to a frazzle."Northumberland society must be exceedingly large!""It is--but it's not overcrowded.About as many die every day, as are
born every night; and, at any rate, they don't interfere with those who
really belong--except to increase prices, and the cost of living, and
clog the avenue with automobiles."but whither it leads no one knows--to the devil,
likely--or a lemon garden.""'Blessed are the lemons on earth, for they shall be peaches in
Heaven!'""What a glorious peach your Miss Erskine will be," he replied."I'm afraid you don't appreciate the great honor the lady did you, in
condescending to view the _treasures_ of Clarendon, and to talk about
them afterward.To hear her, she is the most intimate friend you have
in Hampton."he said, "I'm glad you told me.Somehow, I'm always drawing
lemons.""Quite immaterial to the question, which is: A lemon or not a lemon?""If you could but see yourself at this moment, you would not ask," he
said, looking at her with amused scrutiny.The lovely face, the blue black hair, the fine figure in the simple
pink organdie, the slender ankles, the well-shod feet--a lemon!"But as I can't see myself, and have no mirror handy, your testimony is
desired," she insisted."Then you can't have any objection----"

"If you bring Miss Erskine in?""----if I take you there for a game of Bridge--shall we go this very
evening?""I don't wish--and we are growing very silly.Come, tell
about your Annapolis trip."It's a queer old town, Annapolis--they call it the 'Finished City!'It's got plenty of landmarks, and relics, but nothing more.If it were
not for the State Capitol and Naval Academy, it would be only a lot of
ruins, lost in the sand.No one on
the streets, no one in the shops, no one any place.--Deserted--until
there's a fire."But, with the
autumn and the Academy in session, the town seemed very much alive.We
sampled 'Cheney's Best,' Wegard's Cakes, and saw the Custard-and-Cream
Chapel.""You've been to Annapolis, sure!""There's only one thing
more--did you see Paul Jones?"You can't find him without the aid of a
detective or a guide.""No one!--and there is the shame.We accepted the vast labors and the
money of our Ambassador to France in locating the remains of America's
first Naval Hero; we sent an Embassy and a warship to bring them back;
we received them with honor, orated over them, fired guns over them.And then, when the spectators had departed--assuming they were to be
deposited in the crypt of the Chapel--we calmly chucked them away on a
couple of trestles, under a stairway in Bancroft Hall, as we would an
old broom or a tin can.That's _our_ way of honoring the only Naval
Commander we had in the Revolution.It would have been better, much
better, had we left him to rest in the quiet seclusion of his grave in
France--lost, save in memory, with the halo of the past and privacy of
death around him.""And why didn't we finish the work?""Why bring him here,
with the attendant expense, and then stop, just short of completion?Why didn't we inter him in the Chapel (though, God save me from burial
there), or any place, rather than on trestles under a stairway in a
midshipmen's dormitory?""Because the appropriation was exhausted, or because the Act wasn't
worded to include burial, or because the Superintendent didn't want the
bother, or because it was a nuisance to have the remains around--or
some other absurd reason.At all events, he is there in the cellar, and
he is likely to stay there, till Bancroft Hall is swallowed up by the
Bay.The junket to France, the parade, the speeches, the spectacular
part are over, so, who cares for the entombment, and the respect due
the distinguished dead?""I don't mean to be disrespectful," he observed, "but it's hard luck to
have one's bones disturbed, after more than a hundred years of
tranquillity, to be conveyed clear across the Atlantic, to be orated
over, and sermonized over, and, then, to be flung aside like old junk
and forgot.However, we have troubles of our own--I know I have--more
real than Paul Jones!He may be glad he's dead, so he won't have any to
worry over.In fact, it's a good thing to be dead--one is saved from a
heap of worry.""A daily struggle to procure fuel sufficient
to keep up the fire."Why not make an end of life, at once?""Sometimes, I'm tempted," he admitted."It's the leap in the dark, and
no returning, that restrains, I reckon--and the fact that we must face
it alone.You have
begged the question, or what amounts to it.But, to return to
Annapolis; what else did you see?""Then you know what I saw," he replied.This isn't the day of the rapier and the mask."She half closed her eyes and looked at him through the long lashes."What were you doing down on Greenberry Point?"I was in Annapolis--I saw your name on the
register--I inquired--and I had the tale of the camp.No one, however,
seemed to think it queer!"Camping out is entirely natural," Croyden answered."With the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs?""A party which until five days ago he had not joined--at least, so the
Superintendent told me, when I dined at his house.He happened to
mention your name, found I knew you--and we gossiped.Perhaps we
shouldn't, but we did."he didn't seem even to wonder at your being there----"

"But _you_ did?""It's the small town in me, I suppose--to be curious about other people
and their business; and it was most suspicious."First, you hire a boat and cross the Bay direct from
Hampton to Annapolis.Second, you procure, through Senator Rickrose, a
permit from the Secretary of the Navy to camp on Greenberry Point.Third, you actually do camp, there, for nearly, or quite three weeks.Why go clear to the Western Shore, and choose a
comparatively inaccessible and exposed location on United States
property, if the idea were only a camp?Why not camp over on Kent
Island, or on this coast?Anywhere, within a few miles of Hampton,
there are scores of places better adapted than Greenberry Point."With a series of premises, you can reach whatever conclusion
you wish--you're not bound by the probabilities.""You're simply obscuring the point," she insisted."In this instance,
my premises are facts which are not controverted.Why?----" She held up her hand.I'm simply
'chaffing of you,' don't you know!""With just a lingering curiosity, however," he added."A casual curiosity, rather," she amended."Which, some time, I shall gratify.You've trailed me down--we _were_
on Greenberry Point for a purpose, but nothing has come of it, yet--and
it's likely a failure."Croyden, I don't wish to know.It was a mistake to refer
to it.I should simply have forgot what I heard in Annapolis--I'll
forget now, if you will permit."You can't forget, if you would--and I
would not have you, if you could.Moreover, I inherited it along with
Clarendon, and, as you were my guide to the place, it's no more than
right that you should know.I think I shall confide in you--no use to
protest, it's got to come!""You are determined?--Very well, then, come over to the couch in the
corner, where we can sit close and you can whisper."She put out her hand and led him--and he
suffered himself to be led.when they were seated, "you may begin.Once upon a time----" and
laughed, softly."I'll take this, if you've no immediate use for it,"
she said, and released her hand from his."I shall want it back, presently, however.""Do you, by any chance, get all you want?"Else I would have kept what I already had."She put her hands behind her, and faced around."Well,--once upon a time----" Then he stopped."I'll go over to the
house and get the letter--it will tell you much better than I can.You
will wait here, _right here_, until I return?"She looked at him, with a tantalizing smile."Won't it be enough, if I am here _when_ you return?"When he came out on the piazza the rain had ceased, the clouds were
gone, the temperature had fallen, and the stars were shining brightly
in a winter sky.He strode quickly down the walk to the street and crossed it diagonally
to his own gates.As he passed under the light, which hung near the
entrance, a man walked from the shadow of the Clarendon grounds and
accosted him.Croyden halted, abruptly, just out of distance."With your permission, I will accompany you to your house--to which I
assume you are bound--for a few moments' private conversation."He was about thirty years of age, tall
and slender, was well dressed, in dark clothes, a light weight
top-coat, and a derby hat.His face was ordinary, however, and Croyden
had no recollection of ever having seen it--certainly not in Hampton."I'm not in the habit of discussing business with strangers, at night,
nor of taking them to my house," he answered, brusquely."If you have
anything to say to me, say it now, and be brief."Some one may hear us," the man objected."Pardon me, but I think, in this matter, you would have objection.""You'll say it quickly, and here, or not at all," snapped Croyden."It's scarcely a subject to be discussed on the street," he observed,
"but, if I must, I must.Did you ever hear of Robert Parmenter?Well, the business concerns a certain letter--need I
be more explicit?""If you wish to make your business intelligible.""As you wish," he said, "though it only consumes time, and I was under
the impression that you were in a hurry.However: To repeat--the
business concerns a letter, which has to do with a certain treasure
buried long ago, on Greenberry Point, by the said Robert Parmenter.Do
I make myself plain, now, sir?""Your language is entirely intelligible--though I cannot answer for the
facts recited."The man smiled imperturbably, and went on:

"The letter in question having come into your possession recently, you,
with two companions, spent three weeks encamped on Greenberry Point,
ostensibly for your health, or the night air, or anything else that
would deceive the Naval authorities.During which time, you dug up the
entire Point, dragged the waters immediately adjoining--and then
departed, very strangely choosing for it a time of storm and change of
weather.Evidently, the thieves had managed to
communicate with a confederate, and this was a hold-up."Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to suppose that your search was
not ineffectual.In plain words, you have recovered the treasure."Croyden only smiled, and waited, too."Very good!--we will proceed," said the stranger."The jewels were
found on Government land.It makes no difference whether recovered on
the Point or on the Bay--the law covering treasure trove, I am
informed, doesn't apply.The Government is entitled to the entire find,
it being the owner in fee of the land.""I have devoted my spare moments to the study of
the law----"

"And how to avoid it," Croyden interjected."And also how to prevent _others_ from avoiding it," he replied,
suggestively."Let us take up that phase, if it please you."asked Croyden, suppressing an inclination
to laugh."Then let us take it up, any way--unless you wish to forfeit your find
to the Government.""We are arriving, now, at the pith of the
matter.We will take Parmenter's estimate and
multiply it by two, though jewels have appreciated more than that in
valuation.Fifty thousand pounds is two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars, which will total, according to the calculation, half a million
dollars,--one half of which amount you pay us as our share."Why don't you call it properly--blackmail?""If you prefer blackmail to
share, it will not hinder the contract--seeing that it is quite as
illegal on your part as on ours.Share merely sounds a little better
but either obtains the same end.Call it what you
will--but _pay_.""If you are not familiar
with the law covering the subject under discussion, let me enlighten
you.""I was endeavoring to state the matter succinctly," the stranger
replied, refusing to be hurried or flustered."The Common Law and the
practice of the Treasury Department provide, that all treasure found on
Government land or within navigable waters, is Government property.If
declared by the finder, immediately, he shall be paid such reward as
the Secretary may determine.If he does not declare, and is informed
on, the informer gets the reward.You will observe that, under the law,
you have forfeited the jewels--I fancy I do not need to draw further
deductions.""No!--it's quite unnecessary," Croyden remarked."Your fellow thieves
went into that phase (good word, I like it!)rather fully, down on
Greenberry Point.Unluckily, they fell into the hands of the police,
almost immediately, and we have not been able to continue the
conversation.""I have the honor to continue the conversation--and, in the interim,
you have found the treasure.So, Parmenter's letter won't be
essential--the facts, circumstances, your own and Mr.Macloud's
testimony, will be sufficient to prove the Government's case.Then, as
you are aware, it's pay or go to prison for larceny.""There is one very material hypothesis, which you assume as a fact, but
which is, unfortunately, not a fact," said Croyden.The man laughed, good-humoredly."We don't ask you to acknowledge the
finding--just pay over the quarter of a million and we will forget
everything.""My good man, I'm speaking the truth!""Maybe it's
difficult for you to recognize, but it's the truth, none the less.I
only wish I _had_ the treasure--I think I'd be quite willing to share
it, even with a blackmailer!""I trust it will give no offence if I say I don't believe you."And, without more ado, he turned his back and went up the path to
Clarendon.XII

I COULD TELL SOME THINGS


When Croyden had got Parmenter's letter from the secret drawer in the
escritoire, he rang the old-fashioned pull-bell for Moses.It was only
a little after nine, and, though he did not require the <DW64> to remain
in attendance until he retired, he fancied the kitchen fire still held
him.In a moment Moses appeared--his eyes heavy
with the sleep from which he had been aroused."Moses, did you ever shoot a pistol?""Fur de Lawd, seh!Hit's bin so long sence I dun hit, I t'ink I'se
gun-shy, seh.""Yass, seh, I has don hit.""And you could do it again, if necessary?""I speck so, seh--leas'wise, I kin try--dough I'se mons'us unsuttin,
seh, mons'us unsuttin!""Uncertain of what--your shooting or your hitting?""Well, we're all of us somewhat uncertain in that line.At least you
know enough not to point the revolver toward yourself.""Hi!--I sut'n'y does!seh, I sut'n'y does!"said the <DW64>, with a
broad grin."There is a revolver, yonder, on the table," said Croyden, indicating
one of those they used on Greenberry Point."It's a self-cocker--you
simply pull the trigger and the action does the rest."Yass, seh, I onderstands," said Moses."Bring it here," Croyden ordered.Moses' fingers closed around the butt, a bit timorously, and he carried
it to his master."I'll show you the action," said Croyden."Here, is the ejector,"
throwing the chamber out, "it holds six shots, you see: but you never
put a cartridge under the firing-pin, because, if anything strikes the
trigger, it's likely to be discharged."Croyden loaded it, closed the cylinder, and passed it over to Moses,
who took it with a little more assurance.He was harkening back thirty
years, and more."What do yo warn me to do, seh?""I want you to sit down, here, while I'm away, and if any one tries to
get in this house, to-night, you're to shoot him.I'm going over to
Captain Carrington's--I'll be back by eleven o'clock.It isn't likely
you will be disturbed; if you are, one shot will frighten him off, even
if you don't hit him, and I'll hear the shot, and come back at once."Yass, seh!--I'm to shoot anyone what tries to get in.""You're to shoot anyone who tries to
_break_ in.don't shoot me, when I return, or any
one else who comes legitimately.Be sure he is an intruder, then bang
away.""Sut'n'y, seh!I'se dub'us bout hittin', but I kin bang
away right nuf.Does yo' spose any one will try to git in, seh?"Croyden smiled--"but you be ready for them, Moses, be
ready for them.It's just as well to provide against contingencies."as Croyden went out and the front door closed behind him,
"but dem 'tingencies is monty dang'ous t'ings to fools wid.I don'
likes hit, dat's whar I don'."Croyden found Miss Carrington just where he had left her--a quick
return to the sofa having been synchronous with his appearance in the
hall."I had a mind not to wait here," she said; "you were an inordinately
long time, Mr."I was, and I admit
it--but it can be explained.""Before you listen to me, listen to Robert Parmenter, deceased!"said
he, and gave her the letter."Oh, this is the letter--do you mean that I am to read it?"She read it through without a single word of comment--an amazing thing
in a woman, who, when her curiosity is aroused, can ask more questions
to the minute than can be answered in a month.When she had finished,
she turned back and read portions of it again, especially the direction
as to finding the treasure, and the postscript bequests by the Duvals.At last, she dropped the letter in her lap and looked up at Croyden."Most extraordinary in its
ordinariness, and most ordinary in its extraordinariness.And you
searched, carefully, for three weeks and found--nothing?""Now, I'll tell you about it.""First, tell me where you obtained this letter?""I found it by accident--in a secret compartment of an escritoire at
Clarendon," he answered."This is the tale of Parmenter's treasure--and how we did _not_ find
it!"Then he proceeded to narrate, briefly, the details--from the finding of
the letter to the present moment, dwelling particularly on the episode
of the theft of their wallets, the first and second coming of the
thieves to the Point, their capture and subsequent release, together
with the occurrence of this evening, when he was approached, by the
well-dressed stranger, at Clarendon's gates.And, once again, marvelous to relate, Miss Carrington did not
interrupt, through the entire course of the narrative.Nor did she
break the silence for a time after he had concluded, staring
thoughtfully, the while, down into the grate, where a smouldering back
log glowed fitfully."What do you intend to do, as to the treasure?"In the
words of the game, popular hereabout, he is playing a bobtail!""But he doesn't know it's a bobtail.He is convinced you found the
treasure," she objected."Let him make whatever trouble he can, it won't bother me, in the
least.""He is not acting alone," she persisted."He has confederates--they may
attack Clarendon, in an effort to capture the treasure."this is the twentieth century, not the seventeenth!""We don't'stand-by to repel boarders,' these days.""Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways!""Rather queer!--I've heard those same words before, in this
connection.""Possibly--though I don't recall it.Suppose you are attacked and
tortured till you reveal where you've hidden the jewels?""However, I
put Moses on guard--with a big revolver and orders to fire at anyone
molesting the house.If we hear a fusillade we'll know it's he shooting
up the neighborhood.""Then the same idea _did_ suggest itself to you!""Only to the extent of searching for the jewels--I regarded that as
vaguely possible, but there isn't the slightest danger of any one being
tortured.""You know best, I suppose," she said--"but you've had your warning--and
pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.You've given up all hope of finding
the treasure--abandoned jewels worth--how many dollars?""Possibly half a million," he filled in."If you can suggest what to do--anything which hasn't been done, I
shall be only too glad to consider it.""You say you dug up the entire Point for a hundred yards inland?""And dredged the Bay for a hundred yards?"She puckered her brows in thought.He regarded her with an amused
smile."I don't see what you're to do, except to do it all over again," she
announced--"Now, don't laugh!It may sound foolish, but many a thing
has been found on a second seeking--and this, surely, is worth a
second, or a third, or even many seekings.""If there were any assurance of ultimate success, it would pay to spend
a lifetime hunting.The two essentials, however, are wanting: the
extreme tip of Greenberry Point in 1720, and the beech-trees.We made
the best guess at their location.More than that, the zone of
exploration embraced every possible extreme of territory--yet, we
failed.It will make nothing for success to try again.""Somewhere, in the Bay!--It's shoal water, for three or four hundred
feet around the Point, with a rock bottom.The Point itself has been
eaten into by the Bay, down to this rock.Parmenter's chest disappeared
with the land in which it was buried, and no man will find it now,
except by accident.""Without anyone having the fun of wasting it!"She took up Parmenter's letter again, and glanced over it.Then she
handed it back, and shook her head."It's too much for my poor brain," she said.We gave it rather more than a fair trial,
and, then, we gave it up.When I go home, to-night, I shall
return the letter to the escritoire where I found it, and forget it."You can return it to its hiding place," she reflected, "but you can't
cease wondering.Why didn't Marmaduke Duval get the treasure while the
landmarks were there?"Probably on account of old Parmenter's restriction that it be left
until the 'extremity of need.'""Probably," she said, "the Duvals would regard it as a matter of honor
to observe the exact terms of the bequest."It's only because they did so, that I got a chance to search!""You mean that, otherwise, there would be no buried treasure!"And with all that money, the Duvals
might have gone away from Hampton--might have experienced other
conditions.Colonel Duval might never have met your father--you might
have never come to Clarendon.--My goodness!"In the realm of pure conjecture," he answered."It is idle to theorize
on the might-have-beens, or what might-have-happened if the
what-did-happen hadn't happened.Dismiss it, at least, for this
evening.You asked what I was doing for three weeks at Annapolis, and I
have consumed a great while in answering--let us talk of something
else.What have you been doing in those three weeks?"A little Bridge, a few riding parties, some sails on the Bay,
with an occasional homily by Miss Erskine, when she had me cornered,
and I couldn't get away.Then is when I learned what a deep impression
you had made!""We both were learning, it seems," he replied."I don't quite understand," she said."You made an impression, also--of course, that's to be expected, but
this impression is much more than the ordinary kind!"_"Merci, Monsieur_," she scoffed."No, it isn't _merci_, it's a fact.And he is a mighty good fellow on
whom to make an impression.""You mean, Mr.--Macloud?""For he's coming back----"

"To Hampton?""To be accurate, I expect him not later than the day-after-to-morrow.""I shall believe you, when I see him!""He is, I think, coming solely on your account.""But you're not quite sure?--oh!"Naturally, he hasn't confided in me.""So you're confiding in me--how clever!""I could tell some things----"

"Which are fables.""----but I won't--they might turn your head----"

"Which way--to the right or left?""----and make you too confident and too cruel.He saw you but
twice----"

"Once!""Once, on the street; again, when we called in the evening--but he gave
you a name, the instant he saw you----"

"How kind of him!""He called you: 'The Symphony in Blue.'""Was that the first time you had noticed it?""No, you most assuredly do not!"she said, "I know you're intrepid--but you _won't_!""Because, it would be false to your friend."Yes!--as between you two, you have renounced, in his favor.""At least, I so view it," with a teasingly fascinating smile."Don't you think that you protest over-much?""If we were two children, I'd say: 'You think you're smart, don't
you?'""And I'd retort: 'You got left, didn't you?'""Seriously, however--do you really expect Mr."I surely do--probably within two days; and I'm not chaffing when I say
that you're the inducement.So, be good to him--he's got more than
enough for two, I can assure you.""And what number am I--the twenty-first, or thereabout?""What matters it, if you're _the_ one, at present?""I'd sooner be the present one than all the has-beens," he insisted."If it will advantage any----"

"I didn't say so," she interrupted.

"----I can tell you----"

"Many fables, I don't doubt!"----that we have been rather intimate, for a few years, and I have
never before known him to exhibit particular interest in any woman.""'Why don't you speak for yourself, John,'" she quoted, merrily."Because, to be frank, I haven't enough for two," he answered, gayly.But beneath the gayety, she thought she detected the faintest note of
regret.And, woman-like, when he had gone, she wondered about her--whether she
was dark or fair, tall or small, vivacious or reserved, flirtatious or
sedate, rich or poor--and whether they loved each other--or whether it
was he, alone, who loved--or whether he had not permitted himself to be
carried so far--or whether--then, she dropped asleep.Croyden went back to Clarendon, keeping a sharp look-out for anyone
under the trees around the house.He found Moses in the library,
evidently just aroused from slumber by the master's door key."No one's bin heah, seh, 'cep de boy wid dis'spatch," he hastened to
say.Croyden tore open the envelope:--It was a wire from Macloud, that he
would be down to-morrow.yass, seh!--I'se pow'ful glad yo's back, seh.Nothin' I kin
git yo befo I goes?""You're a good soldier, Moses, you didn't
sleep on guard."I keps wide awake, Marster Croyden, wide awake all de time,
seh.Croyden finished his cigar, put out the light, and went slowly
upstairs--giving not a thought to the Parmenter treasure nor the man he
had met outside.His mind was busy with Elaine Cavendish--their last
night on the moonlit piazza--the brief farewell--the lingering pressure
of her fingers--the light in her eyes--the subdued pleasure, when they
met unexpectedly in Annapolis--her little ways to detain him, keep him
close to her--her instant defense of him at Mattison's scurrilous
insinuation--the officers' hop--the rhythmic throb of the melody--the
scented, fluttering body held close in his arms--the lowered head--the
veiled eyes--the trembling lashes--his senses steeped in the fragrance
of her beauty--the temptation well-nigh irresistible--his resolution
almost gone--trembling--trembling----

                  *       *       *       *       *

The vision passed--music ceased--the dance was ended.Sentiment
vanished--reason reigned once more.to think of her, to dream of the past, even.But
it is pleasant, sometimes, to be a fool--where a beautiful woman is
concerned, and only one's self to pay the piper.XIV

THE SYMPHONY IN BLUE


Macloud arrived the next day, bringing for his host a great batch of
mail, which had accumulated at the Club."I thought of it at the last moment--when I was starting for the
station, in fact," he remarked."The clerk said he had no instructions
for forwarding, so I just poked it in my bag and brought it along.Stupid of me not to think of it sooner.I
can understand why you didn't leave an address, but not why I shouldn't
forward it.""I didn't care, when I left--and I don't care much, now--but I'm
obliged, just the same!""It's something to do; the most
exciting incident of the day, down here, is the arrival of the mail.The people wait for it, with bated breath.I am getting in the way,
too, though I don't get much.... I never did have any extensive
correspondence, even in Northumberland--so this is just circulars and
such trash."He took the package, which Macloud handed him, and tossed it on the
desk.Everybody is
back--everybody is hard up or says he is--everybody is full of lies,
as usual, and is turning them loose on anyone who will listen,
credulous or sophisticated, it makes no difference.It's the telling,
not the believing that's the thing.the little cad Mattison is
engaged--Charlotte Brundage has landed him, and the wedding is set for
early next month.""I don't envy her the job," Croyden remarked."She'll be privileged to draw
on his bank account, and that's the all important thing with her.He
will fracture the seventh commandment, and she won't turn a hair.She
is a chilly proposition, all right.""Well, I wish her joy of her bargain," said Croyden."May she have
everything she wants, and see Mattison not at all, after the wedding
journey--and but very occasionally, then."He took up the letters and ran carelessly through them.he commented, as he consigned them, one by one,
to the waste-basket.Macloud watched him, languidly, behind his cigar smoke, and made no
comment.Presently Croyden came to a large, white envelope--darkened on the
interior so as to prevent the contents from being read until opened.It
bore the name of a firm of prominent brokers in Northumberland."'We own and offer, subject to
prior sale, the following high grade investment bonds.'He drew out the letter and looked at it,
perfunctorily, before sending it to rest with its fellows.--It wasn't
in the usual form.--He opened it, wider.--It was signed by the senior
partner.Croyden:

  "We have a customer who is interested in the Virginia Development
  Company.He has purchased the Bonds and the stock of Royster &
  Axtell, from the bank which held them as collateral.He is
  willing to pay you par for your Bonds, without any accrued
  interest, however.If you will consent to sell, the Company can
  proceed without reorganization but, if you decline, he will
  foreclose under the terms of the mortgage.We have suggested the
  propriety and the economy to him--since he owns or controls all
  the stock--of not purchasing your bonds, and, frankly, have told
  him it is worse than bad business to do so.But he refuses to be
  advised, insisting that he must be the sole owner, and that he is
  willing to submit to the additional expense rather than go
  through the tedious proceeding for foreclosure and sale.We are
  prepared to honor a sight-draft with the Bonds attached, or to
  pay cash on presentation and transfer.We shall be obliged for a
  prompt reply."Yours very truly,

                                              "R. J."What the devil!----"

He read it a second time.No, he wasn't asleep--it was all there,
typewritten and duly signed.Two hundred thousand dollars!--honor sight
draft, or pay cash on presentation and transfer!Then he passed it across to Macloud."Read this aloud, will you,--I want to see if I'm quite sane!"Macloud was at his favorite occupation--blowing smoke rings through one
another, and watching them spiral upward toward the ceiling.he said, as Croyden's words roused him from his
meditation.He and Blaxham had spent considerable time on that letter, trying to
explain the reason for the purchase, and the foolishly high price they
were offering, in such a way as to mislead Croyden."It is typewritten, you haven't a chance to get wrong!"he exclaimed.... "So, I wasn't crazy: and either
Blaxham is lying or his customer needs a guardian--which is it?""I don't see that it need concern you, in the least, which it is," said
Macloud."Be grateful for the offer--and accept by wireless or any
other way that's quicker.""But the bonds aren't worth five cents on the dollar!""So much the more reason to hustle the deal through.You may have slipped up on the Parmenter treasure, but you
have struck it here.""There's something queer about that
letter."Macloud smoked his cigar, and smiled."Blaxham's customer
may have the willies--indeed, he as much as intimates that such is the
case--but, thank God!we're not obliged to have a commission-in-lunacy
appointed on everybody who makes a silly stock or bond purchase.If we
were, we either would have no markets, or the courts would have time
for nothing else.take what the gods have given you
and be glad.You can return to
Northumberland, resume the old life, and be happy ever after;--or you
can live here, and there, and everywhere.You're unattached--not even a
light-o'-love to squander your money, and pester you for gowns and
hats, and get in a hell of a temper--and be false to you, besides.""No, I haven't one of them, thank God!""I've got
troubles enough of my own."It clears some of them away--if I take it."man, you're not thinking, seriously, of refusing?""It will put me on 'easy street,'" Croyden observed."And it comes with remarkable timeliness--so timely, indeed, as to be
suspicious.""It's a bona fide offer--there's no trouble on that score.""This," said Croyden: "I'm broke--finally.The Parmenter treasure is
moonshine, so far as I'm concerned.I'm down on my uppers, so to
speak--my only assets are some worthless bonds.along comes an
offer for them at par--two hundred thousand dollars for nothing!I
fancy, old man, there is a friend back of this offer--the only friend I
have in the world--and I did not think that even he was kind and
self-sacrificing enough to do it.--I'm grateful, Colin, grateful from
the heart, believe me, but I can't take your money."exclaimed Macloud--"you do me too much credit, Croyden.I'm
ashamed to admit it, but I never thought of the bonds, or of helping
you out, in your trouble.It's a way we have in Northumberland.We may
feel for misfortune, but it rarely gets as far as our pockets.Don't
imagine for a moment that I'm the purchaser.I'm not, though I wish,
now, that I was.""Will you give me your word on that?""I most assuredly will," Macloud answered.He looked at the
letter again.... "And, yet, it is very suspicious, very suspicious....
I wonder, could I ascertain the name of the purchaser of the stocks and
bonds, from the Trust Company who held them as collateral?""They won't know," said Macloud."Blaxham & Company bought them at the
public sale.""I could try the transfer agent, or the registrar.""They never tell anything, as you are aware," Macloud replied."I could refuse to sell unless Blaxham & Company disclosed their
customer.""Yes, you could--and, likely, lose the sale; they won't disclose.However, that's your business," Macloud observed; "though, it's a pity
to tilt at windmills, for a foolish notion."Croyden creased and uncreased the letter--thinking.Macloud resumed the smoke rings--and waited.It had proved easier than
he had anticipated.Croyden had not once thought of Elaine
Cavendish--and his simple word had been sufficient to clear
himself....

At length, Croyden put the letter back in its envelope and looked up."I'll sell the bonds," he said--"forward them at once with draft
attached, if you will witness my signature to the transfer.But it's a
queer proceeding, a queer proceeding: paying good money for bad!""That's his business--not yours," said Macloud, easily.Croyden went to the escritoire and took the bonds from one of the
drawers."You can judge, from the place I keep them, how much I thought them
worth!"When they were duly transferred and witnessed, Croyden attached a draft
drawn on an ordinary sheet of paper, dated Northumberland, and payable
to his account at the Tuscarora Trust Company.He placed them in an
envelope, sealed it and, enclosing it in a second envelope, passed it
over to Macloud."I don't care to inform them as to my whereabouts," he remarked, "so,
if you don't mind, I'll trouble you to address this to some one in New
York or Philadelphia, with a request that he mail the enclosed envelope
for you."Macloud, when he had done as requested, laid aside the pen and looked
inquiringly at Croyden."Which, being interpreted," he said, "might mean that you don't intend
to return to Northumberland.""The interpretation does not go quite so far; it means, simply, that I
have not decided.""It's a question of resolution, not of inclination," Croyden answered."I don't know whether I've sufficient resolution to go, and sufficient
resolution to stay, if I do go.It may be easier not to go, at all--to
live here, and wander, elsewhere, when the spirit moves.""I've been thinking over the proposition you
recently advanced of the folly of a relatively poor man marrying a rich
girl," he said, "and you're all wrong.It's a question of the
respective pair, not a theory that can be generalized over.I admit,
the man should not be a pauper, but, if he have enough money to support
_himself_, and the girl love him and he loves the girl, the fact that
she has gobs more money, won't send them on the rocks.It's up to the
pair, I repeat.""Meaning, that it would be up to Elaine Cavendish and me?""I wish I could be so sure," Croyden reflected."Sure of the girl, as
well as sure of myself.""What are you doubtful about--yourself?"Croyden laughed, a trifle self-consciously."I fancy I could manage myself," he said."Try her!--she's worth the try.""Get the miserable money out of your mind a moment, will you?--you're
hipped on it!""All right, old man, anything for peace!Tell me, did you see her, when
you were home?""I did--I dined with her.""You--she talked Croyden at least seven-eighths of the time; I, the
other eighth."Anything left of the
victim, afterward?""I refuse to become facetious," Macloud responded.Then he threw his
cigar into the grate and arose."It matters not what was said, nor who
said it!If you will permit me the advice, you will take your chance
while you have it.""You have--more than a chance, if you act, now----" He walked across to
the window.He would let that sink in.--"How's the Symphony in Blue?""As charming as ever--and prepared for your coming.""As charming as ever, and prepared for your coming.""I left that finality for you--being the person most interested.""When did you arrange for me to go over?""She confided in you, I suppose?""Not directly; she let me infer it.""In other words, you worked your imagination--overtime!""It's a pity you couldn't work it a bit over the Parmenter
jewels."I'm done with the Parmenter jewels!""But they're not done with you, my friend.So long as you live, they'll
be present with you.You'll be hunting for them in your dreams.""Meet me to-night in dream-land!""Well, they're not
likely to disturb my slumbers--unless--there was a rather queer thing
happened, last night, Colin.""Yes!--I got in to Hampton, in the evening; about nine o'clock, I was
returning to Clarendon when, at the gates, I was accosted by a tall,
well-dressed stranger.Here is the substance of our talk.... What do
you make of it?""It seems to me the fellow made it very plain," Macloud returned,
"except on one possible point.He evidently believes we found the
treasure.""Then, he knows that you came direct from Annapolis to Hampton--I mean,
you didn't visit a bank nor other place where you could have deposited
the jewels.Ergo, the jewels are still in your possession, according to
his theory, and he is going to make a try for them while they are
within reach.He hoped, by that
means, to induce you to keep the jewels on the premises--not to make
evidence against yourself, which could be traced by the United States,
by depositing them in any bank.""Why shouldn't I have taken them to a dealer in precious stones?""Because that would make the best sort of evidence against you.You
must remember, he thinks you have the jewels, and that you will try to
conceal it, pending a Government investigation.""You make him a very canny gentleman.""No--I make him only a clever rogue, which, by your own account, he
is.""And the more clever he is, the more he will have his wits' work for
naught.There's some compensation in everything--even in failure!""It would be a bit annoying," observed Macloud, "to be visited by
burglars, who are obsessed with the idea that you have a fortune
concealed on the premises, and are bent on obtaining it.""Annoying?--not a bit!""I should rather enjoy the
sport of putting them to flight.""Or of being bound, and gagged, and ill-treated."you've transferred your robber-barons from Northumberland to the
Eastern Shore.""The robber-barons were still on the
job in Northumberland.These are banditti, disguised as burglars, about
to hold you up for ransom.""I wish I had your fine imagination," scoffed Croyden."I could make a
fortune writing fiction.""Oh, you're not so bad yourself!""It's bully good to think you're coming back to us!""Here, Moses," said Croyden, "take this letter down to the post
office--I want it to catch the first mail.""I fancy you haven't heard of the stranger since last evening?""And of course you haven't told any one?""I suppose you even told
her the entire story--from the finding of the letter down to date.""I did!--and showed her the letter besides."No reason in the world, my dear fellow--except that in twenty-four
hours the dear public will know it, and we shall be town curiosities.""We don't have to remain," said Croyden, with affected seriousness--"there
are trains out, you know, as well as in.""I don't want to go away--I came here to visit you.""But we can't take the Symphony in Blue!"You don't think I came down here to see only
you, after having just spent nearly four weeks with you, in that fool
quest on Greenberry Point?"He turned, suddenly, and faced Croyden."Think she will retail it to the
dear public?""Because, if you do, you might mention it to her--there, she goes,
now!"said Macloud, whirling around toward the window.On the opposite side of
the street, Miss Carrington--in a tailored gown of blue broadcloth,
close fitting and short in the skirt, with a velvet toque to match--was
swinging briskly back from town.Macloud watched her a moment in silence."The old man is done for, at last!""Look at the poise of the
head, and ease of carriage, and the way she puts down her feet!--that's
the way to tell a woman."You better go over," said his friend."It's about the tea hour, she'll
brew you a cup.""And I'll drink it--as much as she will give me.I despise the stuff,
but I'll drink it!""She'll put rum in it, if you prefer!"laughed Croyden; "or make you a
high ball, or you can have it straight--just as you want.""I'll be over, presently," Croyden replied."_I_ don't want any tea,
you know.""Come along, as soon as you
wish--but don't come _too soon_."XV

AN OLD RUSE


Macloud found Miss Carrington plucking a few belated roses, which,
somehow, had escaped the frost.She looked up at his approach, and smiled--the bewilderingly bewitching
smile which lighted her whole countenance and seemed to say so much."And, if I may, to you," he replied.After them, you belong to _me_," she laughed."I don't know--it was the order of speech, and the order of
acquaintance," with a naive look."But not the order of--regard.""You did it very well for a--novice.""You decline to accept it?--Very well, sir, very well!""I can't accept, and be honest," he replied.Perchance,
you will accept a reward: a cup of tea--or a high ball!""Perchance, I will--the high ball!"She looked at him, with a sly smile."You know that I have just returned," she said."I saw you in the
window at Clarendon.""And you came over at once--prepared to be surprised that I was here.""And found you waiting for me--just as I expected."Peccavi!_" he said humbly."_Te absolvo!_" she replied, solemnly."Now, let us make a fresh
start--by going for a walk.You can postpone the high ball until we
return.""I can postpone the high ball for ever," he averred."Meaning, you could walk forever, or you're not thirsty?""Meaning, I could walk forever _with you_--on, and on, and on----"

"Until you walked into the Bay--I understand.I'll take the will for
the deed--the water's rather chilly at this season of the year."Macloud held up his hand, in mock despair."Let us make a third start--drop the attempt to be clever and talk
sense.I think I can do it, if I try."As they came out on the side walk, Croyden was going down the street."I've not forgot your admonition, so don't be uneasy," he observed to
Macloud."I'm going to town now, I'll be back in about half an hour--is
that too soon?"Miss Carrington looked at Macloud, quizzically, but made no comment."The regulation walk--to the Cemetery and back.""It's the favorite walk, here," she explained--"the most picturesque
and the smoothest.""To say nothing of accustoming the people to their future home,"
Macloud remarked."You're not used to the ways of small towns--the Cemetery is a resort,
a place to spend a while, a place to visit.""Does it make death any easier to hob-nob with it?""I shouldn't think so," she replied."However, I can see how it would
induce morbidity, though there are those who are happiest only when
they're miserable.""Such people ought to live in a morgue," agreed Macloud."However
we're safe enough--we can go to the Cemetery with impunity.""There are some rather queer old headstones, out there," she said."Remorse and the inevitable pay-up for earthly transgression seem to be
the leading subjects.There is one in the Duval lot--the Duvals from
whom Mr.Croyden got Clarendon, you know--and I never have been able to
understand just what it means.It is erected to the memory of one
Robert Parmenter, and has cut in the slab the legend: 'He feared nor
man, nor god, nor devil,' and below it, a man on his knees making
supplication to one standing over him.If he feared nor man, nor god,
nor devil, why should he be imploring mercy from any one?""Do you know who Parmenter was?""No--but I presume a connection of the family, from having been buried
with them.""You read his letter only last evening--his letter to Marmaduke
Duval.""His letter to Marmaduke Duval!""I didn't read any----"

"Robert Parmenter is the pirate who buried the treasure on Greenberry
Point," he interrupted.Then, suddenly, a light broke in on her."I see!--I didn't look at the name signed to the letter.And the
cutting on the tombstone----?""Is a victim begging mercy from him," said Macloud."I like that
Marmaduke Duval--there's something fine in a man, in those times,
bringing the old buccaneer over from Annapolis and burying him beside
the place where he, himself, some day would rest.--That is
friendship!""It was a sad day in Hampton
when the Colonel died.""He left a good deputy," Macloud replied."Croyden is well-born and
well-bred (the former does not always comprehend the latter, these
days), and of Southern blood on his mother's side.""We are a bit clannish,
still.""Delighted to hear you confess it!Sandra moved to the kitchen."Mine doesn't go so far South, however, as Croyden's--only,
to Virginia."I knew there was some reason for my liking you!""Than your Southern ancestors?--isn't that enough?""Not if there be a means to increase it.""Southern blood is never satisfied with _some_ things--it always wants
more!""Is the disposition to want more, in Southerners, confined to the male
sex?""In _some things_--yes, unquestionably yes!"Croyden told you of his experience, last
evening?""What possible danger could there be--the treasure isn't at
Clarendon.""But they think it is--and desperate men sometimes take desperate
means, when they feel sure that money is hidden on the premises.""In a town the size of Hampton, every stranger is known.""How will that advantage, in the prevention of the crime?""They don't need stay in the town--they can come in an automobile.""They could also drive, or walk, or come by boat," he added."They are not so likely to try it if there are two in the house.Do you
intend to remain at Clarendon some time?""It depends--on how you treat me.""I engage to be nice for--two weeks!""Done!--I'm booked for two weeks, at least.""And when the two weeks have expired we shall consider whether to
extend the period."She flung him a look that was delightfully alluring."Do you wish me to--consider that?""If you will," he said, bending down."This pace is getting rather
brisk--did you notice it, Mr."You're in a fast class, Miss Carrington.""Now don't misunderstand me----"

"You were speaking in the language of the race track, I presume.""A Southern girl usually loves--horses," with a tantalizing smile."It is well for you this is a public street," he said."But then if it hadn't been, you would not have ventured to tempt me,"
he added."I'm grateful for the temptation, at any rate.""No, not likely--but his first that he has resisted."The fact that we are on a public street would
not restrain you.There was absolutely no one within sight--and you
knew it.""This is rather faster than the former going!""Any way, here is
the Cemetery, and we dare not go faster than a walk in it.Yonder, just
within the gates, is the Duval burial place.Come, I'll show you
Parmenter's grave?"They crossed to it--marked by a blue slate slab, which covered it
entirely.The inscription, cut in script, was faint in places and
blurred by moss, in others.Macloud stooped and, with his knife, scratched out the latter."He died two days after the letter was written: May 12, 1738," said he.Duval did not know it, I reckon.""See, here is the picture--it stands out very plainly," said Miss
Carrington, indicating with the point of her shoe."I'm not given to moralizing, particularly over a grave," observed
Macloud, "but it's queer to think that the old pirate, who had so much
blood and death on his hands, who buried the treasure, and who wrote
the letter, lies at our feet; and we--or rather Croyden is the heir of
that treasure, and that we searched and dug all over Greenberry Point,
committed violence, were threatened with violence, did things
surreptitiously, are threatened, anew, with blackmail and
violence----"

"Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways," she quoted."It does seem one cannot get away from its pollution.It was gathered
in crime and crime clings to it, still.However, I fancy Croyden would
willingly chance the danger, if he could unearth the casket.""And is there no hope of finding it?""Absolutely none--there's half a million over on Greenberry Point, or
in the water close by, and none will ever see it--except by accident.""My own idea--and Croyden's (as he has,
doubtless, explained to you) is that the place, where Parmenter buried
the jewels, is now under water, possibly close to the shore.We dragged
every inch of the bottom, which has been washed away to a depth more
than sufficient to uncover the iron box, but found nothing.A great
storm, such as they say sometimes breaks over the Chesapeake, may wash
it on the beach--that, I think, is the only way it will ever be
found.... It makes everything seem very real to have stood by
Parmenter's grave!"he said, thoughtful, as they turned back toward
town.On nearing the Carrington house, they saw Croyden approaching."I've been communing with Parmenter," said Macloud."I didn't know there was a spiritualistic medium in Hampton!"Well, did he help you to locate his jewel box?""He wasn't especially communicative--he was in his grave.""That isn't surprising--he's been dead something over one hundred and
seventy years."He's buried with the Duvals in the Cemetery, here."one more circumstance to prove the
letter speaks the truth.We find his
will, probated with Marmaduke Duval as executor, we even discover a
notice of his death in the _Gazette_, and now, finally, you find his
body--or the place of its interment!what is really
worth while, we can't find.""Come into the house--I'll give you something to soothe your feelings
temporarily," said Miss Carrington.They encountered Miss Erskine just coming from the library on her way
to the door."My dear Davila, so glad to see you!"Croyden,
we thought you had deserted us, and just when we're trying to make you
feel at home."I'm delighted to be back," said Croyden."The Carringtons seemed
genuinely glad to see me--and, now, if I may include you, I'm quite
content to return," and he shook her hand, as though he meant it."Of course you may believe it," with an inane giggle."I'm going to
bring my art class over to Clarendon to revel in your treasures, some
day, soon.You'll be at home to them, won't you, dear Mr.I shall take pleasure in being at home," Croyden replied,
soberly.Then Macloud, who was talking with the Captain, was called over and
presented, that being, Miss Carrington thought, the quickest method of
getting rid of her.The evident intention to remain until he was
presented, being made entirely obvious by Miss Erskine, who, after she
had bubbled a bit more, departed."What is her name, I didn't catch it?--and" (observing smiles on
Croyden and Miss Carrington's faces) "what is she?""I think father can explain, in more appropriate language!""She's the most intolerable nuisance and greatest fool in Hampton!""A red flag to a bull isn't in it with Miss Erskine and father," Miss
Carrington observed."But I hide it pretty well--while she's here," he protested."If she's not here too long--and you can get away, in time."When the two men left the Carrington place, darkness had fallen.As
they approached Clarendon, the welcoming brightness of a well-lighted
house sprang out to greet them.It was Croyden's one extravagance--to
have plenty of illumination.He had always been accustomed to it, and
the gloom, at night, of the village residence, bright only in library
or living room--with, maybe, a timid taper in the hall--set his nerves
on edge.And Moses, with considerable wonder
at, to his mind, the waste of gas, and much grumbling to himself and
Josephine, obeyed.They had finished dinner and were smoking their cigars in the library,
when Croyden, suddenly bethinking himself of a matter which he had
forgotten, arose and pulled the bell.said old Mose a moment later from the doorway."Moses, who is the best carpenter in town?""Mistah Snyder, seh--he wuz heah dis arfternoon, yo knows, seh!""I didn't know it," said Croyden."Why yo sont 'im, seh.""Dat's mons'us 'culiar, seh--he said yo sont 'im.He com'd 'torrectly
arfter yo lef!Him an' a'nudder man, seh--I didn't know the nudder man,
hows'ever.""Dey sed yo warn dem to look over all de place, seh, an' see what
repairs wuz necessary, and fix dem.Dey wuz heah a'most two hours, I
s'pose.""Do you mean they were
in this house for two hours?"I didn't stays wid em, seh--I knows
Mistah Snyder well; he's bin heah off'n to wuk befo' yo cum, seh.But I
seed dem gwine th'oo de drawers, an' poundin on the floohs, seh.Dey
went down to de cellar, too, seh, an wuz dyar quite a while."seh, don't you t'inks I knows 'im?I knows 'im from de time
he wuz so high.""Go down and tell Snyder I want to see him, either
to-night or in the morning."The <DW64> bowed, and departed.Croyden got up and went to the escritoire: the drawers were in
confusion.He glanced at the book-cases: the books were disarranged.He
turned and looked, questioningly, at Macloud--and a smile slowly
overspread his face."Well, the tall gentleman has visited us!""I wondered how long you would be coming to it!""It's the old ruse, in a slightly modified form.Instead of a
telephone or gas inspector, it was a workman whom the servant knew; a
little more trouble in disguising himself, but vastly more satisfactory
in results.""They are clever rogues," said Croyden--"and the disguise must have
been pretty accurate to deceive Moses.""Disguise is their business," Macloud replied, laconically."If they're
not proficient in it, they go to prison--sure.""And if they _are_ proficient, they go--sometimes.""We'll make a tour of inspection--they couldn't find what they wanted,
so we'll see what they took."Every drawer was turned upside down, every
closet awry, every place, where the jewels could be concealed, bore
evidence of having been inspected--nothing, apparently, had been
missed.They had gone through the house completely, even into the
garret, where every board that was loose had evidently been taken up
and replaced--some of them carelessly.Not a thing was gone, so far as Croyden could judge--possibly, because
there was no money in the house; probably, because they were looking
for jewels, and scorned anything of moderate value."Really, this thing grows interesting--if it were not so ridiculous,"
said Croyden."I'm willing to go to almost any trouble to convince them
I haven't the treasure--just to be rid of them."Abduction, maybe," Macloud suggested."Some night a black cloth will
be thrown over your head, you'll be tossed into a cab--I mean, an
automobile--and borne off for ransom like Charlie Ross of fading
memory.""Moral--don't venture out after sunset!""And don't venture out at any time without a revolver handy and a good
pair of legs," added Macloud."I can work the legs better than I can the revolver.""Or, to make sure, you might have a guard of honor and a gatling gun.""You're appointed to the position--provide yourself with the gun!"said Macloud, "it would be well to take some
precaution.They seem obsessed with the idea that you have the jewels,
here--and they evidently intend to get a share, if it's possible."Macloud shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.XVI

THE MARABOU MUFF


The next two weeks passed uneventfully.The thieves did not manifest
themselves, and the Government authorities did nothing to suggest that
they had been informed of the Parmenter treasure.Macloud had developed an increasing fondness for Miss Carrington's
society, which she, on her part, seemed to accept with placid
equanimity.They rode, they drove, they walked, they sailed when the
weather warranted--and the weather had recovered from its fit of the
blues, and was lazy and warm and languid.In short, they did everything
which is commonly supposed to denote a growing fondness for each
other.Croyden had been paid promptly for the Virginia Development Company
bonds, and was once more on "comfortable street," as he expressed it.But he spoke no word of returning to Northumberland.On the contrary,
he settled down to enjoy the life of the village, social and otherwise.He was nice to all the girls, but showed a marked preference for Miss
Carrington; which, however, did not trouble his friend, in the least.Macloud was quite willing to run the risk with Croyden.He was
confident that the call of the old life, the memory of the girl that
was, and that was still, would be enough to hold Geoffrey from more
than firm friendship.He was not quite sure of himself, however--that
he wanted to marry.And he was entirely sure she had not decided
whether she wanted him--that was what gave him his lease of life; if
she decided _for_ him, he knew that he would decide for her--and
quickly.Then, one day, came a letter--forwarded by the Club, where he had left
his address with instructions that it be divulged to no one.It was
dated Northumberland, and read:

  "My dear Colin--

  "It is useless, between us, to dissemble, and I'm not going to
  try it.I want to know whether Geoffrey Croyden is coming back to
  Northumberland?If he is not
  coming and there is no one else--won't you tell me where you are?(I don't ask you to reveal his address, you see.)I shall come
  down--if only for an hour, between trains--and give him his
  chance.It is radically improper, according to accepted
  notions--but notions don't bother me, when they stand (as I am
  sure they do, in this case), in the way of happiness."Sincerely,

                                           "Elaine Cavendish."At dinner, Macloud casually remarked:

"I ought to go out to Northumberland, this week, for a short time,
won't you go along?""I'm not going back to Northumberland," he said."I'll promise to come back
with you in two days at the most.""You can easily find your
way back.For me, it's easier to stay away from Northumberland, than to
go away from it, _again_."And Macloud, being wise, dropped the conversation, saying only:

"Well, I may not have to go."A little later, as he sat in the drawing-room at Carringtons', he
broached a matter which had been on his mind for some time--working
around to it gradually, with Croyden the burden of their talk.When his
opportunity came--as it was bound to do--he took it without
hesitation."Croyden had two reasons for leaving
Northumberland: one of them has been eliminated; the other is stronger
than ever.""A woman who has plenty of money--more than she can ever
spend, indeed.""What was the
trouble--wouldn't she have him?""Her money--she has so much!--So much, that, in comparison, he is a
mere pauper:--twenty millions against two hundred thousand.""If she be willing, I can't see why he is shy?""He says it is all right for a poor girl to marry a rich man, but not
for a poor man to marry a rich girl.His idea is, that the husband
should be able to maintain his wife according to her condition.To
marry else, he says, is giving hostages to fortune, and is derogatory
to that mutual respect which should exist between them.""We all give hostages to fortune when we marry!""What is it you want me to do?"she asked hastily--"or can I do
anything?""You can ask Miss Cavendish to visit you for a
few days.""Can you, by any possibility, mean Elaine Cavendish?""That's exactly who I do mean--do you know her?""After a fashion--we went to Dobbs Ferry together.""She will think it a trifle peculiar.""On the contrary, she'll think it more than kind--a positive favor.You
see, she knows I'm with Croyden, but she doesn't know where; so she
wrote to me at my Club and they forwarded it.Croyden left
Northumberland without a word--and no one is aware of his residence but
me.She asks that I tell her where _I_ am.Then she intends to come
down and give Croyden a last chance.I want to help her--and your
invitation will be right to the point--she'll jump at it.""Come, we'll work out the letter
together.""Would I not be permitted to kiss you as Miss Cavendish's deputy?""Miss Cavendish can be her own deputy," she answered.--"Moreover, it
would be premature."The second morning after, when Elaine Cavendish's maid brought her
breakfast, Miss Carrington's letter was on the tray among tradesmen's
circulars, invitations, and friendly correspondence.She did not recognize the handwriting, and the postmark was unfamiliar,
wherefore, coupled with the fact that it was addressed in a
particularly stylish hand, she opened it first.It was very brief, very
succinct, very informing, and very satisfactory."Ashburton,

                             "Hampton, Md."My dear Elaine:--

  "Mr.Macloud tells me you are contemplating coming down to the
  Eastern Shore to look for a country-place.Let me advise
  Hampton--there are some delightful old residences in this
  vicinity which positively are crying for a purchaser.Geoffrey
  Croyden, whom you know, I believe, is resident here, and is
  thinking of making it his home permanently.If you can be
  persuaded to come, you are to stay with me--the hotels are simply
  impossible, and I shall be more than delighted to have you.We
  can talk over old times at Dobbs, and have a nice little visit
  together.Don't trouble to write--just wire the time of your
  arrival--and come before the good weather departs."With lots of love,

                                          "Davila Carrington."Elaine Cavendish read the letter slowly--and smiled."Colin is rather a diplomat--he
managed it with exceeding adroitness--and the letter is admirably
worded.I'd forgotten about
Davila Carrington, and I reckon she had forgotten me, till he somehow
found it out and jogged her memory.She went to her desk and wrote this wire,
in answer:

  "Miss Davila Carrington,

       "Hampton, Md."I shall be with you Friday, on morning train.Miss Carrington showed the wire to Macloud."Now, I've done all that I can; the rest is in your hands," she said."I'll cooperate, but you are the general.""Until Elaine comes--she will manage it then," Macloud answered.And on Friday morning, a little before noon, Miss Cavendish arrived.Miss Carrington, alone, met her at the station."You're just the same Davila I'd forgotten for years," said she,
laughingly, as they walked across the platform to the waiting carriage."And you're the same I had forgotten," Davila replied."And it's just as delightful to be able to remember," was the reply.Just after they left the business section, on the drive out, Miss
Carrington saw Croyden and Macloud coming down the street.Evidently
Macloud had not been able to detain him at home until she got her
charge safely into Ashburton.She glanced at Miss Cavendish--she had
seen them, also, and, settling back into the corner of the phaeton, she
hid her face with her Marabou muff.as both men raised their
hats--and drove straight on."Who was the girl with Miss Carrington?""I noticed a bag in the trap,
however, so I reckon she's a guest.""Your opportunity, for the
solitariness of two, will be limited."It depends on what she is--I'm not
sacrificing myself on the altar of general unattractiveness.""Rest easy, I'll fuss her to the limit.You shan't have her to
plead for an excuse."I'm not worried about the guest," Macloud
remarked."There was a certain style about as much of her as I could see which
promised very well," Croyden remarked."I think this would be a good
day to drop in for tea.""And if you find her something over sixty, you'll gallantly shove her
off on me, and preempt Miss Carrington."She's not over sixty--and you know it.You're by no means as blind as
you would have me believe.In fact, now that I think of it, there was
something about her that seems familiar.""You're an adept in many things," laughed Macloud, "but, I reckon,
you're not up to recognizing a brown coat and a brown hat.I think I've
seen the combination once or twice before on a woman.""Well, what about tea-time--shall we go over?""I haven't the slightest objection----"

"Really!""----to your going along with me--I'm expected!"pretty soon it will be: 'Come over and
see us, won't you?'""I trust so," said Macloud, placidly.--"But, as you're never coming
back to Northumberland, it's a bit impossible.""I've a faint recollection of having heard that remark before.""I dare say, it's popular there on smoky days.""Which is the same as saying it's popular there any time.""No, I don't mean that; Northumberland isn't half so bad as it's
painted.We may make fun of it--but we like it, just the same.""Yes, I suppose we do," said Macloud."Though we get mighty sick of
seeing every scatterbrain who sets fire to the Great White Way branded
by the newspapers as a Northumberland millionaire.We've got our share
of fools, but we haven't a monopoly of them, by any means.""We had a marvelously large crop, however, running loose at one time,
recently!""True!--and there's the reason for it, as well as the fallacy.Because
half a hundred light-weights were made millionaires over night, and,
top heavy, straightway went the devil's pace, doesn't imply that the
entire town is mad.""It's no worse than any other big town--and
the fellows with unsavory reputations aren't representative.They just
came all in a bunch.The misfortune is, that the whole country saw the
fireworks, and it hasn't forgot the lurid display.""And isn't likely to very soon," Macloud responded, "with the whole
Municipal Government rotten to the core, councilmen falling over one
another in their eagerness to plead _nolle contendere_ and escape the
penitentiary, bankers in jail for bribery, or fighting extradition; and
graft!permeating every department of the civic life--and
published by the newspapers' broadcast, through the land, for all the
world to read, while the people, as a body, sit supine, and meekly
suffer the robbers to remain.The trouble with the Northumberlander is,
that so long as he is not the immediate victim of a hold up, he is
quiescent.Let him be touched direct--by burglary, by theft, by
embezzlement--and the yell he lets out wakes the entire bailiwick.""It's the same everywhere," said Croyden."No, it's not,--other communities have waked up--Northumberland hasn't.There is too much of the moneyed interest to be looked after; and the
councilmen know it, and are out for the stuff, as brazen as the
street-walker, and vastly more insistent.--I'm going in here, for some
cigarettes--when I come out, we'll change the talk to something less
irritating.I like Northumberland, but I despise about ninety-nine one
hundredths of its inhabitants."When he returned, Croyden was gazing after an automobile which was
disappearing in a cloud of dust."The fellow driving, unless I am mightily
fooled, is the same who stopped me on the street, in front of
Clarendon," he said."That's interesting--any one with him?""He isn't travelling around with
a petticoat--at least, if he's thinking of tackling you.""It isn't likely, I admit--but suppose he is?""He is leaving here as fast as the wheels will turn.""I've got a very accurate memory for faces," said Croyden.If it was he, and he has some new scheme, it will be
declared in due time.So long as they think you have the jewels, they will try
for them.There's Captain Carrington standing at his office door."Sitting up to grandfather-in-law!""Distinctly
proper, sir, distinctly proper!Go and chat with him; I'll stop for
you, presently."*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the two women had continued on to Ashburton.Elaine asked, dropping her muff from before her
face, when they were past the two men."It would make a difference in my--attitude toward him when we met!"The
fact that Croyden did not come out and stop them, that he let them go
on, was sufficient proof that he had not recognized her."You see, I am assuming that you know why I wanted to come to Hampton,"
Elaine said, when, her greeting made to Mrs.Carrington, she had
carried Davila along to her room."And you made it very easy for me to come.""I did as I thought you would want--and as I know you would do with me
were I in a similar position.""I'm sadly afraid I should not have thought of you, were you----"

"Oh, yes, you would!If you had been in a small town, and Mr.Croyden
had told you of my difficulty----"

"As _Mr.Macloud_ told you of mine--I see, dear.""Not exactly that," said Davila, blushing.Macloud has been very
attentive and very nice and all that, you know, but you mustn't forget
there are not many girls here, and I'm convenient, and--I don't take
him seriously.""I don't know--sometimes I think he does, and sometimes I think he
doesn't!""He is an accomplished flirt and difficult to
gauge.""Well, let me tell you one fact, for your information: there isn't a
more indifferent man in Northumberland.He goes everywhere, is in great
demand, is enormously popular, yet, I've never known him to have even
an affair.He is armor-plated--but he is a dear, a perfect dear,
Davila!"she said, with heightening color--and Elaine said no more,
then.Croyden alone, for the first time, or in
company?""I confess I don't know, but I think, however, it would be better to
have a few words with Colin, first--if it can be arranged."Macloud is to come in a moment before
luncheon, if he can find an excuse that will not include Mr."Is an excuse difficult to find--or is any, even, needed?""He doesn't usually come before four--that's the tea hour in Hampton.""If you've got him into the tea habit, you can
do what you want with him--he will eat out of your hand.""I never tried him with tea," said Davila."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure."Mary journeyed to the bedroom."It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *




Transcriber's note:

Minor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors;
otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the
author's words and intent.Juan had never ceased for a moment to blow his tuneful flute,
and it now became apparent that the notes had struck their hearing at
the same time.To say that they were charmed would but half express
their ecstatic condition.The huge old serpent lolled along the waters for a hundred feet or so,
and never so much as shook the spray from his hide.He looked like
Milton's portrait of Satan, stretched out upon the burning marl of hell.In perfect contrast with the sea monster, the beautiful mermaiden lifted
her pallid face above the water, dripping with the crystal tears of the
lake, and gathering her long raven locks, that floated like the train of
a meteor down her back, she carelessly flung them across her swelling
bosom, as if to reproach us for gazing upon her beauteous form.If she were entranced by the music, I was
not less so with her beauty.Presently the roseate hues of a dying
dolphin played athwart her brow and cheeks, and ere long a gentle sigh,
as if stolen from the trembling chords of an Eolian harp, issued from
her coral lips.Again and again it broke forth, until it beat in full
symphony with the cadences of Juan's rustic flute.My attention was at this moment aroused by the suspicious clicking of my
comrade's rifle.Turning around suddenly, I beheld Liehard, with his
piece leveled at the unconscious mermaid.But the
warning came too late, for instantaneously the quick report of his rifle
and the terrific shriek of the mermaid broke the noontide stillness;
and, rearing her bleeding form almost entirely out of the water, she
plunged headlong forwards, a corpse.Beholding his prey, powerless
within his grasp, the serpent splashed toward her, and, ere I could cock
my rifle, he had seized her unresisting body, and sank with it into the
mysterious caverns of the lake.At this instant, I gave a loud outcry,
as if in pain.On opening my eyes, my wife was bending over me, the
midday sun was shining in my face, Dick Barter was spinning some
confounded yarn about the Bay of Biscay and the rum trade of Jamaica,
and the sloop _Edith Beaty_ was still riding at anchor off the wild
glen, and gazing tranquilly at her ugly image in the crystal mirror of
Lake Bigler.[Decoration]

X._ROSENTHAL'S ELAINE._


    I stood and gazed far out into the waste;
    No dip of oar broke on the listening ear;
    But the quick rippling of the inward flood
    Gave warning of approaching argosy.Adown the west, the day's last fleeting gleam
    Faded and died, and left the world in gloom.Hope hung no star up in the murky east
    To cheer the soul, or guide the pilgrim's way.Black frown'd the heavens, and black the answering earth
    Reflected from her watery wastes the night.Once again
    The dripping oar dipped in its silver blade,
    Parting the waves, as smiles part beauty's lips.Betwixt me and the curtain of the cloud,
    Close down by the horizon's verge, there crept
    From out the darkness, barge and crew and freight,
    Sailless and voiceless, all!Then I knew
    I stood upon the brink of Time.I saw
    Before me Death's swift river sweep along
    And bear its burden to the grave.One seamew screamed, in solitary woe;
    "Elaine!stole back the echo, weird
    And musical, from off the further shore.Then burst a chorus wild, "Elaine!And gazing upward through the twilight haze,
    Mine eyes beheld King Arthur's phantom Court.There stood the sturdy monarch: he who drove
    The hordes of Hengist from old Albion's strand;
    And, leaning on his stalwart arm, his queen,
    The fair, the false, but trusted Guinevere!And there, like the statue of a demi-god,
    In marble wrought by some old Grecian hand,
    With eyes downcast, towered Lancelot of the Lake.Lavaine and Torre, the heirs of Astolat,
    And he, the sorrowing Sire of the Dead,
    Together with a throng of valiant knights
    And ladies fair, were gathered as of yore,
    At the Round Table of bold Arthur's Court.There, too, was Tristram, leaning on his lance,
    Whose eyes alone of all that weeping host
    Swam not in tears; but indignation burned
    Red in their sockets, like volcanic fires,
    And from their blazing depths a Fury shot
    Her hissing arrows at the guilty pair.Then Lancelot, advancing to the front,
    With glance transfixed upon the canvas true
    That sheds immortal fame on ROSENTHAL,
    Thus chanted forth his Requiem for the Dead:

        Fresh as the water in the fountain,
          Fair as the lily by its side,
        Pure as the snow upon the mountain,
                  Is the angel
                    Elaine!Day after day she grew fairer,
          As she pined away in sorrow, at my side;
        No pearl in the ocean could be rarer
                 Than the angel
                    Elaine!The hours passed away all unheeded,
          For love hath no landmarks in its tide.No child of misfortune ever pleaded
                    In vain
                   To Elaine!Here, where sad Tamesis is rolling
         The wave of its sorrow-laden tide,
       Forever on the air is heard tolling
                   The refrain
                   Of Elaine![Decoration]

XI._THE TELESCOPIC EYE._

A LEAF FROM A REPORTER'S NOTE-BOOK.For the past five or six weeks, rumors of a strange abnormal development
of the powers of vision of a youth named Johnny Palmer, whose parents
reside at South San Francisco, have been whispered around in scientific
circles in the city, and one or two short notices have appeared in the
columns of some of our contemporaries relative to the prodigious _lusus
naturae_, as the scientists call it.Owing to the action taken by the California College of Sciences, whose
members comprise some of our most scientific citizens, the affair has
assumed such importance as to call for a careful and exhaustive
investigation.Being detailed to investigate the flying stories, with regard to the
powers of vision claimed for a lad named John or "Johnny" Palmer, as his
parents call him, we first of all ventured to send in our card to
Professor Gibbins, the President of the California College of Sciences.It is always best to call at the fountain-head for useful information, a
habit which our two hundred thousand readers on this coast can never
fail to see and appreciate.An estimable gentleman of the African
persuasion, to whom we handed our "pasteboard," soon returned with the
polite message, "Yes, sir; _in_.And so we followed our
conductor through several passages almost as dark as the face of the
_cicerone_, and in a few moments found ourselves in the presence of,
perhaps, the busiest man in the city of San Francisco.Without any flourish of trumpets, the Professor inquired our object in
seeking him and the information we desired."Ah," said he, "that is a
long story.I have no time to go into particulars just now.I am
computing the final sheet of Professor Davidson's report of the Transit
of Venus, last year, at Yokohama and Loo-Choo.It must be ready before
May, and it requires six months' work to do it correctly.""But," I rejoined, "can't you tell me where the lad is to be found?""And if I did, they will not let you see him.""Let me alone for that," said I, smiling; "a reporter, like love, finds
his way where wolves would fear to tread.""Really, my dear sir," quickly responded the Doctor, "I have no time to
chat this morning.Our special committee submitted its report yesterday,
which is on file in that book-case; and if you will promise not to
publish it until after it has been read in open session of the College,
you may take it to your sanctum, run it over, and clip from it enough to
satisfy the public for the present."Saying this, he rose from his seat, opened the case, took from a
pigeon-hole a voluminous written document tied up with red tape, and
handed it to me, adding, "Be careful!"Seating himself without another
word, he turned his back on me, and I sallied forth into the street.Reaching the office, I scrutinized the writing on the envelope, and
found it as follows: "Report of Special Committee--Boy
Palmer--Vision--Laws of Light--Filed February 10, 1876--Stittmore,
Sec."Opening the document, I saw at once that it was a full, accurate,
and, up to the present time, complete account of the phenomenal case I
was after, and regretted the promise made not to publish the entire
report until read in open session of the College.Therefore, I shall be
compelled to give the substance of the report in my own words, only
giving _verbatim_ now and then a few scientific phrases which are not
fully intelligible to me, or susceptible of circumlocution in common
language.The report is signed by Doctors Bryant, Gadbury and Golson, three of our
ablest medical men, and approved by Professor Smyth, the oculist.So
far, therefore, as authenticity and scientific accuracy are concerned,
our readers may rely implicitly upon the absolute correctness of every
fact stated and conclusion reached.The first paragraph of the report gives the name of the child, "John
Palmer, age, nine years, and place of residence, South San Francisco,
Culp Hill, near Catholic Orphan Asylum;" and then plunges at once into
_in medias res_.It appears that the period through which the investigation ran was only
fifteen days; but it seems to have been so thorough, by the use of the
ophthalmoscope and other modern appliances and tests, that no regrets
ought to be indulged as to the brevity of the time employed in
experiments.Besides, we have superadded a short and minute account of
our own, verifying some of the most curious facts reported, with several
tests proposed by ourselves and not included in the statement of the
scientific committee.To begin, then, with the beginning of the inquiries by the committee.They were conducted into a small back room, darkened by old blankets
hung up at the window, for the purpose of the total exclusion of
daylight; an absurd remedy for blindness, recommended by a noted quack
whose name adorns the extra fly-leaf of the San Francisco _Truth
Teller_.The lad was reclining upon an old settee, ill-clad and almost
idiotic in expression.As the committee soon ascertained, his mother
only was at home, the father being absent at his customary
occupation--that of switch-tender on the San Jose Railroad.She notified
her son of the presence of strangers and he rose and walked with a firm
step toward where the gentlemen stood, at the entrance of the room.He
shook them all by the hand and bade them good morning.In reply to
questions rapidly put and answered by his mother, the following account
of the infancy of the boy and the accidental discovery of his
extraordinary powers of vision was given:

He was born in the house where the committee found him, nine years ago
the 15th of last January.Nothing of an unusual character occurred until
his second year, when it was announced by a neighbor that the boy was
completely blind, his parents never having been suspicious of the fact
before that time, although the mother declared that for some months
anterior to the discovery she had noticed some acts of the child that
seemed to indicate mental imbecility rather than blindness.From this
time forward until a few months ago nothing happened to vary the boy's
existence except a new remedy now and then prescribed by neighbors for
the supposed malady.He was mostly confined to a darkened chamber, and
was never trusted alone out of doors.He grew familiar, by touch and
sound, with the forms of most objects about him, and could form very
accurate guesses of the color and texture of them all.His
conversational powers did not seem greatly impaired, and he readily
acquired much useful knowledge from listening attentively to everything
that was said in his presence.He was quite a musician, and touched the
harmonicon, banjo and accordeon with skill and feeling.He was unusually
sensitive to the presence of light, though incapable of seeing any
object with any degree of distinctness; and hence the attempt to exclude
light as the greatest enemy to the recovery of vision.It was very
strange that up to the time of the examination of the committee, no
scientific examination of the boy's eye had been made by a competent
oculist, the parents contenting themselves with the chance opinions of
visitors or the cheap nostrums of quacks.It is perhaps fortunate for
science that this was the case, as a cure for the eye might have been an
extinction of its abnormal power.On the evening of the 12th of December last (1875), the position of the
child's bed was temporarily changed to make room for a visitor.The bed
was placed against the wall of the room, fronting directly east, with
the window opening at the side of the bed next to the head.The boy was
sent to bed about seven o'clock, and the parents and their visitor were
seated in the front room, spending the evening in social intercourse.The moon rose full and cloudless about half-past seven o'clock, and
shone full in the face of the sleeping boy.Something aroused him from slumber, and when he opened his eyes the
first object they encountered was the round disk of her orb.By some
oversight the curtain had been removed from the window, and probably for
the first time in his life he beheld the lustrous queen of night
swimming in resplendent radiance, and bathing hill and bay in effulgent
glory.Uttering a cry, equally of terror and delight, he sprang up in
bed and sat there like a statue, with eyes aglare, mouth open, finger
pointed, and astonishment depicted on every feature.His sudden, sharp
scream brought his mother to his side, who tried for some moments in
vain to distract his gaze from the object before him.Failing even to
attract notice, she called in her husband and friend, and together they
besought the boy to lie down and go to sleep, but to no avail.Believing
him to be ill and in convulsions, they soon seized him, and were on the
point of immersing him in a hot bath, when, with a sudden spring, he
escaped from their grasp and ran out the front door.Again he fixed his
unwinking eyes upon the moon, and remained speechless for several
seconds.At length, having seemingly satisfied his present curiosity, he
turned on his mother, who stood wringing her hands in the doorway and
moaning piteously, and exclaimed, "I can see the moon yonder, and it is
so beautiful that I am going there to-morrow morning, as soon as I get
up.""So big," he replied, "that I cannot see it all at one glance--as big as
all out of doors.""How far off from you does it seem to be?""About half a car's distance," he quickly rejoined.It may be here remarked that the boy's idea of distance had been
measured all his life by the distance from his home to the street-car
station at the foot of the hill.This was about two hundred yards, so
that the reply indicated that the moon appeared to be only one hundred
yards from the spectator.The boy then proceeded of his own accord to
give a very minute description of the appearance of objects which he
beheld, corresponding, of course, to his poverty of words with which to
clothe his ideas.His account of things beheld by him was so curious, wonderful and
apparently accurate, that the little group about him passed rapidly from
a conviction of his insanity to a belief no less absurd--that he had
become, in the cant lingo of the day, a seeing, or "clairvoyant" medium.Such was the final conclusion to which his parents had arrived at the
time of the visit of the scientific committee.He had been classed with
that credulous school known to this century as spiritualists, and had
been visited solely by persons of that ilk heretofore.The committee having fully examined the boy, and a number of independent
witnesses, as to the facts, soon set about a scientific investigation of
the true causes of of the phenomenon.The first step, of course, was to
examine the lad's eye with the modern ophthalmoscope, an invention of
Professor Helmholtz, of Heidelberg, a few years ago, by means of which
the depths of this organ can be explored, and the smallest variations
from a healthy or normal condition instantaneously detected.The mode of using the instrument is as follows: The room is made
perfectly dark; a brilliant light is then placed near the head of the
patient, and the rays are reflected by a series of small mirrors into
his eye, as if they came from the eye of the observer; then, by looking
through the central aperture of the instrument, the oculist can examine
the illuminated interior of the eyeball, and perceive every detail of
structure, healthy or morbid, as accurately and clearly as we can see
any part of the exterior of the body.No discomfort arises to the organ
examined, and all its hidden mysteries can be studied and understood as
clearly as those of any other organ of the body.This course was taken with John Palmer, and the true secret of his
mysterious power of vision detected in an instant.On applying the ophthalmoscope, the committee ascertained in a moment
that the boy's eye was abnormally shaped.A natural, perfect eye is
perfectly round.But the eye examined was exceedingly flat, very thin,
with large iris, flat lens, immense petira, and wonderfully dilated
pupil.The effect of the shape was at once apparent.It was utterly
impossible to see any object with distinctness at any distance short of
many thousands of miles.Had the eye been elongated inward, or shaped
like an egg--to as great an extent, the boy would have been effectually
blind, for no combination of lens power could have placed the image of
the object beyond the coat of the retina.In other words, there are two
common imperfections of the human organ of sight; one called _myopia_,
or "near-sightedness;" the _presbyopia_, or "far-sightedness.""The axis being too long," says the report, "in myopic eyes, parallel
rays, such as proceed from distant objects, are brought to a focus at a
point so far in front of the retina, that only confused images are
formed upon it.Such a malformation, constituting an excess of
refractive power, can only be neutralized by concave glasses, which give
such a direction to rays entering the eye as will allow of their being
brought to a focus at a proper point for distant perception.""Presbyopia is the reverse of all this.The antero-posterior axis of
such eyes being too short, owing to the flat plate-like shape of the
ball, their refractive power is not sufficient to bring even parallel
rays to a focus upon the retina, but is adapted for convergent rays
only.Convex glasses, in a great measure, compensate for this quality by
rendering parallel rays convergent; and such glasses, in ordinary cases,
bring the rays to a focus at a convenient distance from the glass,
corresponding to its degree of curvature."But in the case under
examination, no glass or combination of glasses could be invented
sufficiently concave to remedy the malformation.By a mathematical
problem of easy solution, it was computed that the nearest distance from
the unaided eye of the patient at which a distinct image could be formed
upon the retina, was two hundred and forty thousand miles, a fraction
short of the mean distance of the moon from the earth; and hence it
became perfectly clear that the boy could see with minute distinctness
whatever was transpiring on the surface of the moon.Such being the undeniable truth as demonstrated by science, the
declaration of the lad assumed a far higher value than the mere dicta of
spiritualists, or the mad ravings of a monomaniac; and the committee at
once set to work to glean all the astronomical knowledge they could by
frequent and prolonged night interviews with the boy.It was on the night of January 9, 1876, that the first satisfactory
experiment was tried, testing beyond all cavil or doubt the powers of
the subject's eye.It was full moon, and that luminary rose clear and
dazzlingly bright.The committee were on hand at an early hour, and the
boy was in fine condition and exuberant spirits.The interview was
secret, and none but the members of the committee and the parents of the
child were present.Of course the first proposition to be settled was
that of the inhabitability of that sphere.This the boy had frequently
declared was the case, and he had on several previous occasions
described minutely the form, size and means of locomotion of the
Lunarians.On this occasion he repeated in almost the same language,
what he had before related to his parents and friends, but was more
minute, owing to the greater transparency of the atmosphere and the
experience in expression already acquired.The Lunarians are not formed at all like ourselves.They are less in
height, and altogether of a different appearance.When fully grown, they
resemble somewhat a chariot wheel, with four spokes, converging at the
center or axle.They have four eyes in the head, which is the axle, so
to speak, and all the limbs branch out directly from the center, like
some sea-forms known as "Radiates."They move by turning rapidly like a
wheel, and travel as fast as a bird through the air.The children are
undeveloped in form, and are perfectly round, like a pumpkin or orange.As they grow older, they seem to drop or absorb the rotundity of the
whole body, and finally assume the appearance of a chariot wheel.They are of different colors, or nationalities--bright red, orange and
blue being the predominant hues.They
do no work, but sleep every four or five hours.They have no houses, and
need none.They have no clothing, and do not require it.There being no
night on the side of the moon fronting the sun, and no day on the
opposite side, all the inhabitants, apparently at a given signal of some
kind, form into vast armies, and flock in myriads to the sleeping
grounds on the shadow-side of the planet.They do not appear to go very
far over the dark rim, for they reappear in immense platoons in a few
hours, and soon spread themselves over the illuminated surface.They
sleep and wake about six times in one ordinary day of twenty-four hours.Their occupations cannot be discerned; they must be totally different
from anything upon the earth.The surface of the moon is all hill and hollow.There are but few level
spots, nor is there any water visible.The atmosphere is almost as
refined and light as hydrogen gas.There is no fire visible, nor are
there any volcanoes.Most of the time of the inhabitants seems to be
spent in playing games of locomotion, spreading themselves into squares,
circles, triangles, and other mathematical figures.No one or two are ever seen separated from the main bodies.Mary journeyed to the garden.The children also flock in herds, and seem to be all of one family.They seem to spawn like herring or shad, or to
be propagated like bees, from the queen, in myriads.The moment after a mathematical figure is formed, it
is dissolved, and fresh combinations take place, like the atoms in a
kaleidoscope.No other species of animal, bird, or being exist upon the
illuminated face of the moon.The shrubbery and vegetation of the moon is all metallic.Vegetable life
nowhere exists; but the forms of some of the shrubs and trees are
exceedingly beautiful.The highest trees do not exceed twenty-five feet,
and they appear to have all acquired their full growth.The ground is
strewn with flowers, but they are all formed of metals--gold, silver,
copper, and tin predominating.But there is a new kind of metal seen
everywhere on tree, shrub and flower, nowhere known on the earth.John went to the kitchen.It is
of a bright vermilion color, and is semi-transparent.The mountains are
all of bare and burnt granite, and appear to have been melted with fire.The committee called the attention of the boy to the bright "sea of
glass" lately observed near the northern rim of the moon, and inquired
of what it is composed.He examined it carefully, and gave such a minute
description of it that it became apparent at once to the committee that
it was pure mercury or quicksilver.The reason why it has but very
recently shown itself to astronomers is thus accounted for: it appears
close up to the line of demarcation separating the light and shadow upon
the moon's disk; and on closer inspection a distinct cataract of the
fluid--in short, a metallic Niagara, was clearly seen falling from the
night side to the day side of the luminary.It has already filled up a
vast plain--one of the four that exist on the moon's surface--and
appears to be still emptying itself with very great rapidity and volume.It covers an area of five by seven hundred miles in extent, and may
possibly deluge one half the entire surface of the moon.It does not
seem to occasion much apprehension to the inhabitants, as they were soon
skating, so to speak, in platoons and battalions, over and across it.In
fact, it presents the appearance of an immense park, to which the
Lunarians flock, and disport themselves with great gusto upon its
polished face.One of the most beautiful sights yet seen by the lad was
the formation of a new figure, which he drew upon the sand with his
finger.The central heart was of crimson-<DW52> natives; the one to the right
of pale orange, and the left of bright blue.It was ten seconds in
forming, and five seconds in dispersing.The number engaged in the
evolution could not be less than half a million.Thus has been solved one of the great astronomical questions of the
century.The next evening the committee assembled earlier, so as to get a view of
the planet Venus before the moon rose.It was the first time that the
lad's attention had been drawn to any of the planets, and he evinced the
liveliest joy when he first beheld the cloudless disk of that
resplendent world.It may here be stated that his power of vision, in
looking at the fixed stars, was no greater or less than that of an
ordinary eye.Mary travelled to the office.They appeared only as points of light, too far removed
into the infinite beyond to afford any information concerning their
properties.But the committee were doomed to a greater disappointment
when they inquired of the boy what he beheld on the surface of Venus.He
replied, "Nothing clearly; all is confused and watery; I see nothing
with distinctness."The solution of the difficulty was easily
apprehended, and at once surmised.The focus of the eye was fixed by
nature at 240,000 miles, and the least distance of Venus from the earth
being 24,293,000 miles, it was, of course, impossible to observe that
planet's surface with distinctness.Still she appeared greatly enlarged,
covering about one hundredth part of the heavens, and blazing with
unimaginable splendor.Experiments upon Jupiter and Mars were equally futile, and the committee
half sorrowfully turned again to the inspection of the moon.The report then proceeds at great length to give full descriptions of
the most noted geographical peculiarities of the lunar surface, and
corrects many errors fallen into by Herschel, Leverrier and Proctor.Professor Secchi informs us that the surface of the moon is much better
known to astronomers than the surface of the earth is to geographers;
for there are two zones on the globe within the Arctic and Antarctic
circles, that we can never examine.But every nook and cranny of the
illuminated face of the moon has been fully delineated, examined and
named, so that no object greater than sixty feet square exists but has
been seen and photographed by means of Lord Rosse's telescope and De la
Ruis' camera and apparatus.As the entire report will be ordered
published at the next weekly meeting of the College, we refrain from
further extracts, but now proceed to narrate the results of our own
interviews with the boy.It was on the evening of the 17th of February, 1876, that we ventured
with rather a misgiving heart to approach Culp Hill, and the humble
residence of a child destined, before the year is out, to become the
most celebrated of living beings.We armed ourselves with a pound of
sugar candy for the boy, some _muslin-de-laine_ as a present to the
mother, and a box of cigars for the father.We also took with us a very
large-sized opera-glass, furnished for the purpose by M. Muller.At
first we encountered a positive refusal; then, on exhibiting the cigars,
a qualified negative; and finally, when the muslin and candy were drawn
on the enemy, we were somewhat coldly invited in and proffered a seat.The boy was pale and restless, and his eyes without bandage or glasses.We soon ingratiated ourself into the good opinion of the whole party,
and henceforth encountered no difficulty in pursuing our investigations.The moon being nearly full, we first of all verified the tests by the
committee.Requesting, then, to stay until after midnight, for the purpose of
inspecting Mars with the opera-glass, we spent the interval in obtaining
the history of the child, which we have given above.The planet Mars being at this time almost in dead opposition to the sun,
and with the earth in conjunction, is of course as near to the earth as
he ever approaches, the distance being thirty-five millions of miles.He
rises toward midnight, and is in the constellation Virgo, where he may
be seen to the greatest possible advantage, being in perigee.Mars is
most like the earth of all the planetary bodies.He revolves on his axis
in a little over twenty-four hours, and his surface is pleasantly
variegated with land and water, pretty much like our own world--the
land, however, being in slight excess.He is, therefore, the most
interesting of all the heavenly bodies to the inhabitants of the earth.Having all things in readiness, we directed the glass to the planet.Alas, for all our calculations, the power was insufficient to clear away
the obscurity resulting from imperfect vision and short focus.Swallowing the bitter disappointment, we hastily made arrangements for
another interview, with a telescope, and bade the family good night.There is but one large telescope properly mounted in the city, and that
is the property and pride of its accomplished owner, J. P. Manrow, Esq.We at once procured an interview with that gentleman, and it was agreed
that on Saturday evening the boy should be conveyed to his residence,
picturesquely situated on Russian Hill, commanding a magnificent view of
the Golden Gate and the ocean beyond.At the appointed hour the boy, his parents and myself presented
ourselves at the door of that hospitable mansion.We were cordially
welcomed, and conducted without further parley into the lofty
observatory on the top of the house.In due time the magnificent tube
was presented at the planet, but it was discovered that the power it was
set for was too low.It was then gauged for 240,000 diameters, being the
full strength of the telescope, and the eye of the boy observer placed
at the eye-glass.One cry of joy, and unalloyed delight told the story!Mars, and its mountains and seas, its rivers, vales, and estuaries, its
polar snow-caps and grassy plains--its inhabitants, palaces, ships,
villages and cities, were all revealed, as distinctly, clearly and
certainly, as the eye of Kit Carson, from the summits of the Sierra
Nevada range, beheld the stupendous panorama of the Sacramento Valley,
and the snow-clad summits of Mount Hood and Shasta Butte.[Decoration]

XII._THE EMERALD ISLE._


    Chaos was ended.From its ruins rolled
    The central Sun, poised on his throne of gold;
    The changeful Moon, that floods the hollow dome
    Of raven midnight with her silvery foam;
    Vast constellations swarming all around,
    In seas of azure, without line or bound,
    And this green globe, rock-ribbed and mountain-crown'd.The eye of God, before His hand had made
    Man in His image, this wide realm surveyed;
    O'er hill and valley, over stream and wood,
    He glanced triumphant, and pronounced it "good."But ere He formed old Adam and his bride,
    He called a shining seraph to His side,
    And pointing to our world, that gleamed afar,
    And twinkled on creation's verge, a star,
    Bade him float 'round this new and narrow span
    And bring report if all were ripe for Man.The angel spread his fluttering pinions fair,
    And circled thrice the circumambient air;
    Quick, then, as thought, he stood before the gate
    Where cherubs burn, and minist'ring spirits wait.Nor long he stood, for God beheld his plume,
    Already tarnished by terrestrial gloom,
    And beck'ning kindly to the flurried aid,
    Said, "Speak your wish; if good, be it obeyed."The seraph raised his gem-encircled hand,
    Obeisance made, at heaven's august command,
    And thus replied, in tones so bold and clear,
    That angels turned and lent a listening ear:
    "Lord of all systems, be they near or far,
    Thrice have I circled 'round yon beauteous Star,
    I've seen its mountains rise, its rivers roll,
    Its oceans sweep majestic to each pole;
    Its floors in mighty continents expand,
    Or dwindle into specs of fairy-land;
    Its prairies spread, its forests stretch in pride,
    And all its valleys dazzle like a bride;
    Hymns have I heard in all its winds and streams,
    And beauty seen in all its rainbow gleams.But whilst the LAND can boast of every gem
    That sparkles in each seraph's diadem;
    Whilst diamonds blaze 'neath dusk Golconda's skies,
    And rubies bleed where Alps and Andes rise;
    Whilst in Brazilian brooks the topaz shines,
    And opals burn in California mines;
    Whilst in the vales of Araby the Blest
    The sapphire flames beside the amethyst:
    The pauper Ocean sobs forever more,
    Ungemm'd, unjeweled, on its wailing shore!""Add music to the song the breakers sing!"The strong-soul'd seraph cried, "I'd make yon sea
    Rival in tone heaven's sweetest minstrelsy;
    I'd plant within the ocean's bubbling tide
    An island gem, of every sea the pride!So bright in robes of ever-living green,
    In breath so sweet, in features so serene,
    Such crystal streams to course its valleys fair,
    Such healthful gales to purify its air,
    Such fertile soil, such ever-verdant trees,
    Angels should name it 'EMERALD OF THE SEAS!'"The seraph paused, and downward cast his eyes,
    Whilst heav'nly hosts stood throbbing with surprise.Again the Lord of all the realms above,
    Supreme in might, but infinite in love,
    With no harsh accent in His tones replied:
    "Go, drop this Emerald in the envious tide!"Quick as the lightning cleaves the concave blue,
    The seraph seized the proffer'd gem, and flew
    Until he reached the confines of the earth,
    Still struggling in the throes of turbid birth;
    And there, upon his self-sustaining wing,
    Sat poised, and heard our globe her matins sing;
    Beheld the sun traverse the arching sky,
    The sister Moon walk forth in majesty;
    Saw every constellation rise and roll
    Athwart the heaven, or circle round the pole.Nor did he move, until our spotted globe
    Had donned for him her morn and evening robe;
    Till on each land his critic eye was cast,
    And every ocean rose, and heav'd, and pass'd;
    Then, like some eagle pouncing on its prey,
    He downward sail'd, through bellowing clouds and spray,
    To where he saw the billows bounding free,
    And dropped the gem within the stormy sea!And would'st thou know, Chief of St.Patrick's band,
    Where fell this jewel from the seraph's hand?What ocean caught the world-enriching prize?Child of Moina, homeward cast your eyes!in the midst of wat'ry deserts wide,
    Behold the EMERALD bursting through the tide,
    And bearing on its ever vernal-sod
    The monogram of seraph, and of God!Its name, the sweetest human lips e'er sung,
    First trembled on an angel's fervid tongue;
    Then chimed AEolian on the evening air,
    Lisped by an infant, in its mother prayer;
    Next roared in war, with battle's flag unfurl'd;
    Now, gemm'd with glory, gather'd through the world!Perfidious Albion, blush with shame:
    It is thy sister's!Once more the seraph stood before the throne
    Of dread Omnipotence, pensive and alone."I dropped the jewel in the flashing tide,"
    The seraph said; but saw with vision keen
    A mightier angel stalk upon the scene,
    Whose voice like grating thunder smote his ear
    And taught his soul the mystery of fear."Because thy heart with impious pride did swell,
    And dared make better what thy God made well;
    Because thy hand did fling profanely down
    On Earth a jewel wrenched from Heaven's bright crown,
    The Isle which thine own fingers did create
    Shall reap a blessing and a curse from fate!"Far in the future, as the years roll on,
    And all the pagan ages shall have flown;
    When Christian virtues, flaming into light,
    Shall save the world from superstition's night;
    Erin, oppress'd, shall bite the tyrant's heel,
    And for a thousand years enslaved shall kneel;
    Her sons shall perish in the field and flood,
    Her daughters starve in city, wold, and wood;
    Her patriots, with their blood, the block shall stain,
    Her matrons fly behind the Western main;
    Harpies from Albion shall her strength consume,
    And thorns and thistles in her gardens bloom.But, curse of curses thine, O!fated land:
    Traitors shall thrive where statesmen ought to stand!But past her heritage of woe and pain,
    A far more blest millennium shall reign;
    Seedlings of heroes shall her exiles be,
    Where'er they find a home beyond the sea;
    Bright paragons of beauty and of truth,
    Her maidens all shall dazzle in their youth;
    And when age comes, to dim the flashing eye,
    Still gems of virtue shall they live, and die!No braver race shall breathe beneath the sun
    Than thine, O!Erin, ere the goal be won.Wherever man shall battle for the right,
    There shall thy sons fall thickest in the fight;
    Wherever man shall perish to be free,
    There shall thy martyrs foremost be!when thy redemption is at hand,
    Soldiers shall swell thy ranks from every land!Heroes shall flock in thousands to thy shore,
    And swear thy soil is FREE FOREVERMORE!Then shall thy harp be from the willow torn,
    And in yon glitt'ring galaxy be borne!Then shall the Emerald change its verdant crest,
    And blaze a Star co-equal with the rest!The sentence pass'd, the doomsman felt surprise,
    For tears were streaming from the seraph's eyes."Weep not for Erin," once again he spoke,
    "But for thyself, that did'st her doom provoke;
    I bear a message, seraph, unto thee,
    As unrelenting in its stern decree.For endless years it is thy fate to stand,
    The chosen guardian of the SHAMROCK land.Three times, as ages wind their coils away,
    Incarnate on yon Island shalt thou stray."First as a Saint, in majesty divine,
    The world shall know thee by this potent sign:
    From yonder soil, where pois'nous reptiles dwell,
    Thy voice shall snake and slimy toad expel.Next as a Martyr, pleading in her cause,
    Thy blood shall flow to build up Albion's laws.Last as a Prophet and a Bard combined,
    Rebellion's fires shall mould thy patriot mind.In that great day, when Briton's strength shall fail,
    And all her glories shiver on the gale;
    When winged chariots, rushing through the sky,
    Shall drop their <DW19>s, blazing as they fly,
    Thy form shall tower, a hero'midst the flames,
    And add one more to Erin's deathless names!"gathered here in state,
    Such is the story of your country's fate.Six thousand years in strife have rolled away,
    Since Erin sprang from billowy surf and spray;
    In that drear lapse, her sons have never known
    One ray of peace to gild her crimson zone.Cast back your glance athwart the tide of years,
    Behold each billow steeped with Erin's tears,
    Inspect each drop that swells the mighty flood,
    Its purple globules smoke with human blood!Come with me now, and trace the seraph's path,
    That has been trodden since his day of wrath.in the year when Attila the Hun
    Had half the world in terror overrun,
    On Erin's shore there stood a noble youth,
    The breath of honor and the torch of truth.His was the tongue that taught the Celtic soul
    Christ was its Saviour, Heaven was its goal!His was the hand that drove subdued away,
    The venom horde that lured but to betray;
    His were the feet that sanctified the sod,
    Erin redeemed, and gave her back to God!The gray old Earth can boost no purer fame
    Than that whose halos gild ST.Twelve times the centuries builded up their store
    Of plots, rebellions, gibbets, tears and gore;
    Twelve times centennial annivers'ries came,
    To bless the seraph in St.In that long night of treach'ry and gloom,
    How many myriads found a martyr's tomb!Beside the waters of the dashing Rhone
    In exile starved the bold and blind TYRONE.Beneath the glamour of the tyrant's steel
    Went out in gloom the soul of great O'NEILL.What countless thousands, children of her loin,
    Sank unanneal'd beneath the bitter Boyne!What fathers fell, what mothers sued in vain,
    In Tredah's walls, on Wexford's gory plain,
    When Cromwell's shaven panders slaked their lust,
    And Ireton's fiends despoiled the breathless dust!Still came no seraph, incarnate in man,
    To rescue Erin from the bandit clan.Still sad and lone, she languished in her chains,
    That clank'd in chorus o'er her martyrs' manes.At length, when Freedom's struggle was begun
    Across the seas, by conq'ring Washington,
    When CURRAN thunder'd, and when GRATTAN spoke,
    The guardian seraph from his slumber woke.Then guilty Norbury from his vengeance fled,
    FITZGERALD fought, and glorious WOLFE TONE bled.Then EMMET rose, to start the battle-cry,
    To strike, to plead, to threaten, and to die!happier in thy doom,
    Though uninscrib'd remains thy seraph tomb,
    Than the long line of Erin's scepter'd foes,
    Whose bones in proud mausoleums repose;
    More noble blood through Emmet's pulses rings
    Than courses through ten thousand hearts of kings!Thus has the seraph twice redeem'd his fate,
    And roamed a mortal through this low estate;
    Again obedient to divine command,
    His final incarnation is at hand.Scarce shall yon sun _five times_ renew the year,
    Ere Erin's guardian Angel shall appear,
    Not as a priest, in holy garb arrayed;
    Not as a patriot, by his cause betray'd,
    Shall he again assume a mortal guise,
    And tread the earth, an exile from the skies.But like the lightning from the welkin hurl'd,
    His eye shall light, his step shall shake the world!Are ye but scions of degenerate slaves?Shall tyrants spit upon your fathers' graves?Is all the life-blood stagnant in your veins?Love ye no music but the clank of chains?Hear ye no voices ringing in the air,
    That chant in chorus wild, _Prepare_, PREPARE!on the winds there comes a prophet sound,--
    The blood of Abel crying from the ground,--
    Pealing in tones of thunder through the world,
    "ARM!On some bold headland do I seem to stand,
    And watch the billows breaking 'gainst the land;
    Not in lone rollers do their waters poor,
    But the vast ocean rushes to the shore.So flock in millions sons of honest toil,
    From ev'ry country, to their native soil;
    Exiles of Erin, driven from her sod,
    By foes of justice, mercy, man, and God!AErial chariots spread their snowy wings,
    And drop torpedoes in the halls of kings.On every breeze a thousand banners fly,
    And Erin's seraph swells the battle-cry:--
    "Strike!till proud Albion bows her haughty head!for the bones that fill your mothers' graves!till fair Freedom on the world shall smile![Decoration]

XIII._THE EARTH'S HOT CENTER._


The following extracts from the report of the Hon.John Flannagan,
United States Consul at Bruges, in Belgium, to the Secretary of State,
published in the Washington City _Telegraph_ of a late date, will fully
explain what is meant by the "Great Scare in Belgium."Our extracts are not taken continuously, as the entire document would be
too voluminous for our pages.But where breaks appear we have indicated
the hiatus in the usual manner by asterisks, or by brief explanations.BRUGES, December 12, 1872.HAMILTON FISH,
                     Secretary of State.SIR: In pursuance of special instructions recently received from
   Washington (containing inclosures from Prof.Henry of the
   Smithsonian Institute, and Prof.Lovering of Harvard), I
   proceeded on Wednesday last to the scene of operations at the
   "International Exploring Works," and beg leave to submit the
   following circumstantial report:

   Before proceeding to detail the actual state of affairs at
   Dudzeele, near the line of canal connecting Bruges with the North
   Sea, it may not be out of place to furnish a succinct history of
   the origin of the explorations out of which the present alarming
   events have arisen.It will be remembered by the State Department
   that during the short interregnum of the provisional government
   of France, under Lamartine and Cavaignac, in 1848, a proposition
   was submitted by France to the governments of the United States,
   Great Britain and Russia, and which was subsequently extended to
   King Leopold of Belgium, to create an "International Board for
   Subterranean Exploration" in furtherance of science, and in
   order, primarily, to test the truth of the theory of igneous
   central fusion, first propounded by Leibnitz, and afterward
   embraced by most of contemporary geologists; but also with the
   further objects of ascertaining the magnetic condition of the
   earth's crust, the variations of the needle at great depths, and
   finally to set at rest the doubts of some of the English
   mineralogists concerning the permanency of the coal measures,
   about which considerable alarm had been felt in all the
   manufacturing centers of Europe.The protocol of a quintuple treaty was finally drawn by Prof.Henry, of the Smithsonian Institute, and approved by Sir Roderick
   Murchison, at that time President of the Royal Society of Great
   Britain.To this project Arago lent the weight of his great name,
   and Nesselrode affixed the approval of Russia, it being one of
   the last official acts performed by that veteran statesman.The programme called for annual appropriations by each of the
   above-named powers of 100,000 francs (about $20,000 each), the
   appointment of commissioners and a general superintendent, the
   selection of a site for prosecuting the undertaking, and a board
   of scientific visitors, consisting of one member from each
   country.It is unnecessary to detail the proceedings for the first few
   months after the organization of the commission.Watson, of
   Chicago, the author of a scientific treatise called "Prairie
   Geology," was selected by President Fillmore, as the first
   representative of the United States; Russia sent Olgokoff;
   France, Ango Jeuno; England, Sir Edward Sabine, the present
   President of the Royal Society; and Belgium, Dr.Secchi, since so
   famous for his spectroscopic observations on the fixed stars.These gentlemen, after organizing at Paris, spent almost an
   entire year in traveling before a site for the scene of
   operations was selected.Finally, on the 10th of April, 1849, the
   first ground was broken for actual work at Dudzeele, in the
   neighborhood of Bruges, in the Kingdom of Belgium.The considerations which led to the choice of this locality were
   the following: First, it was the most central, regarding the
   capitals of the parties to the protocol; secondly, it was easy of
   access and connected by rail with Brussels, Paris and St.Petersburg, and by line of steamers with London, being situated
   within a short distance of the mouth of the Hond or west Scheldt;
   thirdly, and perhaps as the most important consideration of all,
   it was the seat of the deepest shaft in the world, namely, the
   old salt mine at Dudzeele, which had been worked from the time of
   the Romans down to the commencement of the present century, at
   which time it was abandoned, principally on account of the
   intense heat at the bottom of the excavation, and which could not
   be entirely overcome except by the most costly scientific
   appliances.There was still another reason, which, in the estimation of at
   least one member of the commission, Prof.Watson, overrode them
   all--the exceptional increase of heat with depth, which was its
   main characteristic.The scientific facts upon which this great work was projected,
   may be stated as follows: It is the opinion of the principal
   modern geologists, based primarily upon the hypothesis of Kant
   (that the solar universe was originally an immense mass of
   incandescent vapor gradually cooled and hardened after being
   thrown off from the grand central body--afterward elaborated by
   La Place into the present nebular hypothesis)--that "the globe
   was once in a state of igneous fusion, and that as its heated
   mass began to cool, an exterior crust was formed, first very
   thin, and afterward gradually increasing until it attained its
   present thickness, which has been variously estimated at from ten
   to two hundred miles.During the process of gradual
   refrigeration, some portions of the crust cooled more rapidly
   than others, and the pressure on the interior igneous mass being
   unequal, the heated matter or lava burst through the thinner
   parts, and caused high-peaked mountains; the same cause also
   producing all volcanic action."The arguments in favor of this
   doctrine are almost innumerable; these are among the most
   prominent:

   _First._ The form of the earth is just that which an igneous
   liquid mass would assume if thrown into an orbit with an axial
   revolution similar to that of our earth.Not many years ago
   Professor Faraday, assisted by Wheatstone, devised a most
   ingenious apparatus by which, in the laboratory of the Royal
   Society, he actually was enabled, by injecting a flame into a
   vacuum, to exhibit visibly all the phenomena of the formation of
   the solar universe, as contended for by La Place and by Humboldt
   in his "Cosmos."_Secondly._ It is perfectly well ascertained that heat increases
   with depth, in all subterranean excavations.This is the
   invariable rule in mining shafts, and preventive measures must
   always be devised and used, by means generally of air apparatus,
   to temper the heat as the depth is augmented, else deep mining
   would have to be abandoned.The rate of increase has been
   variously estimated by different scientists in widely distant
   portions of the globe.A few of them may be mentioned at this
   place, since it was upon a total miscalculation on this head that
   led to the present most deplorable results.The editor of the _Journal of Science_, in April, 1832,
   calculated from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines
   in Durham and Northumberland, the mean rate of increase at one
   degree of Fahrenheit for a descent of forty-four English feet.In this instance it is noticeable that the bulb of the
   thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely cut into the
   solid rock, at depths varying from two hundred to nine hundred
   feet.The Dolcoath mine in Cornwall, as examined by Mr.Fox, at
   the depth of thirteen hundred and eighty feet, gave on average
   result of four degrees for every seventy-five feet.Kupffer compared results obtained from the silver mines in
   Mexico, Peru and Freiburg, from the salt wells of Saxony, and
   from the copper mines in the Caucasus, together with an
   examination of the tin mines of Cornwall and the coal mines in
   the north of England, and found the average to be at least one
   degree of Fahrenheit for every thirty-seven English feet.Cordier, on the contrary, considers this amount somewhat
   overstated and reduces the general average to one degree
   Centigrade for every twenty-five metres, or about one degree of
   Fahrenheit for every forty-five feet English measure._Thirdly._ That the lavas taken from all parts of the world, when
   subjected to chemical analysis, indicate that they all proceed
   from a common source; and

   _Fourthly._ On no other hypothesis can we account for the change
   of climate indicated by fossils.The rate of increase of heat in the Dudzeele shaft was no less
   than one degree Fahrenheit for every thirty feet English measure.At the time of recommencing sinking in the shaft on the 10th of
   April, 1849, the perpendicular depth was twenty-three hundred and
   seventy feet, the thermometer marking forty-eight degrees
   Fahrenheit at the surface; this would give the enormous heat of
   one hundred and twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit at the bottom of
   the mine.Of course, without ventilation no human being could
   long survive in such an atmosphere, and the first operations of
   the commission were directed to remedy this inconvenience.The report then proceeds to give the details of a very successful
contrivance for forcing air into the shaft at the greatest depths, only
a portion of which do we deem it important to quote, as follows:

   The width of the Moer-Vater, or Lieve, at this point, was ten
   hundred and eighty yards, and spanned by an old bridge, the stone
   piers of which were very near together, having been built by the
   emperor Hadrian in the early part of the second century.The rise
   of the tide in the North Sea, close at hand, was from fifteen to
   eighteen feet, thus producing a current almost as rapid as that
   of the Mersey at Liverpool.The commissioners determined to
   utilize this force, in preference to the erection of expensive
   steam works at the mouth of the mine.A plan was submitted by
   Cyrus W. Field, and at once adopted.Turbine wheels were built,
   covering the space betwixt each arch, movable, and adapted to the
   rise and fall of the tide.Gates were also constructed between
   each arch, and a head of water, ranging from ten to fifteen feet
   fall, provided for each turn of the tide--both in the ebb and the
   flow, so that there should be a continuous motion to the
   machinery.Near the mouth of the shaft two large boiler-iron
   reservoirs were constructed, capable of holding from one hundred
   and fifty thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of
   compressed air, the average rate of condensation being about two
   hundred atmospheres.These reservoirs were properly connected
   with the pumping apparatus of the bridge by large cast-iron
   mains, so that the supply was continuous, and at an almost
   nominal cost.It was by the same power of compressed air that the
   tunneling through Mount St.Gothard was effected for the Lyons
   and Turin Railway, just completed.The first operations were to enlarge the shaft so as to form an
   opening forty by one hundred feet, English measure.This consumed
   the greater part of the year 1849, so that the real work of
   sinking was not fairly under way until early in 1850.But from
   that period down to the memorable 5th of November, 1872, the
   excavation steadily progressed.I neglected to state at the
   outset that M. Jean Dusoloy, the state engineer of Belgium, was
   appointed General Superintendent, and continued to fill that
   important office until he lost his life, on the morning of the
   6th of November, the melancholly details of which are hereinafter
   fully narrated.As the deepening progressed the heat of the bottom continued to
   increase, but it was soon observed in a different ratio from the
   calculations of the experts.After attaining the depth of fifteen
   thousand six hundred and fifty feet,--about the height of Mt.Blanc--which was reached early in 1864, it was noticed, for the
   first time, that the laws of temperature and gravitation were
   synchronous; that is, that the heat augmented in a ratio
   proportioned to the square of the distance from the surface
   downward.Hence the increase at great depths bore no relation at
   all to the apparently gradual augmentation near the surface.As
   early as June, 1868, it became apparent that the sinking, if
   carried on at all, would have to be protected by some
   atheromatous or adiathermic covering.Professor Tyndall was
   applied to, and, at the request of Lord Palmerston, made a vast
   number of experiments on non-conducting bodies.As the result of
   his labors, he prepared a compound solution about the density of
   common white lead, composed of selenite alum and sulphate of
   copper, which was laid on three or four thicknesses, first upon
   the bodies of the naked miners--for in all deep mines the
   operatives work _in puris naturalibus_--and then upon an
   oval-shaped cage made of papier mache, with a false bottom,
   enclosed within which the miners were enabled to endure the
   intense heat for a shift of two hours each day.The drilling was
   all done by means of the diamond-pointed instrument, and the
   blasting by nitro-glycerine from the outset; so that the
   principal labor consisted in shoveling up the debris and keeping
   the drill-point _in situ_.Before proceeding further it may not be improper to enumerate a
   few of the more important scientific facts which, up to the 1st
   of November of the past year, had been satisfactorily
   established.First in importance is the one alluded to above--the
   rate of increase of temperature as we descend into the bowels of
   the earth.This law, shown above to correspond exactly with the
   law of attraction or gravitation, had been entirely overlooked by
   all the scientists, living or dead.No one had for a moment
   suspected that heat followed the universal law of physics as a
   material body ought to do, simply because, from the time of De
   Saussure, heat had been regarded only as a force or _vis viva_
   and not as a ponderable quality.But not only was heat found to be subject to the law of inverse
   ratio of the square of the distance from the surface, but the
   atmosphere itself followed the same invariable rule.Thus, while
   we know that water boils at the level of the sea at two hundred
   and twelve degrees Fahrenheit, it readily vaporizes at one
   hundred and eighty-five degrees on the peak of Teneriffe, only
   fifteen thousand feet above that level.This, we know, is owing
   to the weight of the superincumbent atmosphere, there being a
   heavier burden at the surface than at any height above it.The
   rate of decrease above the surface is perfectly regular, being
   one degree for every five hundred and ninety feet of ascent.But
   the amazing fact was shown that the weight of the atmosphere
   increased in a ratio proportioned to the square of the distance
   downward.... The magnetic needle also evinced some curious
   disturbance, the dip being invariably upward.Its action also was
   exceedingly feeble, and the day before the operations ceased it
   lost all polarity whatever, and the finest magnet would not
   meander from the point of the compass it happened to be left at
   for the time being.As Sir Edward Sabine finely said, "The hands
   of the magnetic clock stopped."But the activity of the needle
   gradually increased as the surface was approached.All electrical action also ceased, which fully confirms the
   theory, of Professor Faraday, that "electricity is a force
   generated by the rapid axial revolution of the earth, and that
   magnetic attraction in all cases points or operates at right
   angles to its current."Hence electricity, from the nature of its
   cause, must be superficial.Every appearance of water disappeared at the depth of only 9000
   feet.From this depth downward the rock was of a basaltic
   character, having not the slightest appearance of granite
   formation--confirming, in a most remarkable manner, the discovery
   made only last year, that all _granites_ are of _aqueous_,
   instead of _igneous_ deposition.As a corollary from the law of
   atmospheric pressure, it was found utterly impossible to vaporize
   water at a greater depth than 24,000 feet, which point was
   reached in 1869.No amount of heat affected it in the least
   perceptible manner, and on weighing the liquid at the greatest
   depth attained, by means of a nicely adjusted scale, it was found
   to be of a density expressed thus: 198,073, being two degrees or
   integers of atomic weight heavier than gold, at the surface.The report then proceeds to discuss the question of the true figure of
the earth, whether an oblate spheroid, as generally supposed, or only
truncated at the poles; the length of a degree of longitude at the
latitude of Dudzeele, 51 deg.The concluding portion of the report is reproduced in full.For the past twelve months it was found impossible to endure the
   heat, even sheltered as the miners were by the atmospheric cover
   and cage, for more than fifteen minutes at a time, so that the
   expense of sinking had increased geometrically for the past two
   years.However, important results had been obtained, and a
   perpendicular depth reached many thousands of feet below the
   deepest sea soundings of Lieutenant Brooks.In fact, the enormous
   excavation, on the 1st of November, 1872, measured
   perpendicularly, no less than 37,810 feet and 6 inches from the
   floor of the shaft building!The highest peak of the Himalayas is
   only little over 28,000 feet, so that it can at once be seen that
   no time had been thrown away by the Commissioners since the
   inception of the undertaking, in April, 1849.The first symptoms of alarm were felt on the evening of November
   1.The men complained of a vast increase of heat, and the cages
   had to be dropped every five minutes for the greater part of the
   night; and of those who attempted to work, at least one half were
   extricated in a condition of fainting, but one degree from
   cyncope.Toward morning, hoarse, profound and frequent
   subterranean explosions were heard, which had increased at noon
   to one dull, threatening and continuous roar.But the miners went
   down bravely to their tasks, and resolved to work as long as
   human endurance could bear it.But this was not to be much
   longer; for late at night, on the 4th, after hearing a terrible
   explosion, which shook the whole neighborhood, a hot sirocco
   issued from the bottom, which drove them all out in a state of
   asphyxia.The heat at the surface became absolutely unendurable,
   and on sending down a cage with only a dog in it, the materials
   of which it was composed took fire, and the animal perished in
   the flames.At 3 o'clock A. M. the iron fastenings to another
   cage were found fused, and the wire ropes were melted for more
   than 1000 feet at the other end.The detonations became more
   frequent, the trembling of the earth at the surface more violent,
   and the heat more oppressive around the mouth of the orifice.A
   few minutes before 4 o'clock a subterranean crash was heard,
   louder than Alpine thunder, and immediately afterward a furious
   cloud of ashes, smoke and gaseous exhalation shot high up into
   the still darkened atmosphere of night.At this time at least one
   thousand of the terrified and half-naked inhabitants of the
   neighboring village of Dudzeele had collected on the spot, and
   with wringing hands and fearful outcries bewailed their fate, and
   threatened instant death to the officers of the commission, and
   even to the now terrified miners.Finally, just before dawn, on
   the 5th of November, or, to be more precise, at exactly twenty
   minutes past 6 A. M., molten lava made its appearance at the
   surface!The fright now became general, and as the burning buildings shed
   their ominous glare around, and the languid stream of liquid fire
   slowly bubbled up and rolled toward the canal, the scene assumed
   an aspect of awful sublimity and grandeur.The plains around were
   lit up for many leagues, and the foggy skies intensified and
   reduplicated the effects of the illumination.Toward sunrise the
   flow of lava was suspended for nearly an hour, but shortly after
   ten o'clock it suddenly increased its volume, and, as it cooled,
   formed a sort of saucer-shaped funnel, over the edges of which it
   boiled up, broke, and ran off in every direction.It was at this
   period that the accomplished Dusoloy, so long the Superintendent,
   lost his life.As the lava slowly meandered along, he attempted
   to cross the stream by stepping from one mass of surface cinders
   to another.Making a false step, the floating rock upon which he
   sprang suddenly turned over, and before relief could be afforded
   his body was consumed to a crisp.I regret to add that his fate
   kindled no sympathy among the assembled multitude; but they
   rudely seized his mutilated remains, and amid jeers, execrations,
   and shouts of triumph, attached a large stone to the
   half-consumed corpse and precipitated it into the canal.Thus are
   the heroes of science frequently sacrificed to the fury of a
   plebeian mob.It would afford me a pleasure to inform the department that the
   unforeseen evils of our scientific convention terminated here.But I regret to add that such is very far from being the case.Indeed, from the appearance of affairs this morning at the
   volcanic crater--for such it has now become--the possible evils
   are almost incalculable.The Belgian Government was duly notified
   by telegraph of the death of the Superintendent and the mutinous
   disposition of the common people about Bruges, and early on the
   morning of the 6th of November a squad of flying horse was
   dispatched to the spot to maintain order.But this interference
   only made matters worse.The discontent, augmented by the wildest
   panic, became universal, and the mob reigned supreme.Nor could
   the poor wretches be greatly condemned; for toward evening the
   lava current reached the confines of the old village of Dudzeele,
   and about midnight set the town on fire.The lurid glare of the
   conflagration awakened the old burghers of Bruges from their
   slumbers and spread consternation in the city, though distant
   several miles from the spot.A meeting was called at the
   Guildhall at dawn, and the wildest excitement prevailed.But
   after hearing explanations from the members of the commission,
   the populace quietly but doggedly dispersed.The government from
   this time forward did all that power and prudence combined could
   effect to quell the reign of terror around Bruges.In this
   country the telegraph, being a government monopoly, has been
   rigorously watched and a cordon of military posts established
   around the threatened district, so that it has been almost
   impossible to convey intelligence of this disaster beyond the
   limits of the danger.In the mean time, a congress of the most
   experienced scientists was invited to the scene for the purpose
   of suggesting some remedy against the prospective spread of the
   devastation.The first meeting took place at the old Guildhall in
   Bruges and was strictly private, none being admitted except the
   diplomatic representatives of foreign governments, and the
   members elect of the college.As in duty bound, I felt called on
   to attend, and shall in this place attempt a short synopsis of
   the proceedings.Professor Palmieri, of Naples, presided, and Dr.Kirchoff
   officiated as secretary.Gassiot, of Paris, was the first speaker, and contended that the
   theory of nucleatic fusion, now being fully established it only
   remained to prescribe the laws governing its superficial action."There is but one law applicable, that I am aware of," said he,
   "and that is the law which drives from the center of a revolving
   body all fluid matter toward the circumference, and forcibly
   ejects it into space, if possible, in the same manner that a
   common grindstone in rapid motion will drive off from its rim
   drops of water or other foreign unattached matter.Thus, whenever
   we find a vent or open orifice, as in the craters of active
   volcanoes, the incandescent lava boils up and frequently
   overflows the top of the highest peak of the Andes."Palmieri then asked the speaker "if he wished to be understood as
   expressing the unqualified opinion that an orifice once being
   opened would continue to flow forever, and that there was no law
   governing the quantity or regulating the level to which it could
   rise?"The Neapolitan philosopher then added: "I dissent _in toto_ from
   the opinion of M. Gassiot.For more than a quarter of a century I
   have studied the lava-flows of Vesuvius, AEtna and Stromboli, and
   I can assure the Congress that the Creator has left no such flaw
   in His mechanism of the globe.The truth is, that molten lava can
   only rise about 21,000 feet above the level of the sea, owing to
   the balance-wheel of terrestrial gravitation, which counteracts
   at that height all centrifugal energy.Were this not so, the
   entire contents of the globe would gush from the incandescent
   center and fly off into surrounding space."M. Gassiot replied, "that true volcanoes were supplied by nature
   with _circumvalvular lips_, and hence, after filling their
   craters, they ceased to flow.But in the instance before us no
   such provision existed, and the only protection which he could
   conceive of consisted in the smallness of the orifice; and he
   would therefore recommend his Majesty King Leopold to direct all
   his efforts to confine the aperture to its present size."Palmieri again responded, "that he had no doubt but that the
   crater at Dudzeele would continue to flow until it had built up
   around itself basaltic walls to the height of many hundreds,
   perhaps thousands, of feet, and that the idea of setting bounds
   to the size of the mouth of the excavation was simply
   ridiculous."Gassiot interrupted, and was about to answer in a very excited
   tone, when Prof.Palmieri "disclaimed any intention of personal
   insult, but spoke from a scientific standpoint."He then
   proceeded: "The lava bed of Mount AEtna maintains a normal level
   of 7000 feet, while Vesuvius calmly reposes at a little more than
   one half that altitude.Whitney, of the Pacific Survey, Mount Kilauea, in the Sandwich
   Islands, bubbles up to the enormous height of 17,000 feet.It
   cannot be contended that the crater of Vesuvius is not a true
   nucleatic orifice, because I have demonstrated that the molten
   bed regularly rises and falls like the tides of the ocean when
   controlled by the moon."It was seen at once that the scientists
   present were totally unprepared to discuss the question in its
   novel and most important aspects; and on taking a vote, at the
   close of the session, the members were equally divided between
   the opinions of Gassiot and Palmieri.A further session will take
   place on the arrival of Prof.Tyndall, who has been telegraphed
   for from New York, and of the great Russian geologist and
   astronomer, Tugenieff.In conclusion, the damage already done may be summed up as
   follows: The destruction of the Bruges and Hond Canal by the
   formation of a basaltic <DW18> across it more than two hundred feet
   wide, the burning of Dudzeele, and the devastation of about
   thirty thousand acres of valuable land.At the same time it is
   utterly impossible to predict where the damage may stop, inasmuch
   as early this morning the mouth of the crater had fallen in, and
   the flowing stream had more than doubled in size.In consideration of the part hitherto taken by the Government of
   the United States in originating the work that led to the
   catastrophe, and by request of M. Musenheim, the Belgian Foreign
   Secretary, I have taken the liberty of drawing upon the State
   Department for eighty-seven thousand dollars, being the sum
   agreed to be paid for the cost of emigration to the United States
   of two hundred families (our own pro rata) rendered homeless by
   the conflagration of Dudzeele.I am this moment in receipt of your telegram dated yesterday,
   and rejoice to learn that Prof.Agassiz has returned from the
   South Seas, and will be sent forward without delay.With great respect, I have the honor to be your obedient servant,

                                        JOHN FLANNAGAN,
                                United States Consul at Bruges.P.S.--Since concluding the above dispatch, Professor Palmieri did
   me the honor of a special call, and, after some desultory
   conversation, approached the all-absorbing topic of the day, and
   cautiously expressed his opinion as follows: Explaining his
   theory, as announced at the Congress, he said that "Holland,
   Belgium, and Denmark, being all low countries, some portions of
   each lying below the sea-level, he would not be surprised if the
   present outflow of lava devastated them all, and covered the
   bottom of the North Sea for many square leagues with a bed of
   basalt."The reason given was this: "That lava must continue to
   flow until, by its own action, it builds up around the volcanic
   crater a rim or cone high enough to afford a counterpoise to the
   centrifugal tendency of axial energy; and that, as the earth's
   crust was demonstrated to be exceptionally thin in the north of
   Europe, the height required in this instance would be so great
   that an enormous lapse of time must ensue before the self-created
   cone could obtain the necessary altitude.Before _AEtna_ attained
   its present secure height, it devastated an area as large as
   France; and Prof.Whitney has demonstrated that some center of
   volcanic action, now extinct, in the State of California, threw
   out a stream that covered a much greater surface, as the basaltic
   table mountains, vulgarly so called, extend north and south for a
   distance as great as from Moscow to Rome."In concluding his
   remarks, he ventured the prediction that "the North Sea would be
   completely filled up, and the British Islands again connected
   with the Continent."J. F., U.S.C._WILDEY'S DREAM._


    A blacksmith stood, at his anvil good,
          Just fifty years ago,
    And struck in his might, to the left and right,
          The iron all aglow.And fast and far, as each miniature star
          Illumined the dusky air,
    The sparks of his mind left a halo behind,
          Like the aureola of prayer.And the blacksmith thought, as he hammered and wrought,
          Just fifty years ago,
    Of the sins that start in the human heart
          When _its_ metal is all aglow;
    And he breathed a prayer, on the evening air,
          As he watched the fire-sparks roll,
    That with hammer and tongs, _he_ might right the wrongs
          That environ the human soul!When he leaned on his sledge, not like minion or drudge,
          With center in self alone,
    But with vision so grand, it embraced every land,
          In the sweep of its mighty zone;
    O'er mountain and main, o'er forest and plain,
          He gazed from his swarthy home,
    Till rafter and wall, grew up in a hall,
          That covered the world with its dome!'Neath that bending arch, with a tottering march
          All peoples went wailing by,
    To the music of groan, of sob, and of moan,
          To the grave that was yawning nigh,
    When the blacksmith rose and redoubled his blows
          On the iron that was aglow,
    Till his senses did seem to dissolve in a dream,
          Just fifty years ago.He thought that he stood upon a mountain chain,
    And gazed across an almost boundless plain;
    Men of all nations, and of every clime,
    Of ancient epochs, and of modern time,
    Rose in thick ranks before his wandering eye,
    And passed, like waves, in quick succession by.First came Osiris, with his Memphian band
    Of swarth Egyptians, darkening all the land;
    With heads downcast they dragged their limbs along,
    Laden with chains, and torn by lash and thong.From morn till eve they toiled and bled and died,
    And stained with blood the Nile's encroaching tide.Slowly upon the Theban plain there rose
    Old Cheop's pride, a pyramid of woes;
    And millions sank unpitied in their graves,
    With tombs inscribed--"Here lies a realm of slaves."Next came great Nimrod prancing on his steed,
    His serried ranks, Assyrian and Mede,
    By bold Sennacherib moulded into one,
    By bestial Sardanapalus undone.He saw the walls of Babylon arise,
    Spring from the earth, invade the azure skies,
    And bear upon their airy ramparts old
    Gardens and vines, and fruit, and flowers of gold.Beneath their cold and insalubrious shade
    All woes and vices had their coverts made;
    Lascivious incest o'er the land was sown,
    From peasant cabin to imperial throne,
    And that proud realm, so full of might and fame,
    Went down at last in blood, and sin, and shame.Then came the Persian, with his vast array
    Of armed millions, fretting for the fray,
    Led on by Xerxes and his harlot horde,
    Where billows swallowed, and where battle roared.On every side there rose a bloody screen,
    Till mighty Alexander closed the scene.in his pomp and pride,
    Dash through the world, and over myriads ride;
    Plant his proud pennon on the Gangean stream,
    Pierce where the tigers hide, mount where the eagles scream,
    And happy only amid war's alarms,
    The clank of fetters, and the clash of arms;
    And moulding man by battle-fields and blows,
    To one foul mass of furies, fiends and foes.Such, too, the Roman, vanquishing mankind,
    Their fields to ravage, and their limbs to bind;
    Whose proudest trophy, and whose highest good,
    To write his fame with pencil dipped in blood;
    To stride the world, like Ocean's turbid waves,
    And sink all nations into servient slaves.As passed the old, so modern realms swept by,
    Woe in all hearts, and tears in every eye;
    Crimes stained the noble, famine crushed the poor;
    Poison for kings, oppression for the boor;
    Force by the mighty, fraud by the feebler shown;
    Mercy a myth, and charity unknown.The Dreamer sighed, for sorrow filled his breast;
    Turned from the scene and sank to deeper rest.cried a low voice full of music sweet,
    "Come!"Down the steep hills they wend their toilsome way,
    Cross the vast plain that on their journey lay;
    Gain the dark city, through its suburbs roam,
    And pause at length within the dreamer's home.Again he stood at his anvil good
      With an angel by his side,
    And rested his sledge on its iron edge
      And blew up his bellows wide;
    He kindled the flame till the white heat came,
      Then murmured in accent low:
    "All ready am I your bidding to try
      So far as a mortal may go."'Midst the heat and the smoke the angel spoke,
      And breathed in his softest tone,
    "Heaven caught up your prayer on the evening air
      As it mounted toward the throne.God weaveth no task for mortals to ask
      Beyond a mortal's control,
    And with hammer and tongs you shall right the wrongs
      That encompass the human soul."But go you first forth '<DW41> the sons of the earth,
      And bring me a human heart
    That throbs for its kind, spite of weather and wind,
      And acts still a brother's part.The night groweth late, but here will I wait
      Till dawn streak the eastern skies;
    And lest you should fail, spread _my_ wings on the gale,
      And search with _my_ angel eyes."The dreamer once more passed the open door,
      But plumed for an angel's flight;
    He sped through the world like a thunderbolt hurled
      When the clouds are alive with light;
    He followed the sun till his race was won,
      And probed every heart and mind;
    But in every zone man labored alone
      For himself and not for his kind.All mournful and flushed, his dearest hopes crushed,
      The dreamer returned to his home,
    And stood in the flare of the forge's red glare,
      Besprinkled with dew and foam."The heart you have sought must be tempered and taught
      In the flame that is all aglow.""No heart could I find that was true to its kind,
      So I left all the world in its woe."Then the stern angel cried: "In your own throbbing side
      Beats a heart that is sound to the core;
    Will you give your own life to the edge of the knife
      For the widowed, the orphaned, and poor?""Most unworthy am I for my brothers to die,
      And sinful my sorrowing heart;
    But strike, if you will, to redeem or to kill,
      With life I am willing to part."Then he threw ope his vest and bared his broad breast
      To the angel's glittering blade;
    Soon the swift purple tide gushed a stream red and wide
      From the wound that the weapon had made.With a jerk and a start he then plucked out his heart,
      And buried it deep in the flame
    That flickered and fell like the flashes of hell
      O'er the dreamer's quivering frame."Now with hammer and tongs you may right all the wrongs
      That environ the human soul;
    But first, you must smite with a Vulcan's might
      The heart in yon blistering bowl."Quick the blacksmith arose, and redoubling his blows,
      Beat the heart that was all aglow,
    Till its fiery scars like a shower of stars
      Illumined the night with their flow.Every sling of his sledge reopened the edge
      Of wounds that were healed long ago;
    And from each livid chasm leaped forth a phantasm
      Of passion, of sin, or of woe.But he heeded no pain as he hammered amain,
      For the angel was holding the heart,
    And cried at each blow, "Strike high!"So he hammered and wrought, and he toiled and fought
      Till Aurora peeped over the plain;
    When the angel flew by and ascended the sky,
      _But left on the anvil a chain!_
    Its links were as bright as heaven's own light,
      As pure as the fountain of youth;
    And bore on each fold in letters of gold,
      This token--LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND TRUTH.The dreamer awoke, and peered through the smoke
      At the anvil that slept by his side;
    And then in a wreath of flower-bound sheath,
      The triple-linked chain he espied.Odd Fellowship's gem is that bright diadem,
      Our emblem in age and in youth;
    For our hearts we must prove in the fire of LOVE,
      And mould with the hammer of TRUTH._WHITHERWARD._


By pursuing the analogies of nature, the human mind reduces to order the
vagaries of the imagination, and bodies them forth in forms of
loveliness and in similitudes of heaven.By an irrevocable decree of Nature's God, all his works are progressive
in the direction of himself.This law is traceable from the molehill up
to the mountain, from the mite up to the man.Geology, speaking to us
from the depths of a past eternity, from annals inscribed upon the
imperishable rock, utters not one syllable to contradict this tremendous
truth.Millions of ages ago, she commenced her impartial record, and as
we unroll it to-day, from the coal-bed and the marble quarry, we read in
creation's dawn as plainly as we behold in operation around us, the
mighty decree--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!In the shadowy past this majestic globe floated through the blue ether,
a boiling flood of lava.Time was not;
for as yet the golden laws of Kepler had not emerged from chaos.The sun
had not hemmed his bright-eyed daughters in, nor marked out on the azure
concave the paths they were to tread.The planets were not worlds, but
shot around the lurid center liquid masses of flame and desolation.Comets sported at random through the sky, and trailed after them their
horrid skirts of fire.The Spirit of God had not "moved upon the face of
the waters," and rosy Chaos still held the scepter in his hand.As the coral worm toils on in the unfathomable
depths of ocean, laying in secret the foundations of mighty continents,
destined as the ages roll by to emerge into light and grandeur, so the
laws of the universe carried on their everlasting work.An eternity elapsed, and the age of fire passed away.A new era dawned
upon the earth.The gases were generated, and the elements of air and
water overspread the globe.Islands began to appear, at first presenting
pinnacles of bare and blasted granite; but gradually, by decay and
decomposition, changing into dank marshes and fertile plains.One after another the sensational universe now springs into being.This
but prepared the way for the animated, and that in turn formed the
groundwork and basis for the human.Man then came forth, the result of
all her previous efforts--nature's pet, her paragon and her pride.Reason sits enthroned upon his brow, and the soul wraps its sweet
affections about his heart; angels spread their wings above him, and God
calls him His child.He treads the earth its acknowledged monarch, and
commences its subjection.One by one the elements have yielded to his
sway, nature has revealed her hoariest secrets to his ken, and heaven
thrown wide its portals to his spirit.He stands now upon the very acme
of the visible creation, and with straining eye, and listening ear, and
anxious heart, whispers to himself that terrific and tremendous
word--WHITHERWARD!Late one afternoon in April, I was sitting on the grassy <DW72> of
Telegraph Hill, watching the waves of sunset as they rolled in from the
west, and broke in crimson spray upon the peaks of the Contra Costa
hills.I was alone; and, as my custom is, was ruminating upon the grand
problem of futurity.The broad and beautiful bay spread out like a sea
of silver at my feet, and the distant mountains, reflecting the rays of
the setting sun, seemed to hem it in with barriers of gold.The city lay
like a tired infant at evening in its mother's arms, and only at
intervals disturbed my reflections by its expiring sobs.The hours of
business I well knew had passed, and the heavy iron door had long since
grated on its hinges, and the fire-proof shutter been bolted for the
night.But I felt that my labors had just commenced.The duties of my
profession had swallowed up thought throughout the long hours devoted to
the cares of life, and it was not until I was released from their
thraldom that I found myself in truth a slave.The one master-thought
came back into my brain, until it burned its hideous image there in
letters of fire--WHITHERWARD!The past came up before me with its long memories of Egyptian grandeur,
with its triumphs of Grecian art, with its burden of Roman glory.Italy
came with her republics, her "starry" Galileo, and her immortal
Buonarotti.France flashed by, with her garments dyed in blood, and her
Napoleons in chains.England rose up with her arts and her arms, her
commerce and her civilization, her splendor and her shame.I beheld
Newton gazing at the stars, heard Milton singing of Paradise, and saw
Russell expiring on the scaffold.But ever and anon a pale,
thorn-crowned monarch, arrayed in mock-purple, and bending beneath a
cross, would start forth at my side, and with uplifted eye, but
speechless lip, point with one hand to the pages of a volume I had open
on my knee, and with the other to the blue heaven above.Judea would
then pass with solemn tread before me.Her patriarchs, her prophets and
her apostles, her judges, her kings, and her people, one by one came and
went like the phantasmagoria of a dream.The present then rose up in
glittering robes, its feet resting upon the mounds of Nimrod, its brow
encircled with a coronet of stars, pillaging, with one hand, the cloud
above of its lightnings, and sending them forth with the other, bridled
and subdued, to the uttermost ends of the earth.Earth's physical history also swept by in full
review.All nature lent her stores, and with an effort of mind, by no
means uncommon for those who have long thought upon a single subject, I
seemed to possess the power to generalize all that I had ever heard,
read or seen, into one gorgeous picture, and hang it up in the wide
heavens before me.The actual scenery around me entirely disappeared, and I beheld an
immense pyramid of alabaster, reared to the very stars, upon whose sides
I saw inscribed a faithful history of the past.Its foundations were in
deep shadow, but the light gradually increased toward the top, until its
summit was bathed in the most refulgent lustre.Inscribed in golden letters I read on one of its sides these words, in
alternate layers, rising gradually to the apex: "_Granite_, _Liquid_,
_Gas_, _Electricity_;" on another, "_Inorganic_, _Vegetable_, _Animal_,
_Human_;" on the third side, "_Consciousness_, _Memory_, _Reason_,
_Imagination_;" and on the fourth, "_Chaos_, _Order_, _Harmony_,
_Love_."At this moment I beheld the figure of a human being standing at the
base of the pyramid, and gazing intently upward.He then placed his foot
upon the foundation, and commenced climbing toward the summit.I caught
a distinct view of his features, and perceived that they were black and
swarthy like those of the most depraved Hottentot.He toiled slowly
upward, and as he passed the first layer, he again looked toward me, and
I observed that his features had undergone a complete transformation.He passed the second
layer; and as he entered the third, once more presented his face to me
for observation.Another change had overspread it, and I readily
recognized in him the tawny native of Malacca or Hindoostan.As he
reached the last layer, and entered its region of refulgent light, I
caught a full glimpse of his form and features, and beheld the high
forehead, the glossy ringlets, the hazel eye, and the alabaster skin of
the true Caucasian.I now observed for the first time that the pyramid was left unfinished,
and that its summit, instead of presenting a well-defined peak, was in
reality a level plain.In a few moments more, the figure I had traced
from the base to the fourth layer, reached the apex, and stood with
folded arms and upraised brow upon the very summit.His lips parted as
if about to speak, and as I leaned forward to hear, I caught, in
distinct tone and thrilling accent, that word which had so often risen
to my own lips for utterance, and seared my very brain, because
unanswered--WHITHERWARD!exclaimed I, aloud, shuddering at the sepulchral
sound of my voice."Home," responded a tiny voice at my side, and
turning suddenly around, my eyes met those of a sweet little
school-girl, with a basket of flowers upon her arm, who had approached
me unobserved, and who evidently imagined I had addressed her when I
spoke."Yes, little daughter," replied I, "'tis time to proceed
homeward, for the sun has ceased to gild the summit of Diavolo, and the
evening star is visible in the west.I will attend you home," and taking
her proffered hand, I descended the hill, with the dreadful word still
ringing in my ears, and the fadeless vision still glowing in my heart.#       #       #       #       #

Midnight had come and gone, and still the book lay open on my knee.The
candle had burned down close to the socket, and threw a flickering
glimmer around my chamber; but no indications of fatigue or slumber
visited my eyelids.My temples throbbed heavily, and I felt the hot and
excited blood playing like the piston-rod of an engine between my heart
and brain.I had launched forth on the broad ocean of speculation, and now
perceived, when too late, the perils of my situation.Above me were
dense and lowering clouds, which no eye could penetrate; around me
howling tempests, which no voice could quell; beneath me heaving
billows, which no oil could calm.I thought of Plato struggling with his
doubts; of Epicurus sinking beneath them; of Socrates swallowing his
poison; of Cicero surrendering himself to despair.I remembered how all
the great souls of the earth had staggered beneath the burden of the
same thought, which weighed like a thousand Cordilleras upon my own; and
as I pressed my hand upon my burning brow, I cried again and
again--WHITHERWARD!I could find no relief in philosophy; for I knew her maxims by heart
from Zeno and the Stagirite down to Berkeley and Cousin.I had followed
her into all her hiding-places, and courted her in all her moods.No
coquette was ever half so false, so fickle, and so fair.Her robes are
woven of the sunbeams, and a star adorns her brow; but she sits
impassive upon her icy throne, and wields no scepter but despair.The
light she throws around is not the clear gleam of the sunshine, nor the
bright twinkle of the star; but glances in fitful glimmerings on the
soul, like the aurora on the icebergs of the pole, and lightens up the
scene only to show its utter desolation.The Bible lay open before me, but I could find no comfort there.Its
lessons were intended only for the meek and humble, and my heart was
cased in pride.It reached only to the believing; I was tossed on an
ocean of doubt.It required, as a condition to faith, the innocence of
an angel and the humility of a child; I had long ago seared my
conscience by mingling in the busy scenes of life, and was proud of my
mental acquirements.The Bible spoke comfort to the Publican; I was of
the straight sect of the Pharisees.Its promises were directed to the
poor in spirit, whilst mine panted for renown.At this moment, whilst heedlessly turning over its leaves and scarcely
glancing at their contents, my attention was arrested by this remarkable
passage in one of Paul's epistles: "That was not _first_ which is
spiritual, but that which was natural, and _afterward_ that which is
spiritual.Behold, I show you a mystery: _we shall not all sleep_, but
we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the
last trump."Again and again I read this text, for it promised more by reflection
than at first appeared in the words.Slowly a light broke in on the
horizon's verge, and I felt, for the first time in my whole life, that
the past was not all inexplicable, nor the future a chaos, but that the
human soul, lit up by the torch of science!and guided by the
prophecies of Holy Writ, might predict the path it is destined to tread,
and read in advance the history of its final enfranchisement.Paul
evidently intended to teach the doctrine of _progress_, even in its
applicability to man.He did not belong to that narrow-minded sect in
philosophy, which declares that the earth and the heavens are finished;
that man is the crowning glory of his Maker, and the utmost stretch of
His creative power; that henceforth the globe which he inhabits is
barren, and can produce no being superior to himself.On the contrary,
he clearly intended to teach the same great truth which modern science
is demonstrating to all the world, that progression is nature's first
law, and that even in the human kingdom the irrevocable decree has gone
forth--ONWARD AND UPWARD, FOREVER!Such were my reflections when the last glimmer of the candle flashed up
like a meteor, and then as suddenly expired in night.I was glad that
the shadows were gone.Better, thought I, is utter darkness than that
poor flame which renders it visible.But I had suddenly grown rich in
thought.A clue had been furnished to the labyrinth in which I had
wandered from a child; a hint had been planted in the mind which it
would be impossible ever to circumscribe or extinguish.One letter had
been identified by which, like Champollion le Jeune, I could eventually
decipher the inscription on the pyramid.What are these spectral
apparitions which rear themselves in the human mind, and are called by
mortals _hints_?Who lodges them in the chambers of
the mind, where they sprout and germinate, and bud and blossom, and
bear?The Florentine caught one as it fell from the stars, and invented the
telescope to observe them.Columbus caught another, as it was whispered
by the winds, and they wafted him to the shores of a New World.Franklin
beheld one flash forth from the cloud, and he traced the lightnings to
their bourn.Another dropped from the skies into the brain of Leverrier,
and he scaled the very heavens, till he unburied a star.Rapidly was my mind working out the solution of the problem which had so
long tortured it, based upon the intimation it had derived from St.Paul's epistle, when most unexpectedly, and at the same time most
unwelcomely, I fell into one of those strange moods which can neither be
called sleep nor consciousness, but which leave their impress far more
powerfully than the visions of the night or the events of the day.I beheld a small egg, most beautifully dotted over, and stained.Whilst
my eye rested on it, it cracked; an opening was made _from within_, and
almost immediately afterward a bird of glittering plumage and mocking
song flew out, and perched on the bough of a rose-tree, beneath whose
shadow I found myself reclining.Before my surprise had vanished, I
beheld a painted worm at my feet, crawling toward the root of the tree
which was blooming above me.It soon reached the trunk, climbed into the
branches, and commenced spinning its cocoon.Hardly had it finished its
silken home, ere it came forth in the form of a gorgeous butterfly, and,
spreading its wings, mounted toward the heavens.Quickly succeeding
this, the same pyramid of alabaster, which I had seen from the summit of
Telegraph Hill late in the afternoon, rose gradually upon the view.It
was in nowise changed; the inscriptions on the sides were the same, and
the identical figure stood with folded arms and uplifted brow upon the
top.I now heard a rushing sound, such as stuns the ear at Niagara, or
greets it during a hurricane at sea, when the shrouds of the ship are
whistling to the blast, and the flashing billows are dashing against her
sides.Suddenly the pyramid commenced changing its form, and before many
moments elapsed it had assumed the rotundity of a globe, and I beheld it
covered with seas, and hills, and lakes, and mountains, and plains, and
fertile fields.But the human figure still stood upon its crest.Then
came forth the single blast of a bugle, such as the soldier hears on the
morn of a world-changing battle.Caesar heard it at Pharsalia, Titus at
Jerusalem, Washington at Yorktown, and Wellington at Waterloo.No lightning flash ever rended forest king from crest to root quicker
than the transformation which now overspread the earth.In a second of
time it became as transparent as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun.But in every other respect it preserved its identity.On casting my eyes
toward the human being, I perceived that he still preserved his
position, but his feet did not seem to touch the earth.He appeared to
be floating upon its arch, as the halcyon floats in the atmosphere.His
features were lit up with a heavenly radiance, and assumed an expression
of superhuman beauty.The thought crossed my mind, Can this be a spirit?As sudden as the
question came forth the response, "I am."But, inquired my mind, for my
lips did not move, you have never passed the portals of the grave?Again
I read in his features the answer, "For ages this earth existed as a
natural body, and all its inhabitants partook of its characteristics;
gradually it approached the spiritual state, and by a law like that
which transforms the egg into the songster, or the worm into the
butterfly, it has just accomplished one of its mighty cycles, and now
gleams forth with the refulgence of the stars.I did not die, but passed
as naturally into the spiritual world as the huge earth itself.Prophets
and apostles predicted this change many hundred years ago; but the blind
infatuation of our race did not permit them to realize its truth.Your
own mind, in common with the sages of all time, long brooded over the
idea, and oftentimes have you exclaimed, in agony and
dismay--WHITHERWARD!The revolution may not come in the year
allotted you, but so surely as St.Paul spoke inspiration, so surely as
science elicits truth, so surely as the past prognosticates the future,
the natural world must pass into the spiritual, and everything be
changed in the twinkling of an eye.your own ears may hear
the clarion note, your own eyes witness the transfiguration."Slowly the vision faded away, and left me straining my gaze into the
dark midnight which now shrouded the world, and endeavoring to calm my
heart, which throbbed as audibly as the hollow echoes of a drum.When
the morning sun peeped over the Contra Costa range, I still sat silent
and abstracted in my chair, revolving over the incidents of the night,
but thankful that, though the reason is powerless to brush away the
clouds which obscure the future, yet the imagination may spread its
wings, and, soaring into the heavens beyond them, answer the soul when
in terror she inquires--WHITHERWARD!_OUR WEDDING-DAY._


                   I.

    A dozen springs, and more, dear Sue,
      Have bloomed, and passed away,
    Since hand in hand, and heart to heart,
      We spent our wedding-day.Youth blossomed on our cheeks, dear Sue,
      Joy chased each tear of woe,
    When first we promised to be true,
      That morning long ago.Though many cares have come, dear Sue,
      To checker life's career,
    As down its pathway we have trod,
      In trembling and in fear.Still in the darkest storm, dear Sue,
      That lowered o'er the way,
    We clung the closer, while it blew,
      And laughed the clouds away.'Tis true, our home is humble, Sue,
      And riches we have not,
    But children gambol round our door,
      And consecrate the spot.Our sons are strong and brave, dear Sue,
      Our daughters fair and gay,
    But none so beautiful as you,
      Upon our wedding-day.No grief has crossed our threshold, Sue,
      No crape festooned the door,
    But health has waved its halcyon wings,
      And plenty filled our store.Then let's be joyful, darling Sue,
      And chase dull cares away,
    And kindle rosy hope anew,
      As on our wedding-day.[Decoration]

XVII._THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW._


    One more flutter of time's restless wing,
    One more furrow in the forehead of spring;
    One more step in the journey of fate,
    One more ember gone out in life's grate;
    One more gray hair in the head of the sage,
    One more round in the ladder of age;
    One leaf more in the volume of doom,
    And one span less in the march to the tomb,
    Since brothers, we gathered around bowl and tree,
    And Santa Claus welcomed with frolic and glee.How has thy life been speeding
          Since Aurora, at the dawn,
        Peeped within thy portals, leading
          The babe year, newly born?Has thy soul been scorched by sorrow,
          Has some spectre nestled there?And with every new to-morrow,
          Sowed the seeds of fresh despair?Burst its chain with strength sublime,
        For behold!I bring another,
          And a fairer child of time.Have thy barns been brimming o'er?Will thy stature fit the niches
          Hewn for Hercules of yore?the rolling planet
          Starts on a nobler round.But perhaps across thy vision
          Death had cast its shadow there,
        And thy home, once all elysian,
          Now crapes an empty chair;
        Or happier, thy dominions,
          Spreading broad and deep and strong,
        Re-echo 'neath love's pinions
          To a pretty cradle song!God's blessing on your head;

XVIII._A PAIR OF MYTHS:_

BEING A CHAPTER FROM AN UNPUBLISHED WORK.Eight days passed away unreckoned, and still I remained unconscious of
everything occurring around me.The morning of the ninth dawned, dragged
heavily along, and noon approached, whilst I lay in the same comatose
state.No alteration had taken place, except that a deeper and sounder
sleep seemed to have seized upon me; a symptom hailed by my physician
with joy, but regarded by my mother with increased alarm.Suddenly, the incautious closing of my chamber door, as my sister, Miss
Lucy Stanly, then in her fifteenth year, entered the apartment, aroused
me from slumber and oblivion.I endeavored to recall something
of the past, but memory for a long time refused its aid, and I appeared
as fatally and irremediably unconscious as ever.Gradually, however, my
shattered mind recovered its faculties, and in less than an hour after
my awakening, I felt perfectly restored.No pain tormented me, and no
torpor benumbed my faculties.I rapidly reviewed, mentally, the
occurrences of the day before, when, as I imagined, the disaster had
happened, and resolved at once to rise from my bed and prosecute my
intended journey.At this moment my father entered the apartment, and observing that I
was awake, ventured to speak to me kindly and in a very low tone.I
smiled at his uneasiness, and immediately relieved him from all
apprehension, by conversing freely and intelligibly of the late
catastrophe.He seized my hand a thousand
times, and pressed it again and again to his lips.At length,
remembering that my mother was ignorant of my complete restoration, he
rushed from the room, in order to be the first to convey the welcome
intelligence.My bed was soon surrounded by the whole family, chattering away, wild
with joy, and imprinting scores of kisses on my lips, cheeks and
forehead.The excitement proved too severe for me in my weak condition,
and had not the timely arrival of the physician intervened to clear my
chamber of every intruder, except Mamma Betty, as we all called the
nurse, these pages in all probability would never have arrested the
reader's eye.As it was, I suddenly grew very sick and faint; everything
around me assumed a deep green tinge, and I fell into a deathlike swoon.Another morning's sun was shining cheerily in at my window, when
consciousness again returned.The doctor was soon at my side, and
instead of prescribing physic as a remedy, requested my sister to sit at
my bedside, and read in a low tone any interesting little story she
might select.He cautioned her not to mention, even in the most casual
manner, _Mormonism_, _St.Louis_, or the _Moselle_, which order she most
implicitly obeyed; nor could all my ingenuity extract a solitary remark
in relation to either.My sister was not very long in making a selection; for, supposing what
delighted herself would not fail to amuse me, she brought in a
manuscript, carefully folded, and proceeded at once to narrate its
history.It was written by my father, as a sort of model or sampler for
my brothers and sisters, which they were to imitate when composition-day
came round, instead of "hammering away," as he called it, on moral
essays and metaphysical commonplaces.It was styled


THE KING OF THE NINE-PINS: A MYTH.Heinrich Schwarz, or Black Hal, as he was wont to be called, was an old
toper, but he was possessed of infinite good humor, and related a great
many very queer stories, the truth of which no one, that I ever heard
of, had the hardihood to doubt; for Black Hal had an uncommon share of
"Teutonic pluck" about him, and was at times very unceremonious in the
display of it.But Hal had a weakness--it was not liquor, for that was
his strength--which he never denied; _Hal was too fond of nine-pins_.He
had told me, in confidence, that "many a time and oft" he had rolled
incessantly for weeks together.I think I heard him say that he once
rolled for a month, day and night, without stopping a single moment to
eat or to drink, or even to catch his breath.I did not question his veracity at the time; but since, on reflection,
the fact seems almost incredible; and were it not that this sketch might
accidentally fall in his way, I might be tempted to show philosophically
that such a thing could not possibly be.And yet I have read of very
long fasts in my day--that, for instance, of Captain Riley in the Great
Sahara, and others, which will readily occur to the reader.But I must
not episodize, or I shall not reach my story.Black Hal was sitting late one afternoon in a Nine-Pin Alley, in the
little town of Kaatskill, in the State of New York--it is true, for he
said so--when a tremendous thunder-storm invested his retreat.His
companions, one by one, had left him, until, rising from his seat and
gazing around, he discovered that he was alone.The alley-keeper, too,
could nowhere be found, and the boys who were employed to set up the
pins had disappeared with the rest.It was growing very late, and Hal
had a long walk, and he thought it most prudent to get ready to start
home.The lightning glared in at the door and windows most vividly, and
the heavy thunder crashed and rumbled and roared louder than he had ever
heard it before.The rain, too, now commenced to batter down
tremendously, and just as night set in, Hal had just got ready to set
out.Hal first felt uneasy, next unhappy, and finally miserable.If he
had but a boy to talk to!A verse
that he learned in his boyhood, across the wide sea, came unasked into
his mind.It always came there precisely at the time he did not desire
its company.It ran thus:

    "Oh!for the might of dread Odin
       The powers upon him shed,
     For a sail in the good ship Skidbladnir,[A-236]
       And a talk with Mimir's head!"[B-236]

[Footnote A-236: The ship Skidbladnir was the property of Odin.He could
sail in it on the most dangerous seas, and yet could fold it up and
carry it in his pocket.][Footnote B-236: Mimir's head was always the companion of Odin.When he
desired to know what was transpiring in distant countries, he inquired
of Mimir, and always received a correct reply.]This verse was repeated over and over again inaudibly.Gradually,
however, his voice became a little louder, and a little louder still,
until finally poor Hal hallooed it vociferously forth so sonorously that
it drowned the very thunder.He had repeated it just seventy-seven
times, when suddenly a monstrous head was thrust in at the door, and
demanded, in a voice that sounded like the maelstrom, "What do _you_
want with Odin?""Oh, nothing--nothing in the world, I thank you, sir,"
politely responded poor Hal, shaking from head to foot.Here the head
was followed by the shoulders, arms, body and legs of a giant at least
forty feet high.Of course he came in on all fours, and approached in
close proximity to Black Hal.Hal involuntarily retreated, as far as he
could, reciting to himself the only prayer he remembered, "Now I lay me
down to sleep," etc.The giant did not appear desirous of pursuing Hal, being afraid--so Hal
said--that he would draw his knife on him.But be the cause what it
might, he seated himself at the head of the nine-pin alley, and shouted,
"Stand up!"As he did so, the nine-pins at the other end arose and took
their places."Now, sir," said he, turning again to Hal, "I'll bet you an ounce of
your blood I can beat you rolling."Hal trembled again, but meekly replied, "Please, sir, we don't bet
_blood_ nowadays--we bet _money_.""Blood's my money," roared forth the giant.Hal tried in
vain to hoist the window."Yes, sir," said Hal; and he thought as it was only _an ounce_, he could
spare that without much danger, and it might appease the monster's
appetite."Yes, sir," replied Hal, as he seized what he supposed to be the largest
and his favorite ball."What are you doing with Mimir's head?""I beg your pardon, most humbly," began Hal, as he let the bloody head
fall; "I did not mean any harm."Hal fell on his knees and recited most devoutly, "Now I lay me down,"
etc.I say," and the giant seized poor Hal by the collar
and set him on his feet.He now selected a large ball, and poising it carefully in his hand, ran
a few steps, and sent it whirling right in among the nine-pins; but what
was his astonishment to behold them jump lightly aside, and permit the
ball to pass in an avenue directly through the middle of the alley.The second and third ball met with no better success.Odin--for Hal said it was certainly he, as he had Mimir's head
along--now grasped a ball and rolled it with all his might; but long
before it reached the nine-pins, they had, every one of them, tumbled
down, and lay sprawling on the alley.said the giant, as he grinned most gleefully at poor Hal.Taking another ball, he
hurled it down the alley, and the same result followed."I give up the game," whined out Hal."Then you lose double," rejoined Odin.Hal readily consented to pay two ounces, for he imagined, by yielding at
once, he would so much the sooner get rid of his grim companion.As he
said so, Odin pulled a pair of scales out of his coat pocket, made
proportionably to his own size.He poised them upon a beam in the alley,
and drew forth what he denominated two ounces, and put them in one
scale.Each ounce was about the size of a twenty-eight pound weight, and
was quite as heavy.shouted the giant, as he
grasped the gasping and terrified gambler.He soon rolled up his
sleeves, and bound his arm with a pocket handkerchief.Next he drew
forth a lancet as long as a sword, and drove the point into the biggest
vein he could discover.When he returned to
consciousness, the sun was shining brightly in at the window, and the
sweet rumbling of the balls assured him that he still lay where the
giant left him.On rising to his feet he perceived that a large coagulum
of blood had collected where his head rested all night, and that he
could scarcely walk from the effects of his exhaustion.He returned
immediately home and told his wife all that had occurred; and though,
like some of the neighbors, she distrusted the tale, yet she never
intimated her doubts to Black Hal himself.The alley-keeper assured me
in a whisper, one day, that upon the very night fixed on by Hal for the
adventure, he was beastly drunk, and had been engaged in a fight with
one of his boon companions, who gave him a black eye and a bloody nose.But the alley-keeper was always jealous of Black Hal's superiority in
story telling; besides, he often drank too much himself, and I suspect
he originated the report he related to me in a fit of wounded pride, or
drunken braggadocio.One thing is certain, he never ventured to repeat
the story in the presence of Black Hal himself.#       #       #       #       #

In spite of the attention I endeavored to bestow on the marvelous
history of Black Hal and his grim companion, my mind occasionally
wandered far away, and could only find repose in communing with her who
I now discovered for the first time held in her own hands the thread of
my destiny.Lucy was not blind to these fits of abstraction, and
whenever they gained entire control of my attention, she would pause,
lay down the manuscript, and threaten most seriously to discontinue the
perusal, unless I proved a better listener.I ask no man's pardon for
declaring that my sister was an excellent reader.Most brothers, perhaps
think the same of most sisters; but there _was_ a charm in Lucy's accent
and a distinctness in her enunciation I have never heard excelled.Owing
to these qualities, as much, perhaps, as to the strangeness of the
story, I became interested in the fate of the drunken gambler, and when
Lucy concluded, I was ready to exclaim, "And pray where is Black Hal
now?"My thoughts took another direction, however, and I impatiently demanded
whether or not the sample story had been imitated.A guilty blush
assured me quite as satisfactorily as words could have done, that Miss
Lucy had herself made an attempt, and I therefore insisted that as she
had whetted and excited the appetite, it would be highly
unfraternal--(particularly in my present very precarious
condition)--that parenthesis settled the matter--to deny me the means of
satisfying it."But you'll laugh at me," timidly whispered my sister."Of course I shall," said I, "if your catastrophe is half as melancholy
as Black Hal's.But make haste, or I shall be off to St.But pray
inform me, what is the subject of your composition?""I believe, on my soul," responded I, laughing outright, "you girls
never think about anything else."I provoked no reply, and the manuscript being unfolded, my sister thus
attempted to elucidate


THE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE.Professor Williams having ceased his manipulations, my eyes
involuntarily closed, and I became unconscious to everything occurring
around me.There's truth in mesmerism, after all, thought I, and being
in the clairvoyant state, I beheld a most beautiful comet at this moment
emerging from the constellation Taurus, and describing a curve about the
star Zeta, one of the Pleiades.and as this thought entered my brain, I grasped a hair in the tail of
the comet as it whizzed by me.I climbed up the glittering hair until I found myself seated very
comfortably on the comet's back, and was beginning to enjoy my starlit
ramble exceedingly, when I was suddenly aroused from my meditations by
the song of a heavenly minstrel, who, wandering from star to star and
system to system, sang the fate of other worlds and other beings to
those who would listen to his strains and grant him the rites of
hospitality.As I approached, his tones were suddenly changed, his voice
lowered into a deeper key, and gazing intently at me, or at what
evidenced my presence to his sight, thus began:

The flaming sword of the cherub, which had waved so frightfully above
the gate of the garden of Eden, had disappeared; the angel himself was
gone; and Adam, as he approached the spot where so lately he had enjoyed
the delights of heaven, beheld with astonishment and regret that
Paradise and all its splendors had departed from the earth forever.Where the garden lately bloomed, he could discover only the dark and
smouldering embers of a conflagration; a hard lava had incrusted itself
along the golden walks; the birds were flown, the flowers withered, the
fountains dried up, and desolation brooded over the scene.sighed the patriarch of men, "where are now the pleasures which I
once enjoyed along these peaceful avenues?Where are all those
beautiful spirits, given by Heaven to watch over and protect me?Each
guardian angel has deserted me, and the rainbow glories of Paradise have
flown.No more the sun shines out in undimmed splendor, for clouds array
him in gloom; the earth, forgetful of her verdure and her flowers,
produces thorns to wound and frosts to chill me.The very air, once all
balm and zephyrs, now howls around me with the voice of the storm and
the fury of the hurricane.No more the notes of peace and happiness
greet my ears, but the harsh tones of strife and battle resound on every
side.Nature has kindled the flames of discord in her own bosom, and
universal war has begun his reign!"And then the father of mankind hid his face in the bosom of his
companion, and wept the bitter tears of contrition and repentance."Oh, do not weep so bitterly, my Adam," exclaimed his companion."True,
we are miserable, but all is not yet lost; we have forfeited the smiles
of Heaven, but we may yet regain our lost place in its affections.Let
us learn from our misfortunes the anguish of guilt, but let us learn
also the mercy of redemption."Oh, talk not of happiness now," interrupted Adam; "that nymph who once
wailed at our side, attentive to the beck, has disappeared, and fled
from the companionship of such guilty, fallen beings as ourselves,
forever.""Not forever, Adam," kindly rejoined Eve; "she may yet be lurking among
these groves, or lie hid behind yon hills.""Then let us find her," quickly responded Adam; "you follow the sun,
sweet Eve, to his resting-place, whilst I will trace these sparkling
waters to their bourn.Let us ramble this whole creation o'er; and when
we have found her, let us meet again on this very spot, and cling to her
side, until the doom of death shall overtake us."And the eye of Adam beamed with hope, then kindled for the first time on
earth in the bosom of man; and he bade Eve his first farewell, and
started eastward in his search.Eve turned her face to the west, and set out on her allotted journey.The sun had shone a hundred times in midsummer splendor, and a hundred
times had hid himself in the clouds of winter, and yet no human foot had
trod the spot where the garden of Eden once bloomed.Adam had in vain
traced the Euphrates to the sea, and climbed the Himalaya Mountains.In
vain had he endured the tropical heats on the Ganges, and the winter's
cold in Siberia.He stood at last upon the borders of that narrow sea
which separates Asia from America, and casting a wistful glance to the
far-off continent, exclaimed: "In yon land, so deeply blue in the
distance, that it looks like heaven, Happiness may have taken refuge.I will return to Eden, and learn if
Eve, too, has been unsuccessful."And then he took one more look at the distant land, sighed his adieu,
and set out on his return.First child of misery, first daughter of despair!Poor Eve,
with the blue of heaven in her eye, and the crimson of shame upon her
lip!Poor Eve, arrayed in beauty, but hastening to decay--she, too, was
unsuccessful.Wandering in her westward way, the azure waters of the Mediterranean
soon gleamed upon her sight.She stood at length upon the pebbly shore,
and the glad waves, silent as death before, when they kissed her naked
feet, commenced that song still heard in their eternal roar.A mermaid
seemed to rise from the waters at her feet, and to imitate her every
motion.Her long dark tresses, her deep blue eyes, her rosy cheek, her
sorrowful look, all were reflected in the mermaid before her."Sweet spirit," said Eve, "canst thou inform me where the nymph
Happiness lies concealed?She always stood beside us in the garden of
Eden; but when we were driven from Paradise we beheld her no more."The lips of the mermaid moved, but Eve could hear no reply.mother of mankind, the crystal waters of every sea, reflecting thy
lovely image, still faithful to their trust, conceal a mermaid in their
bosom for every daughter of beauty who looks upon them!Neither the orange groves of the Arno, nor the vineyards of France;
neither the forests of Germania, nor the caves of Norway, concealed the
sought-for nymph.Her track was imprinted in the
sands of Sahara, by the banks of the Niger, on the rocks of Bengola, in
the vales of Abyssinia--but all in vain.Come, Death," cried Eve; "come now, and take me where thou
wilt.This world is a desert, for Happiness has left it desolate."A gentle slumber soon overcame the wearied child of sorrow, and in her
sleep a vision came to comfort her.She dreamed that she stood before an
aged man, whose hoary locks attested that the snows of many winters had
whitened them, and in whose glance she recognized the spirit of Wisdom."Aged Father," said Eve, "where is Happiness?"and then she burst into a
flood of tears."Comfort thyself, Daughter," mildly answered the old man; "Happiness yet
dwells on earth, but she is no longer visible.A temple is built for her
in every mortal's bosom, but she never ascends her throne until welcomed
there by the child of Honor and Love."The morning sun aroused Eve from her slumber, but did not dispel the
memory of her dream."I will return to Eden, and there await until the
child of Honor and Love shall enthrone in my bosom the lost nymph
Happiness;" and saying this, she turned her face to the eastward, and
thinking of Adam and her vision, journeyed joyfully along.The sun of Spring had opened the flowers and clothed the woods in
verdure; had freed the streams from their icy fetters, and inspired the
warbling world with harmony, when two forlorn and weary travelers
approached the banks of the river Pison; that river which had flowed
through the garden of Eden when the first sunshine broke upon the world.A hundred years had rolled away, and the echo of no human voice had
resounded through the deserted groves.At length the dusky figures
emerged from the overshadowing shrubbery, and raised their eyes into
each other's faces.One bound--one cry--and they weep for joy in each
other's arms.Adam related his sad and melancholy story, and then Eve soon finished
hers.But no sooner had she told her dream, than Adam, straining her to
his bosom, exclaimed:

"There is no mystery here, my Eve.If Happiness on earth be indeed the
child of Honor and Love, it must be in Matrimony alone.What else now
left us on earth can lay claim to the precious boon?Approved by heaven,
and cherished by man, in the holy bonds of Matrimony it must consist;
and if this be all, we need seek no further; it is ours!"They then knelt in prayer, and returned thanks to Heaven, that though
the garden of Eden was a wild, and the nymph Happiness no longer an
angel at their side, yet that her spirit was still present in every
bosom where the heart is linked to Honor and Love by the sacred ties of
Matrimony.[Decoration]

XIX._THE LAST OF HIS RACE._


    No further can fate tempt or try me,
      With guerdon of pleasure or pain;
    Ere the noon of my life has sped by me,
      The last of my race I remain.To that home so long left I might journey;
      But they for whose greeting I yearn,
    Are launched on that shadowy ocean
      Whence voyagers never return.My life is a blank in creation,
      My fortunes no kindred may share;
    No brother to cheer desolation,
      No sister to soften by prayer;
    No father to gladden my triumphs,
      No mother my sins to atone;
    No children to lean on in dying--
      I must finish my journey alone!In that hall, where their feet tripp'd before me,
      How lone would now echo my tread!While each fading portrait threw o'er me
      The chill, stony smile of the dead.One sad thought bewilders my slumbers,
      From eve till the coming of dawn:
    I cry out in visions, "_Where are they_?"And echo responds, "_They are gone_!"But fain, ere the life-fount grows colder,
      I'd wend to that lone, distant place,
    That row of green hillocks, where moulder
      The rest of my early doom'd race.There slumber the true and the manly,
      There slumber the spotless and fair;
    And when my last journey is ended,
      My place of repose be it there![Decoration]

XX._THE TWO GEORGES._


Between the years of our Lord 1730 and 1740, two men were born on
opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean, whose lives were destined to exert
a commanding influence on the age in which they lived, as well as to
control the fortunes of many succeeding generations.One was by birth a plain peasant, the son of a Virginia farmer; the
other an hereditary Prince, and the heir of an immense empire.It will
be the main object of this sketch to trace the histories of these two
individuals, so dissimilar in their origin, from birth to death, and
show how it happened that one has left a name synonymous with tyranny,
whilst the other will descend to the lowest posterity, radiant with
immortal glory, and renowned the world over as the friend of virtue, the
guardian of liberty, and the benefactor of his race.Go with me for one moment to the crowded and splendid metropolis of
England.It is the evening of the 4th of June 1734.Some joyful event
must have occurred, for the bells are ringing merrily, and the
inhabitants are dressed in holiday attire.Nor is the circumstance of a
private nature, for banners are everywhere displayed, the vast city is
illuminated, and a thousand cannon are proclaiming it from their iron
throats.The population seem frantic with joy, and rush tumultuously
into each other's arms, in token of a national jubilee.Tens of
thousands are hurrying along toward a splendid marble pile, situated on
a commanding eminence, near the river Thames, whilst from the loftiest
towers of St.James's Palace the national ensigns of St.George and the
Red Cross are seen floating on the breeze.Within one of the most
gorgeously furnished apartments of that royal abode, the wife of
Frederic, Prince of Wales, and heir apparent to the British Empire, has
just been delivered of a son.The scions of royalty crowd into the
bed-chamber, and solemnly attest the event as one on which the destiny
of a great empire is suspended.The corridors are thronged with dukes,
and nobles, and soldiers, and courtiers, all anxious to bend the supple
knee, and bow the willing neck, to power just cradled into the world.A
Royal Proclamation soon follows, commemorating the event, and commanding
British subjects everywhere, who acknowledge the honor of Brunswick, to
rejoice, and give thanks to God for safely ushering into existence
George William Frederic, heir presumptive of the united crowns of Great
Britain and Ireland.Just twenty-two years afterward that child ascended
the throne of his ancestors as King George the Third.Let us now turn our eyes to the Western Continent, and contemplate a
scene of similar import, but under circumstances of a totally different
character.It is the 22d February, 1732.The locality is a distant
colony, the spot the verge of an immense, untrodden and unexplored
wilderness, the habitation a log cabin, with its chinks filled in with
clay, and its sloping roof patched over with clapboards.Snow covers the
ground, and a chill wintery wind is drifting the flakes, and moaning
through the forest.Two immense chimneys stand at either end of the
house, and give promise of cheerful comfort and primitive hospitality
within, totally in contrast with external nature.There are but four
small rooms in the dwelling, in one of which Mary Ball, the wife of
Augustine Washington, has just given birth to a son.No dukes or
marquises or earls are there to attest the humble event.There are no
princes of the blood to wrap the infant in the insignia of royalty, and
fold about his limbs the tapestried escutcheon of a kingdom.His first
breath is not drawn in the center of a mighty capitol, the air laden
with perfume, and trembling to the tones of soft music and the "murmurs
of low fountains."But the child is received from its Mother's womb by
hands imbrowned with honest labor, and laid upon a lowly couch,
indicative only of a backwoodsman's home and an American's inheritance.He, too, is christened George, and forty-three years afterward took
command of the American forces assembled on the plains of old Cambridge.But if their births were dissimilar, their rearing and education were
still more unlike.From his earliest recollection the Prince heard only
the language of flattery, moved about from palace to palace, just as
caprice dictated, slept upon the cygnet's down, and grew up in
indolence, self-will and vanity, a dictator from his cradle.The peasant
boy, on the other hand, was taught from his infancy that labor was
honorable, and hardships indispensable to vigorous health.He early
learned to sleep alone amid the dangers of a boundless wilderness, a
stone for his pillow, and the naked sod his bed; whilst the voices of
untamed nature around him sang his morning and his evening hymns.Truth,
courage and constancy were early implanted in his mind by a mother's
counsels, and the important lesson of life was taught by a father's
example, that when existence ceases to be useful it ceases to be happy.Early manhood ushered them both into active life; the one as king over
extensive dominions, the other as a modest, careful, and honest district
surveyor.Having traced the two Georges to the threshold of their career, let us
now proceed one step further, and take note of the first great public
event in the lives of either.For a long time preceding the year 1753 the French had laid claim to all
the North American continent west of the Alleghany Mountains, stretching
in an unbroken line from Canada to Louisiana.The English strenuously
denied this right, and when the French commandant on the Ohio, in 1753,
commenced erecting a fort near where the present city of Pittsburg
stands, and proceeded to capture certain English traders, and expel them
from the country, Dinwiddie, Governor of Virginia, deemed it necessary
to dispatch an agent on a diplomatic visit to the French commandant, and
demand by what authority he acted, by what title he claimed the country,
and order him immediately to evacuate the territory.George Washington, then only in his twenty-second year, was selected by
the Governor for this important mission.It is unnecessary to follow him, in all his perils, during his wintery
march through the wilderness.The historian of his life has painted in
imperishable colors his courage, his sagacity, his wonderful coolness in
the midst of danger, and the success which crowned his undertaking.The
memory loves to follow him through the trackless wilds of the forest,
accompanied by only a single companion, and making his way through
wintery snows, in the midst of hostile savages and wild beasts for more
than five hundred miles, to the residence of the French commander.How
often do we not shudder, as we behold the treacherous Indian guide, on
his return, deliberately raising his rifle, and leveling it at that
majestic form; thus endeavoring, by an act of treachery and cowardice,
to deprive Virginia of her young hero!with what fervent prayers
do we not implore a kind Providence to watch over his desperate
encounter with the floating ice, at midnight, in the swollen torrent of
the Alleghany, and rescue him from the wave and the storm.Standing
bareheaded on the frail raft, whilst in the act of dashing aside some
floating ice that threatened to ingulf him, the treacherous oar was
broken in his hand, and he is precipitated many feet into the boiling
current.for the destinies of millions yet
unborn hang upon that noble arm!In the early part of the year 1764 a
ministerial crisis occurs in England, and Lord Bute, the favorite of the
British monarch, is driven from the administration of the government.The troubles with the American colonists have also just commenced to
excite attention, and the young King grows angry, perplexed, and greatly
irritated.A few days after this, a rumor starts into circulation that
the monarch is sick.His attendants look gloomy, his friends terrified,
and even his physicians exhibit symptoms of doubt and danger.Yet he has
no fever, and is daily observed walking with uncertain and agitated step
along the corridors of the palace.His conduct becomes gradually more
and more strange, until doubt gives place to certainty, and the royal
medical staff report to a select committee of the House of Commons that
the King is threatened with _insanity_.For six weeks the cloud obscures
his mental faculties, depriving him of all interference with the
administration of the government, and betokening a sad disaster in the
future.His reason is finally restored, but frequent fits of passion,
pride and obstinacy indicate but too surely that the disease is seated,
and a radical cure impossible.Possessed now of the chief characteristics of George Washington and
George Guelph, we are prepared to review briefly their conduct during
the struggle that ensued between the two countries they respectively
represented.Let us now refer to the first act of disloyalty of Washington, the first
indignant spurn his high-toned spirit evinced under the oppressions of a
king.Not long after his return from the west, Washington was offered the
chief command of the forces about to be raised in Virginia, to expel the
French; but, with his usual modesty, he declined the appointment, on
account of his extreme youth, but consented to take the post of
lieutenant-colonel.Shortly afterward, on the death of Colonel Fry, he
was promoted to the chief command, but through no solicitations of his
own.Subsequently, when the war between France and England broke out in
Europe, the principal seat of hostilities was transferred to America,
and his Gracious Majesty George III sent over a large body of troops,
_under the command of favorite officers_.An
edict soon followed, denominated an "Order to settle the rank of the
officers of His Majesty's forces serving in America."By one of the
articles of this order, it was provided "that all officers commissioned
by the King, should take precedence of those of the same grade
commissioned by the governors of the respective colonies, although their
commissions might be of junior date;" and it was further provided, that
"when the troops served together, the provincial officers should enjoy
no rank at all."This order was scarcely promulgated--indeed, before the
ink was dry--ere the Governor of Virginia received a communication
informing him that _George Washington was no longer a soldier_.Entreaties, exhortations, and threats were all lavished upon him in
vain; and to those who, in their expostulations, spoke of the
defenseless frontiers of his native State, he patriotically but nobly
replied: "I will serve my country when I can do so without dishonor."In contrast with this attitude of Washington, look at the conduct of
George the Third respecting the colonies, after the passage of the Stamp
Act.This act was no sooner proclaimed in America, than the most violent
opposition was manifested, and combinations for the purpose of effectual
resistance were rapidly organized from Massachusetts to Georgia.The
leading English patriots, among whom were Burke and Barre, protested
against the folly of forcing the colonies into rebellion, and the city
of London presented a petition to the King, praying him to dismiss the
Granville ministry, and repeal the obnoxious act."It is with the utmost
astonishment," replied the King, "that I find any of my subjects capable
of encouraging the rebellious disposition that unhappily exists in some
of my North American colonies.Having entire confidence in the wisdom of
my parliament, the great council of the realm, I will steadily pursue
those measures which they have recommended for the support of the
constitutional rights of Great Britain."He heeded not the memorable
words of Burke, that afterward became prophetic."There are moments,"
exclaimed this great statesman, "critical moments in the fortunes of all
states when they who are too weak to contribute to your prosperity may
yet be strong enough to complete your ruin."The Boston port bill
passed, and the first blood was spilt at Lexington.It is enough to say of the long and bloody war that followed, that
George the Third, by his obstinacy, contributed more than any other man
in his dominion to prolong the struggle, and affix to it the stigma of
cruelty, inhumanity and vengeance; whilst Washington was equally the
soul of the conflict on the other side, and by his imperturbable
justice, moderation and firmness, did more than by his arms to convince
England that her revolted colonists were invincible.It is unnecessary to review in detail the old Revolution.Let us pass to
the social position of the two Georges in after-life.On the 2d August, 1786, as the King was alighting from his carriage at
the gate of St.James, an attempt was made on his life by a woman named
Margaret Nicholson, who, under pretense of presenting a petition,
endeavored to stab him with a knife which was concealed in the paper.The weapon was an old one, and so rusty that, on striking the vest of
the King, it bent double, and thus preserved his life.On the 29th
October, 1795, whilst his majesty was proceeding to the House of Lords,
a ball passed through both windows of the carriage.James the mob threw stones into the carriage, several of which struck
the King, and one lodged in the cuff of his coat.The state carriage was
completely demolished by the mob.But it was on the 15th May, 1800, that
George the Third made his narrowest escapes.In the morning of that
day, whilst attending the field exercise of a battalion of guards, one
of the soldiers loaded his piece with a bullet and discharged it at the
King.The ball fortunately missed its aim, and lodged in the thigh of a
gentleman who was standing in the rear.In the evening of the same day a
more alarming circumstance occurred at the Drury Lane Theatre.At the
moment when the King entered the royal box, a man in the pit, on the
right-hand side of the orchestra, suddenly stood up and discharged a
large horse-pistol at him.The hand of the would-be assassin was thrown
up by a bystander, and the ball entered the box just above the head of
the King.Such were the public manifestations of affection for this royal tyrant.He was finally attacked by an enemy that could not be thwarted, and on
the 20th December, 1810, he became a confirmed lunatic.In this dreadful
condition he lingered until January, 1820, when he died, having been the
most unpopular, unwise and obstinate sovereign that ever disgraced the
English throne.He was forgotten as soon as life left his body, and was
hurriedly buried with that empty pomp which but too often attends a
despot to the grave.His whole career is well summed up by Allan Cunningham, his biographer,
in few words: "Throughout his life he manifested a strong disposition to
be his own minister, and occasionally placed the kingly prerogatives in
perilous opposition to the resolutions of the nation's representatives.His interference with the deliberations of the upper house, as in the
case of Fox's Indian bill, was equally ill-judged and dangerous._The
separation of America from the mother country, at the time it took
place, was the result of the King's personal feelings and interference
with the ministry._ The war with France was, in part at least,
attributable to the views and wishes of the sovereign of England.His
obstinate refusal to grant any concessions to his Catholic subjects,
kept his cabinet perpetually hanging on the brink of dissolution, and
threatened the dismemberment of the kingdom.He has been often praised
for firmness, but it was in too many instances the firmness of
obstinacy; a dogged adherence to an opinion once pronounced, or a
resolution once formed."The mind, in passing from the unhonored grave of the prince to the last
resting-place of the peasant boy, leaps from a kingdom of darkness to
one of light.Let us now return to the career of Washington.Throughout the
Revolutionary War he carried, like Atropos, in his hand the destinies of
millions; he bore, like Atlas, on his shoulders the weight of a world.It is unnecessary to follow him throughout his subsequent career.Honored again and again by the people of the land he had redeemed from
thraldom, he has taken his place in death by the side of the wisest and
best of the world's benefactors.Assassins did not unglory him in life,
nor has oblivion drawn her mantle over him in death.The names of his
great battle-fields have become nursery words, and his principles have
imbedded themselves forever in the national character.Every pulsation
of our hearts beats true to his memory.His mementoes are everywhere
around and about us.Distant as we are from the green fields of his
native Westmoreland, the circle of his renown has spread far beyond our
borders.In climes where the torch of science was never kindled; on
shores still buried in primeval bloom; amongst barbarians where the face
of liberty was never seen, the Christian missionary of America, roused
perhaps from his holy duties by the distant echo of the national salute,
this day thundering amidst the billows of every sea, or dazzled by the
gleam of his country's banner, this day floating in every wind of
heaven, pauses over his task as a Christian, and whilst memory kindles
in his bosom the fires of patriotism, pronounced in the ear of the
enslaved pagan the venerated name of WASHINGTON!Nor are the sons of the companions of Washington alone in doing justice
to his memory.Our sisters, wives and mothers compete with us in
discharging this debt of national gratitude.With a delicacy that none
but woman could exhibit, and with a devotion that none but a daughter
could feel, they are now busy in executing the noble scheme of
purchasing his tomb, in order for endless generations to stand sentinel
over his remains.ye daughters
of America; enfold them closer to your bosom than your first-born
offspring; build around them a mausoleum that neither time nor change
can overthrow; for within them germinates the seeds of liberty for the
benefit of millions yet unborn.Wherever tyranny shall lift its Medusan
head, wherever treason shall plot its hellish schemes, wherever disunion
shall unfurl its tattered ensign, there, oh there, sow them in the
hearts of patriots and republicans!For from these pale ashes there
shall spring, as from the dragon's teeth sown by Cadmus of old on the
plains of Heber, vast armies of invincible heroes, sworn upon the altar
and tomb at Mount Vernon, to live as freemen, or as such to die!_MASONRY._


    Oh, sacred spirit of Masonic love,
    Offspring of Heaven, the angels' bond above,
    Guardian of peace and every social tie,
    How deep the sources of thy fountains lie!How wide the realms that 'neath thy wings expand,
    Embracing every clime, encircling every land!Beneath the aurora of the Polar skies,
    Where Greenland's everlasting glaciers rise,
    The Lodge mysterious lifts its snow-built dome,
    And points the brother to a sunnier home;
    Where Nilus slays the sacrificial kid,
    Beneath the shadow of her pyramid,
    Where magian suns unclasp the gaping ground,
    And far Australia's golden sands abound;
    Where breakers thunder on the coral strand,
    To guard the gates of Kamehameha's land;
    Wherever man, in lambskin garb arrayed,
    Strikes in defense of innocence betrayed;
    Lifts the broad shield of charity to all,
    And bends in anguish o'er a brother's fall;
    Where the bright symbol of Masonic truth,
    Alike for high and low, for age or youth,
    Flames like yon sun at tropic midday's call,
    And opes the universal eye on all!What though in secret all your alms be done,
    Your foes all vanquished and your trophies won?What though a veil be o'er your Lodges thrown,
    And brother only be to brother known?In secret, God built up the rolling world;
    In secret, morning's banners are unfurled;
    In secret, spreads the leaf, unfolds the flower,
    Revolve the spheres, and speeds the passing hour.The day is noise, confusion, strife, turmoil,
    Struggles for bread, and sweat beneath the toil.The night is silence--progress without jars,
    The rest of mortals and the march of stars!The day for work to toiling man was given;
    But night, to lead his erring steps to Heaven.Who feed the hungry, heed the orphan's cry;
    Who clothe the naked, dry the widow's tear,
    Befriend the exile, bear the stranger's bier;
    Stand round the bedside when the fluttering soul
    Bursts her clay bonds and parteth for her goal;
    God speed you in the noble path you tread,
    Friends of the living, mourners o'er the dead.May all your actions, measured on the square,
    Be just and righteous, merciful and fair;
    Your thoughts flow pure, in modesty of mind,
    Along the equal level of mankind;
    Your words be troweled to truth's perfect tone,
    Your fame be chiseled in unblemished stone,
    Your hearts be modeled on the plummet's line,
    Your faith be guided by the Book divine;
    And when at last the gavel's beat above
    Calls you from labor to the feast of love,
    May mighty Boaz, pillar'd at that gate
    Which seraphs tyle and where archangels wait,
    Unloose the bandage from your dazzled eyes,
    Spell out the _Password_ to Arch-Royal skies;
    Upon your bosom set the signet steel,
    Help's sign disclose, and Friendship's grip reveal;
    Place in your grasp the soul's unerring rod,
    And light you to the Temple of your God!_POLLOCK'S EUTHANASIA._


    He is gone!By his own strong pinions lifted

    Where he strikes, with minstrels olden,

                      Deathless bars.There, with Homer's ghost all hoary,
    Not with years, but fadeless glory,
                      Lo!he stands;

    And through that open portal,

    Statesman, sage, and Christian stoic,
                      Greets his son;

    Whilst in paeans wild and glorious,
    Like his "Paradise victorious,"

    But with glory's beams resplendent
                      As a star;

    Slow descends from regions higher,
    With a crown and golden lyre
                      In his car.All around him, crowd as minions,
    Thrones and sceptres, and dominions,
                      Kings and Queens;

    Ages past and ages present,
    Lord and dame, and prince and peasant,
                      His demesnes!young bard hesperian,
    Welcome to the heights empyrean,
                      Thou did'st sing,

    Ere yet thy trembling fingers
    Struck where fame immortal lingers,
                      In the string.I am the bard of Avon,
    And the Realm of song in Heaven
                      Is my own;

    Long thy verse shall live in story,
    And thy Lyre I crown with glory,
                      And a throne!_SCIENCE, LITERATURE AND ART DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH
CENTURY._


Looking back into the past, and exploring by the light of authentic
history, sacred as well as profane, the characteristics of former ages,
the merest tyro in learning cannot fail to perceive that certain epochs
stand prominently out on the "sands of time," and indicate vast activity
and uncommon power in the human mind.These epochs are so well marked that history has given them a
designation, and to call them by their name, conjures up, as by the wand
of an enchanter, the heroic representatives of our race.If, for instance, we should speak of the era of Solomon, in sacred
history, the memory would instantly picture forth the pinnacles of the
Holy Temple, lifting themselves into the clouds; the ear would listen
intently to catch the sweet intonations of the harp of David, vocal at
once with the prophetic sorrows of his race, and swelling into sublime
ecstasy at the final redemption of his people; the eye would glisten at
the pomp and pageantry of the foreign potentates who thronged his court,
and gloat with rapture over the beauty of the young Queen of Sheba, who
journeyed from a distant land to seek wisdom at the feet of the wisest
monarch that ever sat upon a throne.We should behold his ships
traversing every sea, and pouring into the lap of Israel the gold of
Ophir, the ivory of Senegambia, and the silks, myrrh, and spices of the
East.So, too, has profane history its golden ages, when men all seemed to be
giants, and their minds inspired.What is meant when we speak of the age of Pericles?We mean all that is
glorious in the annals of Greece.We mean Apelles with his pencil,
Phidias with his chisel, Alcibiades with his sword.We seem to be
strolling arm-in-arm with Plato, into the academy, to listen to the
divine teachings of Socrates, or hurrying along with the crowd toward
the theatre, where Herodotus is reading his history, or Euripides is
presenting his tragedies.Aspasia rises up like a beautiful apparition
before us, and we follow willing slaves at the wheels of her victorious
chariot.The whole of the Peloponnesus glows with intellect like a forge
in blast, and scatters the trophies of Grecian civilization profusely
around us.The Parthenon lifts its everlasting columns, and the Venus
and Apollo are moulded into marble immortality.Rome had her Augustan age, an era of poets, philosophers, soldiers,
statesmen, and orators.Crowded into contemporary life, we recognize the
greatest general of the heathen world, the greatest poet, the greatest
orator, and the greatest statesman of Rome.Caesar and Cicero, Virgil and
Octavius, all trod the pavement of the capitol together, and lent their
blended glory to immortalize the Augustan age.Italy and Spain and France and England have had their golden age.The
eras of Lorenzo the Magnificent, of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Louis
Quatorze and of Elizabeth, can never be forgotten.They loom up from the
surrounding gloom like the full moon bursting upon the sleeping seas;
irradiating the night, clothing the meanest wave in sparkling silver,
and dimming the lustre of the brightest stars.History has also left in
its track mementoes of a different character.In sacred history we have
the age of Herod; in profane, the age of Nero.We recognize at a glance
the talismanic touch of the age of chivalry, and the era of the
Crusades, and mope our way in darkness and gloom along that opaque
track, stretching from the reign of Justinian, in the sixth century, to
the reign of Edward the Third, in the fourteenth, and known throughout
Christendom as the "Dark Ages."Let us now take a survey of the field we
occupy, and ascertain, if possible, the category in which our age shall
be ranked by our posterity.But before proceeding to discuss the characteristics of our epoch, let
us define more especially what that epoch embraces.It does not embrace the American nor the French Revolution, nor does it
include the acts or heroes of either.The impetus given to the human
mind by the last half of the eighteenth century, must be carefully
distinguished from the impulses of the first half of the nineteenth.The
first was an era of almost universal war, the last of almost
uninterrupted peace.The dying ground-swell of the waves after a storm
belong to the tempest, not to the calm which succeeds.Hence the wars of
Napoleon, the literature and art of his epoch, must be excluded from
observation, in properly discussing the true characteristics of our era.De Stael and Goethe and Schiller and Byron; Pitt and Nesselrode,
Metternich and Hamilton; Fichte and Stewart and Brown and Cousin;
Canova, Thorwaldsen and La Place, though all dying since the beginning
of this century, belong essentially to a former era.They were the
ripened fruits of that grand uprising of the human mind which first
took form on the 4th day of July, 1776.Our era properly commences with
the downfall of the first Napoleon, and none of the events connected
therewith, either before or afterward, can be philosophically classed in
the epoch we represent, but must be referred to a former period.Ages
hence, then, the philosophic critic will thus describe the first half of
the nineteenth century:

  "The normal state of Christendom was peace.The age of steel that
  immediately went before it had passed."Speculative philosophy fell asleep; literature declined;
  Skepticism bore sway in religion, politics, and morals; Utility
  became the universal standard of right and wrong, and the truths
  of every science and the axioms of every art were ruthlessly
  subjected to the _experimentum crucis_.The verdicts pronounced in the olden time against
  Mohammed and Mesmer and Robespierre were set aside, and a new
  trial granted.The ghosts of Roger Bacon and Emanuel Swedenborg
  were summoned from the Stygian shore to plead their causes anew
  before the bar of public opinion.The head of Oliver Cromwell was
  ordered down from the gibbet, the hump was smoothed down on the
  back of Richard III, and the sentence pronounced by Urban VIII
  against the'starry Galileo' reversed forever.Aristotle was
  decently interred beneath a modern monument inscribed thus: '_In
  pace requiescat_;' whilst Francis Bacon was rescued from the
  sacrilegious hands of kings and peers and parliament, and
  canonized by the unanimous consent of Christendom.Germany led the van, and
  Humboldt became the impersonation of his times."Such unquestionably will be the verdict of the future, when the present
time, with all its treasures and trash, its hopes and realizations,
shall have been safely shelved and labeled amongst the musty records of
bygone generations.Let us now examine into the grounds of this verdict more minutely, and
test its accuracy by exemplifications.I. And first, who believes now in _innate ideas_?Locke has been
completely superseded by the materialists of Germany and France, and all
speculative moral philosophy exploded.The audiences of Edinburgh and
Brown University interrupt Sir William Hamilton and Dr.Wayland in their
discourses, and, stripping off the plumage from their theses,
inquisitively demand, "_Cui bono_?"How can
we apply it to the every-day concerns of life?We ask you for bread and
you have given us a stone; and though that stone be a diamond, it is
valueless, except for its glitter.No philosopher can speculate
successfully or even satisfactorily to himself, when he is met at every
turn by some vulgar intruder into the domains of Aristotle and Kant, who
clips his wings just as he was prepared to soar into the heavens, by an
offer of copartnership to "speculate," it may be, in the price of pork.Hence, no moral philosopher of our day has been enabled to erect any
theory which will stand the assaults of logic for a moment.Each school
rises for an instant to the surface, and sports out its little day in
toss and tribulation, until the next wave rolls along, with foam on its
crest and fury in its roar, and overwhelms it forever.As with its
predecessor, so with itself."The eternal surge
    Of Time and Tide rolls on and bears afar
    Their bubbles: as the old burst, new emerge,
    Lashed from the foam of ages."But I have stated that this is an age of _literary decline_.It is
true that more books are written and published, more newspapers and
periodicals printed and circulated, more extensive libraries collected
and incorporated, and more ink indiscriminately spilt, than at any
former period of the world's history.In looking about us we are
forcibly reminded of the sarcastic couplet of Pope, who complains--

    "That those who cannot write, and those who can,
     All scratch, all scrawl, and scribble to a man."Had a modern gentleman all the eyes of Argus, all the hands of Briareus,
all the wealth of Croesus, and lived to the age of Methuselah, his
eyes would all fail, his fingers all tire, his money all give out, and
his years come to an end, long before he perused one tenth of the annual
product of the press of Christendom at the present day.It is no figure
of rhetoric to say that the press groans beneath the burden of its
labors.Could the types of Leipsic and London, Paris and New York, speak
out, the Litany would have to be amended, and a new article added, to
which they would solemnly respond: "Spare us, good Lord!"A recent publication furnishes the following statistical facts relating
to the book trade in our own country: "Books have multiplied to such an
extent in the United States that it now takes 750 paper-mills, with 2000
engines in constant operation, to supply the printers, who work day and
night, endeavoring to keep their engagements with publishers.These
tireless mills produce 270,000,000 pounds of paper every year.It
requires a pound and a quarter of old rags for one pound of paper, thus
340,000,000 pounds of rags were consumed in this way last year.There
are about 300 publishers in the United States, and near 10,000
book-sellers who are engaged in the task of dispensing literary pabulum
to the public."It may appear somewhat paradoxical to assert that literature is
declining whilst books and authors are multiplying to such a fearful
extent.Byron wrote:

    "'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
     A book's a book, although there's nothing in 't."True enough; but books are not always literature.A man may become an
author without ceasing to be an ignoramus.His name may adorn a
title-page without being recorded _in aere perenne_.He may attempt to
write himself up a very "lion" in literature, whilst good master Slender
may be busily engaged "in writing him down an ass."Not one book in a thousand is a success; not one success in ten thousand
wreathes the fortunate author with the laurel crown, and lifts him up
into the region of the immortals.Tell me, ye who prate about the
_literary glory_ of the nineteenth century, wherein it consists?Whose
are

    "The great, the immortal names
     That were not born to die?"I cast my eyes up the long vista toward the Temple of Fame, and I behold
hundreds of thousands pressing on to reach the shining portals.They
jostle each other by the way, they trip, they fall, they are overthrown
and ruthlessly trampled into oblivion, by the giddy throng, as they rush
onward and upward.One, it may be two, of the million who started out,
stand trembling at the threshold, and with exultant voices cry aloud for
admittance.One perishes before the summons can be answered; and the
other, awed into immortality by the august presence into which he
enters, is transformed into imperishable stone.Let us carefully scan the rolls of the literature of our era, and
select, if we can, poet, orator, or philosopher, whose fame will deepen
as it runs, and brighten as it burns, until future generations shall
drink at the fountain and be refreshed, and kindle their souls at the
vestal flame and be purified, illuminated and ennobled.In poetry, aye, in the crowded realms of song, who bears the
sceptre?--who wears the crown?America, England, France and Germany can
boast of bards _by the gross_, and rhyme _by the acre_, but not a single
poet.The _poeta nascitur_ is not here.He may be on his way--and I have
heard that he was--but this generation must pass before he arrives.Is it Poe, croaking sorrowfully with
his "Raven," or Willis, cooing sweetly with his "Dove"?Is it Bryant,
with his "Thanatopsis," or Prentice, with his "Dirge to the Dead Year"?Perhaps it is Holmes, with his "Lyrics," or Longfellow, with his
"Idyls."is it not self-evident that we have no poet, when it is
utterly impossible to discover any two critics in the land who can find
him?True, we have lightning-bugs enough, but no star; foot-hills, it may be,
in abundance, but no Mount Shasta, with its base built upon the
everlasting granite, and its brow bathed in the eternal sunlight.In England, Tennyson, the Laureate, is the spokesman of a clique, the
pet poet of a princely circle, whose rhymes flow with the docility and
harmony of a limpid brook, but never stun like Niagara, nor rise into
sublimity like the storm-swept sea.Beranger, the greatest poet of France of our era, was a mere
song-writer; and Heine, the pride of young Germany, a mere satirist and
lyrist.Freiligrath can never rank with Goethe or Schiller; and Victor
Hugo never attain the heights trodden by Racine, Corneille, or Boileau.In oratory, where shall we find the compeer of Chatham or Mirabeau,
Burke or Patrick Henry?I have not forgotten Peel and Gladstone, nor
Lamartine and Count Cavour, nor Sargent S. Prentiss and Daniel Webster.But Webster himself, by far the greatest intellect of all these, was a
mere debater, and the spokesman of a party.He was an eloquent speaker,
but can never rank as an orator with the rhetoricians of the last
century.And in philosophy and general learning, where shall we find the equal of
that burly old bully, Dr.and yet Johnson, with all his
learning, was a third-rate philosopher.In truth, the greatest author of our era was a mere essayist.Beyond all
controversy, Thomas Babington Macaulay was the most polished writer of
our times.With an intellect acute, logical and analytic; with an
imagination glowing and rich, but subdued and under perfect control;
with a style so clear and limpid and concise, that it has become a
standard for all who aim to follow in the path he trod, and with a
learning so full and exact, and exhaustive, that he was nicknamed, when
an undergraduate, the "Omniscient Macaulay;" he still lacks the giant
grasp of thought, the bold originality, and the intense, earnest
enthusiasm which characterize the master-spirits of the race, and
identify them with the eras they adorn.As in literature, so in what have been denominated by scholars the
_Fine Arts_.The past fifty years has not produced a painter, sculptor,
or composer, who ranks above mediocrity in their respective vocations.Canova and Thorwaldsen were the last of their race; Sir Joshua
Reynolds left no successor, and the immortal Beethoven has been
superseded by <DW64> minstrelsy and senseless pantomime.The greatest
architect of the age is a railroad contractor, and the first dramatist a
cobbler of French farces.But whilst the highest faculty of the mind--the imagination--has
been left uncultivated, and has produced no worthy fruit, the next
highest, the casual, or the one that deals with causes and effects, has
been stimulated into the most astonishing fertility.Our age ignores fancy, and deals exclusively with fact.Within its
chosen range it stands far, very far pre-eminent over all that have
preceded it.It reaps the fruit of Bacon's labors.It stands thoughtfully on the field of Waterloo, and
estimates scientifically the manuring properties of bones and blood.It
disentombs the mummy of Thotmes II, sells the linen bandages for the
manufacture of paper, burns the asphaltum-soaked body for firewood, and
plants the pint of red wheat found in his sarcophagus, to try an
agricultural experiment.It deals in no sentimentalities; it has no
appreciation of the sublime.It stands upon the ocean shore, but with
its eyes fixed on the yellow sand searching for gold.It confronts
Niagara, and, gazing with rapture at its misty shroud, exclaims, in an
ecstasy of admiration, "Lord, what a place to sponge a coat!"Having no
soul to save, it has no religion to save it.It has discovered that
Mohammed was a great benefactor of his race, and that Jesus Christ was,
after all, a mere man; distinguished, it is true, for his benevolence,
his fortitude and his morality, but for nothing else.It does not
believe in the Pope, nor in the Church, nor in the Bible.It ridicules
the infallibility of the first, the despotism of the second, and the
chronology of the third.It is possessed of the very spirit of Thomas;
it must "touch and handle" before it will believe.It questions the
existence of spirit, because it cannot be analyzed by chemical solvents;
it questions the existence of hell, because it has never been scorched;
it questions the existence of God, because it has never beheld Him.It does, however, believe in the explosive force of gunpowder, in the
evaporation of boiling water, in the head of the magnet, and in the
heels of the lightnings.It conjugates the Latin verb _invenio_ (to find
out) through all its voices, moods and tenses.It invents everything;
from a lucifer match in the morning to kindle a kitchen fire, up through
all the intermediate ranks and tiers and grades of life, to a telescope
that spans the heavens in the evening, it recognizes no chasm or hiatus
in its inventions.It sinks an artesian well in the desert of Sahara for
a pitcher of water, and bores through the Alleghanies for a hogshead of
oil.From a fish-hook to the Great Eastern, from a pocket deringer to a
columbiad, from a sewing machine to a Victoria suspension bridge, it
oscillates like a pendulum.Deficient in literature and art, our age surpasses all others in
science.Knowledge has become the great end and aim of human life."I
want to know," is inscribed as legibly on the hammer of the geologist,
the crucible of the chemist, and the equatorial of the astronomer, as it
is upon the phiz of a regular "Down-Easter."Our age has inherited the

XXIV._THE ENROBING OF LIBERTY._


    The war-drum was silent, the cannon was mute,
      The sword in its scabbard lay still,
    And battle had gathered the last autumn fruit
      That crimson-dyed river and rill,
    When a Goddess came down from her mansion on high,
      To gladden the world with her smile,
    Leaving only her robes in the realm of the sky,
      That their sheen might no mortal beguile.As she lit on the earth she was welcomed by Peace,
      Twin sisters in Eden of yore--
    But parted forever when fetter-bound Greece
      Drove her exiled and chained from her shore;
    Never since had the angel of Liberty trod
      In virginal beauty below;
    But, chased from the earth, she had mounted to God,
      Despoiled of her raiment of snow.Our sires gathered round her, entranced by her smile,
      Remembering the footprints of old
    She had graven on grottoes, in Scio's sweet Isle,
      Ere the doom of fair Athens was told."I am naked," she cried; "I am homeless on earth;
      Kings, Princes, and Lords are my foes,
    But I stand undismayed, though an orphan by birth,
      And condemned to the region of snows."hail"--our fathers exclaim--
      "To the glorious land of the West!With a diadem bright we will honor thy name,
      And enthrone thee America's guest;
    We will found a great nation and call it thine own,
      And erect here an altar to thee,
    Where millions shall kneel at the foot of thy throne
      And swear to forever be free!"Then each brought a vestment her form to enrobe,
      And screen her fair face from the sun,
    And thus she stood forth as the Queen of the globe
      When the work of our Fathers was done.A circlet of stars round her temples they wove,
      That gleamed like Orion's bright band,
    And an emblem of power, the eagle of Jove,
      They perched like a bolt in her hand;
    On her forehead, a scroll that contained but a line
      Was written in letters of light,
    That our great "Constitution" forever might shine,
      A sun to illumine the night.Her feet were incased in broad sandals of gold,
      That riches might spring in her train;
    While a warrior's casque, with its visor uproll'd,
      Protected her tresses and brain;
    Round her waist a bright girdle of satin was bound,
      Formed of colors so blended and true,
    That when as a banner the scarf was unwound,
      It floated the "Red, White and Blue."Then Liberty calm, leant on Washington's arm,
      And spoke in prophetical strain:
    "Columbia's proud hills I will shelter from ills,
      Whilst her valleys and mountains remain;
    But palsied the hand that would pillage the band
      Of sisterhood stars in my crown,
    And death to the knave whose sword would enslave,
      By striking your great charter down."Your eagle shall soar this western world o'er,
      And carry the sound of my name,
    Till monarchs shall quake and its confines forsake,
      If true to your ancestral fame!Your banner shall gleam like the polar star's beam,
      To guide through rebellion's Red sea,
    And in battle 'twill wave, both to conquer and save,
      If borne by the hands of the free!"[Decoration]

XXV._A CAKE OF SOAP._


    I stood at my washstand, one bright sunny morn,
    And gazed through the blinds at the upbringing corn,
    And mourn'd that my summers were passing away,
    Like the dew on the meadow that morning in May.I seized, for an instant, the Iris-hued soap,
    That glowed in the dish, like an emblem of hope,
    And said to myself, as I melted its snows,
    "The longer I use it, the lesser it grows."For life, in its morn, is full freighted and gay,
    And fair as the rainbow when clouds float away;
    Sweet-scented and useful, it sheds its perfume,
    Till wasted or blasted, it melts in the tomb.Thus day after day, whilst we lather and scrub,
    Time wasteth and blasteth with many a rub,
    Till thinner and thinner, the soap wears away,
    And age hands us over to dust and decay.as I dream of thee now,
    With the spice in thy breath, and the bloom on thy brow,
    To a cake of pure Lubin thy life I compare,
    So fragrant, so fragile, and so debonair!But fortune was fickle, and labor was vain,
    And want overtook us, with grief in its train,
    Till, worn out by troubles, death came in the blast;
    But _thy_ kisses, like Lubin's, were sweet to the last!_THE SUMMERFIELD CASE._


The following additional particulars, as sequel to the Summerfield
homicide, have been furnished by an Auburn correspondent:

  MR.EDITOR: The remarkable confession of the late Leonidas Parker,
  which appeared in your issue of the 13th ultimo, has given rise to
  a series of disturbances in this neighborhood, which, for romantic
  interest and downright depravity, have seldom been surpassed, even
  in California.Before proceeding to relate in detail the late
  transactions, allow me to remark that the wonderful narrative of
  Parker excited throughout this county sentiments of the most
  profound and contradictory character.I, for one, halted between
  two opinions--horror and incredulity; and nothing but subsequent
  events could have fully satisfied me of the unquestionable
  veracity of your San Francisco correspondent, and the scientific
  authenticity of the facts related.The doubt with which the story was at first received in this
  community--and which found utterance in a burlesque article in an
  obscure country journal, the Stars and Stripes, of Auburn--has
  finally been dispelled and we find ourselves forced to admit that
  we stand even now in the presence of the most alarming fate.Too
  much credit cannot be awarded to our worthy coroner for the
  promptitude of his action, and we trust that the Governor of the
  State will not be less efficient in the discharge of his duty.[Since the above letter was written the following proclamation has
  been issued.--P.PROCLAMATION OF THE GOVERNOR.=$10,000 REWARD!=

                                           DEPARTMENT OF STATE.By virtue of the authority in me vested, I do hereby offer the
    above reward of ten thousand dollars, in gold coin of the
    United States, for the Arrest of Bartholomew Graham,
    familiarly known as Black Bart.Said Graham is accused of the
    murder of C. P. Gillson, late of Auburn, county of Placer, on
    the 14th ultimo.He is five feet ten inches and a half in
    height, thick set, has a mustache sprinkled with gray,
    grizzled hair, clear blue eyes, walks stooping, and served in
    the late civil war under Price and Quantrell, in the
    Confederate army.He may be lurking in some of the
    mining-camps near the foot-hills, as he was a Washoe teamster
    during the Comstock excitement.The above reward will be paid
    for him, _dead or alive_, as he possessed himself of an
    important secret by robbing the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield.By the Governor:                  H. G. NICHOLSON,
                                            Secretary of State.Given at Sacramento, this the fifth day of June, 1871.Our correspondent continues:

  I am sorry to say that Sheriff Higgins has not been so active in
  the discharge of his duty as the urgency of the case required, but
  he is perhaps excusable on account of the criminal interference of
  the editor above alluded to.But I am detaining you from more
  important matters.Your Saturday's paper reached here at 4
  o'clock, Saturday, 13th May, and, as it now appears from the
  evidence taken before the coroner, several persons left Auburn on
  the same errand, but without any previous conference.Two of these
  were named respectively Charles P. Gillson and Bartholomew Graham,
  or, as he was usually called, "Black Bart."Gillson kept a saloon
  at the corner of Prickly Ash Street and the Old Spring Road; and
  Black Bart was in the employ of Conrad & Co., keepers of the
  Norfolk livery stable.Gillson was a son-in-law of ex-Governor
  Roberts, of Iowa, and leaves a wife and two children to mourn his
  untimely end.As for Graham, nothing certain is known of his
  antecedents.It is said that he was engaged in the late robbery of
  Wells & Fargo's express at Grizzly Bend, and that he was an
  habitual gambler.Only one thing about him is certainly well
  known: he was a lieutenant in the Confederate army, and served
  under General Price and the outlaw Quantrell.He was a man
  originally of fine education, plausible manners and good family;
  but strong drink seems early in life to have overmastered him, and
  left him but a wreck of himself.But he was not incapable of
  generous, or rather, romantic, acts; for, during the burning of
  the Putnam House, in this town, last summer, he rescued two ladies
  from the flames.In so doing he scorched his left hand so
  seriously as to contract the tendons of two fingers, and this very
  scar may lead to his apprehension.There is no doubt about his
  utter desperation of character, and, if taken at all, it will
  probably be not alive.So much for the persons concerned in the tragedy at the Flat.Herewith I inclose copies of the testimony of the witnesses
  examined before the coroner's jury, together with the statement of
  Gillson, taken _in articulo mortis_:


                     DEPOSITION OF DOLLIE ADAMS.STATE OF CALIFORNIA, } ss.Said witness, being duly sworn, deposed as follows, to wit: My
    name is Dollie Adams; my age forty-seven years; I am the wife
    of Frank G. Adams, of this township, and reside on the North
    Fork of the American River, below Cape Horn, on Thompson's
    Flat; about one o'clock P. M., May 14, 1871, I left the cabin
    to gather wood to cook dinner for my husband and the hands at
    work for him on the claim; the trees are mostly cut away from
    the bottom, and I had to climb some distance up the mountain
    side before I could get enough to kindle the fire; I had gone
    about five hundred yards from the cabin, and was searching for
    small sticks of fallen timber, when I thought I heard some one
    groan, as if in pain; I paused and listened; the groaning
    became more distinct, and I started at once for the place
    whence the sounds proceeded; about ten steps off I discovered
    the man whose remains lie there (pointing to the deceased),
    sitting up, with his back against a big rock; he looked so
    pale that I thought him already dead, but he continued to moan
    until I reached his side; hearing me approach, he opened his
    eyes, and begged me, "For God's sake, give me a drop of
    water!"I asked him, "What is the matter?"He replied, "I am
    shot in the back."Without waiting to question him further, I returned
    to the cabin, told Zenie--my daughter--what I had seen, and
    sent her off on a run for the men.Taking with me a gourd of
    water, some milk and bread--for I thought the poor gentleman
    might be hungry and weak, as well as wounded--I hurried back
    to his side, where I remained until "father"--as we all call
    my husband--came with the men.We removed him as gently as we
    could to the cabin; then sent for Dr.Liebner, and nursed him
    until he died, yesterday, just at sunset.Question by the Coroner: Did you hear his statement, taken
    down by the Assistant District Attorney?--A.Q. Did you see him sign it?--A.Q. Is this your signature thereto as witness?--A.(Signed)                         DOLLIE ADAMS.DEPOSITION OF MISS X. V. ADAMS.Being first duly sworn, witness testified as follows: My name
    is Xixenia Volumnia Adams; I am the daughter of Frank G. Adams
    and the last witness; I reside with them on the Flat, and my
    age is eighteen years; a little past 1 o'clock on Sunday last
    my mother came running into the house and informed me that a
    man was dying from a wound, on the side-hill, and that I must
    go for father and the boys immediately.I ran as fast as my
    legs would carry me to where they were "cleaning up," for they
    never cleaned up week-days on the Flat, and told the news; we
    all came back together and proceeded to the spot where the
    wounded man lay weltering in his blood; he was cautiously
    removed to the cabin, where he lingered until yesterday
    sundown, when he died.A. He did
    frequently; at first with great pain, but afterward more
    audibly and intelligibly.A. First, to send for Squire Jacobs, the
    Assistant District Attorney, as he had a statement to make;
    and some time afterward, to send for his wife; but we first of
    all sent for the doctor.A. Only myself; he had
    appeared a great deal easier, and his wife had lain down to
    take a short nap, and my mother had gone to the spring and
    left me alone to watch; suddenly he lifted himself
    spasmodically in bed, glared around wildly and muttered
    something inaudible; seeing me, he cried out, "Run!or he'll set
    the world afire!His tone of voice
    gradually strengthened until the end of his raving; when he
    cried "fire!"his eyeballs glared, his mouth quivered, his
    body convulsed, and before Mrs.Gillson could reach his
    bedside he fell back stone dead.(Signed)                          X. V. ADAMS.The testimony of Adams corroborated in every particular that of
  his wife and daughter, but set forth more fully the particulars of
  his demoniac ravings.He would taste nothing from a glass or
  bottle, but shuddered whenever any article of that sort met his
  eyes.In fact, they had to remove from the room the cups,
  tumblers, and even the castors.At times he spoke rationally, but
  after the second day only in momentary flashes of sanity.The deposition of the attending physician, after giving the
  general facts with regard to the sickness of the patient and his
  subsequent demise, proceeded thus:


    I found the patient weak, and suffering from loss of blood and
    rest, and want of nourishment; occasionally sane, but for the
    most part flighty and in a comatose condition.The wound was
    an ordinary gunshot wound, produced most probably by the ball
    of a navy revolver, fired at the distance of ten paces.It
    entered the back near the left clavicle, beneath the scapula,
    close to the vertebrae between the intercostal spaces of the
    fifth and sixth ribs; grazing the pericardium it traversed the
    mediastinum, barely touching the oesophagus, and vena azygos,
    but completely severing the thoracic duct, and lodging in the
    xiphoid portion of the sternum.Necessarily fatal, there was
    no reason, however, why the patient could not linger for a
    week or more; but it is no less certain that from the effect
    of the wound he ultimately died.I witnessed the execution of
    the paper shown to me--as the statement of deceased--at his
    request; and at the time of signing the same he was in his
    perfect senses.It was taken down in my presence by Jacobs,
    the Assistant District Attorney of Placer County, and read
    over to the deceased before he affixed his signature.I was
    not present when he breathed his last, having been called away
    by my patients in the town of Auburn, but I reached his
    bedside shortly afterward.In my judgment, no amount of care
    or medical attention could have prolonged his life more than a
    few days.(Signed)                   KARL LIEBNER, M. D.


  The statement of the deceased was then introduced to the jury as
  follows:


    PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA }
                  _vs._               }
            BARTHOLOMEW GRAHAM.       }_Statement and Dying Confession of Charles P. Gillson, taken
    in articulo mortis by George Simpson, Notary Public._

    On the morning of Sunday, the 14th day of May, 1871, I left
    Auburn alone in search of the body of the late Gregory
    Summerfield, who was reported to have been pushed from the
    cars at Cape Horn, in this county, by one Leonidas Parker,
    since deceased.It was not fully light when I reached the
    track of the Central Pacific Railroad.Having mined at an
    early day on Thompson's Flat, at the foot of the rocky
    promontory now called Cape Horn, I was familiar with the
    zigzag paths leading down that steep precipice.One was
    generally used as a descent, the other as an ascent from the
    canyon below.I chose the latter, as being the freest from the
    chance of observation.It required the greatest caution to
    thread the narrow gorge; but I finally reached the rocky
    bench, about one thousand feet below the grade of the
    railroad.It was now broad daylight, and I commenced
    cautiously the search for Summerfield's body.There is quite a
    dense undergrowth of shrubs thereabouts, lining the
    interstices of the granite rocks so as to obscure the vision
    even at a short distance.Brushing aside a thick manzanita
    bush, I beheld the dead man at the same instant of time that
    another person arrived like an apparition upon the spot.It
    was Bartholomew Graham, known as "Black Bart."We suddenly
    confronted each other, the skeleton of Summerfield lying
    exactly between us.Graham
    advanced and I did the same; he stretched out his hand and we
    greeted one another across the prostrate corpse.Before releasing my hand, Black Bart exclaimed in a hoarse
    whisper, "Swear, Gillson, in the presence of the dead, that
    you will forever be faithful, never betray me, and do exactly
    as I bid you, as long as you live!"Fate sat there, cold and
    remorseless as stone.I hesitated; with his left hand he
    slightly raised the lappels of his coat, and grasped the
    handle of a navy revolver.As I gazed, his eyeballs assumed a greenish tint, and his
    brow darkened into a scowl."As your confederate," I answered,
    "never as your slave."The body was lying upon its back, with the face upwards.The
    vultures had despoiled the countenance of every vestige of
    flesh, and left the sockets of the eyes empty.Snow and ice
    and rain had done their work effectually upon the exposed
    surfaces of his clothing, and the eagles had feasted upon the
    entrails.But underneath, the thick beaver cloth had served to
    protect the flesh, and there were some decaying shreds left of
    what had once been the terrible but accomplished Gregory
    Summerfield.But they did
    not interest me so much as another spectacle, that almost
    froze my blood.In the skeleton gripe of the right hand,
    interlaced within the clenched bones, gleamed the wide-mouthed
    vial which was the object of our mutual visit.Graham fell
