The seeds of the common pumpkin, Cucurbita pepo, are extolled by many
physicians as a remedy for tape-worms; and the writer has twice had the
opportunity of observing large specimens of the beef tape-worm which
were expelled after the administration of this medicine.The dose is an
ounce of the seeds bruised into a paste and made into an emulsion.It
should be taken in the morning, fasting, and followed in an hour or two
with a full dose of castor oil.Santonin, a principle derived from santonica, Artemisia maritima, is
reported as a remedy for tape-worms, but its efficacy has also been
denied.The dose is from two to four grains for an adult, and from
one-quarter to one-half a grain for children over two years.It is best
administered in lozenges prepared with sugar and tragacanth.The quinia sulphate has also been recommended as an effectual remedy
both in tape- and seat-worms.As regards the prophylaxis of tape-worms, there are some important
points to which we direct attention.The evacuations of patients containing tape-worms, their segments and
eggs, should not be carelessly thrown away, at least in places
accessible to animals which may become infected.They should be treated
with boiling water, the heat of which is sufficient to kill all animal
parasites.The handling of living tape-worms and segments should be
avoided, as eggs {943} which may adhere to the hands, if transferred to
the mouth and swallowed, will produce infection.Meats visibly infested with measles are not fit and should not be used
as food.Raw meat should altogether be discarded as food, both for the
sick and well, and all meats should be thoroughly cooked.As a rule,
meat should not be used so long as it appears red or on cutting emits a
bloody liquid.A large piece of meat requires long boiling or roasting
for sufficient heat to penetrate to the interior to destroy any
parasites that may be present.Even salted meats and hams should be
cooked to ensure against parasitic infection.It is important also to
avoid food prepared by uncleanly persons who may be infested with
tape-worms.As regards our domestic animals, which are the common source of the
infection of man with tape-worms, they should also be protected from
infection as far as possible.This is to be done by preventing them
from having access to human excrement.As Heller remarks, with this
object the barbarous custom of defecating in every place promiscuously
should be put down with a high hand.[2]

[Footnote 2: Several years since a physician of Texas sent to the
writer a piece of pork, making inquiry as to its condition, and stating
that all the pigs of his vicinity were diseased and their flesh
similarly affected.It contained a number of measles or larval
tape-worms.On giving the information and the probable cause of the
affection of the pigs, the doctor reported in return that there was not
a privy in his village.Until our people are more careful with the
raising of pigs, European governments will have reason for prohibiting
the importation of our pork.]*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ECHINOCOCCUS.--SYNONYM: Hydatid tape-worm.Larval condition: Echinococcus; E. hominis; E. veterinorum; E.
granulosis; E. scolicipariens; E. altricipariens; E. hydatidosus; E.
multilocularis; E. cyst; Hydatid; Hydatid cyst; Acephalocyst.This tape-worm, in its mature state the most insignificant looking of
its kind, though not strictly an intestinal worm of man, in the
juvenile condition is one of his most dangerous parasites, as being the
source of hydatid tumors.The adult tape-worm lives in the small
intestine of the dog and wolf, in some localities often existing in
these animals in thousands together.From its diminutive size it may be
readily overlooked, concealed or obscured by the villi among which it
is suspended to the mucous membrane.It is about a fourth of an inch in
length, and consists of but four segments, of which the last alone
exhibits the ripe condition.The head resembles in construction that of
the pork tape-worm, being provided with four suckers and a prominent
crown, with from thirty to fifty hooks arranged in a double circle.The
terminal ripe segment exceeds in size all the preceding together, and
before it separates from the series another is ready to take its place.The ripe eggs contain the usual six-spined embryo as in other
tape-worms.The mature worm is remarkable for the comparative shortness of its
life, which, according to Siebold, is about seven weeks.Apparently to
compensate for the small number of its segments, the larval form is
endowed with the power of multiplying itself to a wonderful degree.It is only in the larval condition that the hydatid tape-worm infests
man, and in this state also it infests the ape, the ox and sheep and
other ruminants, also the horse, hog, and indeed many other animals of
the same class.{944} If the eggs of the tape-worm are swallowed, which may readily
happen by too free intimacy or association with infested dogs, the
liberated embryos obtain access to the intestine.Penetrating the
mucous membrane, the embryos thence may migrate to any part of the
body.From the comparative frequency of hydatid tumors in the liver we
may suspect they mostly enter the portal venous system and take the
course of the blood-current.It is, however, probable that they migrate
directly to their destination, for hydatid tumors are also frequently
seated in the neighboring organs and the abdominal walls.The embryo
tape-worm, once fixed in position, becomes the starting-point of a
hydatid tumor.When dogs are fed on the liver, or other parts affected with hydatid
tumors, from the sheep or other animals, the scolices are liberated,
and, passing into the small intestine, are there developed into the
mature tape-worms.Hydatid tumors occur in any of the organs of the body, but are more
frequent in the liver than in all others together.They are common in
the lungs, kidneys, spleen, omentum, and subperitoneal tissue of the
abdominal walls.They are less common in the heart, brain, spinal
canal, the pelvic viscera, and the bones.Mostly but a single tumor is
found in the same person, but occasionally several occur together in
the same or in different organs.There are several varieties of the hydatid tumor.In man the more
common form consists of a cyst or a group of cysts enclosed in a
connective-tissue envelope induced by the presence of the parasite.The
simple cyst is produced through the transformation of the echinococcus
embryo, and the group of cysts is derived from the former by
proliferation; and hence the first has been called the parent cyst, and
the others the daughter cysts.These also in the same manner may
produce a third series, called granddaughter cysts.The parent cyst, at
first spherical, becomes modified in shape according to the space it
occupies and the resistance to which it is subjected, thus assuming an
oval, lobulated, or other form.It may increase in size to that of a
cocoanut or larger, and may remain simple, but usually is compounded by
proliferation in the production of daughter cysts.These may be few or
many up to hundreds, and range from a minute size up to that of a
walnut, and are spherical or modified in shape by mutual pressure or
other cause.The cysts are filled with a clear watery liquid of saline
taste, but without albumen.The hydatid cysts are usually composed of an outer thick, translucent,
homogeneous, laminated, glistening, highly elastic membrane, the
ectocyst, and an inner thin, granular, and cellular layer, the
endocyst.From the endocyst originate minute buds, which become the
brood-capsules of the larval worms or scolices.These form little
groups of a few to a dozen individuals suspended within the
brood-capsules, but capable of eversion from them.The individual
scolices, which appear to the naked eye as mere white points, have the
form and construction of the head-segment of the mature Taenia
echinococcus.After death or by violence they become easily detached,
and then float free in the liquid containing them.In some cases the
echinococcus cysts develop no scolices, in which condition they
constitute acephalocysts.Occasionally the echinococcus embryo
undergoes imperfect development, constituting the multilocular hydatid
tumor, rarely found elsewhere than in the liver.{945} Echinococcal tumors, especially those which have many daughter
cysts, when accessible are remarkable for exhibiting a tremulous
movement when grasped by the hand and quickly tapped with the finger.Infection through the embryonic form of the Taenia echinococcus, as the
source of hydatid tumors, is productive of the most disastrous
consequences, and has ended in the destruction of many lives both of
men and domestic animals.The parasite is not directly productive of
suffering, but its effects and dangers are proportioned to the size of
the tumor it occasions and the character and importance to life of the
organ in which the latter is situated.With the increase of the hydatid
tumor, usually of very slow growth, it encroaches upon the surrounding
parts, and if these are not displaced they become disorganized and
atrophied.The liability and frequency of infection with the hydatid disease
appear to be proportioned to the prevalence of intimate association
with the dog.In Iceland, in which it is said every peasant owns half a
dozen dogs, which share his dwelling with him, it is also reported that
one-sixth of all the deaths are due to the hydatid parasite.Ordinarily, the hydatid disease is beyond the reach of medical
treatment.The mercurials and potassium iodide have been recommended,
but the results are very doubtful.Apparently as an indication how
little hydatid parasites may be influenced by medicine, the following
incident will show: The writer once received for dissection the body of
an English sailor which had been injected with zinc chloride for
preservation.In the abdominal wall in the right iliac region there was
a hydatid tumor the size of a fist.On examination of the tumor it was
found full of daughter cysts, and these contained living scolices,
though the man had been dead several days and the tissues were bleached
by the zinc solution.Favorable results in the treatment of hydatid tumors are only to be
expected through surgical means when they are accessible.As a prophylactic measure against infection the avoidance of too
intimate association with dogs is especially to be recommended.In concluding the chapter on Taenia echinococcus, as a prophylactic
against this and other parasites Cobbold gives the advice that "all
entozoa which are not preserved for scientific investigation or
experiment should be destroyed by fire when practicable, and under no
circumstances whatever should they be thrown aside as harmless refuse."*       *       *       *       *

TAENIA ACANTHOTRIAS.Larval condition: Cysticercus acanthotrias.This species has been but once observed, and only in the larval
condition or that of the scolex, which was first described by Weinland.About a dozen specimens were found by Jefferies Wyman of Boston in the
body of a woman of Virginia who died of phthisis.They were situated in
the connective tissue beneath the skin and in the muscles, except one,
which was attached to the dura mater.The scolex is distinguishable
from that of the other human tape-worms in possessing a triple circle
of hooks.{946} The Trematodes, or Fluke-worms.The trematodes or fluke-worms, though allied to the tape-worms, differ
in many important characters.In the mature condition, like the latter,
they are solid worms or are devoid of a body cavity or coelum, and are
with rare exceptions hermaphroditic.They are, however, never compound,
but simple or consist of single individuals, and are provided with a
mouth and alimentary canal, but this is closed or is without an anal
aperture.They have a water vascular system, communicating with the
exterior by a pore at the posterior extremity of the body.They are
commonly of flat, elliptical shape, with a sucker-like mouth at the
fore end, and with a second sucker situated ventrally near the middle.The fluke-worms are remarkable for their successive transformations and
course of life, and, like the tape-worms, they pass the different
stages of their existence in different animals.A number of species
have been described as infesting man, but most of them are,
fortunately, of rare occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HEPATICUM.--SYNONYMS: Fasciola hepatica; Liver-fluke.This species, the common liver-fluke, occasionally occurs in the human
body, but is especially frequent in the sheep and other ruminating
animals, as the ox, goat, and deer, and it likewise occurs in the
horse, hog, and some other animals.It usually inhabits the liver,
occupying the bile-ducts, but is also sometimes found in the portal and
other veins and in the intestine, and more rarely in abscesses beneath
the skin.It is the cause of the affection in sheep called rot, of
which many thousands die annually.The liver-fluke is a flat, tongue-shaped, brownish worm about an inch
long and about half as wide.It is invested with minute scale-like
spines.The head end is somewhat prolonged, and terminates in a small
oral sucker, a short distance behind which is a small ventral sucker.The intestine is forked and much branched.The genital aperture is
situated between the oral and ventral suckers.The commonly yellowish
eggs are numerous and large, oval, and measure about 0.135 mm.The common liver-fluke frequently occurs in large numbers, even
hundreds, in the liver of the sheep, obstructing the bile-ducts and
occasioning more or less destruction of the organ.The eggs pass off
with the bile into the intestine, and are discharged with the
excrement.In water the eggs are hatched, and deliver a ciliated and
freely-swimming embryo.This in favorable positions, such as marshy
pastures, obtains access to small fresh-water snails and penetrates to
the interior of their body.Here the embryo sheds its ciliated
integument and is transformed into a sporocyst.This is an elliptical
pouch containing reproductive bodies, which become developed into
individuals of more elongated form than the sporocyst, provided with a
mouth and stomach, and named redias, or nurses.The nurse penetrates to
the liver of the snail, and there develops within itself new forms
called cercarias, which resemble the parent fluke-worm, but are
provided with a long, powerful tail and have no apparent generative
apparatus.The cercaria escapes through an aperture of the nurse, and
makes its way out of the snail into the water, where it swims about
actively by means of the tail, much in the manner of a tadpole.{947}
The cercaria after a time fixes itself to a submerged plant, becomes
encysted, shakes off its tail, and remains in a quiescent state.If in
this condition, in the feeding of sheep or other animals, the tailless
cercaria or incipient fluke-worm is transferred to the stomach, it
makes its way to the liver, and there grows and is developed into the
sexually mature worm.Recently it has been ascertained both in England and Germany that the
juvenile state of the fluke-worm is passed especially in the little
fresh-water snail Lymneus truncatulus.As, however, the common
liver-fluke occurs in America, while the last-named species of Lymneus
does not, it is rendered probable that the juvenile condition of the
parasite also occurs in other species of snails.Incidentally, the
writer may here mention that he has found certain of our smallest
fresh-water snails, such as Planorbis parvus, frequenting meadows in
the vicinity of our rivers and creeks, swarming with nurses of several
different species of fluke-worms.Notwithstanding the frequency of the common liver-fluke in the sheep
and other domestic animals, its occurrence has been rare in man, and in
all the cases reported it has been few in number, either single or from
two to half a dozen.In man it has been found to occupy the bile-ducts,
the portal vein, and abscesses beneath the skin.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM LANCEOLATUM.--SYNONYM: Smaller Liver-fluke.This species, much smaller than the preceding, is of lanceolate form,
acute behind, smooth, and about a third of an inch long.Its suckers
are moderately large, and the bifurcate intestine is unbranched.It
infests the liver of the sheep and ox and some other animals, and not
unfrequently is found in association with the former species.It
usually does not occur in such great numbers together as in the latter;
from which and other circumstances, as the smaller size and smooth
investment, it does not produce the same serious results.Its
continuous history remains unknown, though it is probable that its
course is similar to that of the common liver-fluke.Several cases are
reported of its occurrence as a parasite in man.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM SINENSE.--Under this head Cobbold has recently described a
species somewhat larger than the D. lanceolatum.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CONJUNCTUM.--Another species described by Cobbold under this
name, originally found in the liver of an American fox, has also been
detected in man.The worm is about one-fourth of an inch long.*       *       *       *       *

SYMPTOMS.--Cases of fluke-worms in the human liver have occurred so
rarely that we are not prepared to indicate with certainty what may be
the nature of the peculiar symptoms.If the parasites were numerous,
they would give rise to more or less obstruction of the bile-ducts,
with accumulation of bile, accompanied with jaundice and other symptoms
usually attendant on functional disturbance of the liver.As in sheep,
they would occasion dilatation of the bile-ducts, catarrhal
inflammation, incrustation with biliary matters, hyperplasia of the
surrounding {948} tissues, and more or less disorganization and atrophy
of the secretory structure.TREATMENT.--As regards the treatment, we can say almost nothing.In the
destructive disease of rot in sheep there are no known means to expel
the parasites from the liver.If present in man, as they occur but few
in number, we may hope for their spontaneous expulsion in due time
without leaving any serious result.As a means of prophylaxis persons
should carefully avoid salads prepared from subaquatic vegetables, like
cress, which may harbor little fresh-water snails.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM HETEROPHYES.--This is a small species, about half a line long,
with the fore part of the body covered with minute spines, and having a
large, nearly central, ventral disk.It has been but once observed, and
was reported by Bilharz, in Cairo, as having been found, in the
post-mortem examination of a boy, in the small intestine, in which it
existed in hundreds.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM CRASSUM.--This is the largest of the fluke-worms infesting
man, and measures from one to three inches in length.It is elliptical,
comparatively thick, and smooth.The two suckers have nearly the same
relative size and position as in the D. hepaticum.It inhabits the
duodenum, and has been observed a number of times infesting inhabitants
of China and India.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM RINGERI.--A species by this name, about half an inch long, has
recently been described by Cobbold as infesting the lungs of people in
Formosa and China.*       *       *       *       *

DISTOMUM OPHTHALMOBIUM.--A minute species, described under this name,
has been detected several times in the human eye.*       *       *       *       *

BILHARZIA HAEMATOBIA.--SYNONYM: Distomum haematobium.As a human parasite this is the most important of the fluke-worms,
being the most common and dangerous.It is apparently restricted to
Africa and Arabia, and is especially frequent in Egypt, Abyssinia, the
Cape of Good Hope, and Natal.So far as known, it is peculiar to man
and monkeys, and inhabits the veins, especially those of the portal
system, and it lives on the blood.The blood fluke-worm is remarkable among its kind in having the sexes
distinct.The female is slender, cylindrical, and tapering toward the
ends, looking more like an ordinary thread-worm than a fluke-worm, and
is about three-fourths of an inch long.The male is about half an inch
long, but wider than the female, which it partially embraces at
maturity by doubling upon it laterally.This parasite, of the same essential nature as the more ordinary
fluke-worms, is most probably introduced in the juvenile condition into
the stomach by drinking unfiltered standing waters, and perhaps also by
eating vegetables which grow in wet places and upon which the young
fluke-worms may be encysted.From the stomach the worms gain access to
the portal venous system, within which they undergo development to
sexual maturity.The worms, proportioned to their number, {949}
occasion more or less sudden and dangerous haematuria.According to
Bilharz, who first discovered the parasite, it also induces
inflammation of the ureters, bladder, and rectum, accompanied with
ulceration and incrustations and concretions in the same, due to the
abundant deposit of eggs in the mucous membrane.The symptoms in the
haematuria are obvious; all treatment fails, but the prophylaxis is
evident.*       *       *       *       *

AMPHISTOMUM HOMINIS.--The genus Amphistomum is distinguished from
Distomum in having the ventral disk placed at the posterior extremity
of the body.A species has been recently described by Cobbold under the above name,
and is reported as having been observed several times in natives of
India.It is a red worm, about the fourth of an inch long, and inhabits
the caecum and ascending colon, in which it was found in hundreds
together.The mucous membrane exhibited venous congestion and was
marked with numerous red spots resembling leech-bites, produced by the
parasites.One of the patients died of cholera.We have too little information as to the symptoms induced by this
parasite, and of its treatment, to say anything.It is probable that
calomel, turpentine, and castor oil would be appropriate remedies.Several other fluke-worms which have been reported as having been found
in the human body are generally viewed with doubt as to their
genuineness.Such are the Hexathyridium pinguicola, from a tumor of the
ovary; the H. venarum, said to have been found in the blood and in the
sputum of haemoptysis; and the Tetrastomum renale, said to have been
found in the urine.The Acanthocephali, or Thorn-head Worms.The thorn-head worms in the mature condition are comparatively robust
cylindrical worms, with a body-cavity or coelum, but devoid of mouth
and alimentary canal.They are provided with a protrusile and
retractile proboscis-like head armed with circular rows of recurved
hooks, by which they firmly cling to the wall of the intestine of their
host.There are many species, which mostly in
the mature state live in fishes.In the juvenile or larval condition
they live in other animals, mostly crustaceans and insects.It is
doubtful whether any species naturally infests man.*       *       *       *       *

ECHINORHYNCHUS GIGAS.--The great thorn-head worm is a common parasite
of the hog, living in the small intestine.It is a large white worm,
the female of which reaches a foot in length, while the male is about
one-third the size.It is doubtful whether it occurs as a human
parasite, though a worm less than the fourth of an inch found in a man
in Prague has been attributed to this species.The Nematodes, or Thread-worms.The nematodes, or thread-worms, are slender, cylindrical, and
inarticulate, and usually more or less tapering toward one or both
extremities.{950} They have a distinct coelum or body-cavity, with
thick muscular walls limited by a transparent elastic, chitinous
integument, which is sometimes more or less distinctly and regularly
transversely wrinkled.The alimentary canal extends the length of the
coelum, with the mouth at the anterior extremity, and usually an anus
at or near the posterior extremity.In some forms in the mature
condition the intestine is atrophied and the anus absent.The sexes are
distinct, and commonly the male is very much smaller than the female.The organs of generation occupy the coelum along the sides of the
intestine.The female aperture is commonly situated ventrally near or
in advance of the middle of the body, while the male aperture is at or
in the vicinity of the anus.Mostly, the worms are oviparous, but many
are viviparous.The development is direct, and usually the
transformations are inconspicuous, so that the embryos mostly differ
but little from the parent, except in the absence of the generative
apparatus.*       *       *       *       *

OXYURIS VERMICULARIS.--SYNONYMS: Ascaris vermicularis; Seat-worm;
Pin-worm; Maw-worm; Maggot-worm; Thread-worm; Ascarides.The seat-worm is the most common intestinal parasite of man, prevails
everywhere, and is peculiar to him.It is a lively, wriggling creature
which inhabits the small and large intestines and feeds on their
contents.It frequently occurs in large numbers together, and in such
cases incessantly makes its appearance, associated with multitudes of
eggs, in the evacuations.The female, which is ordinarily seen alone in the greatest abundance,
is a white cylindrical worm tapering toward both extremities.The head
end is thickened, and is provided with three prominent labial papillae
enclosing the mouth.The posterior end extends from the anal aperture
in a long and straight, narrow, conical, sharp-pointed tail.The double
uterine tube, distended with eggs, terminates in a vagina, the external
aperture of which is situated ventrally near the anterior third of the
body.The smaller male hardly tapers behind, but is incurved and ends
in a short, blunt, conical tail.The penis is a single chitinous
spicule, the end of which is usually seen projecting from the cloacal
aperture.The young seat-worms, in various degrees of growth and development, and
the mature males are chiefly to be met in the lower portion of the
small intestine, while the pregnant and mature females chiefly occupy
the caecum.The seat-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that a single
ripe female contains from 10,000 to 12,000 eggs, and these, it is
suspected, may be renewed several times before her functions become
exhausted.From time to time the ripe females proceed along the large
intestine to the rectum, in which position they lay most of their eggs.These are discharged, together with many of the worms, in the feces.The eggs are ovoid in shape and about 0.05 mm.After they are
laid under favorable conditions the embryos are rapidly developed.The investigations of the helminthologists of the day make it appear
that it is necessary that the eggs of the seat-worm should be swallowed
{951} and pass through the stomach, in which the embryos are freed,
before they can undergo development to sexual maturity.Moreover,
observations go to show that infection may, and probably ordinarily
does, occur from eggs scratched from the anus and conveyed to the mouth
directly or by being applied to food from uncleanly hands.It is
evident that itching of the anus, induced by the presence of the
parasites in the rectum, often accompanied by itching of the nose and
lips, may lead to alternate scratching of the parts and the
transference of eggs from one to the other.Thus, too, uncleanly nurses
who may be infested with seat-worms after scratching may handle food
and infest children under their charge.Children are commonly more
liable to the parasites than others, no doubt from the circumstance
that they are less capable of avoiding the conditions favorable to
infection.Seat-worms prevail in all conditions of society, but their
prevalence is largely proportioned to the more or less uncleanly
habits.Persons sleeping with others infested are liable to infection,
especially if they are uncleanly and in the habit of eating in bed.Obvious hints to avoid the parasites are obtained by regarding the
statements thus given.SYMPTOMS.--The presence of a few seat-worms is usually attended with no
obvious inconvenience, and they may remain unnoticed unless
accidentally observed in the evacuations.The symptoms occasioned by
them are in great measure proportioned to their quantity and the
susceptibility of the patient.The most prominent symptom is excessive
itching of the anus; often trifling or even absent during the day, it
becomes very annoying and distressing in the evening or during the
night.This periodic change appears to be due to the movement of the
worms to the rectum, apparently induced by the position and repose of
the patient and the increased warmth of the body in bed.Under these
circumstances the patient attempts to relieve the incessant itching by
scratching, and often by boring with the finger in the anus.In this
way eggs become adherent to the finger-nails, under which they have
been repeatedly detected, and may thus be inadvertently transferred to
the mouth.Occasionally, some of the worms wander from the anus, and in
women may thence penetrate into the vulva.The itching of the anus may
induce more or less sexual irritation, which in the young may further
lead to onanism and its attendant evils.Other symptoms of the presence
of the parasites are itching of the nose and lips, restlessness in
sleep, grinding of the teeth, startings, twitchings, and general
nervous disturbance.When the worms are very numerous they may produce
intestinal catarrh, with discharges of mucus, pain, and diarrhoea.In
children especially they may give rise to more serious nervous
symptoms, as epileptic fits and chorea.TREATMENT.--Generally, persons are readily relieved of seat-worms.Epsom salt alone or with senna as a purgative, repeated once or twice,
often answers to completely expel them.Castor oil, also alone or with
a few drops of the oil of turpentine or of wormseed, is also an
effectual remedy.The tincture of aloes, in the dose of from half a
fluidounce to two fluidounces, once or twice repeated, the writer has
found to fully answer the purpose.Besides the purgatives, medicated
suppositories, in obstinate cases injections of olive oil, and enemata
of a solution of castile soap introduced by means of an elastic tube,
so as to wash out the entire length of the large intestine, may be
employed.*       *       *       *       *

{952} ASCARIS LUMBRICOIDES.--SYNONYMS: Round-worm; Long round-worm;
Maw-worm; Lumbricus.The round-worm is the largest of the nematodes which ordinarily infest
man, and is second only in frequency to the seat-worm.It is a
well-known parasite, and prevails everywhere in all conditions of
society.It is less lively in its movements than the seat-worm, and is
remarkable for possessing a peculiar disagreeable odor, which is
independent of the medium in which it lives.It inhabits the small
intestine and feeds on the contents.It also infests the hog and the
ox.The round-worm is cylindrical, reddish or brownish, and tapering toward
both extremities.The head end terminates in three prominent labial
papillae surrounding the mouth, and the tail end is short and conical.The female, as commonly seen, ranges from six inches to a foot in
length, and is about a fourth of an inch in thickness.The ovarian
tubes are long, thread-like, and tortuous, and, with the shorter,
nearly straight, and wider uterine tubes, contain many millions of
eggs.The genital aperture is situated ventrally near the anterior
third of the body.The male is about half the size of the female, but
is capable of considerable extension, and the tail end is incurved.The
penis consists of a pair of slender, clavate, chitinous spicules, the
ends of which protrude from the cloacal aperture at the root of the
tail.The round-worm is exceedingly prolific, it being estimated that the
genital tubes of a large mature female contain the enormous number of
60,000,000 of eggs.The ripe eggs are laid in the intestine, and are
discharged with the evacuations in great numbers, and often in
considerable masses together.They are oval, about 0.05 mm.in length,
and are provided with a thick shell and an additional tuberculate
albuminoid envelope, usually  by the intestinal contents.The eggs of the round-worm after being expelled from the body are very
tenacious of life, and under ordinary favorable circumstances they may
remain in a condition capable of development for several years.Experiments have shown that they have great power in resisting the
destructive influences of heat and cold, dryness, and the agencies of
decomposition.In water and moist earth they have been retained alive
for a year or two.When ripe eggs are placed in water the development
of the embryo is observed to proceed very slowly, and is only completed
after five or six months.The embryo while still contained within the
egg sheds its skin and becomes provided with a tooth-like spine to the
head end.The smallest examples of reputed round-worms found in the
human intestine measured only about a line in length.The further history of the round-worm is unknown, nor has it yet been
positively ascertained in what manner man becomes infected with the
parasite.Repeated experiments, not only on the hog and other animals,
but on man himself, go to show that he is not directly infected by
swallowing the recently-laid ripe eggs.It is rendered probable that
the eggs are swallowed by some common but yet unknown minute aquatic
animal, within which the embryo may undergo further development, and in
this condition may be swallowed by man in drinking-water.In
confirmation of the view that man becomes infected in the latter way,
Davaine remarks that the "people of Paris, who drink only filtered
{953} water, are rarely infected with the round-worm, which is
otherwise the case in the rural districts of France."The round-worm is most prevalent in warm climates, and especially among
the less-civilized peoples.The better classes among the more
enlightened nations suffer comparatively little from the parasite, and
it is the lower classes, especially the ill-fed and uncleanly, who are
most afflicted.It is exceedingly frequent in the Orient, in Africa,
the West Indies, and Brazil.Most commonly, only a few round-worms--one, two, three, up to a
dozen--occur together in the same person, but they often occur in
considerable number, even to several hundreds.Not unfrequently they
are found in association with seat-worms.They are more frequent and
usually occur in greater abundance in children, perhaps in a measure
due to the circumstance that they are less able to discriminate the
conditions favorable to infection and avoided on other grounds by
adults.The natural and ordinary habitation of the round-worm is the small
intestine, especially the jejunum, and it commonly only occurs in the
large intestine, mostly dead, on the way to be discharged with the
evacuations.Under disturbing circumstances, as the character of
certain irritating food, the parasite is disposed to become restless
and wander from its usual position.Not unfrequently it enters the
stomach, and thence may ascend to the mouth or nose, and perhaps the
first intimation of the presence of such an unwelcome guest is in its
expulsion from the mouth.From the pharynx the worm may enter the
larynx and trachea, or advance farther into the air-passages, giving
rise to the usual symptoms of foreign bodies in these parts.Occasionally the parasite forces its way through the bile-ducts into
the liver and gall-bladder, creating disturbance in those organs
proportioned to the number and size of the worms and the extent of
their progress.In the liver it may occasion inflammation and the
formation of an abscess attended with all the usual symptoms of
hepatitis.It has been reported that it may penetrate the intestinal
wall and enter the peritoneal cavity, but it is generally regarded as
doubtful whether the worm can do so in a healthy state of the
intestine, but only where there may be ulceration or other similar
condition.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms indicating the presence of the round-worm in
the intestine vary with its numbers and with the age and susceptibility
of the patient.In general, the presence of one or two worms is
unattended with any marked disturbance, and is mostly unsuspected until
the parasite is accidentally seen in the discharges.The ordinary
symptoms are disordered appetite (usually increased), flatulence,
hiccough, foul breath, dyspepsia, abdominal pains, itching at the
extremities of the alimentary canal, furred tongue, darkening of the
eyelids, and emaciation.The nervous symptoms are restlessness in
sleep, unpleasant dreams, starting in fright, grating of the teeth, and
muscular twitchings.In more aggravated cases, especially in children,
epileptic fits may occur.If the parasites are numerous, they produce
diarrhoea with copious mucus discharges, and may induce enteritis with
all its attendant symptoms.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.When the worms wander into the stomach,
they induce colic, nausea, retching, and vomiting, all of which
disappear with the expulsion of the parasites.TREATMENT.--The remedies employed for seat-worms often serve to {954}
expel the round-worm, and not unfrequently the two are discharged
together.Wormseed, or the seed of Chenopodium anthelminticum, has been
a favorite remedy for the round-worm, especially in children.The dose
in these cases is one or two scruples of the powdered seeds in
electuary with syrup or molasses, administered in the morning before
breakfast and at bedtime for three or four days.It should be followed
by calomel or other brisk cathartic.The volatile oil, in the dose of
from five to ten drops in emulsion, may be used in the same manner.A much-extolled remedy to destroy and get rid of the round-worm is
santonin, given in doses of from one-third to one and a half grains
three or four times a day, the larger dose being used only for adults.It should be followed by a purgative, for which a dose of castor oil
answers a good purpose.*       *       *       *       *

ASCARIS MYSTAX, the common round-worm of the cat and dog, has been
reported as occasionally infesting man.It resembles the former
species, but is much smaller, commonly from one to four inches in
length, and has the head end furnished with a pair of lateral narrow,
wing-like expansions of the integument.It inhabits the small
intestine, and when present in man would no doubt induce symptoms like
those of the ordinary round-worms which infest him.*       *       *       *       *

TRIOCEPHALUS DISPAR.--SYNONYMS: Long thread-worm; Whip-worm.The long thread-worm is a not unfrequent intestinal parasite of man,
though rarely observed unless specially sought, as it ordinarily gives
rise to little or no disturbance.It is common in England, Southern
Europe, and the Orient.Davaine reports that half the cases of persons
investigated in Paris were infested with it; it also occurs in this
country.It inhabits the lower end of the ileum, the caecum, and
vermiform appendix, and feeds on the intestinal contents.It commonly
occurs in small numbers, two or three to a dozen, occasions no evident
inconvenience, and is rarely discharged with the evacuations.The long thread-worm is yellowish-white and cylindrical, with the
anterior half or more of the body attenuated in a hair-like manner.The
female reaches about two inches in length, has the tail end conical,
and the anus subterminal.The male is about two-thirds the length of
the former, has the thicker portion of the body enrolled, and the tail
end blunt.The eggs are laid in the intestine and discharged with the
feces.The subsequent history of the parasite and its mode of infecting
man remain unknown.Only in cases where long thread-worms are numerous do they give rise to
trouble.According to Leuckart, Pascal gives as constant symptoms of
the presence of large numbers of the parasite, headache, redness of the
face, prominence of the eyes, small, irregular, and intermittent pulse,
and pains in the lower part of the abdomen.The usual remedies addressed to the seat-worm and round-worm will most
probably be equally applicable to the long thread-worm.*       *       *       *       *

LEPTODERA STERCORALIS.--SYNONYMS: Anguillula stercoralis; Rhabditis
stercoralis.{955} This is a minute nematode worm recently observed infesting French
soldiers in Cochin China.It is about half a line in length, and
inhabits the small and large intestine, and also penetrates into the
biliary and pancreatic ducts.It occurs in myriads and occasions
diarrhoea and dysentery.Another species, Leptodera intestinalis,
nearly three times as large, has been noticed in smaller number
associated with the former.The eggs of these worms are laid in the
intestines, and both together are discharged in multitudes with the
feces.They are probably introduced into man by drinking stagnant
water, and undergo complete development after passing through the
stomach.It is probable that the remedies employed in the treatment of the
familiar seat-worms and round-worms would be equally efficacious in the
expulsion of these parasites.*       *       *       *       *

ANCHYLOSTOMUM DUODENALE.--SYNONYMS: Strongylus duodenalis; Dochmius
duodenalis; Sclerostoma duodenale.This intestinal parasite, first noticed in Milan by Dubini in 1838, is
of more dangerous character than any of the nematode worms previously
described.In Europe, besides Italy, it was frequently observed among
the workmen of the St.It is exceedingly common in
Egypt, and Bilharz found it in nearly all his post-mortem examinations
of bodies.It probably prevails to a considerable extent in most
tropical countries, including the East and West Indies and Brazil.There is also reason to suspect, from the nature of the affection it
induces, that it may exist in the Southern States.The Anchylostomum is a red, cylindrical worm, with the anterior
extremity tapering and recurved.The head end, somewhat enlarged,
encloses a capacious oral capsule armed with strong hook-like teeth.The caudal extremity of the female ends in a conical point, and the
genital aperture is situated behind the middle of the body.The caudal
extremity of the male ends in a trilobate pouch, within which projects
the bispiculate penis.The female is from five lines to three-fourths
of an inch long; the male is about half the size.The eggs are oval and
measure 0.05 mm.The worm inhabits the small intestine, especially the duodenum and
jejunum, clinging tenaciously to the lining membrane by means of the
armed mouth.It penetrates the mucous membrane to the submucous coat,
from which it sucks the blood that forms its food.In the position of
its attachment it gives rise to little ecchymoses.It often occurs in
large numbers, even to hundreds and thousands.The eggs are laid in the
intestine and are discharged with the evacuations.Externally, in
water, the embryo undergoes development within the egg, and then
escapes to lead for some time an independent existence.Subsequently,
it is most probable that the worm obtains access to the human stomach
by drinking standing water, and completes its development in the
intestine.The Anchylostomum proves to be a prolific source of wasting diseases in
tropical countries, and is pernicious to an extent proportioned to the
numbers infesting the intestine.By depriving the body of blood it
produces a greater or less degree of anaemia.The affection begins very
insidiously, and the general nutrition of the body may not be visibly
disturbed {956} until a late period.In moderate cases the disease is
indicated by general paleness of the skin and mucous membranes, fatigue
on slight exertion, and a tendency to palpitations and quickened pulse.In more severe cases there is constantly increasing debility, with
increase of paleness, indisposition to exertion, excessive sleepiness,
and feeling of coldness.Dyspeptic symptoms sometimes appear, and loss
of appetite may alternate with ravenous hunger.Accompanying this there
is often a disposition to eat innutritious articles, as coal, clay,
wool, etc.Feeling of weight and oppression in the epigastrium and
abdominal pains are frequent.In the advance of the affection shortness
of breath appears, increased on exertion to violent dyspnoea.Emaciation becomes obvious in the later stage of the disease.In the
worst cases the symptoms increase in severity, the patient becomes
dropsical, is attacked with profuse diarrhoea and vomiting, and finally
dies.The severity of the affection is proportioned to the number of
parasites present and the quantity of blood they consume and cause to
be lost.Bad cases may end fatally in a few weeks, but generally the
disease lasts for months, and where the patient is provided with
abundance of good food it may continue for years.The prognosis of the disease is rather unfavorable; if, however, the
nature of the affection is ascertained before it has greatly exhausted
the patient, and the parasites can be expelled, the result should be
favorable.We have thus far obtained but little information as to the best
treatment for Anchylostomum.Calomel and turpentine have been
recommended, and, as these are most powerful vermicides, we have reason
to believe they would prove most effectual remedies.In regard to the prophylaxis for Anchylostomum--and we may add in
general for all parasites which gain entrance to man through
drinking-water--all stagnant or standing waters should be filtered, so
as to remove any source of infection, whether by eggs or free embryos
of parasites or of larval forms existing within minute aquatic animals
which serve as intermediate hosts to parasites.Standing waters, such
as those of puddles, ditches, marshes, and ponds, more or less swarm
with minute animals, all of which may be entirely removed by
filtration.Even the water of cisterns and wells, if supplied from the
free surface of the country, may not be free from minute animals, and
especially eggs, and therefore requires filtration to be safe.Only
spring and freely-running water of rivers and creeks and of lakes is
commonly free from microscopic animals and their eggs, and therefore
devoid of all danger in these respects.*       *       *       *       *

STRONGYLUS LONGEVAGINATUS; S.bronchialis.--This nematode has been only
once satisfactorily observed.Many occurred in the lungs of a boy in
Germany, but the real cause of his death was not stated.The female
worm is about an inch long, the male about five-eighths of an inch.Certain worms previously discovered in the bronchial glands of a case
of phthisis, and described under the name of Hamularia lymphatica, are
regarded by Cobbold as the same with the former; but the descriptions
of the two render this improbable.Treutler's drawing of Hamularia, as
copied by Leuckart, looks like an Ascaris upside down.*       *       *       *       *

{957} EUSTRONGYLUS GIGAS; Strongylus gigas; Palisade-worm;
Kidney-worm.--This worm, recorded in the catalogue of human parasites,
is doubtful as such.Pertaining to the same family as Anchylostomum, as
the common name indicates its usual habitation is the kidney.It is the
largest of the nematodes, and is a long, cylindrical red worm, slightly
tapering, and blunt at the ends.The mouth is enclosed by six rounded
labial papillae.The caudal extremity of the male ends in an inverted
cup-like pouch, from which the penal spiculum protrudes.The female
commonly ranges from one to three feet in length and from a fourth to
nearly half an inch in thickness.The male ranges from six inches to a
foot in length and from one to three lines in thickness.The mature parasite is common in many fish-eating mammals, from which
it is inferred that fishes are the intermediate host for the juvenile
condition of the worm.It is frequent in the wolf, dog, mink, weasel,
raccoon, otter, and seal.It also occurs in the hog, and is reported to
have occurred in the horse, ox, and man.Usually it is solitary, and
occupies one of the kidneys coiled upon itself.Under its influence the
kidney is atrophied and reduced to the condition of a capsule of
connective tissue, often containing bony spicules.It feeds on blood
and on the purulent matter resulting from the inflammation it produces.The worm is occasionally found in other positions, as the mesentery,
the abdominal cavity, the intestine, liver, urinary bladder, and lungs,
but perhaps in most of these cases has been derived from its usual
habitation.In this country the writer has repeatedly observed the
kidney-worm in the mink, the dog, and the wolf.In one instance in the
former animal he found a female and a male associated together in one
kidney, which was reduced to the condition of a fibrous capsule
containing in its wall a large radiated plate of bone.The cases on record of the occurrence of this formidable parasite in
man are of very early date, and are mostly doubtful as to the authentic
nature of the worm, and are all unsatisfactory as to the attendant
phenomena.*       *       *       *       *

TRICHINA SPIRALIS.--The trichina, or flesh-worm, a minute nematode, is
a common parasite of man, and from its wide prevalence and results may
be regarded as the most dangerous of all.Perhaps from the earliest
ages it has been dealing death freely and indiscriminately to our kind
without its existence having been suspected until within the last
half-century.Frequently, the affection, now named trichinosis,
produced by its presence has been so prevalent in communities as to
appear epidemic.The parasite was first discovered, and is commonly
observed, as a little worm coiled up and imbedded in the flesh of man.In the same manner it is frequently seen in the flesh of the hog.In
the adult or mature state it lives in the small intestine of both man
and the hog, but its duration of life in this position is comparatively
brief.Trichinosis, or the disease induced by the introduction of trichinae
into the intestinal canal and the migration thence into the voluntary
muscles, varies in symptoms and gravity with the number, condition, and
position of the parasites and the susceptibility of the patient.The
presence of trichinae in the alimentary canal, though often accompanied
by violent symptoms, is comparatively free from danger, whereas in the
muscular {958} system they not only produce the greatest suffering, but
often the most disastrous results.Man is ordinarily infected with the trichina by eating the raw or
insufficiently cooked meat of the hog, or pork in any of its varieties
of food.Infected meat often contains immense numbers of the parasite,
a single ounce at times being estimated to contain from 50,000 to
100,000 worms.The trichina was first distinctly noticed in the muscles of the human
body by Paget in 1835, and was described by Owen with the name it now
bears.It was subsequently observed under the same circumstances by
other investigators.In 1846 the parasite was found by the writer in
the muscles of the hog, but neither he nor others for some time
afterward suspected the significance of the discovery.In 1860, Zenker
of Dresden treated a supposed case of typhus complicated with excessive
muscular pain and oedema.On post-mortem examination the muscles were
found swarming with trichinae, and to these the affection altogether
was attributed.Nearly at the same time the investigations of Leuckart
confirmed the relationship of the parasites as the cause of the
disease.In 1862, Friederich first diagnosticated the affection and
experimentally determined the presence of the worms in the living
patient.The trichina is also found infesting other animals of the same class
besides man and the hog, especially the rat, mouse, rabbit, cat, and
fox.Experiments further prove that mammals are generally more or less
susceptible to infection with the parasite, though some appear to
resist its extension to the muscular system, as in the case of the dog.The horse, ox, and sheep exhibit little disposition to artificial
infection of the muscles, and hence from this circumstance and the
nature of the food of these animals they are rarely found to be
infested with trichinae.In experiments on birds and lower classes of
animals, though trichinae were ascertained to advance in development in
the intestine, they failed to invade the muscular system.Ordinarily, it appears that while man is infected with trichinae
through the hog, this animal becomes infected by eating infested rats,
mice, and cats, fragments of waste pork, and perhaps occasionally by
feeding on the excrements of infested animals.The trichinae occupying the muscles are immature, and it is only after
they are swallowed and the parasites are freed by digestion of the
envelopes and pass into the intestine that they undergo development to
sexual maturity.In this state the female is viviparous and gives birth
to a multitude of active embryos, which immediately commence to migrate
to the muscular system.As it is estimated that each female may give
birth to upward of a thousand embryos, it is readily conceived to what
an extent the body may become infested from eating a few ounces of
trichinous pork.The immature or larval trichinae are also distinguished as muscular,
and the sexually mature ones as intestinal, trichinae, in accordance
with their position in the two principal conditions.Muscular trichinae vary in condition from the embryo, which works its
way among the muscular fibres or has obtained entrance into these, to
the coiled-up worm lying quiescent in a capsule imbedded among the
muscular fibres.Infected flesh in the early state is scarcely distinguishable as such
with {959} the naked eye, but in old cases the trichina capsules become
imbued with calcareous matter, and are thus rendered visible as minute
white or grayish specks scattered through the red meat.In the recent state of invasion the worms are found free among the
muscular fibres or within these.Later, they appear mostly solitary and
at rest, coiled within a fusiform mass of semi-liquid granular matter
resulting from the degradation of the muscular substance.Subsequently,
they become enclosed in an elliptical capsule, apparently derived from
the myolemma of the muscular fibre they had entered.The capsules,
situated among the bundles of sound muscular fibres, are arranged with
their long diameter parallel with the latter.The trichina capsules
commonly measure about one-fifth of a line long, and the coiled worm
within is scarcely a half-line long.If muscular trichinae remain with their host, after a year or more they
exhibit signs of decay.Commonly, little fat-globules appear at the
poles of the capsules, and these become the seat of calcareous deposit.Finally, the worms die and undergo degeneration.When meat with living trichina capsules is swallowed, the freed worms
pass into the intestine, and here in the course of four or five days
reach maturity.The adult intestinal trichina is a minute, filiform white worm, thicker
behind and tapering forward.The female is about an eighth of an inch
long, and has the genital aperture at the anterior fourth of the body.The male is little more than half the length of the former, and has the
caudal end provided with a pair of conical processes, between which is
the genital aperture.The ripe female trichinae give birth to living embryos, and continue
the function for about a month, after which they appear exhausted,
ordinarily die, and disappear from the intestinal canal.The new-born
embryos, about 1/200 of a line long, quickly leave the intestine to be
disseminated throughout the body.Penetrating the mucous membrane, they
probably enter the blood-vessels to be carried onward by the
blood-currents, and perhaps also, in part, directly migrate to their
destination in the muscles.The latter mode of progress is rendered the
more probable from the circumstance that the muscles contiguous to the
intestinal canal, as the diaphragm and those of the abdominal walls,
are commonly most abundantly infested with the parasites.In the
muscles of the limbs they are sometimes noticed to predominate toward
the extremities of the former, as if retarded in their course by the
tendinous connections.It would appear that muscular trichinae, to be capable of producing
infection--that is to say, of further development--must have reached a
certain stage, corresponding with the encapsulated condition, before
they are swallowed.In this stage they may remain within their host
probably for a year or two.Children seem to suffer less in proportion to the quantity of
trichinous meat they eat than adults, and they appear less susceptible
to muscular invasion of the parasites.The difference is probably in a
measure due to the greater susceptibility of the intestinal canal and
the consequent production of more copious diarrhoea in children, with
more complete expulsion of the worms.SYMPTOMS.--In general, the effect produced by eating trichinous meat
{960} is proportioned to the number and condition of the trichinae
ingested and to the susceptibility of the patient.A few of the
parasites may pursue their entire career and die within their host
without ever exhibiting any obvious evidence of their presence.Sometimes the symptoms of trichinosis are obscure or trifling,
sometimes sufficiently well marked, but moderate, and often they are
more or less striking and violent.The period of incubation of the
affection varies from a few hours to a week or more, and the duration
of the disease also varies--both in a measure proportioned to the
number and condition of the parasites.In mild cases of trichinosis the patient may pass through the course of
the disease without being confined to bed, and in a few weeks may be
regarded as convalescent.The majority of cases pursue a slow course of
from six or seven weeks to three or four months.A fatal termination is
frequent, and is most common from the fourth to the sixth week, and
appears mainly to be due to the loss of respiratory power.Fatal cases
rarely happen after the seventh week.From a few hours to a few days after eating trichinous meat the patient
may be seized with dyspeptic symptoms--nausea, cardialgia, flatulence,
eructations, and vomiting.These may be accompanied with complete loss
of appetite, excessive thirst, bad taste, and fetid breath.There is
also commonly a feeling of general uneasiness, with fulness of the
forehead or headache, and feeling of weakness and fatigue to exhaustion
or complete prostration.Neuralgic pains are felt in the abdomen and
limbs, and the muscles generally are more or less relaxed and flabby.Violent disturbance of the alimentary canal occurs only when large
quantities of active trichinae are taken with the food.The subsequent
symptoms, due to invasion of the muscular system, may, but do not
necessarily, accord in degree with the former.Diarrhoea usually comes on early, and the evacuations, at first more
consistent, become thin and clay-, like those of typhus or like
the rice-water stools of cholera.In the severest cases the patient may
die in this stage from extreme exhaustion and with all the appearance
of cholera.Sometimes the diarrhoea subsides and gives place to
obstinate constipation.The muscular symptoms induced by the invasion of the trichinae may be
trifling or moderate, varying to a most violent character.They
commonly appear after a week, and later up to the sixth week.The
muscles become more or less swollen, hard and tender to the touch, or
highly painful under pressure.Motion is extremely painful, and the
patient usually lies in a helpless state with the limbs flexed--adults
on the back, children on the side.Difficulty, with pain, in chewing
and swallowing ensues, and even complete trismus, due to the presence
of the parasites in the muscles of mastication and deglutition.Difficulty of breathing also arises from the presence of the trichinae
in the respiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm and those of the
larynx.Even movement of the eyes is painful, due to the parasites in
the orbital muscles.Bronchial catarrh comes on early, attended with
hoarseness and asthmatic cough.Fever may be absent in mild cases of trichinosis, but is considerable
in the severer forms, though not in the first few days.The pulse
accords with the increase of temperature.Profuse sweating is a common symptom of the affection, commencing {961}
early and continuing throughout.Generally there is considerable
decrease in the quantity of urine, which is highly <DW52>.Adults suffer with insomnia, while the reverse state prevails in
children, who commonly lie in a soporose condition.Formication and
dilatation of the pupils are frequent symptoms.Oedema is a characteristic and pathognomonic symptom of trichinosis,
and is seldom so slight as to escape attention.It commonly appears in
the eyelids and face about the end of the first week, and may disappear
after several days, to recur after several weeks.It usually commences
in the limbs in the second week, and is more marked and persistent, and
increases, especially in severe cases.Peritoneal and pleuritic irritation and inflammation, with bronchitis
and pneumonia, are not unfrequent complications in the more aggravated
form of trichinosis.Most cases of the disease reaching the seventh week advance in
convalescence, while those of mild character by this time have
recovered, except from the weakness and emaciation, which remain as
evidences of serious illness.Trichinosis in children is distinguished by greater mildness, less
danger, abundant oedema, less muscular pain, a dormant condition, and
more rapid convalescence.The distinct recognition of trichinosis is difficult in isolated cases,
but becomes more evident where it occurs in numbers, as in an entire
family or in large portions of a community.The proof that the patient
has partaken of trichinous pork helps to establish the diagnosis.In the beginning of severe cases of the affection symptoms of a more or
less violent gastro-intestinal catarrh are commonly present, often
associated with slight fever and almost invariably excessive
perspiration.Muscular lameness, both in mild and severe cases, is an
early symptom.The disease is distinguished from cholera by the profuse
perspiration and the peculiar muscular symptoms; from ordinary
rheumatism by the gastro-intestinal catarrh and general exhaustion.With the appearance of oedema of the eyelids and face at the end of a
week the diagnosis becomes more certain.The further progress of the
affection is so characteristic that its distinction can scarcely remain
in doubt.The general prostration, the violent muscular symptoms, the
bronchial catarrh, the hoarseness and dyspnoea, the profuse sweating,
and the sleeplessness, render the case pretty clear.In the prognosis of the disease no positive conclusion can be derived
from the severity or early appearance of the initial symptoms.Commonly, the more speedily they occur and the more violent they are,
the less favorable will be the prognosis, while the later they appear,
the more propitious it is.Long-continued diarrhoea is especially
unfavorable, while a profuse diarrhoea at the beginning is to be viewed
as a fortunate event.The prognosis is more favorable in cases in which
sleep and the appetite are maintained, and in those in which the
disturbance of the respiratory organs is slight.A favorable
termination of the affection is the rule with children.TREATMENT.--The treatment of trichinosis is not generally promising in
favorable results.No means have yet been discovered to destroy or
remove trichinae which have migrated from the intestinal canal.While
{962} the parasites continue within the latter we may have reasonable
hope of expelling them from the body by means of the usual remedies for
intestinal worms.Experience, however, with these remedies has not been
in accordance with expectations.In the mean time, until some more
potent vermicide is discovered applicable to the destruction and
removal of trichinae from the intestine, we are disposed to place most
reliance on such purgatives as oil of turpentine and castor oil and
calomel and jalap.Subsequently, a good nutritive diet with wine is
recommended to preserve the life of the patient until the affection has
reached that period when the parasites become capsulated and there is
no longer danger from them as irritants.As a preventive of trichinosis, besides the avoidance of pork or its
varied preparations of ham, sausages, etc.when it is known or
suspected they may be infested, thorough cooking of meats is a certain
means.A boiling temperature surely kills all animal parasites, but
care is requisite that large pieces of meat should be cooked
sufficiently long that the desired heat may extend to the interior
throughout.The writer may add that it was in a slice of boiled ham,
from which he had partly made his dinner, that he first discovered
trichina in the hog.*       *       *       *       *

Of the nematode worms there are many species of comparatively long,
slender proportions, which constitute the family of Filaridae.As
parasites they rarely occupy the interior of the intestinal canal,
except by way of transit, and live in most other organs and tissues of
the body of both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA MEDINENSIS.--SYNONYMS: Dracunculus; D. medinensis; Medina-worm;
Guinea-worm.The Medina-worm has long been recognized as a parasite of man, and by
competent authorities has been regarded as the fiery serpent which
afflicted the children of Israel in the wilderness of Judea.It
prevails in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia, and thence has
been introduced into tropical America.It is ordinarily observed as a
long, white, cord-like worm, situated beneath the skin in any part of
the body, but mostly in the lower limbs, and especially in the vicinity
of the ankle.Though a frequent parasite, only the female is known.In
the mature condition it is nearly uniformly cylindrical, and ranges
from eighteen inches to three or four feet in length and less than a
line in thickness.The head end is rounded and furnished with a little
papillate plate, in the centre of which is situated a minute oral
aperture.The caudal end is conical and incurved.The intestinal canal
is atrophied and without an anal aperture.The coelum is mainly
occupied by a capacious uterus filled with free embryos.A generative
aperture appears also to be absent, and the young can only escape by
rupture of the parent.Experiments made about a dozen years since in Turkestan by Fedschenko,
at the suggestion of Leuckart, have shown that when the embryos of the
Medina-worm are introduced into water containing the familiar little
crustacean cyclops, they penetrate into this, and within it undergo
transformation into the larval stage.The subsequent history of the
larval worms remains unknown, but from what we have learned of the
history of many parasitic worms it is reasonable to suppose that if
{963} the infested cyclops is swallowed in drinking-water, it may
explain the presence of the mature worm in the human body.The young
worms, liberated from their crustacean host by digestion in the
stomach, probably enter the intestine, and thence migrate to their
destination.In the young condition, advancing to maturity, the worms
have been found in all parts of the body except within the cranium and
eyeball.They appear to migrate in the course of the least-resisting
connective tissues, along the route of the principal blood-vessels,
until they reach the surface of the body.Usually, a single worm is found in a person, though cases occur where
several, to a dozen or more, are present.Commonly, the parasite is
solitary, though two or three may be associated together.When deeply
seated the Medina-worm ordinarily produces but little discomfort,
though in some cases its movements are accompanied with more or less
severe pain.It also gives rise to inflammation and the formation of an
abscess, in the purulent matter of which the worm lies bathed.The
removal of the worm, when accessible, by the proper surgical aid is
followed by complete relief.It is evident that filtration of the drinking-water would be a certain
prophylaxis for the Medina-worm.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA SANGUINIS.--SYNONYMS: Filaria sanguinis hominis, Lewis; F.
sanguinolenta; F. Bancrofti, Cobbold.Another species of Filaria, a more dangerous parasite of man and
indigenous to the tropics, is of frequent occurrence, though of
comparatively recent discovery.It has been observed in India, Africa,
Brazil, and the West Indies.It is commonly seen in the embryonic
condition, living in the blood of patients affected with elephantiasis
and certain other diseases, and is also found in the urine.In this
early condition it is a minute worm, scarcely more than the 1/100 of an
inch in length, and occurs together in immense numbers.In the sexually mature condition the female filaria is a white
hair-like worm three or four inches in length, living in the lymphatic
vessels distally to the glands, especially in those of the lower limbs
and scrotum.The embryos after leaving the parent pass into the
lymphatic stream, and thence into the circulating blood.According to
recent observations of Manson, they enter the blood in the evening and
increase in number until midnight, after which they decrease and
disappear by morning, from which time during the day they remain absent
from the circulation.The investigations of the same authority have
shown that when the blood of infected persons is sucked by mosquitoes
these insects also imbibe the embryos, which subsequently undergo
transformation in the mosquitoes into the larval state.In this
condition the filariae may be transferred to water, by drinking which
man may become infected with the parasites.The larvae introduced into
the stomach appear thence to make their way to the lymphatics, within
which they undergo further development to maturity, and thus remain a
long time.The presence of the worms in the lymphatics, with their numerous brood
in the circulating blood, gives rise to haematuria and chyluria.As
results of the obstruction of the lymphatic currents, the parasites
induce inflammation, suppuration, lymphatic abscesses, buboes,
lymphangiectasis, {964} oedema, ascites, chylous hydrocele,
elephantiasis,[3] and certain cutaneous affections.[Footnote 3: Several years since, with the view of ascertaining the
presence of parasitic worms, the writer examined the blood of a case of
elephantiasis under the charge of T. G. Morton, but none were detected.From what we have since been informed of the habits of Filaria
sanguinis, the absence of the parasites may have its explanation in the
circumstance that the blood examined was withdrawn in the daytime.]TREATMENT.--While the treatment of the affection induced by the Filaria
sanguinis is varied and uncertain, the prophylactic measures are
obvious and certain.Under favorable conditions of bright light, high
temperature, and abundant food the stagnant waters of tropical
countries are especially prolific of the minute forms of animals which
harbor parasites.It hence becomes evident that all such waters,
whether obtained from puddles, ponds, tanks, or cisterns, should be
filtered before being used for drinking.Boiling is also effectual in
destroying all the animal life of waters, and thus rendering them
innocuous so far as parasites are concerned.*       *       *       *       *

Several other species of Filaria have been found in the human body, but
are little known and very rare in their occurrence.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA LOA.--This species occurs in Western Africa, on the Gaboon
River, and is perhaps more frequent than now commonly supposed.It is
an active worm, little more than an inch in length, and is usually
found beneath the conjunctiva of the eye.It probably also occupies
other positions, and a missionary on the Gaboon informed the writer
that he had extracted one from the back of one of his own fingers.Its
presence produced an intense burning pain.The <DW64>s are reported to
extract the worm by means of a thorn.The worm has also been observed
in Brazil and the West Indies.*       *       *       *       *

FILARIA RESTIFORMIS.--Under this name the writer recently described a
large Filaria reported to have been withdrawn from the urethra of a man
in West Virginia.It was obtained by C. L. Garnett, and sent, together
with an account of the case, to the Army Medical Museum of Washington,
where it is now preserved.It was a red cylindrical worm, twenty-six
inches in length, tapering at the head, and thick, incurved, and
obtusely rounded at the tail end.[4]

occurrence of little worms in the aqueous humor and crystalline lens of
the human eye, to which the accompanying names have been applied.*       *       *       *       *

DISEASES OF THE LIVER.BY ROBERTS BARTHOLOW, A.M., M.D., LL.D.I. FUNCTIONAL DISORDERS.DEFINITION.--The term biliousness is used to signify a disturbance of
the gastro-intestinal digestion, with coincident excess in the
production of bile.According to the popular conception, both lay and
medical, the excess of bile is the cause of the symptoms; but when the
whole subject is carefully examined it will be found that biliousness
is made up of several factors, and that the hepatic disorder, if it
exist at all, is a mere incident.PATHOGENY.--From the time of Galen biliousness has been regarded as a
morbid entity and the liver as the organ affected.Stoll, amongst
moderns, first revived the Galenical doctrines.Abernethy[1] was
amongst English physicians the most conspicuous advocate of the
condition called biliousness, and was the apostle of blue pill and
black draught.Copland in his great dictionary[2] more distinctly
formulated the views of the English school--especially that portion of
it influenced by the results of Indian practice--than had been
previously attempted, and hence his work best represents the opinions
and practice of the time amongst the English-speaking peoples.In this
country the great Rush first promulgated the notions of biliousness
which have since so dominated the medical opinion of this continent.A
large part of the United States has proved a fruitful soil for the
cultivation of theories of biliousness, since the condition known under
this name is a frequent accompaniment of malarial poisoning.To this
fact must be attributed the preponderating importance of biliary
derangements in the practice of the physicians of India also.[Footnote 1: _Surgical Works_, London, 1811, vol.[Footnote 2: _A Dictionary of Practical Medicine_, vol.It is a fact which will be hereafter more fully developed that malarial
infection may, and often does, derange the hepatic functions without
producing fever.The malarial poison irritates the liver, and thus more
bile is produced, but the quality deteriorates with the increase in
quantity.The functions of the liver are more disturbed during an
access of intermittent fever: the organ is swollen, the skin is muddy,
the eyes yellow, the tongue coated with a thick yellow fur, and the
urine is deeply tinged with bile-pigment.Many of the metals employed as medicines and as poisons, as gold, {966}
silver, antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, etc., irritate the liver both in
their entrance and in their exit from the organism, and cause
biliousness; and the same fact is true of some vegetable alkaloids and
animal poisons.The liver excretes many of these substances, and in
their passage out from the blood the hepatic cells are irritated and an
increased production of bile is a result.Improper food, indulgence in
fats, sweets, condiments, and all kinds of fermented and alcoholic
liquors, intestinal indigestion arising from any cause, and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, are the most usual and obvious pathogenic
factors.In respect to food and indigestion as etiological factors
there are several points requiring more explicit statement.When
nitrogenous elements (albuminoids) are in excess in quantity or as
respects the power to digest and convert them, immature products, of
which uric acid is the chief, accumulate in the blood.When the fats,
sugars, and starches are in excess of the requirements of the organism
or are imperfectly disposed of in the small intestines, a local
irritation of the mucous membrane is produced, and various complicated,
immature products enter the blood.With these troubles and faults of
intestinal digestion a gastro-duodenal catarrh is usually associated.Without the production of catarrhal jaundice, gastro-duodenal catarrh,
with the forms of indigestion accompanying it, keeps up a reflex
irritation of the liver.Just as the presence of normal chyme induces
the flow of bile, so the unhealthy products of intestinal indigestion
excite an irritation of the liver.The continued operation of this
cause maintains an abnormal activity of the liver, and more bile is
produced than is easily disposed of.SYMPTOMS.--The condition of biliousness, as now understood, is made up
of derangement of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane, with
bile-production in excess and bile-absorption probably delayed.The
symptoms are the product of these complicated conditions.The
complexion is muddy; the conjunctivae are yellow; the tongue is heavily
coated with a yellowish-white fur; a bitter taste persists in the
mouth; the breath is heavy in odor, even fetid; the appetite may be
keen or there may be complete anorexia; a sensation of nausea, of
heaviness, and fulness of the stomach is experienced, especially after
eating; the bowels are confined usually, but occasionally the movements
are relaxed, bilious in appearance, and cause heat and irritation about
the anus; headache is constantly present to some extent, and there is a
sense of fulness with more or less dizziness, and singing in the ears;
vision is rather blurred, and there is a hebetude of mind; the urine is
high-, high in specific gravity, and deposits lithates
abundantly on cooling.When these symptoms are conjoined with
hemicrania, nausea, and vomiting, the case is called bilious sick
headache, and when diarrhoea supervenes, the discharges apparently
containing much bile, it is bilious diarrhoea.The symptoms which above
all others give the character to the morbid complexus are the muddy
(bilious) complexion, the yellow-coated tongue, the yellow
conjunctivae, and the high- urine.The first departure from the
normal may be scarcely observed.Gradually, owing chiefly to errors of
diet, to climatic changes, or to malarial influences, or to these
several factors combined, the affected person drifts into the condition
of biliousness above described.Besides the general malaise, he
experiences no little despondency, inaptitude for exertion, and indeed
actual weakness.Finally, he is unable to apply himself to business,
relinquishes the effort, and seeks advice.{967} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Those who are accustomed to
experience attacks of biliousness suffer from them at certain intervals
which may be tolerably regular--at intervals of a few days, two, three,
or four weeks--when the cause is uniform; but they may happen very
irregularly when the conditions producing them are variable.The
duration of an attack is from two days to a week or more, according to
the severity of the symptoms and to the character of the measures
instituted for relief.The termination is in a return to the normal
state.If the conditions which produced it continue, when one attack is
ended the preparations for another begin at once, and at length
sufficient derangement of the organs concerned arises to constitute the
morbid complexus of biliousness.TREATMENT.--Prophylaxis has great importance, since the causes of the
malady are to a considerable extent, at least, preventable.Errors of
diet in respect to the use of condiments, fats, meat, pastry, etc.When there is pronounced gastro-duodenal catarrh and acid
fermentation in the duodenum, the saccharine, fatty, and starchy
elements of the food must rather be excluded and lean meats allowed.Abundant exercise, bathing, and an open-air life in general should be
directed.Whenever a malarial infection is causative a change of
climate becomes imperative.Heredity cannot, of course, be excluded,
but the tendency to hepatic derangement can be rendered inoperative by
an abstemious life.The remedial management includes the dietetic as well as the medicinal
treatment.When the distress has reached sufficient proportions to
justify such an extreme measure, the patient should be restricted to a
diet exclusively of skimmed milk, of which he is directed to take a
gill or more every three hours.This serves a double purpose, as
aliment and as a depurative agent, for this considerable quantity of
fluid promotes the urinary excretion and the elimination of waste
products.If the case is not severe enough to allow of such an
expedient, the diet should in any event be restricted to skimmed milk
hot, milk and hot water, hot lemonade, a little chicken or mutton
broth, a bit of dry toast, etc.As a rule, although not so palatable,
hot drinks are more beneficial than cold, but if the preference is
decidedly for cold, they may be allowed.After the more severe symptoms
have subsided a little lean meat broiled may be added, and as the cure
proceeds the succulent vegetables and acid fruits may be permitted.Abstinence from potatoes, hominy, cracked wheat, and oatmeal should be
enjoined during the convalescence of those who suffer from habitual
attacks.Medicines may not be necessary to those who have the resolution to
adhere to skimmed milk for several days or who can abstain from food
altogether for a day.Many experienced sufferers, especially through
the South and West and in England, procure rather prompt relief from a
blue pill of ten to fifteen grains or from one to five grains of
calomel at night, followed by a Seidlitz powder, Rochelle or Epsom
salts, or phosphate of soda on the following morning.Such patients
find that no other treatment is as serviceable.They get relief from
other measures, it is true, but neither as promptly nor as
satisfactorily.It is held by the advocates of this practice that the
mercurial acts on the liver--that the surplus bile is carried off; and
they point to the peculiar stools and to {968} the relief experienced
in evidence of the truth of this theory.Without entering on the
argument, which would occupy too much space, it must suffice here to
state that calomel and blue pill do not increase bile-production,[3]
but they do stimulate the intestinal glands and increase excretion from
them.The peculiar greenish stools produced by these mercurials do not
owe their characteristic appearance to the presence of bile, but rather
to the chemical transformations of the mercury itself and to the waste
products excreted by the intestinal glands.Since the researches of
Rutherford have been published, euonymin has been much prescribed in
cases of biliousness.From three to five grains are taken at the
bed-hour, and a mild laxative in the morning.In the same group of
cholagogues are ipecac, iridin, sanguinarin, and especially
podophyllin; but the serious objection to their use is that they
stimulate the liver when this organ is in an irritable state.As
calomel and blue pill have a sedative rather than a stimulant action on
the liver, they are more useful in biliousness than are the true
cholagogues.It should be borne in mind that one-half of a grain of
calomel will have a distinct purgative action on many persons, and that
one grain will rarely need to be exceeded.[Footnote 3: That calomel, the type of a mercurial purgative, does not
increase the discharge of bile has been demonstrated on dogs by Rohrig
and Rutherford, and confirmed by observation of the effects of 20
grains on Westphalen's case of biliary fistula in man--a case in which,
for a time, all the bile escaped externally, and none apparently
entered the intestine (_Deutsch.Med._, 1873, Band xi.In general, notwithstanding the unquestionable utility of the
mercurial, it is better to relieve cases of biliousness by less
objectionable measures.A saline which acts at the same time on the
intestines and kidneys, as Rochelle salts, is usually effective in
bringing relief.A bottle of solution of magnesia citrate, of Saratoga
water (Congress, Hathorn, or High Rock), and of Blue Lick, the famous
sulphurous laxative of Kentucky, may remove the disorder in mild cases
if at the same time a suitable diet is enjoined.Phosphate of soda in
laxative doses, with or without Vichy water, is also a good remedy, if
somewhat slow.The warm purgatives, rhubarb, colocynth, aloes, etc.,
are useful when there is pronounced constipation.DEFINITION.--By the term lithaemia is meant a condition of the system
in which uric (lithic) acid is produced in excess, and in which certain
derangements occur in consequence of the accumulation of this material
in the blood.Uricaemia was the term first suggested by Flint, Sr.,[4]
to express this state, and subsequently lithaemia was employed by
Murchison.[5] The latter has been more generally accepted.In one of
the most recent and valuable contributions to this subject by
DaCosta[6] lithaemia is the term used to designate the complex of
symptoms produced by uric acid in excess.[Footnote 4: _The Principles and Practice of Medicine_, Philada.,
1882.][Footnote 5: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, 2d ed., p.[Footnote 6: _The Medical News_, vol.PATHOGENY.--The ultimate product of albuminoid substances in the
organism prepared for final excretion is urea.That this substance is
{969} finally formed in the liver, to be excreted by the kidneys, seems
now well established.[7] In acute yellow atrophy of the liver, with the
disappearance of the proper structure of the organs urea ceases to be
produced, and instead leucin and tyrosin are excreted.In certain
states of the system characterized by deficient oxidation urea is not
sufficiently formed, and instead uric acid, a lower grade of oxidation
and a product of the disintegration of albuminoid substances, results.An excess of urates is not always pathological.Their excretion seems
to be in a certain sense a safety-valve function.When albuminoid
matters are taken in excess of the power of the system to convert them,
or when the supply of oxygen to the blood is deficient from any cause,
urea is not formed, but uric acid and urates are abundantly excreted by
the urine.[8] Imperfect digestion of the albuminoids when they are not
taken in relatively too large an amount, and limitation below the
normal of the oxidation process when the supply of oxygen is not
insufficient, will have the same effect: in place of urea, uric acid
and urates will be formed and excreted.One of the early results of the
persistent presence of an excess of uric acid is the production of
lithaemia, the morbid complexus of which this excess is at once the
cause and the proof.[Footnote 7: This proposition is not universally accepted.Valmont
(These de Paris, _Etude sur les Causes des Variations de l'Uree dans
quelques Maladies du Foie_, 1879) has carefully studied the excretion
of urea in several diseases in which the proper structure of the liver
is damaged--in atrophic cirrhosis and in cancer.As in these maladies
not all the secreting portion of the organ is destroyed, the argument
is so far weakened.Patients with
cirrhosis or cancer of the liver who eat little excrete but little
urea.If they eat and do not absorb, or vomit or have diarrhoea, the
result is the same.When they partake largely of nitrogenous aliment
the proportion of urea rapidly increases.In a cachectic or simply
anaemic patient the urea falls, apparently in proportion to the state
of the general nutrition and of the work done by the organic functions.Absolute immobility of the patient seems to have an influence on the
amount of urea excreted.In sclerosis or cancer the quantity of urea
falls rapidly on the occurrence of ascites or oedema, when a notable
quantity of urea is found in the fluid.The digitalis often used in
the treatment also contributed to the loss of urea."If these
conclusions are verified, the formation of urea must depend on some
other function.][Footnote 8: Genevoix, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de
l'Acide urique dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876.]The persons who suffer from lithaemia are usually those who indulge in
the pleasures of the table and habitually consume much meat, pastry,
and highly-seasoned and rich food of all kinds.The idle, luxurious,
and indolent, literary men of sedentary habits, men who have led active
lives, but on retiring from business have continued to indulge in a
full diet, are apt to suffer from this malady.Women are less disposed
to it, but if subjected to the same conditions may also be similarly
affected.Especially do those suffer from lithaemia who indulge in malt
liquors or in alcoholic drinks of any kind.These substances act by
deranging digestion, and thus preventing the proper conversion of the
albuminoids, by inducing congestion of the liver, and also by
interfering with the process of oxidation.SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of lithaemia include derangements of the
digestive organs and of the liver, of the circulation, and of the
nervous system.As these subjects suffer from gastric and
gastro-duodenal catarrh, they present the usual symptomatology of these
affections, as a sense of weight and oppression at the epigastrium,
acidity, pyrosis, a capricious--sometimes voracious, sometimes
good--appetite, a coated {970} tongue, a bitter taste, etc.The bowels
are irregular, sometimes constipated, occasionally relaxed, with
scybalae.The stools may be liquid, almost black or light-yellow and
grayish.The motions are apt to be offensive, and a good deal of
offensive gas is discharged with them.Hemorrhoids are often present,
and there may be heat and irritation about the anus, and not
unfrequently intolerable itching.After meals there is much depression,
and often an insupportable drowsiness.Irregularity in the rhythm, even
intermissions, of the pulse are not infrequent.The nervous symptoms, as DaCosta has lately insisted on, are the most
important and pronounced.The connection between oxaluria and mental
despondency has long been known, but the nature of the relation remains
undetermined.Headache, frontal and occipital, especially the former,
dizziness, tinnitus aurium, suffusion of the eyes, ecchymoses of the
conjunctiva, are usually present.Not unfrequently the subjects of this
affection experience sudden attacks of vertigo, accompanied by dimness
of vision and intense headache, and are supposed to have some organic
lesion of the brain.They are irritable, despondent, and often
intensely hypochondriacal, almost suicidal--are subject to neuralgic
attacks, and have aching in the limbs, a sense of weariness, and more
or less burning in the palms and soles.The skin is rather dry and the complexion muddy.Urticaria is of
frequent occurrence, and sudden attacks of nausea, vomiting, and
intestinal pain coincide with the appearance of the eruption on the
skin.The urine is usually rather increased in amount, its color heightened,
its acidity above normal, and floating in it, usually visible to the
naked eye, are reddish masses composed of uric acid.More or less pain
in the back, referable to the situation of the kidneys, and sometimes
extending along the course of the ureters, is common.The bladder is
rather irritable, and the passage of the urine produces heat and
scalding.The testicles are apt to feel sore and are somewhat
retracted.On standing, the urine may deposit uric acid and the urates
copiously, or the acid may be seen to form a cloud which slowly
subsides.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course and duration of
lithaemia are much influenced by the habits of life of the person
affected.When unopposed by treatment and no change is made in the
conditions producing it, a gradual increase in the various disturbances
takes place.After a time structural changes occur in the liver; the
organs of circulation early undergo atheromatous degeneration; various
cerebral disorders due to degenerative changes arise; and acute
intercurrent affections may terminate life.Amongst the secondary
maladies due to lithaemia are gout, diabetes, renal calculi, and
nephritic colic.If the cases are subjected to appropriate treatment,
curative results may be certainly obtained.The prognosis, then, will
be influenced materially by the moral strength of the patient.If he is
one who can surrender his appetites and live abstemiously, a cure may
be promised.The case is far different with those who will continue the
use of malt, vinous, or alcoholic drinks, and will persist in indulging
in the pleasures of the table.DIAGNOSIS.--The differentiation of lithaemia from other affections
offers no special difficulties.From gastro-duodenal catarrh it is
separated by the {971} excess of uric acid in the urine only, the other
symptoms being for the most part the same.The cerebral symptoms--the
vertigo, headache, etc.--are to be distinguished from the same due to
actual disease of the brain by the previous history, by the absence of
changes seen on ophthalmoscopic examination and of other signs of brain
disease, and by the subsequent behavior.Cases of cerebral mischief
producing such effects would rapidly develop into serious states,
whereas in lithaemia there are great fluctuations, but no apparent
progress in many months.In lithaemia also there are no changes in the
fundus oculi, whereas in brain diseases choked disk, hemorrhage into
the retina, white atrophy, etc.Further, in
lithaemia there are no disorders of sensibility, of motility, or of
intellection, whilst these are ordinary evidences of cerebral mischief.TREATMENT.--Attention to diet is of the first importance.As uric acid
is an intermediate product in the metamorphosis of albumen, it might be
supposed that to diminish the quantity of this constituent of the food
would be sufficient.In some cases this suffices, but usually attention
must be given to the peculiarities of digestion characteristic of each
patient.More frequently trouble arises from indulgence in the starchy
and saccharine constituents of the diet; in some a very considerable
gastro-duodenal catarrh exists, and the mucus, acting as a ferment,
sets up an acetic fermentation in the starchy and saccharine
substances, with the necessary production of much carbonic acid gas.If
the fats disagree, the butyric fermentation also takes place, and very
irritating fat acids result.In these cases there is usually much gas
formed in the stomach and intestine, and an immediate ratio appears to
exist between the degree of mental despondency and the quantity of gas
in the intestinal canal.It follows, then, that in cases of lithaemia
the saccharine, starchy, and fatty constituents of an ordinary diet
should be omitted from the food of such subjects.Bread should be
partaken of very sparingly, and the foods containing starch, sugar, and
oil ought not to be partaken of at all.The succulent vegetables, as
lettuce, spinach, celery, cole-slaw, tomatoes, etc., ought to be
substituted.Lean fresh meats, poultry, game (plainly cooked), fresh
fish, oysters, eggs, etc.On
the other hand, there may be those who do better on a diet of
vegetables and fruit, excluding meat.In such we may suppose the fault
lies in the stomach digestion, where the albuminoids are converted into
peptones, the intestinal digestion being active and normal.All kinds
of wine and malt liquors should be prohibited.Coffee and tea must also
be relinquished.Without the carefully-regulated diet medicines can
accomplish but little; hence he who would obtain curative results must
give careful attention to every dietetic detail.As deficient oxidation is an important factor in developing lithaemia,
active exercise must be enjoined.The amount of exercise must be
determined by the condition of the individual and the time, regulated
as far as may be by the period after meals.As when the food prepared
for assimilation is entering the circulation oxygen is needed to
perfect the final changes, it seems clear that exercise should be taken
three or four hours after the process of digestion has begun.Walking
exercise is better than any other for this purpose, but it should not
be carried to the point of exhaustion from fatigue.Sea-air and
sea-bathing are oxidizing agents of considerable value, and are
especially useful to the {972} subjects of lithaemia suffering at the
same time from malarial infection.Medicines are administered with the view to accomplish two purposes: to
correct the disorders of digestion, to promote oxidation.One of the
most useful remedies is nitric acid, five to ten minims of the official
diluted acid being given before meals.It is more especially effective
when there is an excessive production of acid.The fermentation which
produces acid and the diffusion of acid-forming materials from the
blood are alike prevented by it.The injunction to administer it before
meals must be borne in mind when these purposes are to be subserved.Nitric acid, as well as the other mineral acids, but in a greater
degree, promotes the flow of bile.This well-known clinical fact has
been confirmed by experiments.Under the use of nitric acid, as above
advised, uric acid and the urates disappear from the urine, being
excreted as urea, and hence this remedy accomplishes both of the
objects for which medicines are administered in this disorder.No other
mineral acid can fill its place in this connection.Alkalies possess very decidedly the power to promote oxidation.The
soda salts are objectionable, for, combining with uric acid, they form
the insoluble urate of soda.The salts of potash and lithium, on the
other hand, form soluble combinations, and they also increase
elimination.Much depends on the time at which they are administered,
as Bence Jones,[9] and since Ralfe[10] especially, has shown.To
increase the alkalinity of the blood and urine, they must be taken
after meals, for then the acid materials of digestion are pouring into
the blood.For the same reason, if alkalies are administered to
neutralize the acidity of the intestinal canal, they must be given
after meals.The most useful alkaline remedies are liquor potassae,
bicarbonate of potash, Rochelle salts, citrate of lithium, etc.The
effervescing preparations of potash and of lithium are elegant and
palatable forms in which to administer these remedies.They may also be
taken dissolved in Vichy water, in our Saratoga Vichy, or in Carlsbad
or Bethesda.When the use of mineral waters is not contraindicated in
the state of the digestive organs, great good is accomplished by the
persistent use of Vichy, foreign or domestic, of Carlsbad, and the
alkaline waters of Wisconsin.[Footnote 9: _Lectures on Pathology and Therapeutics_, by H. Bence
Jones, London, pp.[Footnote 10: _Physiological Chemistry_, by Charles Henry Ralfe,
London, 1883.]The so-called cholagogues are unquestionably useful, but they become
less and less necessary according to the success achieved in the
dietetic course.Phosphate of soda is one of the most effective of this
group of medicines.As it acts as a compound, and not as a salt of soda
merely, it does not come within the prohibition against the use of soda
salts.It promotes the flow of bile and appears to remove the catarrhal
state of the mucous membrane.A teaspoonful three times a day is the
quantity usually required.Under some circumstances it may be
advantageously combined with arseniate of soda.Mercurials were
formerly almost universally used, but they have been largely supplanted
by podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, etc., and by the phosphate of soda
above mentioned.Podophyllin is indicated when constipation is a
symptom.An efficient mode of giving it is in the form of granules, but
it must be continued without intermission for some time or during the
existence of {973} the lithaemia.The quantity given should be
sufficient to maintain the evacuations in a soluble state.Good results
are obtained from a combination of podophyllin with extracts of
physostigma, nux vomica, and belladonna.When distinct torpor of the
liver without constipation exists, euonymin, combined with physostigma,
may be advantageously used.For the vertigo and hypochondriasis no
remedy is more beneficial than arsenic (Fowler's solution) in small
doses kept up for some time, and it is also distinctly curative of the
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane.When malarial infection is the
cause of lithaemia, quinine becomes indispensable.Topical agents in some cases render important aid to the other curative
measures.A daily sponge-bath, the water made more stimulating by the
addition of sea-salt, is very useful in the absence of sea-bathing.Friction of the hepatic region with the official ointment of the red
iodide of mercury unquestionably stimulates the hepatic functions.General faradization and faradic and galvanic excitation of the
chylopoietic system promotes activity of the digestive apparatus and of
the organic functions in general.Hepatic Glycosuria (Temporary).DEFINITION.--By the term hepatic glycosuria in this connection is meant
a temporary glycosuria due to excessive formation of glycogen.The
liver, unduly stimulated, produces more glycogen than can be disposed
of, and hence it is excreted by the kidneys as grape-sugar.PATHOGENY.--In the normal condition it is supposed that the glycogen
produced by the liver is converted into grape-sugar, and soon oxidized
and thus consumed.One theory of diabetes maintained that in some way
the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar was excessive and beyond
the oxidizing power of the blood, and hence this substance was
discharged in the urine.The recent discovery by Pavy[11] of glycogen
in considerable amount in the blood of all parts of the body renders it
certain that there are peculiar conditions necessary to the formation
of grape-sugar in sufficient quantity to constitute diabetes.It is
tolerably certain that an excess of acid in the intestinal canal,
diminishing thus the alkalinity of the blood, will have as a symptom
sugar in the urine.Persons disposed to the accumulation of fat, and
eating freely of sugar and starchy food, are apt to have intestinal
indigestion, and the acid produced by the fermentation of these
substances will, after its absorption, hinder the conversion of any
food-sugar.In such subjects also there may be an increased conversion
of the glycogen of the blood into sugar under the same conditions.Such
a glycosuria must necessarily be temporary and a purely functional
disorder.[Footnote 11: _The Lancet_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--The subjects of the malady under consideration are of full
habit, even obese.They habitually consume considerable quantities of
malt liquors and a diet composed largely of the starchy and saccharine
foods.If not in malt liquors, they at least indulge freely in bread,
potatoes, pastry, cakes--in all forms of farinaceous food, fats, and
sweets.They have a keen appetite, eat largely, and drink freely of
fluids.As {974} a rule, these subjects are but little disposed to
physical exercise and lead rather sedentary lives.Indulgence in such a
mode of life tends to increase the accumulation of fat, weakens the
muscles, and with them the heart-muscle, and slowly induces a
gastro-intestinal catarrh accompanied by stomachal and intestinal
indigestion.At first, heaviness, oppression, and drowsiness after
meals are experienced; then acidity, pyrosis, and eructations follow;
and ultimately the evidences of intestinal indigestion--flatulence,
pain, irregular and unhealthy evacuations, etc.--come on.Meanwhile,
the appetite is not usually impaired, and the disposition to drink
fluids increases; the amount of urine voided is greater, and to rise
during the night for the purpose of emptying the bladder comes to be a
fixed habit.The urine under these circumstances is copious,
high-, acid, and deposits on cooling abundantly of uric acid and
urates.The amount passed in twenty-four hours will reach sixty,
eighty, or more ounces, and the specific gravity will range from 1025
to 1035.On testing in the usual way, traces of sugar, more or less
distinct, will appear,[12] but not constantly, and hence repeated
examinations are necessary to determine the quantity.As a rule, the
evidence of the presence of sugar in small amount is satisfactory.[Footnote 12: In testing for sugar, when the urine contains the urates
in such abundance there is danger of error.In using Trommer's,
Fehling's, or Moore's test, on heating, the urates will effect a
reduction of the copper or bismuth.It is necessary, therefore, to
separate them before applying the test.This is accomplished as
follows: The urine is evaporated to dryness on a water-bath; the sugar
in the evaporated residue is dissolved out by absolute alcohol, and
then an aqueous solution is prepared, to which the test is applied.An
experienced operator will not need to take such precautions, for,
familiar with the reactions, he can readily judge of the results.]Various affections of the skin appear in the subjects of this malady,
and urticaria, prurigo, eczema, and boils are the forms most usual.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Slow in developing, this temporary
glycosuria is also slow in its course.It remains nearly stationary for
months, even years.Meanwhile the degenerative changes associated with
it slowly develop on all sides.The quantity of sugar does not greatly
increase, for its amount, being apparently dependent on the quantity of
acid entering the blood from the intestinal canal, must continue nearly
at the same standard.It is comparatively rare for true diabetes to
develop out of this state, although such a termination must be regarded
as a natural outcome.One reason, it may be, why such a conclusion is
not often reached is because of intercurrent maladies.It is an
important fact that acute serous--less often
parenchymatous--inflammations are very apt to occur during the
existence of even temporary glycosuria.Under appropriate management
this disorder is readily amenable to treatment.Hence the prognosis
will be favorable or not according to the skill exhibited in its
treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--This malady offers no special difficulty in diagnosis.From
gastro-duodenal catarrh and from lithaemia it is distinguished by the
saccharine condition of the urine.From diabetes it is separated by the
rate of progress, by the protracted duration of the case without any
distinct advance, and by the temporary and fugitive character of the
glycosuria.TREATMENT.--To carefully regulate the diet is the first consideration.The traces of sugar and the excess of urates rapidly disappear when the
{975} starches, sugar, and fats are withdrawn from the diet.Indeed,
the rule as to alimentation must be as rigidly enforced as in true
diabetes, but after the gastro-intestinal catarrh has subsided the
ordinary mixed diet--that before the disturbance began--may be returned
to gradually.Active exercise must be enjoined under the same
conditions and for the same purpose as in the treatment of lithaemia.In these obese subjects, unaccustomed to movement, exercise must be
cautiously undertaken; beginning with short excursions, it must be
gradually increased.Horseback riding is an excellent expedient, but
should not take the place of walking.The merely medical measures have a twofold direction: to remove the
gastro-duodenal catarrh; to promote oxidation of the sugar in the blood
or prevent the conversion of glycogen into grape-sugar.Vichy water,
the potash salts, and alkalies generally serve to accomplish the
latter, and phosphate and arseniate of soda, tinctures of nux vomica,
and of physostigma, bismuth, and carbolic acid, relieve the former.Small doses of Fowler's solution (two drops ter in die), and a minim
three times a day of a mixture in equal parts of tincture of iodine and
carbolic acid, are effective remedies in gastro-duodenal catarrh.DEFINITION.--The term jaundice has its origin in the French word jaune,
yellow.Icterus, which has come to be a more technical word, is of
uncertain Greek origin, and is much employed by French writers as
ictere.The common German name is Gelbsucht, a highly expressive
designation.Jaundice signifies a yellow discoloration of the skin
caused by the presence of bile.As a symptom it will receive much consideration in the pages to follow,
but there is also a functional disorder--a jaundice due to a
disturbance in the biliary functions, without evidences of structural
change--which must be discussed here.This preliminary statement of our
present knowledge of jaundice will facilitate the comprehension of it
as a symptom, and will render unnecessary explanations that will be
merely a repetition of previous ones.CAUSES.--The theories of the causation of jaundice may be reduced to
three: 1, that it is due to a disorganization of the blood in which the
coloring matter is set free, and hence is known as haematogenous; 2,
that the materials of the bile, which it is the office of the liver to
remove from the blood, are not so disposed of; 3, that the bile, after
being formed by the liver, is absorbed into the blood because of an
obstacle to its escape, and hence this is called hepatogenous jaundice.The modern view of haematogenous jaundice had its origin in the
supposed discovery of the identity of haematoidin with bilirubin.If
the pigment of the blood has the same composition as the pigment of the
bile, haematogenous jaundice will be produced whenever haematoidin is
set free in the blood.Virchow[13] was the first investigator to show
the close resemblance between these two pigments.Since his observation
was made an identity of haematoidin and bilirubin has been maintained
by Zenker, Valentiner, Kuhne, and others, and as strenuously denied by
{976} Stadeler, Preyer, Young, and others.At the present time it
appears to be established that although the blood- and bile-pigments
are closely related, they are not identical.[14] Nevertheless, a
haematogenous jaundice is still admitted to exist by Leyden,[15]
Immermann,[16] Gubler,[17] Ponfick,[18] and some others.The existence
or non-existence of this form of jaundice is, however, of little
importance in this connection, since, if it ever occur, the malady of
which it is a symptom is not an affection of the liver, but of the
blood, as phosphorus-poisoning, pyaemia, etc.[Footnote 13: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band i. p.[Footnote 14: Legg, J. Wickham, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, p.[Footnote 15: _Beitrage zur Pathologie des Icterus_, Berlin, 1866, p.[Footnote 17: _Union medicale_, 1857, p.[Footnote 18: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.The second theory, that the bile is preformed in the blood and
separated by the liver, and that jaundice results because of the
failure of the liver to perform this office, is no longer entertained,
although largely held down to within a very recent period.As the bile
acids and bile-pigments are not to be found in the blood, chemistry
lends no support to the theory of jaundice by suppression of the
hepatic function.As they do not exist in the blood and are found in
the secretion of the liver, there can be no other view held than that
they are formed by this organ.[19]

[Footnote 19: The old doctrine of jaundice by suppression, which has
always been maintained by Harley (_On Jaundice_, London, 1863, p.20
_et seq._), has been again restated and strongly advocated by him in
his treatise on _The Diseases of the Liver_, p.83, which was issued in
1883.In the two following postulates he formulates his view:

"1.The biliary secretion can be actually retarded, and even totally
arrested, without alteration of hepatic tissue.When the liver strikes work and secretes no bile, the animal body
becomes jaundiced as a direct consequence thereof."This view, he affirms, "can be made comparatively easy of absolute
proof."The evidence on which he chiefly relies is exceedingly fallacious.It
rests on two facts: the existence of a case of jaundice in which the
ducts and gall-bladder contain no bile, but only ordinary mucus; the
appearances presented by a liver in a case of jaundice due to
obstruction of the common duct.The evidence afforded by the former is
entirely fallacious, because in an old case of jaundice with catarrh of
the bile-ducts such changes take place in the bile that it loses all of
its distinctive characteristics.This may be seen in an ancient example
of obstruction of the cystic duct, where the bile which the
gall-bladder contained is ultimately transformed into a whitish or
colorless mucus.The changes which occur in the so-called cysts of the
arachnoid are comparable, and exhibit the entire transformation of
blood-pigment, which is closely allied to bile-pigment.]The third theory of jaundice--that which refers the disease to an
absorption of the bile into the blood after it has been formed by the
liver--is the one now most generally held, and, indeed, as one of the
causes is universally held.The bile is absorbed into the blood because
an obstacle to its passage by the bile-ducts exists at some point in
their course.This is the principal, but not the only, cause of
absorption.When the pressure in the vessels falls below that in the
ducts, bile will pass toward and into the vessels.Again, it sometimes
happens that a considerable part of the bile discharged into the
intestines is reabsorbed unchanged, and enters the portal vein and the
general circulation, thus causing jaundice.The disturbances of the liver causing jaundice are various.It
sometimes occurs without cause, and the first intimation of it is the
peculiar tint of the skin.It is certainly true that powerful emotions
are causative; thus, a violent anger has brought on an attack.In such
a case we must suppose a depression of the vaso-motor system, and such
a lowering of the blood-pressure as to favor the passage of bile into
the {977} veins rather than into the bile-ducts.Thus, it has been
abundantly shown that a slight difference in pressure will divert the
bile in either direction.Heidenhain[20] has demonstrated that the bile
passes in the direction of least resistance, and in the case of the
considerable vaso-motor depression caused by extreme emotion the least
resistance is in the direction of the vessels.More frequently than
moral emotion is catarrh of the bile-ducts.It is not necessary for the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane to close the ducts to have
the bile pass into the veins; such a degree of swelling as to make the
passage of the bile somewhat difficult suffices.A simple hyperaemia of
the mucous membrane may cause sufficient obstruction of the bile-ducts
to give rise to jaundice.Gastro-intestinal catarrh plays an important
part in the production of simple jaundice.Frerichs[21] ascertained
that of 41 cases, gastro-duodenal catarrh existed in 34.Ponfick[22]
considers catarrh of the ducts the principal factor.In fact, at the
present time there is but one dissenting voice on this point.[23]

[Footnote 20: Quoted by Legg, _supra_, p.[Footnote 21: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 22: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 23: Harley, _Diseases of the Liver_, 1883, p.440 _et seq._]

Gastro-duodenal catarrh extends by contiguity of tissue to the mucous
lining of the bile-ducts.The catarrhal state of the mucous membrane is
produced by errors of diet, acid indigestion, indulgence in condiments,
wines, and rich foods in general.Climatic changes, malarial infection,
exposure to cold and dampness, etc.are indirectly causative of
jaundice through the intermediation of gastro-duodenal catarrh.Formerly, obstruction of the gall-ducts was supposed to be caused
sometimes by a spasmodic contraction of the organic muscular fibre
assumed to exist in the walls of the ducts.Although the presence of
these muscular elements has been denied, Heidenhain has lately,
apparently, demonstrated them.Audige has made observations
confirmatory of those of Heidenhain, and Dujardin-Beaumetz[24] has
verified the statements of Audige.It seems, therefore, in a high
degree probable that organic muscular elements exist in the walls of
the hepatic ducts, and that spasmodic icterus may therefore occur.SYMPTOMS.--Simple icterus may exist without any other obvious symptoms
than the yellow discoloration of the skin.In most cases, however, the
yellowness is preceded for a week or more by the symptoms of a
gastro-intestinal catarrh, or these symptoms accompany the jaundice.There is much mental depression and a general malaise is experienced.Headache, mental hebetude, a total loss of appetite, a furred tongue,
and a bitter taste, nausea and sometimes vomiting, constipation or
diarrhoea, precede or accompany the jaundice.When these symptoms
precede for some time the appearance of yellowness, it is probable that
the biliary derangement is secondary to the gastro-duodenal catarrh,
but when they occur with the jaundice it is probable that they are due
to the absence of bile from the intestine.The yellowness first appears in the conjunctiva for a day or two before
the skin is tinted, and within forty-eight hours after the flow of bile
into the intestine has ceased.The face next becomes yellow, then the
body, {978} and afterward the limbs, but in some cases the limbs remain
free from discoloration.The lips do not exhibit any change of color,
but the roof of the mouth, the palate, and the mucous membrane under
the tongue are yellow.The saliva does not, as a rule, contain
bile-pigment or exhibit any changes of color unless mercurial
salivation is caused, when it becomes greenish in color and has a
bitter taste.[25] A yellow tint of the sweat, especially under the
arm-pits, is common.The milk very often contains bile-pigment or is
changed in color in some way.[Footnote 25: Legg, _On the Bile, etc._, _supra_.]The feces are colorless or have a grayish or clay- tint, and are
semi-solid, although sometimes hard and dry.In simple jaundice
diarrhoea is very often present.There may be considerable flatulence,
and more or less pain in consequence about the umbilicus, and the gas
when discharged is very offensive.The stools also, in some cases, have
an odor of decomposition, and if carefully examined particles of food,
undigested and decomposing, will be found.The feces may have a
parti-<DW52> appearance--part whitish or grayish or clay-, and
part of a normal color.The obstruction to the flow of bile may be in a part, and indeed in a
small part comparatively, of the liver, and hence there may be
sufficient bile flow down to color the feces to a greater or less
extent.But a small amount of bile-pigment in the blood suffices to
tint the whole surface of the body.The urine may exhibit changes in appearance before the conjunctiva
becomes yellow.It is  in all possible degrees, from a merely
high normal hue to a deep brownish almost black tint.It may be deep
red and clear like dark brandy or brown like porter, and thick with
urates.Usually, the urine of jaundice deposits abundantly of urates,
but this fact is more especially true of those patients retaining
appetite or having a voracious appetite and indulging in a full diet
without restraint.The reaction of the urine is acid, and the specific
gravity does not often descend below 1010, and may be 1030.The amount
passed in twenty-four hours varies, but does not differ materially from
the normal.Toward the termination of some fatal cases the quantity of
urine has greatly diminished, and in a few instances was suppressed,
but in such examples other factors than hepatic disease were concerned.More or less albumen is nearly constantly present in the urine of
jaundice, but the detection of a trace is very difficult when the
urine, as is so often the case, is cloudy.The urine should be
carefully filtered before applying the test, and a specimen for
comparison should be placed alongside of that being examined.If on
boiling no haze appears, it may be developed by dropping in some nitric
acid.The nitric-acid test, so often employed by allowing some drops of
urine to trickle down the test-tube and observing the reaction at the
point of contact, is, in the writer's experience, very fallacious.The
source of the albumen in jaundiced urine is obviously the
blood-globules.As Von Dusch first demonstrated, and Kuhne[26]
afterward clearly confirmed, the bile acids dissolve the red
corpuscles.As the quantity of albumen in the urine is small, it is
reasonable to conclude, as suggested by Legg, that the bile acids are
not present in the blood in any considerable amount.[Footnote 26: _Archiv fur path.When any large quantity of bile is contained in the urine, its
detection is not difficult.A strip of muslin dipped in the urine will
be stained, and the underclothing of the patient will have the
yellowish spots {979} caused by bile.Gmelin's test is the most
convenient.This is applied as follows: Some nitric acid containing
nitrous--which is the case of the ordinary commercial article--is put
into a test-tube, and some of the suspected urine is allowed to trickle
down the side of the tube to come in contact, but not mix, with the
acid.At the point of contact, when the urine contains bile-pigment,
first a zone of green, then blue, violet, and finally red color,
develops.As this play of colors takes place on the instant, the
attention must be sharply fixed to see the changes.Rosenbach[27]
suggests this test be applied by filtering some urine containing bile
through filtering-paper and touching the paper with a drop of nitric
acid.The result is, a green circle forms at the point of contact.The
usual mode of applying Gmelin's test is to place on the bottom of a
common white plate or on a porcelain dish a thin film of the urine, and
carefully bring in contact with it a thin film of nitric acid.The
color reaction mentioned above takes place at the margin of contact.[Footnote 27: _Centralblatt fur die medicin Wissenschaft_, 1876, p.Besides the presence of bile and albumen, and some fatty epithelium
from the tubules, there is no material change in the composition of the
urine.At one time it was supposed that the amount of urea was greatly
lessened, but later and more accurate investigations have shown that
this excretion is in greater or less quantity according to the food
taken, and bears no relation to the jaundice.On the other hand,
Genevoix[28] maintains that the quantity of urea is increased in
spasmodic icterus, and in the same ratio the uric acid declines.As
regards the chlorides and other salts, there seems to be a tolerably
constant ratio in their variations with the changes of quantity of urea
and uric acid--are therefore nearly related to the amount of food
taken.[Footnote 28: _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree et de l'Acide urique
dans les Maladies du Foie_, Paris, 1876, p.59 _et seq._]

As regards the condition of the liver, there is no apparent change.In
topography, in the area of hepatic dulness, and in the dimensions of
the right hypochondrium the local condition does not deviate from the
normal in simple jaundice.There may be more or less tenderness over
the epigastrium and along the inferior margin of the liver, but there
is rarely any actual pain.The circulation of bile in the blood and the action of the bile acids
on the red corpuscles must have an influence on the functions of
various organs.In some cases of jaundice, but by no means in all, the
pulse is slow, in a few instances descending as low as 40 per minute,
and, according to Frerichs,[29] as low as 21 per minute.Usually, the
pulse-rate is not lower than 60.To observe the slowing of the heart
the patient must be recumbent, for the pulse rises to the normal or
above on assuming the erect posture and moving about.The occurrence of
fever also prevents the depression of the circulation.The slowing of
the heart is found to be due to the action of the bile acids on the
cardiac ganglia.The other elements of the bile were ascertained to
have no influence on the circulation.As the heart may be slowed by an
increase of inhibition through stimulation of the vagi or by a
paralyzing action on the cardiac muscle, it was necessary to eliminate
these effects to establish the influence of the bile acids on the
ganglia.By exclusion, and by ascertaining the effects {980} of the
bile acids on a properly prepared Stannius heart, Steiner and Legg have
succeeded in demonstrating this important point.[30]

[Footnote 29: _Diseases of the Liver_, Syd.[Footnote 30: _Archiv f. Anat.u. Physiol._, 1874, p.474; Legg, _On
the Bile, etc._, _loc.cit._]

The temperature of jaundice is normal usually, sometimes below.When a
febrile affection occurs during the course of jaundice, the rise of
temperature belonging to it is prevented in considerable part,
sometimes entirely.The depression of temperature is referred by Legg
to the lessened activity of the hepatic functions; but it seems to the
writer more satisfactory to refer it to the action of the bile acids on
the red corpuscles, the conveyors of oxygen.Rohrig[31] has shown
experimentally that the injection of bile acids has this effect on the
temperature of animals.[Footnote 31: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1863, p.The nutrition of the body early suffers in jaundice; more or less loss
of flesh soon occurs, and debility and languor are experienced.There
are several factors concerned in this result.The diversion of the bile
from the intestine interferes in the digestion of certain materials;
when jaundice occurs, glycogen ceases to be formed--and this substance
has an important office in nutrition and force-evolution--and the
injury done to the red blood-globules interferes with oxidation
processes.The functions of the nervous system are variously disturbed in
jaundice.Headache, frontal, occipital, or general, is present in most
cases to a greater or less extent.Hebetude of mind and despondency are
nearly if not quite invariable, although it is not unusual to see men
with jaundice engaged in their ordinary avocations.More or less wakefulness at night, or sleep with
disturbing dreams, not unfrequently coincide with drowsiness during the
waking moments.In severe cases of icterus dependent on structural
changes the cholaemia may produce stupor, delirium, convulsions, etc.,
but such formidable symptoms do not belong to the simple and merely
functional jaundice.Vision is sometimes  yellow, or, rather, white objects appear
yellow, but this must be a rare symptom, since Frerichs never met with
an example.Murchison[32] narrates a case, and the writer has seen one.It is a fugitive symptom, rarely continuing longer than two or three
days.The term xanthopsy has been applied to it.[Footnote 32: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, New York,
1877, p.A nervous symptom of common occurrence is pruritus of the skin.This
may be so severe as to prevent sleep, and in any case is a disagreeable
and persistent affection, always worse at night.It may appear before
the jaundice so long a period as ten days, as in a case mentioned by
Graves,[33] and two months in a case narrated by Flint.[34] It is most
severe at the beginning of the jaundice, and usually disappears before
the jaundice ceases, but it may continue to the end.It is not limited
to any particular part of the body.Pruritus is sometimes accompanied
by urticaria, and the irritation caused by the friction of the skin may
set up an eczema.Occasionally boils, and more rarely carbuncles,
appear during the course of jaundice.Another curious affection of the
skin which occurs during chronic jaundice is xanthelasma or
vitiligoidea.First mentioned by Rayer, this disease was afterward well
described by Addison and Gull[35] under the name vitiligoidea, and they
recognized two varieties, v. plana and v. tuberosa.The plane variety
is found on the {981} mucous membrane of the mouth, the eyelids, the
palms of the hands, and the flexures of the joints, and consists of a
yellowish-white soft eruption slightly raised above the surrounding
skin and varying in size from a pin's point to a dime in size.The
color is described as like that of a dead leaf or chamois-skin.The
tuberose variety consists of small tubercles from a millet-seed to a
pea in size.They have a yellowish color, are tense and shining, and
are placed on the ears, neck, knuckles, elbows, knees, and other parts.Whilst the plane variety gives little if any uneasiness, the tuberose
is apt to become irritated and painful.From the pathological point of
view this eruption consists of proliferating connective-tissue
corpuscles, some of which have undergone fatty degeneration.[36] The
morbid process tends to occur symmetrically, as on the eyelids, to
which it may be confined, but it usually develops in patches, and may
indeed extend over the whole body, when it is called xanthelasma
multiplex.[Footnote 33: _Clinical Lectures on the Practice of Medicine_, 2d ed.,
by Neligan, p.[Footnote 35: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1851, p.[Footnote 36: Waldeyer, _Archiv fur path.The disorganization of the blood caused by jaundice sets up a
hemorrhagic diathesis.This result, however, is not usual in simple
jaundice, but belongs rather to acute yellow atrophy, sclerosis, and
other chronic affections of the liver.It will therefore be more
appropriately considered in connection with those maladies.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--When jaundice is a symptom merely,
it pursues a course determined by the peculiarities of the disease.The
duration of simple jaundice varies from one to four weeks, the average
being about three weeks.If it continues longer than two months,
suspicions may well be entertained that the case is of a more
formidable character than simple jaundice.The termination of this form
of the disease is always in health.A favorable prognosis can be given
only in the case of an accurate diagnosis.Those cases may terminate
more speedily which, being of malarial origin, are treated by efficient
doses of quinine.If delirium and coma come on, the apparently mild
case means, probably, acute yellow atrophy, which cannot at the onset
be distinguished from simple jaundice.If any nervous symptoms occur or
if hemorrhage appears, the case will prove to be serious.A rise of
temperature usually indicates mischief.When the stools begin to
exhibit the normal appearance from the presence of bile, a satisfactory
termination of the case may be soon expected.The yellowness of the
skin disappears slowly after the natural route of the bile has been
restored, and the urine is the last to lose the pigment, as it was the
first to exhibit its presence.DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of jaundice as a symptom is usually easy.It
should be remembered that jaundice cannot be detected at night by any
ordinary light, and when it is disappearing the tint varies, now being
distinct, again absent.Mental emotion when the color is fading
develops it.Browning by the sun's rays causes an appearance which
might be mistaken by a superficial observer for jaundice, but it is
only necessary to look at the parts protected and at the urine to
discover the true state of the case.The detection of bile in the urine
and the ocular evidence of its absence from the stools will be
conclusive.In some cases of jaundice the stools are golden yellow, and
in many instances they are offensive.{982} It is important to mark out the limits of the gall-bladder, if it
is of sufficient size to do so, for any accumulation of bile in this
sac signifies an obstruction of the ductus communis choledochus.If the
jaundice has come on after the symptoms of gastro-duodenal catarrh, is
recent, continues but two or three weeks, and then subsides without any
nervous symptoms or hemorrhage, it is a case of simple jaundice,
probably due to catarrh or spasm of the bile-ducts.If the jaundice be
preceded by attacks of severe pain, nausea, and vomiting, and
disappears after a week or two, the case is one of hepatic calculi.If
the jaundice persists months after such an attack of acute pain, and
does not disappear after a year or more, it is probably due to an
impacted calculus.The other diagnostic relations of jaundice are more
properly considered in connection with the malady of which jaundice is
a symptom.TREATMENT.--For jaundice the symptom the treatment is included in that
of the disease.Here the treatment of simple jaundice, the functional
disorder, is to be discussed.If there is much nausea, the tongue is
heavily coated, and, especially if the seizure has followed dietetic
excesses, an emetic of ipecac may be highly serviceable.Recent
experiments have proved the accuracy of the clinical observations which
recognized the cholagogue property of ipecac, and hence the emetic
effect of this remedy is aided by its power to promote the discharge of
bile.Emetics are of course contraindicated when jaundice is due to an
impacted calculus, to malignant disease, to echinococci or other kinds
of tumor.If there is much irritability of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, as shown in vomiting and diarrhoea, small doses of calomel
(1/12 to 1/4 grain) three or four times a day are highly useful.If
calomel possessed the property ascribed to it of stimulating the liver,
it would be injurious; it is beneficial here because it has a sedative
effect at first, followed, when a sufficient amount has accumulated, by
an eliminant action.Such hepatic stimulants as euonymin, sanguinarin,
podophyllin, jalap, colocynth, rhubarb, etc.have long been used in
cases of jaundice with the view that the liver is torpid and needs
stimulating.It may be inquired, however, If the bile already formed
has no outlet by the proper route, what utility can there be in making
the organ produce more?The true reason for the administration of such
remedies in any case of obstructive jaundice is to cause such downward
pressure as to force out of the duct an obstructing plug of mucus.The
writer has known this result to be accomplished by a dose of compound
jalap powder when a great variety of remedies had been employed in
vain.One of the most efficient remedies--in the writer's considerable
experience the most efficient--is phosphate of sodium, of which a
drachm or more is administered three times a day.This remedy liquefies
mucous plugs and promotes the flow of bile without harshly and rudely
forcing the biliary secretion, and it also has a marked curative effect
in gastro-duodenal catarrh.It may be given advantageously with
arseniate of soda--the latter in dose of 1/20 grain--and dissolved in a
tumblerful of Vichy water or Saratoga Vichy water, or preferably in a
wineglassful of hot water.Free use of alkaline and laxative mineral
waters is desirable, for a double purpose--to act on the liver and on
intestinal digestion, and to promote the excretion of biliary matters
by the kidneys.In this country we have a number to select from--the
Saratoga, Bethesda, Michigan, and others.Certain sulphurous waters,
{983} as the Blue Lick of Kentucky, are highly useful in the more
chronic cases.Sulphur baths may be conjoined to the internal
administration of the waters.Nitric and nitro-muriatic acids have long been celebrated for their
good effects in jaundice.It is the presence of the acid chyme in the
duodenum which excites the normal flow of bile, and Bernard found that
applying acid to the orifice of the common duct in the intestine has
the same effect.There is then a rational reason for the administration
of this remedy.A nitro-muriatic bath, both local and general, was
formerly more used than now.Its utility is questionable, and the
difficulties in the way of applying it great.Recently, Gerhardt[37] has proposed to faradize the gall-bladder, and
by compression with the fingers to empty it, forcing the bile into the
intestine, and thus clearing out obstructions.This seems to be very
questionable if not dangerous practice, but repeated successes will
justify it.[Footnote 37: _Sammlung klinische Vortrage_, Volkmann, p.Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Fats, starches, and
sweets cannot be well digested when no bile enters the small intestine,
where they undergo conversion.These substances fermenting, much acid
results, and hence if a catarrh exist it is increased.An exclusive
diet of skimmed milk, kept up for two weeks or as long as possible, is
the best mode of alimentation for this part of the treatment.Afterward, the diet should be composed of milk, meat-broth, lemonade,
and subsequently of the succulent vegetables, acid fruits, and fresh
meat.Indulgence in malt liquors, wines, and spirits should be strictly
prohibited.Daniel moved to the hallway.A new method of treating jaundice has been lately proposed by
Krull,[38] which has the merit that no injury is done by it if no good
is accomplished.It consists in injecting into the rectum from two to
four pints of water at 60 degrees F., which is retained as long as
possible.Each time the injection is repeated the temperature is raised
a little.Krull reports that he has uniformly succeeded, and has never
found it necessary to repeat the injection more than seven times.It
may be given twice or thrice a day.[Footnote 38: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1877, p.STRUCTURAL DISEASES OF THE LIVER.DEFINITION.--An abnormal quantity of blood in the liver, constantly
present, constitutes hyperaemia or congestion.During the period of
repose there is less, but during the period of activity more, blood
circulating in the liver, but the physiological hyperaemia is not, nor
does it contribute to, a diseased state unless abnormal conditions
continue it beyond the proper limits.The term hyperaemia, here used,
applies to a pathological state in which various structural alterations
grow out of the continual congestion of the blood-vessels of the organ.CAUSES.--A physiological congestion of the liver ensues when the {984}
process of digestion is going on.The afferent vessels dilate, and not
only more blood, but various materials taken up from the foods and
products of digestion, many of them having directly stimulating
effects, also pass to the organ.Frequent and large indulgence in food,
especially if rich in quality and highly seasoned with spices, mustard,
etc., the consumption of malt liquors, wines, and alcoholic fluids in
general, the habitual use of strong coffee and tea, gradually induce a
state of hyperaemia.If to the consumption of a large quantity of
highly-stimulating food there is added the mischief of insufficient
waste, the danger of congestion of the liver is the greater.Persons
addicted to the pleasures of the table are apt to pursue sedentary
lives, and hence, besides the inappropriation of the material digested,
the process of oxidation is insufficient to burn off the surplus.A
sedentary life further tends to make the circulation in the hepatic
veins sluggish by lessening the number and depth of the respirations,
and with the obesity developed under these conditions the propelling
power of the heart is diminished by fatty degeneration or fatty
substitution of the cardiac muscle.Disease of the semilunar ganglion,
the solar plexus, and of the splanchnics under circumstances and of a
nature not now well understood may cause dilatation of the hepatic
vessels.Suppression of a long-existing hemorrhage from piles and from the
uterine system has caused hyperaemia of the liver.Evidences of hepatic
congestion are comparatively common about the menstrual period in
consequence of the tardy appearance of the flow, of its insufficiency,
or of its sudden suppression.There is a form of jaundice known as
icterus menstrualis, and attacks of hepatic congestion are not uncommon
at the climacteric period.The most important causes of hyperaemia of the liver are mechanical,
and consist in obstruction to the circulation in the ascending vena
cava from disease of the heart or lungs.Dilatation of the right
cavities, incompetence of the tricuspid, and stenosis of the mitral
orifice are the usual cardiac changes leading to congestion of the
liver.The same effect, to a much less extent, however, is produced by
any cause which weakens the propelling power of the heart, as
myocarditis, pericarditis, etc.Amongst the pulmonary lesions
obstructing the venous circulation are emphysema, interstitial and
croupous pneumonia, effusions into the pleura, intrathoracic aneurisms
or tumors, etc.It should not be forgotten that effusions into the left
pleura, as was demonstrated by Bartels[39] and confirmed by Roser,[40]
so push over the mediastinum toward the right and bend the vena cava in
the same direction, just as it emerges from the opening in the
diaphragm, that the circulation in this vessel is impeded, and
consequently congestion of the liver induced.[Footnote 39: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.[Footnote 40: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, Band vi.The influence of climate, especially of long-continued high
temperature, has been warmly disputed.On the whole, it seems probable
that in warm climates congestion of the liver is much more common.In the section on
Jaundice it was stated that this symptom may occur without the
phenomena of fever, and, indeed, without any other disturbance of the
system.In a large proportion of cases of intermittent fever, probably
in all, more or less congestion of the liver occurs.{985} PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Congestion may take place in the portal
system, and be due to conditions of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, or in the hepatic vein and radicles, due to obstructive
troubles in the heart or lungs.Restricting the observations to the hyperaemia, and not including
subsequent lesions, it suffices to say that the liver is somewhat
enlarged, rather darker in color than the normal, and uniformly so; the
radicles and branches of the portal vein in the liver, the trunk of the
vein itself, and the veins of the spleen, stomach, intestines,
mesentery, etc.are distended with black blood, and the tissue of the
liver rather wet, inclined to soften, and here and there marked by
minute hemorrhages from rupture of small vessels.The extravasations of
blood accompany the hepatic congestion of hot climates, and probably
are the preludes to suppurative inflammation.The portal system the
more readily suffers from a passive congestion because of the provision
for the alternate expansion and contraction of the tunics of the
vessel, scantily supplied with contractile elements.An acute
congestion of the liver produced by sudden dilatation of the
capillaries of the hepatic artery has not been described, but it would
appear to be possible.The most important form of hepatic congestion is the mechanical,
arising from obstruction of the circulation in the heart or lungs.In
consequence of this obstruction the blood accumulates on the venous
side, and there is in consequence an ischaemia of the arterial side.The hepatic vein becomes distended, and its terminal radicle in the
centre of each acinus--the central vein--enlarges with the increased
pressure.It follows that the minute capillaries emptying into the
central vein are also distended with blood, and finally the portal vein
and its radicles throughout are similarly affected.The same condition
of the hepatic circulation was long ago observed by Virchow[41] as a
result of weakness of the muscular tissue of the heart, and
consequently diminished propelling power of the organ.On section of
the liver much black blood flows out; each central vein is a distinct
dark object in the centre of each acinus, and contrasts strongly with
the surrounding paler substance, whence the common term for this
appearance is nutmeg liver.The long-continued distension of the
central vein leads to sclerosis of its walls,[42] and the neighboring
hepatic cells undergo atrophy in consequence of the greater pressure.A
relatively increased quantity of connective tissue seems to result, but
whether hyperplasia occurs is disputed.By Talamon[43] such increase of
the connective tissue is denied, but Thierfelder[44] admits that there
is an apparent and also in some cases a real increase.The atrophy of
the cells induces more or less shrinking and consolidation of the
liver; it is therefore smaller in size and firmer in texture, and
presents a brownish-red color.The atrophic change in the hepatic cells
is represented finally by some brownish or black pigment, but it is
rare, indeed, for all the cells of an acinus to disappear.To this
change has been applied the term cyanotic atrophy.In some instances
Liebermeister[45] {986} has found an increase of the connective tissue
of the liver; and this opinion is confirmed by Legg.[46] When this
multiplication of the connective tissue occurs, the condition of the
liver is entitled cyanotic induration.The sclerosis originating in
this way is distinguished from true cirrhosis by its less extent,
irregularity, situation, and the marked degree of hepatic congestion.[Footnote 41: _Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band v. p.[Footnote 42: Talamon, _Recherches anatomo-pathologiques et cliniques
sur le Foie cardiaque_, Paris, 1881 (pamphlet).][Footnote 43: _Ibid._]

Leberkrankheiten_, Tubingen, 1864, p.209 _et seq._]

[Footnote 46: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.SYMPTOMS.--Hyperaemia of the liver is usually one of the complex
conditions of a morbid state, and hence is associated in its
symptomatology with the connected maladies.On the one hand associated
with gastro-intestinal disorders, on the other with cardiac and
pulmonary diseases, the symptoms must be varied accordingly.It is
necessary, however, to indicate as clearly as may be those belonging to
the hepatic circulation.Congestion of the portal circulation is a condition to which frequent
references are made, but which is rarely clearly defined.As seen in
the West and South, it signifies a gastro-intestinal catarrh more or
less acute, with an obvious condition of biliousness, as manifested in
a faint jaundiced tint of the skin and of the conjunctivae, uneasiness
in the right hypochondrium, with enlargement of the area of hepatic
dulness, the evacuations from the bowels being either grayish or
clay-, or more frequently bilious, acrid, and offensive.The gastro-intestinal disorder which initiates the hepatic disturbance
should not be confounded with that which succeeds to congestion of the
hepatic veins.The latter invariably comes on after the obstruction at
the heart or lungs has continued for some time.There occurs in this
state very extensive hyperaemia of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, and consequent disorders of stomachal and intestinal
digestion.The former is a reflex cause of disturbance, probably
through the intermediation of the solar plexus.The gastro-intestinal
irritation, by depressing the functions of the hepatic through the
solar plexus, induces a paresis of the muscular layer of the portal
system, and thus congestion ensues.Such a result is aided by high
temperature, but especially by the constitutional tendencies of some
subjects to hepatic disturbances.In such examples of hyperaemia the
symptoms consist of those belonging to gastro-intestinal catarrh,
succeeded by those referable to the liver, consisting in uneasiness,
heaviness, and fulness of the right hypochondrium, increase in the area
of hepatic dulness, soreness on pressure along the inferior margin of
the ribs and over the epigastric region, yellowness of the
conjunctivae, a fawn color of the skin generally, and high-
rather scanty urine, depositing abundantly uric acid and urates.A
liver considerably enlarged and projecting one or two fingers' breadths
below the ribs may be quickly relieved and return to the normal size on
the occurrence of hemorrhage from piles or after free watery
evacuations produced by a hydragogue cathartic.The form of hepatic congestion most usually observed is that of the
hepatic vein, caused by obstructive troubles of the heart or lungs, and
known as the nutmeg liver.The increase of size of the liver under
these circumstances may be very considerable.To determine an increase
in the area of hepatic dulness the position of the organ must be
ascertained with reference to the position of the body, whether
recumbent or erect.In the former position the liver gravitates toward
the thorax; in the {987} latter, downward into the abdomen.If
palpation only were employed to detect an increase in the size of the
organ, an error might readily be committed in this respect.Some
congestion may doubtless exist without an actual increase of size
recognizable by our means of investigation; there may be merely some
distension manifested by a sense of increased resistance; the liver may
project a hand's breadth below the ribs; and between these extremes
there may be all possible degrees of enlargement.When the liver, in
consequence of hyperaemia, projects below the ribs, it offers to the
sense of touch the impression of a smooth, elastic, rather rounded
surface, and not the hardness and nodular character of sclerosis, and
not the sharpness of border and hardness of texture belonging to
amyloid disease.The enlargement of the liver due to hyperaemia is
further distinguished by the fact that it varies much in size at
different times, and may be much reduced by hemorrhage from the portal
system, and increased suddenly by an attack of dyspnoea.When the liver is enlarged by hyperaemia the patient usually has a
distinct appreciation of the fact, feels a sense of weight, tenderness,
and oppression in the right hypochondrium, and experiences a painful
dragging from the right toward the left when turned on the left side.In some cases pain is felt in the shoulder, or, if not pain, a feeling
of weight.A slight icteroid hue of the conjunctiva, face, upper
extremities, and trunk is often present, but the stools are not wanting
in bile and the urine contains but little pigment--facts indicating
that the obstruction is limited to a small number of ducts.If the
jaundice is decided, the stools clay-, and the urine loaded with
pigment, a catarrhal swelling of the common or hepatic duct exists.As nutmeg liver is an incident in the course of the venous stasis from
cardiac or pulmonary obstructive disease, it is not unusual to find
ascites and general dropsy occur.When ascites precedes the other
manifestations of dropsy, and is relatively more important, the hepatic
congestion has led to atrophy of the cells and contraction of the
organ, or to cyanotic induration, as it has been designated in
contradistinction to cirrhotic induration.The subjects of hepatic congestion, especially of that form of the
malady due to gastro-intestinal irritation, are apt to experience no
little mental depression, even hypochondriasis, as, indeed, is usual in
most cases of hepatic disease.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The behavior of any case of
hyperaemia of the liver is determined, first, by the character of the
cause, and, secondly, by the extension of the mischief and the atrophic
changes which ensue.The congestion arising from gastro-intestinal
irritation is comparatively short-lived, since the causal conditions
may usually be promptly removed.It is far different in the cases due
to pulmonary or cardiac disease.If caused by a left pleuritic
exudation, the congestion will disappear as soon as the bend in the
ascending vena cava is removed by paracentesis.If, however, produced
by a permanent pulmonary obstruction, the course of the hepatic disease
is toward cyanotic induration.The same is true of obstructive cardiac
lesions.If compensation--as, for example, of a mitral
regurgitation--is not effected, the continual congestion must lead to
the ultimate lesions of the liver; but if compensation can be brought
about, the liver will be saved the irremediable {988} changes.The
prognosis, therapeutical and pathological, must necessarily be
dependent on the lesions of which the hyperaemia of the liver is merely
a symptom.DIAGNOSIS.--The decision in any case of hyperaemia of the liver must
rest on the determination of the gastro-intestinal, pulmonary, or
cardiac diseases causative.When, for example, to the gastro-intestinal
disturbance or cardiac disease there are added heaviness, uneasiness,
increased area of dulness of the right hypochondrium, a hyperaemia of
the liver may be concluded to exist.The extent to which the organ is
damaged may be judged from its size, the duration of the congestion,
and the character of the determining cause.If the area of hepatic
dulness declines steadily after having been increased, the causative
conditions continuing, the shrinking is due to atrophy.This view is
confirmed if ascites has appeared and increased out of proportion to
the general dropsy.TREATMENT.--Those cases of hyperaemia dependent on excesses in eating
and drinking require the substitution of a diet composed of lean meat,
skimmed milk, acid fruits, and such succulent vegetables as lettuce,
tomatoes, celery, etc.When there is a high degree of gastro-intestinal
catarrh, an absolute milk diet may be enforced with great advantage.enjoined in the section devoted to
lithaemia are equally applicable here.Amongst the special plans of
diet sometimes advocated in the condition of abdominal plethora or
portal congestion are the grape cure, the whey cure, etc.Great good is
accomplished by a simple diet and a course of the Saratoga saline
laxative waters--the Congress, Hathorn, Geyser, etc.The alkaline
waters of Wisconsin and Michigan, the White Sulphur of Virginia, and
others having similar properties in this country may be employed for
the same purpose.The saline laxatives, Pullna, Friedrichshall, and
other purgative salines, may be used in robust, plethoric subjects with
much portal congestion, hemorrhoids, etc.Phosphate of soda, given in
sufficient quantity to maintain a soluble state of the bowels, is also
a useful remedy.The resinous cathartics, podophyllin, jalap, rhubarb,
aloes, euonymin, iridin, baptisin, etc., are all useful when the
indication is to unload the portal circulation.The mercurials,
formerly so much used, are now discredited to an unwarranted degree.In
an irritable state of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane calomel in
small doses is remarkably useful.The treatment of congestion of the hepatic vein is included in that of
the lesion causing it.In some rather exceptional cases the liver
enlarges considerably in consequence of incompetence of the mitral,
without there being any other conspicuous evidence of the lesion.Remarkable relief is afforded to the hepatic symptoms by the
administration of digitalis.The important point in all cases due to
cardiac disease is to bring about compensation, and thus obviate the
consequences of the lesion.Remediable pulmonary affections should be
cured as promptly as possible, and the evil results of incurable
affections lessened by efforts to remove the hepatic hyperaemia.Careful alimentation, saline laxatives, and diuretics are the most
efficient measures.It would be encroaching on the subjects of
pulmonary and of cardiac diseases to enter more minutely into the
therapeutical questions connected with a symptom of these affections.DEFINITION.--By the term perihepatitis is meant an acute inflammation
of the serous envelope of the liver.It may be acute or chronic, very
rarely the latter, and it is usually a secondary affection, although
primary cases are not uncommon.PATHOGENY.--Inflammation of the hepatic portion of the peritoneum may
arise by an extension of the morbid process from neighboring parts, as
in perforation of the stomach or duodenum, pleuritis of that part of
the membrane reflected from the diaphragm, etc.More frequently it
arises by contiguity from some disease of the liver itself, as chronic
interstitial hepatitis, abscess, echinococci cysts, cancer, etc.The
author has frequently (comparatively) seen perihepatitis follow the
passage of gall-stones.It is usual to find considerable organized
exudation at the hilus of the liver in the case of those who have had
several attacks of hepatic colic, and attachments to various
neighboring parts also.In those instances of secondary hepatitis there
may be more or less extensive connective-tissue formation and
compression of the hepatic substance (Budd).[47]

[Footnote 47: _Diseases of the Liver_; also, Bamberger, _Krankheiten
des Chlylopoietic Systems_, p.Direct perihepatitis arises from traumatic causes--from contusions of
the right hypochondrium by spent balls, blows and falls, etc.Tight-lacing and wearing a strap to support the trousers are supposed
to excite a slow, chronic hepatitis, but the latter is more certain to
bring about such a result than the former.SYMPTOMS.--Acute perihepatitis, if of sufficient extent, causes more or
less fever; pain is felt in the right hypochondrium, and is increased
by pressure and by deep inspirations, and in some rare instances a
friction murmur is audible synchronous with the respiratory movements.These symptoms succeed to attacks of hepatic colic, perforation of the
stomach or intestine, and contusions of the abdominal wall.The chronic
form is not febrile; there is a feeling of soreness instead of acute
pain; pressure, the movements of the body, respiration, etc.increase
the distress, and on turning on the left side a painful dragging is
experienced.A slight degree of icterus may be present in both acute
and chronic cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of the acute cases is
toward recovery.In two or three days the inflammation reaches the
maximum, adhesions form, and then the morbid process declines.The
whole course of an acute perihepatitis caused by external injury or by
the passage of gall-stones is terminated in a week or ten days.The
mischief done may not be limited to the adhesions formed.The large
quantity of newly-organized connective tissue may, in its subsequent
contraction, compress the common, cystic, or hepatic duct, or the
portal, or both ducts and vein.The course of the chronic cases is
determined by the causative lesion.The contraction of the new-formed
connective tissue may compress the organ and lead to sclerotic changes
which cannot be distinguished from cirrhosis.In some instances
contusions set up suppurative inflammation, and an abscess forms
between the parietal and glandular layer of the peritoneum.Such a case
will then present the phenomena of hepatic abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the character of the case will be
{990} largely influenced by the history.If the attack has followed a
blow on the side or a paroxysm of hepatic colic or the symptoms of
perforation, there will be no difficulty in determining its seat and
character.In the absence of the history the differentiation must be
made between perihepatitis and pleuritis.The distinction consists in
the fact that in the former the pain and soreness are below the line of
respiratory sounds, although synchronous with them.In chronic
perihepatitis the symptoms come on in the course of the hepatic
disorder, or are consequent on a local injury, as the pressure of stays
or a band.TREATMENT.--If the symptoms are acute and the subject robust, the local
abstraction of blood by leeches affords relief and diminishes the
violence of the disease.A bandage should be tightly applied around the
body at the level of the hypochondrium to restrain the movements of the
affected organ.A turpentine stupe may be confined in this way, or a
compress of water may be utilized to serve the same purpose.If the
pain is acute and the peritonitis due to perforation or to the passage
of calculi, the hypodermatic injection of morphia is the most important
resource.Interstitial Hepatitis; Sclerosis of the Liver; Cirrhosis.DEFINITION.--The terms interstitial hepatitis and sclerosis of the
liver express the nature of the malady: they signify an inflammation of
the intervening connective tissue, resulting in a sclerosis--an
induration of the organ.The term cirrhosis, now so largely in use, was
originally proposed by Laennec[48] because of the yellowish tint of the
granulations, from the Greek word, [Greek: chirros], yellow.As
Laennec's theory of cirrhosis was erroneous, having regarded these
granulations as new formations, the word is a very faulty one, and
hence it would be preferable to use the term sclerosis, since a similar
change in other organs is thus designated, as sclerosis of the kidney,
sclerosis of the lungs, etc.It is also called in England gin-drinker's
liver, hobnail liver.Carswell[49] first described the anatomical
changes with accuracy, and illustrated them with correct drawings.The
following year Hallmann[50] confirmed the truth of Carswell's
descriptions, and contributed a good account of the morbid anatomy; and
subsequently French, German, and English authorities added new facts,
which will be set forth in the further discussion of the subject.[Footnote 48: _Traite de l'Auscultatlon mediate_, tome ii.[Footnote 49: _Illustrations of the Elementary Form of Diseases_,
fasciculus 10, plate 2.][Footnote 50: _De Cirrhosi hep._, Diss.Inaug., Berolini, 1839, quoted
by Thierfelder.]CAUSES.--Sclerosis of the liver is, conspicuously, a disease of adult
life and onward.Except the congenital example mentioned below, the
earliest age at which the disease has occurred, so far as I am able to
ascertain, is four years--a case reported by Wettergreen[51] of
hypertrophic sclerosis, in which neither a syphilitic nor paludal cause
could be ascertained.Cayley[52] reports a case in a child of six;
Murchison,[53] Frerichs,[54] Griffith,[55] one each at ten.After this
period the increase relatively to age is rapid.The majority of cases
occur between thirty {991} and fifty years.Yet Virchow[56] has given
the details of a congenital example.According to Forster, of 31 cases
of cirrhosis, 16 were between forty and sixty years.The preponderance
of cases in the male sex is very decided.Of Bamberger's 51 cases, 39
were men, 12 were women; of Frerichs' 36 cases, 20 occurred in men and
16 in women--a larger proportion of women than any other author
records; of 12 cases observed by myself, only 1 was a woman.Nationality does not affect the production of cirrhosis, except as
regards the personal habits of the people.This disease is
comparatively uncommon in wine- and beer-drinking countries, and
frequent amongst a spirit-drinking people.[57] The great etiological
factor is the abuse, the habitual use, of spirits, and hence the number
of cases observed in North Germany, England, Scotland, and the United
States.Murchison affirms that he has never seen a case produced in any
other way.Even in children of tender years the abuse of spirits can
usually be traced.Nevertheless, there are instances of the disease the
origin of which cannot be referred to alcoholic excess.The congenital
cases, as that narrated by Virchow, and the instances occurring in
children and adults not given to spirits in any form, indicate that
there are other pathogenetic influences which may bring about a
sclerosis of the liver.Virchow[58] was one of the first to illuminate
the subject of visceral syphilis and to demonstrate the occurrence of
sclerosis of the liver from syphilitic infection.Very often the
syphilitic cachexia coincides with alcoholic excess.There can be no
doubt that chronic malarial poisoning causes, or powerfully predisposes
to, cirrhosis.I have submitted elsewhere pathological evidence on this
point,[59] and the Italian physicians, who have the opportunity to
obtain accurate data, maintain that malarial toxaemia does bring about
this state.It is probable that the overgrowth of connective tissue is
induced by the repeated congestions of the malarial attacks, and by the
obstruction due to catarrh of the bile-ducts which so often occurs in
the febrile paroxysms.[Footnote 51: _Hygeia_, 1880, quoted by _London Medical Record_, March
15, 1881.][Footnote 52: _Transactions of the Path.[Footnote 53: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 54: _Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.[Footnote 55: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 56: _Archiv f. path.[Footnote 57: Baer, _Der Alcoholismus_, Berlin, 1878, p.62 _et seq._]

[Footnote 58: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.281; also, Lancereaux, _A
Treatise on Syphilis_, Syd.[Footnote 59: _Memoirs of the Sanitary Commission_, medical volume.]J. Wickham Legg[60] and Charcot[61] nearly simultaneously discovered
that obstruction of the bile-ducts, if continued a sufficient length of
time, sets up a hyperplasia of the connective tissue of the liver.Thus, Legg has seen a liver
markedly cirrhotic in a case where a small cancer of the duodenum
completely obstructed the flow of bile into the intestine.[62] By tying
the common duct in dogs it was found that a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue very soon occurred, and this was followed, of course,
by contraction of the new tissue and atrophy of the hepatic cells.Closure of the hepatic vein has the same effect, and also, as
Solowieff[63] has asserted, closure of the portal vein; on the other
hand, by Frerichs and others the closure of the portal is attributed to
the sclerosis.[Footnote 60: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.351 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 61: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.231 _et
seq._]

[Footnote 62: _On the Bile, Jaundice, etc._, _loc.Anat., etc._, Band lxii.Certain poisons, as antimony, arsenic, notably phosphorus, have the
power to set up an irritative hyperplasia of the connective tissue of
the {992} liver.These metals accumulate in the liver in preparation
for excretion.Wegner,[64] in the study of the action of phosphorus on
dogs, rabbits, and other animals, has induced a marked degree of
sclerosis, but such results have not been observed in cases of
poisoning by phosphorus in man, except in an instance reported by
Kussner.[Footnote 64: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lv.Finally, a condition of the liver corresponding in all respects to
cirrhosis has been induced by perihepatitis, by the organization of the
exudation and its subsequent contraction, and by the extension of the
morbid process from the capsule to the interlobular connective tissue
(Poulin[65]).[Footnote 65: _Etude sur les Atrophies viscerales consecutives aux
Inflammations chroniques du Sereuses, etc._, These de Paris, 1880.]PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Several forms of cirrhosis are recognized by the
modern French school of pathologists.According to Sabourin,[66] there
is an annular, a monolobular, and a multilobular form.These differ
merely in regard to the arrangement of the new connective tissue.At
the outset of the disease the liver is increased in size and
hyperaemic.The outer
surface is at this period smooth, but on section the islets of the
parenchymatous tissue, yellowish in color, are distinctly visible
between the grayish or pale-rose tint of the intervening or
proliferating tissue.This reddish-gray material consists of fine
connective-tissue elements containing spindle-shaped cells.[67] The
development of this material is such as to even exceed in quantity the
proper glandular structure.The bands of newly-formed connective tissue
extend between individual lobules (monolobular cirrhosis) or between
groups of lobules (multilobular cirrhosis).A portion of the
spindle-shaped cells form new vessels communicating with the branches
of the hepatic artery.[68] Coincidently with the formation of the new
connective tissue ensues its contraction.The enlarged organ diminishes
in size from a slight degree to one-half its original volume;
especially in the left lobe is the diminution of size most marked.On
the surface it exhibits a knobbed or nodular aspect (hobnail liver),
and these knobs present through the capsule a yellow appearance.The
granulations, so called, consist of small prominences corresponding to
lobules or groups of lobules, and hence vary in size from that of a
pinhead to that of a pea.[69] Between these are the sharply-defined
masses of connective tissue.On section the organ is found to be of
firm almost cartilaginous hardness, and between the interlacing bundles
of connective tissue are the small islands of parenchymatous tissue
projecting above the cut surface and having a yellowish or
brownish-yellow color.As the terminal branches of the portal are
compressed in the process of shrinking undergone by the new connective
tissue, they are destroyed.The result of this obliteration of the
portal radicles is the impaired nutrition of the lobules and atrophy of
the cells.Formerly it was held that the atrophy of the hepatic cells
was due to the compression exercised by the contracting connective
tissue, and Beale[70] even maintained that the change began in {993}
the cells, the connective tissue contracting as the cells receded
before them.This view has been reaffirmed by Ackermann in a paper read
last year before the Congress of German Naturalists and Physicians, but
without any acknowledgment, so far as I can ascertain, of Beale's
long-before expressed opinions.In the discussion which followed the
reading of Ackermann's paper the position of its author was supported
by Aufrecht, Kussner, and others, but controverted by Rindfleisch.It
has been demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten[71] that the lobule is
nourished not only by the portal radicles, but by the branches of the
hepatic artery, which enter, by the interlobular vein, the capillaries
of the lobule, and hence the nutrition of the cells suffers in
consequence of the lessened blood-supply; but it is probable also that
more or less compression is exercised.When the cells are destroyed,
their remains may be discerned in the mass of connective tissue as fine
fat-granules or masses of pigment yellowish or brownish in color.The
peculiar appearance to which the name cirrhosis is applied is due to
the lobules or groups of lobules which project on section above the
divided surface, and are  yellowish by the bile-pigment, which
here exists in an exaggerated quantity.The cells themselves are not
normal: they are enlarged by compensatory hypertrophy, and they contain
much bile-pigment and a considerable quantity of fat.The compression
of the capillaries, especially their obliteration, leads to stasis of
the blood and its consequences in the whole chylopoietic system.Sabourin, "Du Role que joue le Systeme veineux

SYMPTOMS.--The development of sclerosis is usually very insidious.After some years' indulgence in spirit-drinking or affected for a
length of time with the other causes of the malady, a gradual decline
of vigor occurs.The complexion takes on a fawn color, stigmata slowly
form on the face, there is more or less yellowness of the conjunctiva,
and attacks of headache, giddiness, and even severe vertigo, are
experienced.An increasing indisposition to mental effort, some
hebetude of mind, and a gradually deepening despondency are felt.The
appetite gradually fails, becomes capricious, and only highly-seasoned,
rather odd, or unusual articles of food can be taken.Such subjects
acquire a taste for condiments, for such uncooked vegetables as onions,
celery, raw cabbage, etc., for fruits, and get a distaste for
plainly-cooked meats and vegetables, for sweets, etc.The digestion is
as capricious as the appetite: at first there are times of appetite,
again of indifference, then of disgust; some heaviness is felt after
meals; gaseous eructations, acidity, pyrosis, nausea, occur day after
day as the case advances; and ultimately morning vomiting is regularly
experienced.Nausea is felt on rising; then with much straining and
distress a little glairy mucus and a teaspoonful of bile are brought
up; after which, it may be, a little food can be taken.It is only
after the case is fully declared that these troubles of stomach
digestion become constant; previously they occur now and then in a
paroxysmal way, whilst between there is only labored digestion.As the compression of the portal radicles maintains, by reason of the
obstruction, a constant hyperaemia of the intestinal mucous membrane, a
catarrhal state, with fermentation of the fatty, starchy, and
saccharine constituents of the food, and hence complicated products of
an irritating kind, must result therefrom.Hemorrhoids, varying in size
according to {994} the degree of obstruction, form, sometimes bleeding
more or less profusely, again being merely troublesome or painful.Fissures of the anus and fistula in ano not unfrequently complicate the
case.The bowels are necessarily rather relaxed than confined, but at
the onset of the malady they may be confined, afterward assuming more
or less of the characteristics of diarrhoea.The stools may be
offensive with the products of decomposition, rather clay- or
golden, or brownish and almost black from the presence of blood.In
some cases the stools are parti---clay- in part, brownish
in part--and in exceptional examples continue normal or nearly so until
near the end.As the transudations from the portal vessels increase,
the mucous membrane of the intestinal canal becomes oedematous, and,
the normal secretions being arrested, the discharges finally consist of
a watery fluid, whitish or grayish, dark-brown or blackish, and very
offensive.The decomposition of foods instead of their proper digestion
and solution, and especially the fermentation of the starchy and
saccharine constituents of the aliment taken, produce a great quantity
of gas; hence meteorism comes to be an ordinary symptom.The
accumulation of gas is greatly promoted by the paretic state of the
muscular layer and by the relaxation of the abdominal walls consequent
on the oedema of the muscular tissue.A high degree of distress is
sometimes caused by the great accumulation of flatus; the abdomen is
greatly distended and the diaphragm is pushed up against the heart and
lungs, compelling the patient at length to sit up to breathe with ease.Of course the accumulation of fluid may be greater, and the gas only
add to the discomfort.Sometimes it happens, indeed, that
this is the only evidence of the portal obstruction at first observed.Haematemesis is more common than intestinal hemorrhage.Now the blood
may be large in quantity, appear little changed from its usual
coagulated state, and be brought up promptly with slight effort of
vomiting; now it is passed by stool, is in coffee-, granular
masses or in a tar-like, semifluid state; and again it appears in
coffee-grounds mixed with the contents of the stomach.These variations
are due to the character, seat, and extent of the hemorrhage and to the
condition of the mucous membrane.Merely-distended capillaries,
yielding, may furnish a little blood, which, acted on by the gastric
juice, forms coffee-grounds, or, if not acted on in consequence of the
failure of the gastric glands to functionate, appears as bloody streaks
mixed with mucus.Enlarged veins, giving way, may furnish a large
quantity of partly-coagulated venous blood, charred or not as the state
of the juices will determine.In some cases hemorrhages into the
submucous tissue or thromboses of the submucous veins lead to solution
of the membrane thus deprived of its nutritional supply, and ulcers
form.Two admirable examples of this kind have been seen by the writer
in which large haematemesis occurred from ulcers near the pylorus.They
were round, smooth ulcers, containing coagula, and the eroded vessels
(veins) were readily seen opening into the cavity of each.The obstruction to the portal circulation results also in an
enlargement of the spleen.There may be a simple enlargement due to the
hyperaemia merely; there may be an enlargement due to the hyperaemia
and to a resulting hyperplasia of the connective tissue; there may be
also, in {995} addition to the second form of enlargement, amyloid
degeneration, syphilitic hyperplasia, etc.The increased dimensions of
the spleen are by no means always made out, and authorities differ
greatly as to the proportion of cases in which the enlargement can be
detected.The organ may indeed be considerably enlarged whilst pushed
upward into the left hypochondrium by the effusion, and yet the attempt
to measure and define its dimensions may be fruitless.From a slight
increase due to the hyperaemia up to the enormous dimensions acquired
by the added amyloid material there are all possible variations in
size.Partly in consequence of the increased blood-pressure in the vessels of
the peritoneum, and partly in consequence of the watery condition of
the blood itself, effusion takes place into the sac of the peritoneum.Such an accumulation is known as ascites, or dropsy of the abdomen.The
time at which the effusion begins, the amount of it, and the degree of
contraction of the liver necessary to produce it, vary in each case.Ascites may be the first symptom to announce the onset of cirrhosis; it
is more frequently amongst the later symptoms, and is the evidence of
much interference in the portal circulation.However, it is not due
wholly to hepatic disease.The blood in cirrhosis is much reduced and
watery, hence slight causes suffice to induce an outward diffusion.Given a certain obstacle to the passage of the blood through the liver,
transudation will be the more prompt to appear the greater the anaemia.In some cases an enormous quantity of fluid collects: from ten to
thirty pounds may be regarded as usual, and forty to sixty pounds as
exceptional, although the highest amount just given is not rare.The
fluid of ascites nearly represents the serum of the blood.It has a
straw color and is clear, but it may have a reddish tint from the
presence of blood, a greenish-yellow or brown from bile-pigment.The
solids of the serum are in the proportion of from 1 to 3 per cent., and
consist of albumen chiefly and salts, of which sodium chloride is the
principal.Hoppe's[72] analysis gives this result: 1.55 to 1.75 solids,
of which 0.62 to 0.77 is albumen.According to Frerichs, the amounts of
solids ranges from 2.04 to 2.48, and of these albumen constitutes 1.01
to 1.34.[Footnote 72: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band ix.]Oedema of the inferior extremities comes on after, usually--rarely
with--the ascites.If the mechanism of this oedematous swelling be as
supposed, the effusion into the areolar tissue necessarily succeeds to
the abdominal effusion.The pressure of the fluid in the cavity on the
ascending vena cava and iliac veins seems to be the principal factor;
but to this must also be added the intestinal gas, which in some
instances exerts a powerful force.The ankles have in rather rare cases
appeared swollen before the abdomen, but the detection of fluid in the
peritoneal cavity when in small quantity is not always easy.Obese
women, with much accumulation of fat in the omentum and flatus in the
intestines, have swollen feet and legs if erect for some time, the
effusion being due to pressure on the vena cava.The legs may become
enormously distended.The scrotum and penis in the male, the vulva in
the female, the buttocks and the abdominal wall, also become
oedematous, sometimes immensely.Warmth and moisture and the friction of the sensitive surfaces excite
vesicular and pustular eruptions where the {996} scrotum and labiae
come in contact with the thighs.Urination may be impeded by the oedema
of the prepuce.An attempt at compensation for these evils growing out of the
obstruction in the portal system is made by the natural powers.Anastomoses of veins through minute branches are made use of to convey
the blood of the obstructed portal circulation into the general venous
system, and to this end become greatly enlarged.The interlobular veins
being obliterated by the contracting connective tissue, the pressure in
the branches and trunk of the portal vein is much increased.Hence an
outlet is sought for in the veins which communicate between the portal
and the ascending vena cava.One of the most important of these is a
vein in the round ligament, at one time supposed to be the closed
umbilical vein, but proved by Sappey to be an accessory portal vein.Bamberger,[73] however, has found the umbilical vein pervious, and
since, Hoffmann[74] has demonstrated the same fact.It is probable,
indeed, that Sappey's observation is correct for some cases.In either
event, the veins of the abdominal wall about the umbilicus
communicating with the epigastric become enormously distended, and in
some advanced cases of cirrhosis form a circle known as the caput
Medusae.Further communication between the portal and the veins of the
diaphragm takes place by means of the veins in the coronary and
suspensory ligaments.In some instances a new route is established
between the veins of the diaphragm and the portal by means of new
vessels formed in the organized connective tissue resulting from
perihepatitis.Still another channel of communication exists between
the inferior oesophageal veins, the azygos, and the coronary, and
finally between the inferior hemorrhoidal and the hypogastric.The more
completely can communication be established between these anastomosing
veins the less severe the results of portal obstruction.[Footnote 73: _Krankheiten des Chylopoiet.cit._]

[Footnote 74: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

Besides these indirect evidences of portal obstruction and a
contracting organ, there are direct means of ascertaining the condition
of the liver.By the methods of physical diagnosis we may acquire much
information.On auscultation, as our Jackson[75] was the first to show,
a grating or creaking like leather, or friction sound, is audible over
the right hypochondrium synchronously with the respiratory movements or
when produced by moving with the fingers the abdominal wall on the
liver.This sound is caused by the bands of false membrane which extend
between the two surfaces, and hence indicates a secondary
perihepatitis.[Footnote 75: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850.]To ascertain the dimensions of the liver--to mark out the area of
hepatic dulness--with accuracy is a most necessary procedure.The
period of the disease is an important element in the problem.When the
new material is deposited and the congestion of the portal system first
occurs, an increase in the dimensions of the organ is observed.This
enlargement, of brief duration, must not be confounded with the
hypertrophic sclerosis, another form of the malady.So considerable is
the increase in the size of the liver that there is an evident
enlargement of the right hypochondrium, and the whole abdomen seems
fuller.The organ may be felt, on palpation, projecting one, two, or
even three fingers' breadths below the margin of the ribs, and the left
lobe extends well across the epigastrium, increasing the sense of
resistance and the area {997} of dulness in this direction.The
enlarged liver, as felt below the ribs, appears firmer than is natural,
is yet smooth, and the margin is sharply defined.The duration of this
period of enlargement is indefinite, but it is rather brief, and is
followed by the contracting and atrophic stage.It is not often,
indeed, that the patient presents himself during the period of
enlargement.Sometimes a perihepatitis or an unwonted tenderness in the
right side compels attention during this stage, but more frequently it
escapes notice.If perihepatitis occur, there will be fever, pain, and
tenderness, a slight icterode hue of the skin, and possibly
Jackson's[76] friction sound.These symptoms, taken in conjunction with
the history of the case and the obvious enlargement of the organ, will
indicate the existence of the first stage of sclerosis.[Footnote 76: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, July,
1850, _supra_.]The contraction of the liver, or, as it may be expressed, the atrophy
of the hepatic cells and the consequent shrinking of the interlobular
connective tissue, goes on slowly.Several months may be occupied in an
amount of atrophy distinct enough to be recognized by the narrowing of
the area of hepatic dulness.Especially difficult is the recognition of
the contraction when ascites has fully distended the abdomen.It may be
necessary under such circumstances to postpone a decision until tapping
has removed the fluid.If the organ can be felt by depressing the walls
of the abdomen, more or less unevenness of surface may be detected, and
the inferior margin may give the impression of hardness and sharpness
of outline.At the same time, the increased dulness of the epigastric
region observed during the hypertrophic stage will have gradually
ceased because of the shrinking of the left lobe.The liver may be
undergoing the atrophic degeneration to a marked extent and yet remain
large--larger even than normal.Such a state of things may be due to
conjoint amyloid or fatty degeneration of the organ, and, indeed, more
or less fatty change occurs in all cases of cirrhosis.The shrinking of
the liver persists until the area of dulness is not greater in area
than two or three ribs.The disturbances of function in sclerosis of the liver are not limited
to the chylopoietic system.As the secreting structure of the liver is
continually lessened in extent by the atrophy, symptoms result from the
necessary interference in the hepatic functions.These symptoms are
concerned with the liver, with the nutrition of the tissues of the
body, and with the kidneys.As regards the biliary function of the
liver, the quantity of bile acids and pigment is reduced below the
normal in proportion to the damage done to the organ.As a rule, there
is little jaundice in sclerosis, and very little bile-pigment present
in the urine.Instead of a
jaundiced hue of the skin, it has a fawn color--an earthy, sallow tint
eminently characteristic of a chronic affection in which the power to
produce bile is much impaired.Occasionally it happens, particularly in
the early stages of cirrhosis, that a well-marked jaundice appears in
the face and body, but this probably is due to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.In most cases the integument presents the earthy and sallow
hue above mentioned.Graves[77] appears to have been the first to
interpret aright the greater significance of this appearance of the
skin than the purely jaundiced tint.The glycogenic {998} function of
the liver must be impaired in the same ratio as the biliary.The
nutrition of the body suffers; the skin becomes dry and harsh; the fat
disappears; the temperature of the body, unless the conditions for
producing fever are present, is barely up to normal, if not somewhat
below; a marked degree of anaemia supervenes; and the action of the
heart becomes feeble and rapid after a period of slowness.The blood is
altered in quality, and hence hemorrhages--epistaxis especially--occur,
petechiae and ecchymoses appear in the skin, and stigmata are numerous
about the face and nose.[Footnote 77: _Clinical Medicine_, _op.cit._]

The urine in cirrhosis is high- because of the abundance of
pigment, and in the early stages of the disease is increased in amount,
although of lower specific gravity.When much effusion takes place into
the peritoneal sac, the compression of the renal veins by the fluid
lessens the activity of the kidneys and diminishes the urinary flow.Much discussion has taken place over the quantity of urea present in
the urine in cases of cirrhosis, but it has been established that the
relative quantity of urea lessens in proportion to the damage suffered
by the liver.[78] The urates are in excess.[Footnote 78: Charcot, _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, _loc.252; also, _Essai sur les Variations de l'Uree dans les Maladies du
Foie_, par F. Genevoix, Paris, 1876; _Des Rapports de l'Uree avec le
Foie_, par A. Martin, Paris, 1877; _Sur l'Uree et ces Variations dans
la Cirrhose_, These de Paris, Audiguier; _Contribution a l'Etude du
Role du Foie dans la Product.de l'Uree_, Reufflet.]COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--There are enormous variations in
the course of the disease as respects the rate of its progress.In
general, it may be said that the whole duration is from three months to
six years.The onset is often insidious, and little distress is
occasioned until effusion begins in the abdomen.In other cases there
is considerable pain in the right hypochondrium, severe disorders of
digestion and intestinal derangements, rapid emaciation, ascites, and
some intercurrent malady which terminates them, often quite
unexpectedly.The usual course is as follows: After the protracted use
of alcoholic stimulants the symptoms of gastro-intestinal catarrh
appear; there occur acidity, pyrosis, morning vomiting, and distress
after meals; the bowels are irregular, the stools rather dark and
offensive; the bodily vigor declines and the mental condition is
depressed and hypochondriacal; emaciation progresses; the skin becomes
dry, harsh, and fawn-; stigmata appear on the face; some
uneasiness is felt in the abdomen, through the right hypochondrium, and
about the umbilicus; presently the abdomen enlarges and the feet and
legs swell; after a time the abdominal enlargement is extreme and the
walls become thin, the genitals and thighs are greatly distended, and
the prepuce is so swollen that urination grows more and more difficult,
the penis almost disappearing in the surrounding oedema;
notwithstanding the immense size of the abdomen and lower extremities,
the chest, face, and upper extremities are wasted away; to lie down is
impossible, and only snatches of disturbed sleep are procured in the
upright sitting posture; breathing grows more and more difficult, and a
sense of suffocation is imminent; and, thus worn out by suffering and
want of sleep, the patient at last sinks into a soporose state and dies
comatose, if not cut off before by some acute serous
inflammation--pleuritis, peritonitis, peri- or endocarditis, pneumonia,
etc.{999} The course of any case of cirrhosis is much influenced by the
amount of damage to the hepatic cells and by the extent of the
compensatory changes in the circulation.Ulcers of the stomach or
intestine, opening vessels, or hemorrhages from the mucous membranes
may have a pronounced effect on the progress of any case.A fatal
result was determined in a case under the writer's charge by hemorrhage
from ulcers near the pylorus, which were caused by thromboses of the
stomach veins at that point.Occasionally, the occurrence of thrombosis
of the portal vein adds an embarrassing and dangerous complication.The
liver, besides the change due to cirrhosis, may be affected by amyloid
or fatty degeneration, or by both combined.It should not be forgotten
that more or less fatty change takes place in the hepatic cells
undergoing atrophy, whence the appearance called cirrhosis.Sclerosis
may be a general condition in which several organs participate, the
kidneys notably.These organs are changed by a hyperplasia of the
connective tissue, and especially by fatty degeneration of the
epithelium.In the brain the sclerosis consists in chronic
pachymeningitis, adhesions of the dura, etc., and with these
connective-tissue changes are often associated extravasations of blood.These lesions are probably due to chronic alcoholism rather than to the
cirrhosis--are simultaneous lesions, instead of consecutive.The duration of cirrhosis must necessarily depend largely on the
occurrence of the complications above mentioned and on the appearance
of intercurrent diseases.The most usual intercurrent maladies are
peritonitis, pleuritis, and other serous inflammations.An attack of
cerebral (meningeal) hemorrhage may occur.Failure of the heart may be
due to fatty degeneration of its muscular tissue.Stupor, coma, and
insensibility may come on toward the close in consequence of the
retention of excrementitious matters.By Flint, Jr., these cerebral
symptoms were referred to the retained cholesterin, and hence he
designated this state cholesteraemia.Numerous experimentalists
(Pages,[79] Chomjakow,[80] Von Krusenstern,[81] Koloman Muller[82])
have studied this question, and only Muller has been able to confirm
Flint's theory.The condition is more suitably designated cholaemia,
which signifies blood-poisoning from the excrementitious biliary
matters retained in the system.[Footnote 79: Quoted by Legg, p.[Footnote 80: Quoted by Krusenstern.][Footnote 81: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxv.[Footnote 82: _Archiv fur experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie_,
Band i. p.Any fully-developed case of cirrhosis can only terminate in one way,
for we possess no means of restoring the hepatic cells when once
destroyed.At the outset of the disease, before any serious changes
have taken place, it is probable it may be arrested.Proceeding to its
natural termination without complications or intercurrent affections,
death finally occurs from exhaustion.The emaciation becomes extreme,
the stomach gets to be excessively irritable, and an exhausting
diarrhoea consumes the last remains of strength.Then an oedema of the
lungs or failure of the heart or a deep coma ends the scene.DIAGNOSIS.--Cirrhosis in its first stage is to be distinguished from
diseases which cause enlargement of the liver, and in its second or
contracting stage from diseases that induce contraction of the organ.The history of alcoholic excess is an important means of
differentiating this {1000} from other affections.The enlargement
belonging to alcoholism is distinguished from that due to amyloid
disease by the permanent character of the latter and by its history of
chronic suppuration, in addition to, it may be, alcoholic excess; from
cancer, by the character of the enlargement, by its permanence, by the
secondary deposits in the mesentery and elsewhere, by the severe and
persistent pain; from hydatids or echinococci cysts by the painless
enlargement of the latter, by the absence, usually, of any interference
with the hepatic functions, by the purring thrill, and by the presence
of the characteristic hooklets in the fluid withdrawn.From the
maladies characterized by the contraction of the organ it is
distinguished by the rapidity with which the case is developed in acute
yellow atrophy, and by the profound constitutional disturbance
characteristic of this form of contraction.When the liver is lessened
in size in consequence of the compression exercised by the contracting
exudation of a local peritonitis, there is a history of pain and
soreness of the right hypochondrium, followed by the symptoms of
contraction--a very different history from that of cirrhosis, in which
the local attacks of pain and distress succeed to or accompany the
symptoms of contraction.Occlusion of the gall-ducts by a calculus may
set up a slow atrophy having some points of resemblance to cirrhosis;
but in this malady attacks of hepatic colic precede the signs of
obstruction, the jaundice, and gray evacuations, and the evidences of
contraction succeed to these very characteristic symptoms; whereas in
cirrhosis paroxysms of pain followed by jaundice are not known.Occlusion of the portal vein may also be followed by atrophy, but this
is usually due to some other affection of the abdominal organs, and the
change in the condition of the liver occurs very promptly, there being
neither the history nor the course of symptoms belonging to cirrhosis.TREATMENT.--As the abuse of alcoholic liquors--even their habitual use
in moderation--is the chief pathogenetic factor, they should be
entirely given up.Condiments, coffee and tea, highly-seasoned animal
foods, are of less importance as causes, but are sufficiently injurious
to require them to be discontinued.The food of such subjects should
not contain fat, because the bile is necessary to its right
assimilation, and should have but a small proportion relatively of
starch and sugar, since these articles readily ferment in the presence
of an excess of mucus and in the absence of the bile.The succulent
vegetables, as lettuce, celery, spinach, etc., should be substituted
for the starchy and saccharine.A diet largely composed of skimmed milk
renders an important service both as a nutrient and a diuretic and
depurant.Lean meats, acid fruits, and the weak alkaline mineral waters
should be the basis of a proper system of alimentation.As malarial intoxication is a cause now distinctly recognized, patients
should be removed from such influences.If this be impracticable, the
effects of the poison should, as far as possible, be removed,
especially the glandular complications.To this end, such remedies
should be employed as will affect the overgrowth of the connective
tissue, as the compound solution of iodine, the bichloride of mercury,
and the chloride of gold (or gold and sodium).Quinine will be
necessary, according to circumstances.Do we possess any means to check the overgrowth of connective tissue
{1001} in cases of sclerosis?The writer believes that those remedies
have this power to a less or greater extent which are separated by the
liver from the blood.These are chiefly the salts of gold, silver,
copper, arsenic, and mercury (chloride), and phosphorus.The most
useful of these are the chloride of gold and sodium and the chloride of
mercury, and some phosphates.The writer has had, he thinks, curative
results in the commencement of the disease from the chloride of gold
and sodium and the phosphate of sodium.German practitioners believe
that the chloride of ammonium is a powerful alterant and deobstruent,
and prescribe it in this affection to stop the overgrowth of connective
tissue.That it does have this effect can hardly be disputed, but the
daily quantity necessary is large, the taste very disagreeable, and the
stomachal effect that of an irritant.Hence it is by no means so
effective as the chlorides above mentioned.The chloride of gold and
sodium (1/10 grain) can be given at the same time with chloride of
mercury (1/20 grain) if it is desirable to combine their effects.The
writer has seen what appeared to be cases of cirrhosis in the first
stage yield to the persistent administration of phosphate of
sodium--drachm j ter in die--and the chloride of gold and sodium.When contraction of the liver has ensued, and hemorrhages, effusion
into the cavity of the peritoneum, and a high degree of
gastro-intestinal catarrh have occurred, the relief of the secondary
symptoms takes the first place in importance.There are but three modes
by which an effusion into the abdomen can be removed: by the skin, by
the kidneys, by the intestinal canal.Each of these may be employed in
turn.By the skin warm baths, vapor baths, digitalis stupes, and
especially the subcutaneous injection of pilocarpin, may be employed.These alone may be sufficient in some cases--rather rarely, however.They may all be used simultaneously or in turn to effect the purpose.A
digitalis stupe may be made to have the effect of a vapor bath: a large
one is placed on the abdomen and the body is covered with blankets,
which results in the production of abundant sweating.The vapor bath is
applied in the ordinary way, so that no explanation is needed.If there
be no contraindication in the state of the heart, pilocarpin salts can
be injected in sufficient quantity to induce active diaphoresis.These
measures proving inadequate, an attempt should be made to dispose of
the fluid by acting on the kidneys and promoting diuresis.Amongst the
diuretics in ascites, Wilks places the resin of copaiba first.The dose
ranges from two to five grains, and it may be given in combination with
gold or mercury chloride.When this remedy increases the flow of urine,
it does good, but if the quantity of urine remains unchanged, it does
no good, and should be discontinued.As the effusion of fluid is due to the portal obstruction, it follows
that depletion of the terminal radicles of this system will act most
directly on the origin of the troubles.Hydragogue cathartics have,
therefore, an important place in the treatment of ascites of hepatic
origin.One of the most generally efficient of these remedies is the
compound jalap powder, for whilst it produces free watery evacuations,
it also stimulates the kidneys somewhat.It is generally better to give
a full dose--one or two teaspoonfuls--in the early morning, so that the
disturbance caused by it will subside before the time for taking food.Several free watery evacuations should be produced by it.Sometimes the
resin or extract of podophyllin is added to the compound jalap powder
to increase its activity.{1002} Purgative combinations of colocynth,
gamboge, and resin of podophyllin are also occasionally employed, but
the most efficient hydragogue is elaterium.The last-mentioned may act
very efficiently without causing any considerable depression, but the
results obtained by it are usually fleeting.After even a very free
discharge of fluid the effusion quickly increases, and further
purgation is required.Tapping is a palliative expedient which must
sometimes be considered.With the present improved aspirator and the
antiseptic method the fluid may be withdrawn with ease and safety.It
is not necessary in any case to remove all the fluid--merely that
quantity which will relieve the pressure on the diaphragm and on the
renal vessels.The author has seen general peritonitis result from
tapping.As such a complication will increase all the difficulties of a
case, it is very desirable to prevent it by careful application of the
antiseptic method and sealing of the punctured orifice to prevent the
entrance of germs.In the protracted cases of cirrhosis there ensues, finally, a highly
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane, the bowels become very
irritable, and frequent offensive and watery discharges occur.If under
these circumstances the abdominal effusion increases, the remedies must
consist of diuretics and diaphoretics rather than purgatives.Indeed,
an exhaustive colliquative diarrhoea may require bismuth, copper, and
other astringents, combined with opium, to prevent the patient passing
into the condition of collapse.Hemorrhage by vomiting or by stool will
demand ice, subsulphate of iron, ipecac, ergotin in the form of
subcutaneous injection especially, and other remedies which have been
found useful in gastric or intestinal hemorrhage.Topical remedies are not without utility if used early.When the
changes in the liver are secondary to peritonitis of the hepatic
portion, the application of leeches and cups renders an important
service.At any time during the course of cirrhosis wet or dry cups may
be used with advantage whenever local pain, tenderness, and a catching
respiration indicate the extension of mischief to the peritoneum.The
tincture of iodine or flying blisters, or both in turn, may be applied
over the right hypochondrium after cups and leeches, or at any time
when local distress indicates the need of counter-irritants.Probably
the most efficient topical application during the hypertrophic stage of
cirrhosis is the official ung.A piece the size
of a large pea should be thoroughly rubbed in over the hepatic region
daily until some irritation of the skin is produced.When this
irritation has subsided the applications should be renewed.Suppurative Hepatitis; Abscess of the Liver.DEFINITION.--Suppurative hepatitis is an acute inflammation of the
hepatic parenchyma, terminating in suppuration.The inflammation may be
primary or due to local conditions entirely, or it may arise from
morbid processes occurring in parts or organs in anatomical relation to
the liver.CAUSES.--Climate exercises an unquestionable influence in the
production of hepatic abscess.Those warm countries visited by
dysentery, {1003} says Lombard,[83] are almost exclusively affected by
this disease.Hirsch,[84] whilst recognizing the influence of climate,
shows that the natives are not affected to the same extent as are
Europeans.Both writers maintain that hepatic abscess does not occur
frequently in the corresponding parallels of latitude in the United
States; which is true of the Atlantic border, but is not correct for
the interior continent, the valley of the Mississippi, and its
tributaries.In this vast region the conditions for the production of
hepatitis exist abundantly.The mean annual temperature, the
malaria-breeding soil, the social and personal habits of the people
(males), combine to favor the production of hepatic abscess.As the
native population and females in tropical countries are not affected,
there must be other influences to the action of which the high
temperature contributes.The rich and highly-seasoned food in which
Europeans indulge and the large consumption of alcoholic drinks are
doubtless responsible in a large measure for the occurrence of this
malady in such excessive proportions amongst them.[Footnote 83: _Traite de Climatologie medicale_, tome iv.[Footnote 84: _Handbuch der historisch-geographischen Pathologie_, Band
ii.Sex has a remarkable influence in securing immunity against hepatic
abscess.According to the statistics of Rouis,[85] of 258 cases of
hepatic abscess, only 8 were in women.He rightly enough attributes
this exemption rather to the difference in habits of the two sexes than
to any merely sexual peculiarity.In 12 cases observed by the writer,
only 1 was in a woman.In Waring's[86] collection of 300 fatal cases of
tropical dysentery, only 9 occurred in women.These facts are most
conclusive regarding the relatively greater frequency of the affection
in men.As might be expected, the age at which this disease occurs is
the period of adult life, when exposure to the conditions developing it
is most likely to happen.In general, then, hepatic abscess may be
referred to the period mentioned by Rouis--from twelve to seventy-five
years of age.In my own cases the youngest was eleven years and the
oldest fifty-four years of age.It is not the broken-down subject of
mature age or the weakling of youth who is attacked by hepatic abscess,
but the more vigorous and able-bodied, who have, because of their
strength and activity, been exposed to the manifold conditions
producing it.[Footnote 85: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie
d'apres des Observations recueilles dans le Nord de l'Afrique_, par J.
L. Rouis, Paris, 1860, p.[Footnote 86: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology of Some
Points connected with Abscess of the Liver_, by Ed.John Waring,
Resident Surgeon of Travancore, 1854, p.Rouis finds that a combination of the lymphatic and nervous
temperaments seems most favorable to the production of this malady.It
is certain that those who have the bodily conditions influential in the
formation of gall-stones are not unfrequently attacked by abscess.The
passage of the calculi may induce a local peritonitis of considerable
severity; their arrest in the duct, with the result of ulcerating
through, producing peritonitis and adhesions, are conditions
eventuating in the formation of an abscess always large and sometimes
of enormous size.Under such circumstances the element of temperament
has a secondary place in the aggregate of causes.Not very often hepatic abscess results from external blows, contusions,
and from penetrating wounds.The liver is so placed as to glide aside
when a blow is inflicted on the right hypochondrium, and thus escapes
{1004} direct compression.An injury which elsewhere would have but
little effect may excite suppurative inflammation in the tropical--or,
as it may be entitled, the hepatic--abscess zone.Climatic conditions,
or the changed habits of Europeans in tropical and subtropical regions,
exert a distinct influence in traumatic cases.The most important causes of hepatic abscess exist in the state of the
portal vein, hepatic artery, and the hepatic veins.In the valley of
the Mississippi and its tributaries, where abscess of the liver is a
comparatively common disease, it has been found that in a large
proportion of the cases the initial stage is an affection of the
rectum--a form of dysentery properly entitled proctitis.So far as this
vast region is concerned, the intestinal disease which precedes abscess
of the liver, and stands in a causative relation to it, is an affection
of the mucous membrane from which the inferior hemorrhoidal veins
arise.This disease, although having a dysenteric form, is not ordinary
dysentery.The onset of the disease and its symptomatic expression are
those of a mild affection of the mucous membrane of the rectum--so
insignificant in some cases as to be recalled with difficulty.In
tropical countries abscess of the liver may be associated with
dysenteric ulcerations.This relation has been frequently observed, but
is far from constant.In Waring's[87] cases, which occurred in India,
31 per cent.of the fatal cases of hepatic abscess arose during the
course of acute or chronic dysentery.De Castro of Alexandria[88] finds
that dysentery is the most frequent cause of abscess in that region,
especially in the Greek hospital.Murchison[89] considers tropical
abscess of the liver as secondary to dysentery in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but by no means in all.In non-tropical
countries abscess of the liver is found to succeed to ulcerations of
the stomach, the intestines, the bile-ducts, etc.In the case of
ulceration of any part of the mucous membrane from which the portal
vein receives branches a morbific material may be conveyed to the
liver.This morbific material may be some unknown septic principle the
presence of which in the liver will excite suppurative inflammation; it
may consist of an embolus having septic power or a merely mechanical
irritant; it may be micrococci or some other living organisms, which,
arrested in the portal radicles, set up inflammatory foci, etc.There
are many examples of hepatic abscess connected with dysenteric
ulcerations of the intestine in which no embolus can be found.Admitting the presence of the embolus originally, its disappearance is
readily understood by reference to the changes induced by suppuration.Excepting these cases there must be many in which no embolus can be
found, because none existed; an unknown septic substance has excited
the suppurative inflammation.Emboli may be lodged in the liver from
thrombi formed in the peripheral distribution of the portal vein, or
from distant parts of the systemic circulation, as in bone diseases.There has been no satisfactory explanation of the manner in which such
emboli pass the pulmonary capillaries to be lodged in the liver.At one
time there was supposed to be a special relation between injuries of
the bones of the head and hepatic abscess, but it is now known {1005}
that these cases are not more numerous than those due to osteo-myelitis
in any situation.Abscesses in the lungs are greatly more frequent than
in the liver in cases of this kind.According to Waldeyer,[90] whilst
in two-thirds of the cases of death from surgical diseases and injuries
there were abscesses in the lungs, in only 6 per cent.were there
abscesses of the liver.It is evident that the emboli entering the
systemic circulation are usually arrested in the pulmonary capillaries.Klebs maintains that such emboli consist of parasitic organisms.[Footnote 87: _On Abscess of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 88: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur Traitement
chirurgical_, par le Dr.S. V. Castro (d'Alexandrie d'Egypte).][Footnote 89: _Clinical Lectures_, _loc.[Footnote 90: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xl.Dilatation and ulceration of the bile-ducts were the principal causes
of hepatic abscess, as ascertained by Von Baerensprung, in the Berlin
Pathological Institute.Duodenal catarrh involving the orifice of the
common duct, catarrh of the biliary passages leading to obstruction,
and plugging with a gall-stone have resulted in abscess, the initial
lesion being probably rupture of one or more of the finer tubes or
inflammation leading to suppuration.[91]

[Footnote 91: Grainger Stewart, _The Edinburgh Medical Journal_,
January, 1873.]Finally, a considerable proportion of cases of hepatic abscess arise
under unknown conditions.In such cases, however, it is usually found
that there has been more or less indulgence in alcoholic drinks, or the
liver has been taxed by excesses in the use of rich foods and
condiments, or exposure to extreme degrees of temperature has occurred.In the interior valley of this continent, where hepatic abscess is
comparatively common, the causes are to be found in malarial
influences, in alcoholic indulgence, in dysenteric attacks the product
of climatic variations and improper alimentation, and in the formation
and arrest in transitu of hepatic calculi also the result of
long-continued gastro-duodenal and biliary catarrh.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Great differences of opinion have been expressed
as to the initial lesions in hepatic abscess.It is probable, however,
that these differences are due to the character of the abscess.Some
have their origin in the hepatic cells, others in the connective
tissue, and others still in the vessels.There may be a number of
points at which the suppurative process begins, or it may be limited to
one.Virchow[92] describes the initial lesion as beginning in the
cells, which first become coarsely granular, then opaque, and finally
soften, and pus appears.Klebs, who maintains the constant agency of
septic micrococci, affirms that the changes in the cells are due to
compression exerted by the mass of these organisms distending the
neighboring vessels, and then suppuration begins on the portal side of
the lobules.Liebermeister originally held that the initial lesion is
in the connective tissue; and this view is also supported by Koster,
who brings to bear experimental data.In the walls of the vessels of
the connective tissue and about them, between the hepatic cells, great
numbers of lymphoid cells accumulate.The intercellular spaces are also
distended with plasma and round cells, and in the vicinity of the
central vein the swollen hepatic cells are pressed together; soon
pus-corpuscles appear, and the proper anatomical elements are broken up
into a diffluent mass composed of fat-granules, pus-corpuscles, and
disintegrating hepatic cells.[Footnote 92: _Archiv fur path.When suppurative hepatitis arises from an embolus, or emboli, the
{1006} first step is the change in the appearance of the acini, which
are enlarged and grow softer by disintegration of their cells; then at
the centre a yellowish spot appears, and is made up of the detritus,
granules of fat, and pus.Surrounding such softening portions of the
hepatic tissue is a zone of congestion.When the morbid processes are
excited by emboli, there will be as many centres of pus-formation as
there are particles distributed by the vessels--from two or three to
fifty or more.They may be uniformly distributed through the organ or
be collected in one part.Emboli conveyed by the portal vein will be
arranged with a certain regularity and through the substance of the
liver, whilst those coming from some part of the systemic circulation
tend to form at the periphery under the capsule.Small abscesses in
close proximity unite ultimately by the softening and disintegration of
the intervening tissue.In the so-called tropical abscess, which is the variety so frequently
met with in the interior of this country, the mode of development is
different from the embolic, above described.Owing to the deposit of
some morbific matter whose nature is now unknown, the vessels dilate
and hyperaemia of the part to become the seat of suppuration ensues.The cells become cloudy, granular, and opaque from the deposit of an
albuminous matter in them.Within the area of congestion a yellowish
spot soon appears, surrounded by a translucent, pale-gray ring, and
here suppuration begins; the neighboring cells disintegrate and a
purulent collection is formed, which enlarges by the destruction in
succession of the adjacent portions of hepatic tissue.Whilst this
process is going on there is a border of deep congestion about the
abscess, fading off gradually into the normal tint of the hepatic
parenchyma; the walls of the abscess are rough and irregular from
projections of tissue just beginning to disintegrate, and the pus
burrows in various directions more or less deeply into the softening
parts.The size to which such purulent collections attain is largely
determined by the condition of the liver as a whole.If the organ
attacked is healthy otherwise and the general health is not
deteriorated, the area of the abscess may be limited by a well-defined
membrane and continue inactive for a long time.This limiting membrane
is of inflammatory origin, developed from the connective tissue, and
varies in thickness from a mere line to several.It was formerly called
a pyogenic membrane, because the pus discharged was supposed to be
formed by it.When such a limiting inflammation cannot take place, the
abscess continually enlarges by the softening and destruction of the
adjacent hepatic tissue, and may finally attain to enormous
proportions.The embolic abscesses vary in size from that of a pea to
that of an orange.The so-called tropical abscesses are usually
single--in three-fourths of the cases, according to Rouis;[93] in 62.1
per cent., according to Waring.[94] Of the fatal cases collected by the
latter author, 285 in number, a single abscess existed in 177, and
multiple abscesses in 108.there were two abscesses; in
3.6 per cent., three; and in 5.6 per cent.As regards the part of the liver in which abscess occurs, the
statistics show a great preponderance in favor of the right lobe.In
Waring's collection of 300 cases the right lobe was the {1007} seat of
the abscess in 163, or 67.3 per cent.; the left lobe was affected in
16, or 6.6 per cent.; and both lobes in 35, or 14.4 per cent.The
preponderance of cases affecting the right lobe is the more striking
when it is understood that, other parts being invaded, the right is
included with them in the morbid process.In my own cases the right
lobe was the seat of the abscess in 70 per cent.[Footnote 93: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie_,
_loc.[Footnote 94: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.connected with Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.The contents of the abscesses are affected in character by the form of
the disease, whether embolic or tropical, by its rate of development,
by the condition of the hepatic parenchyma, by the formation of a
limiting membrane, etc.In the more chronic cases, surrounded by a
dense membrane, the pus is usually laudable or dry and cheesy; in the
acute embolic cases the pus is dark brown, ichorous or grumous, and
contains a good deal of detritus of the hepatic parenchyma; and in the
tropical cases it is of a sanguinolent, dark color, or more frequently
of a grayish purulent fluid; and in the acute forms contains much
broken-down tissue, whilst in the chronic cases, in direct ratio to
their duration, the pus approaches the laudable character.The source
of an abscess discharging from the neighborhood of the liver may be
ascertained by a microscopical examination and the discovery of the
hepatic elements (the cells) in the fluid.Bile may also be present in
the pus.The abscesses not confined by a limiting membrane constantly enlarge by
the softening and disintegration of the adjacent liver substance, and
those enclosed or encysted after a period of quiescence of variable
duration begin active efforts to establish communication outwardly.The
point to which a purulent collection in the liver tends becomes an
important element in diagnosis and in treatment.As the abscess
approaches the surface of the liver the capsule inflames, and if
adhesions are not formed more or less sloughing occurs, and the
contents are discharged into the abdominal cavity.Adhesions may form
to the parietes, an external swelling appear, and after a time
discharge take place in the right hypochondrium at some point.Pus may
escape at the umbilicus, in the right inguinal region, posteriorly at
the sacro-iliac junction, and in other situations.Adhesions may form
to the stomach, duodenum, the ascending vena cava, to the diaphragm
opening the thoracic cavity, the pericardium, or the mediastinum; and
the accumulated pus may thus find a vent.According to Waring,[95] the
termination of hepatic abscess is as follows: Of 300 cases, 169, or
56.3 per cent., remained intact--that is, had not advanced beyond the
liver; 48 were evacuated by operation, or 16 per cent.; 14, or 4.6 per
cent., entered the thoracic cavity; 28, or 9.3 per cent., opened into
the right lung; 15, or 5 per cent., entered the abdominal cavity; 7, or
2.3 per cent., opened into the colon; 1 entered the stomach; 3 entered
the hepatic vein near the vena cava; 1 communicated with the hepatic
ducts, 2 with the right kidney, etc.The termination of 162 fatal
cases, according to Rouis,[96] was as follows: 125 proved fatal in
consequence of the extent of the abscess or of the severity of the
accompanying dysentery; 3 terminated by gangrene of the walls of the
abscess; 3 by peritonitis; 12 by opening of the abscess; 2 by rupture
of adhesions; 11 by opening of the abscess into the pleura; 2 by
intercurrent and 3 by secondary pneumonia.Notwithstanding the
differences {1008} in the mode of expressing the conditions, the
general results are the same.[Footnote 95: _An Inquiry into the Statistics and Pathology, etc.of
Abscess in the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 96: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques, etc._, p.An abscess of the liver having discharged in a favorable way, healing
may take place.There may be such an extent of injury--the whole
secreting structure of the liver being destroyed--that repair is beyond
the power of the organism.The best results are attained when discharge
occurs by the most direct route externally; the next, by way of the
right lung; the third, by the stomach or intestine.Repair cannot be
hoped for when a large part of the normal hepatic structure is
destroyed.When the pus escapes the walls of the abscess approximate,
and union takes place by connective tissue, leaving a radiated or a
merely linear cicatrix to mark the site of the purulent collection.So
perfectly does repair take place in suitable subjects that no trace of
the lesion may remain.Those portions of the liver outside the borders of the abscess, and
beyond the vascular derangements produced by it, may be entirely
healthy.In the cases terminating in recovery the portion of the liver
unaffected by abscess continues to functionate normally.More or less
of the liver may be destroyed; hence it follows that recovery may be
partial.According to the damage done to the proper secreting structure
of the organ will the recovery be partial, limited, or complete.SYMPTOMS.--The existence of an abscess of the liver is determined by
systemic or general and by local symptoms, and they may be acute or
chronic.Systemic.--In acute cases the beginning of mischief may be announced by
a rigor, but more frequently this indicates the onset of suppuration,
and is one of the phenomena of the chronic form.As the disease occurs
in this country, a chill takes place suddenly in a case which presents
the usual symptoms of proctitis (dysentery) during the course of this
affection or soon after its apparent cure; then a febrile movement
occurs, and subsequently an irregular intermittent, the rise of
temperature being preceded by rigors or mere transient chilliness.With
these febrile symptoms there may be associated uneasiness in the right
hypochondrium, acute pain, or a feeling of weight and pressure, with
jaundice, etc.The fever is septicaemic, intermittent, or remittent if
it have any special type.In the septicaemic form the rigors are
severe, occur irregularly, sometimes daily, sometimes twice a day, and
at intervals of two or three days or longer; the fever rises to a high
point--104 degrees, 105 degrees, or higher--and the sweats are profuse.In the intermittent form the fever usually has the quotidian type; some
slight chilliness is experienced in the early morning as a rule, and
the exacerbation occurs in the afternoon and evening, the sweating
being slight toward the morning.More frequently, in the writer's
observation, the type of fever has been remittent, with periodical, but
not regularly so, exacerbations.In such cases the morning temperature
has been at 99 degrees or 100 degrees, and the evening 102 degrees or
103 degrees.Such a range of temperature may be present during three or
four weeks or even longer, the abscess gradually making its way
outwardly.Conclusions may be drawn from the behavior of the febrile
movement as to the character of the local affection, with the
limitations imposed by the necessary uncertainty of the data.If the
chills are decided rigors, the fever {1009} high, and the sweats
profuse, either pyaemic abscesses or large tropical abscesses
implicating neighboring organs exist.The simple intermittent,
especially the remittent, form of fever suggests abscesses of medium
size making their way outwardly, with only partial injury to the parts
traversed.In a certain portion of the cases the type of fever changes
when a large accumulation of pus takes place; after several weeks of a
mild remittent the fever becomes irregularly intermittent with rigors,
strong exacerbations, and profuse sweats.In protracted cases the fever
assumes the typhoid aspect; there is profound adynamia, dry tongue,
sordes, diarrhoea, and the usual symptoms of this state.When the
secreting structure of the liver is destroyed to a large extent, the
condition of acholia is superadded to the typhoid state.The pulse is irritable and quick from the beginning of the symptoms.In
a few instances a slow pulse, such as occurs in jaundice, has been
observed, but generally the number of cardiac contractions is in a
direct ratio with the body temperature.When typhoid symptoms supervene
in advanced cases the pulse becomes weak and dicrotic.The chronic cases with
mild remittent fever have little more than slight moisture of the
surface, whilst the acute and pyaemic cases are characterized by
profuse sweats.If to an irregular febrile movement, preceded by chills
and followed by sweats, there is added the tendency to sweat on all
occasions--on slight exertion, on sleeping, under any
excitement--suppuration may be suspected.General malaise, a sense of fatigue and exhaustion, and progressive
decline in flesh and strength occur.It is remarkable, however, how
some obese subjects preserve their roundness and apparent fulness of
habit.Usually, however, emaciation advances pari passu with the
progress of the suppuration.The more acute the symptoms, the more
rapid the wasting.When an encysted abscess develops in the course of a
chronic dysentery, there may be no appreciable change in the condition
of the patient properly attributable to the additional lesion.The loss
of appetite, the frequent vomiting, and often the dysenteric troubles,
contribute materially to the exhaustion and the wasting of the tissues.The stomachal derangements may be present with the initial symptoms,
but they are usually more pronounced when the abscess attains to
considerable size.A peculiar tint of the skin, especially of the face, is observed in
those cases without jaundice.There is an earthy or sallow hue, which
to the practised eye signifies suppuration.Jaundice is present in a
less proportion of cases.In 13 of Waring's cases the skin is said to
be sallow.In Rouis's collection icterus was present in 17 per cent.,
or 26 times in 155 patients.According to Waring, jaundice is rarely
present.In the 12 cases in my own hands actual jaundice was not
present in one, but 9 had an earthy hue or presented some yellowness of
the conjunctiva.In fact, jaundice does not have the importance as a
symptom which might, a priori, have been expected.The mental condition of these subjects is that of depression.They
sleep poorly, are disturbed by vivid dreams of a horrifying character,
and the nocturnal sweats increase the tendency to wakefulness.Daniel went back to the bedroom.Hypochondria, or at least marked symptoms of mental depression, as
{1010} Hammond[97] has shown, are present in many cases.So frequent,
indeed, seems to be the association of a depressed mental state with
hepatic abscess that in every case of the former the liver should be
carefully explored.Hammond goes so far as to say that in every case of
hypochondriasis puncture of the liver with the aspirator needle should
be practised when any symptom, however indefinite, indicates the
existence of an abscess.Besides the condition of hypochondriasis in
many cases, there may be stupor, hebetude of mind, confusion due to
acholia, cholaemia (Flint's cholesteraemia), when a large part of the
liver structure is destroyed.[Footnote 97: _Neurological Contributions_, vol.68: "On
Obscure Abscesses of the Liver, their association with Hypochondria and
other Forms of Mental Derangement, and their Treatment."]Sweating has already been referred to as a phenomenon connected with
the febrile movement.It is necessary to state further that this may
vary in amount from a mere moisture of the surface connected with
sleep, or it may be a profuse diaphoresis with which the febrile
paroxysm terminates.As a systemic symptom, sweating is strongly
suggestive of suppuration, and may therefore be extremely significant,
in this connection, of suppuration in the liver.According to Waring,
of 75 cases specifically interrogated on this point, 72 presented this
symptom.123) to it as very constantly present, coming
on chiefly at night--sometimes generally over the body, sometimes
limited to the head, and always accompanied by an accelerated pulse.The urine in cases of hepatic abscess varies; it is never normal.There
may be merely an excess of urates--a symptom common enough in all
febrile affections and in suppuration.It is usually high-,
deficient in urea, and contains leucin and tyrosin, and not often
bile-pigment, except when jaundice is present, which, as we have seen,
is rather uncommon.It should be borne in mind that whilst the above-described mental and
cerebral and other symptoms are often present, they are by no means
invariably so.There are cases, usually of encysted abscess, in which
no functional disturbance of any kind exists.But the systemic symptoms
are by no means so important as the local.To these we must now direct
attention.Local.--The position, size, and shape of the liver are not without
significance, but it is strictly correct to say that an abscess of the
liver may exist without any change in the size of the organ or in its
relations to the surrounding organs.In 2 of 12 cases in the hands of
the writer there was no evidence of enlargement of the right
hypochondrium, but a difference in circumference of half an inch was
ascertained in favor of the left side.In 4 cases there was no
appreciable change in the size of the hepatic region; in one-half there
was an increase in the area of hepatic dulness.In one of the cases in
which the left side was the larger the abscess was of enormous extent,
and discharged by the stomach and intestine.The enlargement of the
liver may be very great.In one instance observed by the author the
abscess reached to the upper border of the third rib.Rarely does the
dulness extend more than two fingers' breadth below the inferior margin
of the ribs, although cases are reported in which the enlarged organ
reached to the crest of the ileum.As a rule, the diaphragm is pushed
up and the lung displaced, rather than the dulness is extended
downward.When the first tumefaction {1011} due to the initial
congestion takes place, the organ may be much larger than subsequently,
the pus becoming encysted and the normal state outside of the area of
suppuration being restored.The purulent collection in a large
proportion of the cases taking place in the right lobe, the extension
of dulness is in the same lines as the normal.When, however, the right
lobe is the seat of abscess, or a purulent collection forms around an
impacted calculus, the swelling may appear in the outer border of the
epigastrium next the ribs, and the increased area of dulness will be
across the epigastrium and occupying the superior portion of this
region.The general experience on these points corresponds to my own.Thus, according to Waring, there was an evident enlargement of the
liver in 90 cases, and no enlargement in 11.In most cases the increase
in size gives the impression of a fulness or hardness of the liver or
of a diffused swelling or tumor of the epigastrium.In some instances
the right hypochondrium is bulged out, the intercostal spaces widened,
and the side appears to be or is actually elevated, and occasionally
enlarged veins form, as in cases of the obstructed portal circulation
of cirrhosis.In a case recently presented at Jefferson College
Hospital clinic by the author, a globular swelling formed in the walls
of the abdomen just below the inferior margin of the ribs near the site
of the gall-bladder, and was held by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of this locality; but it had the history of an hepatic abscess, and
ultimately proved to be one.Rouis furnishes statistical evidence of
the time when the increase in size of the liver occurs with respect to
the other symptoms.He has noted an enlargement of the organ 73 times
in 122 cases.Of 51 cases, the liver was enlarged in 12 before
suppuration, in 22 at the onset of suppuration, and in 17 after
suppuration was established.In 49 examples the liver was enlarged in 2
before any other symptom was manifest, in 8 at the onset of symptoms,
and in 39 after the symptoms were well declared.Fluctuation is not referred to by the writers in general, and there are
no statistical data on this symptom, so far as our observation extends.No symptom could be more uncertain in all doubtful cases.When a large
accumulation has taken place and the parietes of the sac are thin,
fluctuation may be detected, but it cannot then be regarded as
decisive.When an abscess in the interior of the right lobe is
encysted, no fluctuation can be effected.The best mode of eliciting
fluctuation, according to Hammond, is to place the extremities of the
fingers of the left hand in the depression between the ribs over the
most prominent part of the right hypochondrium, and gently tap with the
fingers of the right hand the right border of the epigastrium.In 3 out
of 12 cases this method has apparently elicited fluctuation in my own
experience.Sandra moved to the hallway.The elasticity of the hepatic structure is such that the
method of palpation, however practised, must return a sensation nearly
allied to that of fluctuation in a purulent accumulation.It is
certain, therefore, that errors of observation are liable to occur, and
hence conclusions based on an apparent fluctuation should be accepted
with caution; under any circumstances it should be very distinct, and
even then should not be acted on unless supported by other suggestive
evidence.The uneasiness or pain felt in the right hypochondrium varies greatly
according to the position of the abscess, the degree and kind of
pressure exerted on neighboring organs, and the period of its
development.When {1012} the peritoneal layer of the liver is involved,
there will usually be acute pain, and this happens at two periods--when
the abscess first forms from an impacted calculus or from any cause
which includes the peritoneum, and subsequently when the pus, making
its way from the liver, excites inflammation in the peritoneal
investment of the liver, of the diaphragm, or affects ultimately the
pleural membrane.In the so-called pyaemic abscesses there is very
little pain, and in the case of the large single abscess in the
interior of the right lobe there is rather a sensation of weight or of
heaviness, of dragging than of acute pain.When the capsule of the
liver is put on the stretch or the peritoneal investment is inflamed,
then acute pain may be felt.More or less pain or local distress is, on
the whole, a usual symptom.According to Rouis,[98] local pain is
present in 141 out of 177 cases, or in 85 per cent.The statistics of
Waring[99] closely correspond, for of 173 patients affected with this
malady, in 153 there was more or less pain referable to the affected
organ.The position of the pain has some influence in determining the
seat of the malady, and often indicates the position of the abscess.As
respects the character of the pain, there is little uniformity; in
general it is a tensive, heavy, throbbing sensation, but under the
circumstances above mentioned this may have an acute or lancinating
character, as when the capsule or the peritoneal investment of the
organ becomes involved.[Footnote 98: _Recherches, etc._, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 99: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

Besides the pain directly referable to the liver there are painful
sensations felt in the neighboring parts, of very considerable
significance.These are often described as sympathetic pains, and are
referred to the shoulder--to the right shoulder when the right lobe is
the seat of mischief, and to the left shoulder when the abscess forms
in the left lobe of the liver.Although this statement has many
limitations, it is not without diagnostic importance.Rouis ascertained
the existence of the shoulder pain in 17 per cent.of the cases, or in
28 in a total of 163.Waring reports that this symptom was observed in
52 in a total of 76 cases.The right shoulder seems to be affected in
about the same ratio as the right lobe of the liver in 25 times out of
26 cases, according to Rouis.The shoulder pain appears at the same
time, in a majority of cases, as the hepatic pain, but it is very
capricious.It is most frequently at the top of the shoulder, but it
may be at the end of the clavicle, in the scapula, or extend down the
arm.Its duration is very irregular, appearing occasionally during the
existence of the disease, coming on at the outset, and lasting weeks or
months, or only felt on pressure over the liver, on coughing, or on
taking a full inspiration.The character of the pain is equally
uncertain.It is usually heavy, tensive, stinging, or may be merely a
sensation of soreness or of uneasiness or of weariness.The behavior of
the shoulder pain is partly explicable by reference to the path by
which the reflex is conveyed.As Luschka[100] has shown, the filaments
of the phrenic nerve supplied to the suspensory ligament and capsule of
the liver, put on the stretch or irritated, convey the impression to
the cord, and it is reflected over the sensory fibres of the fourth
cervical distributed to the shoulder.Rouis reports an instance in
which the deltoid was wasted.[Footnote 100: Quoted by Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

The decubitus of patients affected with hepatic abscess is often {1013}
extremely characteristic.To obviate the pressure on the swollen and
inflamed organ the position assumed is right lateral-dorsal, the body
inclined to the right, the right thigh flexed on the pelvis, and the
spinal column so curved as to relax the abdominal muscles of the right
side.When the pain and tenderness are not great there may be frequent
changes of position, but in repose the lateral-dorsal decubitus is
assumed.When the suppuration is well advanced and the accumulation
large, the patient keeps in that position nearly constantly.If
pressure interferes with the normal play of the lungs, and dyspnoea is
produced on assuming the recumbent posture, the attitude taken
expresses this state also: then the decubitus is lateral and partly
dorsal, but the body is raised to a half-upright.There are many
exceptions to these rules.Some lie easiest on the back, some on the
left side; but it is quite certain that much the largest number, when
uninfluenced by special circumstances, naturally place themselves as
above described.Jaundice is amongst the rarer symptoms.Rouis finds it to be present in
17 per cent.of the cases, Thierfelder in 16 per cent., and Waring in
somewhat less than 6 per cent.Referring to my own observation,
jaundice has rarely been present, but some yellowness of the
conjunctivae and a faint yellow tint of the skin generally have been
evident.The peculiar aspect of the countenance connected with
suppuration has rarely been wanting.When jaundice does occur, it is
referable to two conditions--to a catarrhal swelling of the bile-ducts,
which may be coincident with the onset of the suppurative inflammation;
to the pressure of the abscess on the hepatic or common duct, which
must happen at a late period.As an abscess of the liver forms and enlarges, pressure is exerted on
neighboring organs, producing very decided disturbances.Nausea and
vomiting, anorexia, a coated or glazed tongue, diarrhoea or dysentery,
are amongst the disorders of this kind involving the digestive
apparatus.There is nothing characteristic in the condition of the tongue which
does not belong to suppuration in any situation.Nevertheless, there
are some appearances that have a certain value in conjunction with
other diagnostic signs.At the onset of the suppurative inflammation
the tongue is more or less heavily coated, but as the case proceeds it
becomes dry and glazed in parts, whilst covered with a well-defined
membrane-like crust at the base and margins.This appearance is very
characteristic of the cases of suppuration, the abscess enlarging.In a
very important case observed by me lately there was a well-marked
diphtheritic-like exudation of the tongue and fauces toward the
termination of the case, the membrane forming as the pus accumulated.This appearance was coincident with a typhoid state.Nausea and vomiting appear with the beginning of symptoms, are
associated with the general signs of systemic disturbance, and are
especially prominent when an accumulation of pus takes place, being due
under these circumstances to pressure on the hepatic and solar plexuses
or to direct encroachment on the stomach--probably to both causes.The
frequency and persistence of the vomiting are points of much diagnostic
importance, according to Maclean[101] and Fayrer,[102] which I {1014}
am able to fully confirm from my own experience.The matters ejected by
vomiting consist of the contents of the stomach--glairy mucus, the
accumulation in the gall-bladder, altered blood (coffee-grounds)--and
the contents of the abscess if it discharge by the stomach.The
vomiting is most apt to occur during the febrile exacerbation or at the
time of sweating.The statistics are conclusive as to the frequency of
vomiting as a symptom.Of 84 cases in which special reference was made
to this point, in 74 nausea or vomiting existed.In my own experience
this symptom has never been wanting.[Footnote 101: "The Diagnostic Value of Uncontrollable Vomiting," by W.
C. Maclean, _Brit.Journ._, August 1, 1873.][Footnote 102: _Ibid._, September 26, 1873.]The relation between abscess of the liver and dysentery has been much
discussed.Under the head of Causes the influence of dysentery as a
pathogenetic factor has already been examined.We have now to study its
symptomatic relations.A considerable proportion of the cases occurring
in this country have been preceded by proctitis--simple, sporadic
dysentery affecting the rectum.In India a close relationship has been
traced between ulcerations of the intestinal canal and abscess.of the cases have occurred in those
who were actually suffering from dysentery or recent or old
ulcerations.As observed by Rouis in Algiers, out of 143 cases there
were 128 with dysentery, or 90 per cent.Budd[103] long ago maintained
that a peculiar poison generated at an open ulceration in the intestine
was the true cause.Moxon,[104] Dickinson, and others have lately
reaffirmed this explanation.A case by the latter[105] casts a strong
light on this question: A patient had extensive dysenteric ulceration
of the intestine and an abscess of the liver, without any symptoms
indicating their existence.Such a case teaches the instructive lesson
that dysenteric ulcerations may escape detection, and hence the
connection between abscess and the intestinal lesion remains unknown.In a small proportion of cases--about 5 per cent.--dysentery is a
result, apparently, of hepatic abscess.Whether the relation is
admitted to exist or not, it is a curious fact that in so many cases
ulcerative disease of the intestinal canal accompanies the hepatic
affection.Hemorrhoids, prolapse of the rectum, gastro-intestinal
catarrh, etc.are produced by the pressure of an enlarging abscess on
the portal vein.[Footnote 103: _Diseases of the Liver_, 3d ed., p.[Footnote 104: _Pathological Transactions_, 1862 and subsequently.Numerous cases are recorded in the various volumes up to 1880.][Footnote 105: _Ibid._, vol.The urine contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, is usually
loaded with urates, and the amount of urea may be deficient when much
of the hepatic tissue is destroyed.From the beginning of symptoms some cough is experienced: it is short
and dry, but after a time in many cases the cough is catching and
painful, and finally may be accompanied by profuse purulent
expectoration.The breathing is short and catching when by the upward
extension of the mischief the diaphragm is encroached on, and may
become very painful when the pleura is inflamed.Ulceration of an
abscess into the lungs is announced by the signs of a local
pleuro-pneumonia--by the catching inspiration, the friction sound, the
crepitant rale, the bronchophony and bronchial breathing, and bloody
sputa usually, etc.Some time before the abscess really reaches the
diaphragm, preparation is made in the lung for the discharge through a
bronchus.The author has seen {1015} many examples of this, and a very
striking illustration of the same fact is afforded in a case by
Dickinson,[106] in which an abscess holding about four ounces was
contained in the upper part of the right lobe; its walls were irregular
and not lined by a limiting membrane.It is further stated that the
"right pleura was coated with flocculent lymph, and the cavity
contained serous fluid," etc.Here, in advance of the abscess,
preparation was made for its discharge through the lung.The tendency
of an abscess of the abdomen to external discharge is manifested in two
directions: those of the upper part tend to discharge through the
lungs, those of the lower part through the natural openings below.Abscesses of the liver come within the former rule, but it is not of
invariable application, since some discharge by the stomach or
intestine, some externally; yet a large proportion make their way
through the lungs.Another symptom referable to the pulmonary organs in
cases of hepatic abscess is singultus, or hiccough.This is a symptom
of the period of discharge rather, and is often extremely protracted
and exhausting.Pericarditis occurs in those cases in which discharge
takes place in this direction, and it may develop, as does pleuritis,
in advance of any change in the diaphragm.This preparation of the
thoracic organs for external discharge seems almost like a conscious
purpose, as if an intelligent supervision of these processes were
exercised.[Footnote 106: _Transactions of the Pathological Society_, vol.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As the facts already given have
sufficiently shown, the course of abscess of the liver is extremely
uncertain.From the beginning to the end there may not be a single
indication of its presence.On the other hand, a well-marked case is
perfectly characteristic.Abscesses of the liver are acute and
chronic--the former of short duration, accompanying pyaemia, portal
phlebitis, and similar conditions; the latter, arising in the course of
chronic dysentery or from unknown causes, especially if encysted,
remaining latent for weeks or months.The course of an abscess is much
influenced by the direction taken by the pus in the attempt at
discharge.This portion of the subject requires careful statement and
thorough treatment, and we therefore present it somewhat in detail.Beginning with his individual observations, the abscess in the author's
12 cases discharged--3 externally, 5 by the lungs, and 4 by the stomach
or intestines.In Waring's[107] collection of 300 fatal cases, 169
remained intact at death, 48 were operated on; consequently, only 83
are left for the purpose of this comparison.Of 83 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging spontaneously in some direction, 42 escaped into
the thoracic cavity or by the right lung (in 28); into the abdominal
cavity (15) or stomach (1) or intestine (7), 23; externally 2, besides
in special directions to be hereafter referred to.Rouis[108] has
tabulated the results in 30 cases of abscess fatal without an operative
influence.Of these, 2 discharged externally, 17 by the thorax (15 by
the lung), 5 by the stomach, 4 by the intestine, and 2 by the biliary
canals.[Footnote 107: _An Inquiry, etc.into Abscess of the Liver_, _loc.[Footnote 108: _Recherches sur les Suppurations endemiques du Foie,
etc._, _loc.The appearances presented when the discharge takes place through the
external parts are by no means uniform.When the epigastric or
umbilical region is the point of discharge, a globular tumor forms,
which may {1016} be mistaken for a fibroid or fatty growth; softening
in the centre of the mass occurs, and ultimately the pus is discharged.If the pus makes its way outwardly through the right hypochondrium, the
tumor formed is furrowed by the attachment to the ribs, and several
openings usually occur.The pus may burrow under the skin for some
distance and point in the axilla, or, making its way along the
suspensory ligament, emerge at the navel, or, descending, appear in the
lumbar region or under Poupart's ligament.As the statistics prove, the most usual route for discharge to take
place is by the thoracic cavity, especially the right lung.Some time
in advance of an opening in the diaphragm a localized pleuro-pneumonia
occurs, adhesions form between the pulmonary and costal pleura, and a
channel is tunnelled out for the passage of the pus to a bronchus.The
discharge of pus suddenly occurs after some days of cough and bloody
expectoration.Even in favorable cases the amount is so large that the
patient has extreme difficulty in disposing of it, and in unfavorable
cases, the quantity being large, the patient's life is ended by apnoea.In still other cases an extensive purulent accumulation may form in the
pleural cavity, the lung is compressed, and all the phenomena of an
empyema superadded to those of a hepatic abscess.In a case reported by
Westphalen[109] all the bile secreted by the patient came out by an
opening in the fifth intercostal space.The empyema thus induced may
indeed be the principal lesion, as in the case of the late Gen.Breckenridge, on whom thoracentesis was performed by Sayre of New York,
and in a case reported by Lower.[110] So far from this being uncommon,
as asserted by Thierfelder, when an abscess of the liver approaches the
diaphragm inflammatory symptoms begin on the pleural side, and thus
pyothorax may occur in advance of the perforation of this septum.[Footnote 109: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.Med._, 1873, Band xi.[Footnote 110: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1864, p.The opening of an hepatic abscess into the pericardium is rare, since
in Waring's collection of 300 fatal cases there was not one.When it
does occur, pain is experienced about the heart; the action of the
organ becomes irregular; praecordial anxiety and oppression are felt;
suffocative attacks occur; and very soon the symptoms of pericarditis
arise.Perforation of the ascending vena cava or of the hepatic vein
happens in about 2 per cent.When a quantity of pus is
thus turned into the circulation, disastrous results follow, not so
much from the infective nature of the pus as from the sudden increased
pressure within the vascular system and the labor imposed on the heart,
already failing.The escape of the pus into the peritoneal cavity occurs in about 11 per
cent.of the cases of spontaneous evacuation, according to Waring.Of
the 162 fatal cases collected by Rouis, 14 opened into the
peritoneum--about the same proportion as Waring gives.When discharge
takes place into the peritoneum, the patient passes into a condition of
collapse, or peritonitis is excited and rapidly proves fatal.In rare
instances the inflammatory reaction is restricted to a small area,
ulceration takes place through the abdominal parietes, and thus
discharge is effected.An opening may be made into the intestine or into the pelvis of the
kidney.In the former case pus is discharged by stool or by vomit, and
often in enormous quantity; in the latter by the urine, frequent and
{1017} painful micturition, with much pus, being the evidence of the
accident.In either case communication may be kept up with the abscess,
and the patient be worn out with the exhausting discharge maintained by
the intercommunication between the abscess and the canal through which
discharge takes place.Cases of hepatic abscess prove fatal without perforation.In Waring's
collection of 300 cases, 169 remained intact, in the words of the
author--that is, did not extend beyond the boundaries of the liver.Of
203 cases collected by Rouis, 96 did not extend beyond the liver.According to Thierfelder, about one-half of the cases of hepatic
abscess perforate the liver.These statistics therefore closely
correspond, and the general conclusion is very nearly expressed in the
formulated statement of Thierfelder.The duration of hepatic abscess cannot readily be expressed in figures.The acute cases terminate early by reason of the various complicating
conditions.The chronic cases are much influenced in their duration by
the presence of a limiting membrane, for if this be formed the duration
will be protracted over weeks or months; and those cases not thus
confined are necessarily of shorter duration.A period of latency may
result when the extension of the morbid process is thus hindered.Forming a conclusion from the general conduct of the cases, it may be
said that the duration of hepatic abscess is from two weeks to six
months.Of 220 cases collected by Waring, the average duration was 39
days.Rouis fixes the average duration in 179 cases at 60 days.Of
Waring's cases, the largest number (59) terminated in from 10 to 20
days; whilst Rouis places the maximum number (104) at from 11 to 60
days, the shortest duration of any case being 10 days, and the longest
480 days.The termination may be accelerated by the manner of discharge, as when
the abscess opens into the ascending vena cava, into the sac of the
pericardium, or into the peritoneal cavity.In my own cases, carefully
selected for these observations, death occurred in one during discharge
by the right lung, one within twelve hours after discharge by the
intestine, and one within ten days after discharge by the stomach and
intestine, the mortality of the whole being 75 per cent.In Waring's
collection of 300 fatal cases, 169 died whilst the abscess was still
intact--that is, in the liver.The mortality from abscess of the liver is very large.In Rouis's
collection of 203 cases, 162 died, 39 recovered entirely, and 2
improved; 80 per cent., therefore, proved fatal.According to De
Castro,[111] whose observations were made at Alexandria, Egypt, 93 in
208 cases died, this being 72.5 per cent.According to Ramirez,[112] of
11 cases of which an account is given in his memoir, 10 died and 1
recovered--a mortality of 90 per cent.40) also gives the
results arrived at by the Medico-chirurgical Society of Alexandria, who
collected 72 cases of abscess, of which 58 died, making the percentage
of deaths 80.5.Various circumstances besides the abscess affect the
result.An early successful operation, the mode of discharge, the
amount of hepatic tissue destroyed by the {1018} suppuration, the
extent of pre-existing lesions--especially ulcerations of the
intestinal canal--are important factors in the result.In respect to
some of these we have valuable statistical data.The discharge through
the lungs is the most favorable route, next by the parietes of the
abdomen, and lastly by the intestinal canal.One-half of those cases in
which discharge is effected by the right lung get well.This is my own
experience, and it accords with the observations of Rouis, of De
Castro, and others.Rouis gives the result in 30 cases of hepatic
abscess discharging by the right lung; of these 15 recovered.Of 25
cases observed by De Castro, discharging by the lungs, 19 recovered.Next to the discharge by the bronchi, the most favorable mode of exit
is externally, through the parietes of the abdomen; much less favorable
is by the stomach or intestine; but still more fatal is the discharge
into the cavity of the peritoneum.When the abscesses are multiple and
due to pyaemia, the termination is always in death.The numerous
lesions besides the hepatic accelerate the fatal issue.In the case of
large single abscesses the result is in a great measure due to
exhaustion from protracted suppuration.When in addition to the
formation of a great quantity of pus there is frequent vomiting and
rejection of aliment, the failure of strength is proportionally rapid.In favorable cases, after an abscess is evacuated through the right
lung, recovery takes place promptly.When the discharge occurs through
the abdominal wall, the process is much slower, and often fistulous
passages with several orifices, very slow to heal, are formed.Complete
recovery may ultimately take place.The recovery will be incomplete in
those cases with large loss of hepatic substance, especially when this
coincides, as it usually does, with catarrh, ulceration, and other
lesions of the intestinal tube.Again, the recovery will be incomplete
in those cases where there are imperfect healing of the abscess site
and a fistulous communication with the exterior.[Footnote 111: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, _loc.[Footnote 112: _Du Traitement des Abces du Foie, Observations
receuilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, _loc.cit._]

It is possible for the arrest and healing of a suppurative inflammation
of the liver to take place without discharge.Under such circumstances
the watery part of the pus is absorbed, the solid constituents undergo
a fatty metamorphosis, are emulsionized, and thus absorbed, and
gradually closure of the damaged area is effected by a
connective-tissue formation.We must, however, accept with caution
those examples of this process which are supposed to have occurred
because radiating cicatrices are discovered on the surface of the
liver.In a case of hepatic abscess discharging through the lung, known
to the writer, after death, which occurred fifteen years subsequently,
there was no trace of the mischief, so perfectly had repair been
effected.Radiating cicatrices are so often of syphilitic origin that
they cannot be accepted as proof of the former existence of an abscess.DIAGNOSIS.--He who finds the diagnosis of abscess of the liver easy
under all circumstances can have had but little experience with the
numerous difficulties in the way of a correct opinion.There are cases
so plain that the most casual inspection suffices to form a conclusion;
there are cases so difficult that the most elaborate study fails to
unravel the mystery.The maladies with which hepatic abscess may be
confounded are echinococcus of the liver, dropsy of the gall-bladder,
cancer, abscess of the abdominal wall, empyema, or hydrothorax, etc.As
regards echinococcus, the difference consists in the slow and painless
enlargement characteristic of echinococcus, and the absence of any
symptoms other than those {1019} due to the mere pressure of the
enlarging mass.In abscess there may be no apparent enlargement, or the
increase in the area of dulness may be very great, or after a period of
increase of size there may be contraction due to the formation of pus,
and hence limitation of the inflammation; finally, the accumulation of
fluid may be sufficient to cause dulness up to the inferior margin of
the second rib.There are no corresponding changes of size in the
echinococcus cyst.Furthermore, abscess of the liver large enough to be
recognized by the increased dimensions of the organ will be accompanied
by more or less pain in the right hypochondrium and by a septicaemic
fever.On the other hand, an echinococcus tumor is not accompanied by
fever, pain, or tenderness, and it has that peculiar elastic trembling
known as the purring tremor.The most certain means of differential
diagnosis is the use of an aspiration-needle and the withdrawal of a
portion of the fluid.The presence of pus with hepatic cells will be
conclusive of abscess, whilst a serous fluid with echinococci hooklets
will prove the existence of the echinococcus cyst.In cases of dropsy of the gall-bladder there are no febrile symptoms,
no chills, and the tenderness when present is limited to the pyriform
body, the seat of the accumulation of fluid, and no general enlargement
of the liver can be made out.At the point of swelling fluctuation may
be detected, or if the gall-bladder is filled with calculi the
sensation imparted to the touch is that of a hard, nodular body of an
area and position corresponding to that of the gall-bladder.Tapping
the gall-bladder, an easy and safe procedure, will resolve all doubts.When an impaction of a gall-stone is the cause of abscess, the clinical
history is eminently characteristic: there are attacks of hepatic
colic, after one of which the chills, fever, and sweats belonging to
hepatic abscess occur.The differentiation of cancer of the liver from abscess rests on the
following considerations: In cancer there is slow enlargement, with
pain; a more or less nodular state of the organ without fluctuation;
usually ascites; no rigors; no fever and sweats.In abscess the liver
may or may not be enlarged; there are rigors, fever, and sweating, and
the surface of the organ, so far as it can be reached, is smooth and
elastic, and it may be fluctuating.Cancer happens in persons after
middle life, develops very slowly, and is accompanied by a peculiar
cachexia; abscess occurs at any period, very often succeeds to or is
accompanied by dysentery and by the usual phenomena of suppuration.It is extremely difficult to separate an abscess in the abdominal wall,
in the right hypochondrium, or a tumor in this region, from an abscess
of the liver.The history of the case, the existence of a dysentery or
of an apparent intermittent or remittent fever before the appearance of
a purulent collection, will indicate the liver as the probable source
of the trouble.Attention has already been called to a case in which an
abscess of the liver was supposed by an eminent surgeon to be a tumor
of the abdominal wall.The history in this case of an obstinate
remittent fever, followed by the appearance of a tumor of the
hypochondrium and by a preliminary discharge at the umbilicus, clearly
indicated the nature of the trouble.In the absence of any history of
the case it is extremely difficult to fix the origin of a suppurating
tumor originating, apparently, in the depth of the right hypochondrium.Mistakes are frequently made in the case of an abscess developing in
{1020} the convexity of the right lobe of the liver and pushing the
diaphragm up to the third, even to the second, rib, and thus producing
conditions identical with empyema of the right thorax.Such instances
of hepatic abscess are peculiarly difficult of recognition, because,
the physical signs being the same as those of empyema, the
differentiation must rest on the clinical history.In cases of empyema
proper the effusion in the chest is preceded by pain and accompanied by
an increasing difficulty of breathing; in hepatic abscess there are, as
a rule, symptoms of disturbance in the hepatic functions, fluctuation
in the hepatic region, dysentery, etc., long anterior to any
disturbance in the thoracic organs.Again, empyema may be a latent
affection, without any symptom except some obscure pain and a
progressive increase in the difficulty of breathing; on the other hand,
abscess of the liver is preceded by symptoms of liver disease and of
associated maladies.A dry, purposeless cough is present in many cases
of abscess; a painful cough with bloody expectoration occurs when
preparation is making for discharge through the lungs.Errors of diagnosis are liable to occur in the consideration of
symptoms unquestionably hepatic in origin.Thus, the intermittent fever
accompanying some cases of hepatic colic, like the shivering fits and
fever which occur in cases of nephro-lithiasis, may be confounded with
the septicaemic fever of hepatic abscess.An attentive examination of
the attendant circumstances, especially a careful survey of the right
hypochondrium, can alone determine the nature of the symptoms.In all
doubtful cases the experimentum crucis of puncture with the
exploring-needle becomes a measure of necessity.When all diagnostic
indications are at fault, the needle of the aspirator may decide the
issue.An abundant experience has shown that a needle of suitable size
may be introduced into the right lobe without any ill result--often,
indeed, with distinctly good effects when there is no suppuration or
when pus cannot be detected.In the present state of our knowledge it
cannot be determined why puncture of the organ should be beneficial in
cases having the symptomatic type of hepatic abscess when none exists;
but of this fact there is no doubt.TREATMENT.--As the formation of pus is coincident with or causative of
the first symptoms, it is obvious that treatment directed to prevent an
abscess can rarely succeed.Yet it is probable that now and then an
abscess just forming has been arrested and healing effected.At the
onset of symptoms some large doses of quinine, with a little morphine
(scruple j of the former and 1/8 gr.of the latter), every four or six
hours, may have a decided curative effect.During the course of the
septicaemic fever, with its chills and febrile exacerbations, quinine
in full doses and alcohol according to the conditions present are
necessary remedies.As the symptoms develop saline laxatives are useful
until the formation of pus becomes evident, when all perturbating
treatment of the intestinal canal should cease.If dysentery be present
when the hepatic symptoms arise, it should be cured as promptly as
possible; and of all remedies for this purpose, ipecac given in the
usual antidysenteric quantity offers the best prospect of relief.For
the dysentery which succeeds to abscess, and is probably, in part at
least, dependent on portal obstruction, the mineral astringents, as
copper sulphate, are the most effective remedies.As far as
practicable, after an abscess has formed the intestinal canal should be
kept quiet, for any considerable disturbance will {1021} endanger the
escape of pus into the peritoneal cavity.Persistent vomiting is very
significant of pressure by an enlarging abscess in the stomach, and
usually signifies an abscess associated with impacted calculus.It is
important in such cases to maintain, as far as can be done, a quiescent
condition of the stomach, for the purpose of preventing rupture into
the peritoneal cavity and to favor the nutrition which is seriously
endangered by the repeated vomiting.Effervescent soda powders are very
useful; carbolic acid in solution, or creasote-water with or without
bismuth, is beneficial; champagne, very dry and highly effervescent,
has been, in the writer's hands, remarkably efficient.As food becomes
a most important need in such cases, milk and lime-water, wine-whey,
egg-nog, and similar aliments must be given in small doses and
frequently.Nutrient enemata, prepared from eggs, milk, and beef-juice,
with the materials for digestion--acid and pepsin--may be made to
supplement the stomach, but such efforts have a very limited utility,
owing to the state of the hepatic functions and to the obstruction of
the portal circuit.In all cases it is necessary to maintain the
strength by suitable aliment and the judicious use of stimulants.The
long-continued and profuse suppuration makes an enormous demand on the
vital resources of the patient, and this must be compensated by
suitable food-supplies.As the formation of pus has taken place in most cases when symptoms
have begun, the question of highest importance is, Shall the pus be
evacuated?The statistical evidence relating to this question becomes
then an extremely valuable guide.As in almost all cases of puncture of
the liver for the evacuation of an abscess some part of the liver
substance must be passed through, it is necessary to note how far this
can be done without inflicting permanent injury on the organ.Hammond
has punctured the liver in eight cases without the presence of an
abscess, and of these not one has presented any unfavorable symptom.The author has punctured the liver, penetrating well into the interior,
in two cases in which no abscess was discovered, but the symptoms of
hepatitis existed, with the effect to improve the symptoms.In
Condon's[113] collection of 11 cases there were 8 of abscess evacuated
by the trocar, and 3 of acute hepatitis in which abscess had not
formed, but in which the puncture procured the most decided
amelioration of the symptoms.We have heretofore referred to Hammond's
experience in the puncture of the liver in cases of hypochondriasis,
this condition appearing to depend in some instances on the presence of
abscess.In a number of instances abscesses did exist, but in many
others there was no apparent lesion of the liver, but in these cases
the puncture of the organ was without any ill result.Testimony to the
same effect is given by Ramirez,[114] who asserts that he had not known
a single instance in which any ill result followed puncture of the
liver.It may therefore be regarded as certain that exploratory
puncture of the organ for the purpose of diagnosis as well as for
treatment can at any time be performed with suitable precautions in
respect to the size, condition, and character of the instrument.[Footnote 113: "On the Use of the Aspirator in Hepatic Abscess," Dr.E.

recueilles a Mexico et en Espagne_, par Lino Ramirez, M.D., Paris,
1867, p.The authorities of most experience are agreed that, provided with the
{1022} aspirator, the abscess may be punctured as soon as a purulent
collection can be ascertained to exist.The obvious reason for tapping
the abscess is its tendency to extend in various directions, destroying
the hepatic substance.In those examples confined by a limiting
membrane, after a time of inactivity ulceration begins, and the pus
seeks an outlet in some direction.The early evacuation by a suitable
aspirator becomes then a measure of the highest necessity.The good
effects of puncture with even such a crude instrument as the trocar is
well exhibited in the statistics collected by Waring.[115] In a
collection of 81 cases opened by the knife or trocar there were 66
deaths, making the percentage of recoveries 18.5.In these cases the
operative procedure was a final measure, and the mischief had been done
almost if not quite in its entirety.The statistics of Waring are
concerned with a period anterior to 1850.Although they demonstrate the
value of the trocar and evacuation of the abscess, as compared with the
results of the natural course of the disease, the far greater success
of the treatment by the aspirator is shown by the statistics of recent
times.Thus in McConnell's[116] 14 cases, also of India, in which the
aspirator was used to empty the sac, 8 recovered and 6 died.The
statistics of Waring may also be profitably compared with those of
Condon,[117] in which, of 8 cases of abscess evacuated by the
aspirator, 4 recovered, or 50 per cent.They may also be compared with
Sach's[118] cases, 21 in number, of which 8 recovered, or 38 per cent.,
and with the cases of De Castro[119] of Alexandria, who reports 22
large abscesses operated on, the proportion of cures being 31.8 per
100, and 10 small abscesses, the proportion of cures being 70 per 100.In a case seen in consultation with Collins, in this city, last year,
the aspirator was used by us about three months after the symptoms of
abscess declared themselves.About a quart of bloody pus was drawn off
at once, the opening sealed, and no subsequent accumulation occurred,
the patient entirely recovering, for after a year he was seen
(December, 1884) in complete health.From these data we draw the
important conclusion that early operation is desirable.This fact may
be formulated in the expression: In all cases of hepatic abscess use
the aspirator whenever the presence of pus is made out.When the
abscess is large, and especially when communication is established with
the parietes of the abdomen, a free opening, followed by the insertion
of a drainage-tube, is the proper method to pursue.If the pus
reaccumulates, it is good practice to inject the cavity with tincture
or compound solution of iodine after the pus is drawn off, provided the
dimensions of the abscess are not too great.[Footnote 115: _An Inquiry into the Statistics of Abscess of the
Liver_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 116: "Remarks on Pneumatic Aspiration, with Cases of Abscess
of the Liver treated by this Method," _Indian Annals of Medical
Science_, July, 1872, quoted.][Footnote 117: _Lancet_, _supra_.][Footnote 118: _Ueber die Hepatitis der heissen Lander, etc._, von Dr.[Footnote 119: _Des Abces du Foie des Pays chauds, et de leur
Traitement chirurgical_, par le Docteur S. V. de Castro (d'Alexandrie
d'Egypte), Paris, 1870, p.As regards the mode of proceeding, the following are useful rules:
Ascertain, if possible, the existence of fluctuation; locate the point
where the walls of the abscess are thinnest; insert an
exploring-needle, and if the depot of pus is reached substitute a
trocar having a sufficient calibre to evacuate the contents of the
abscess; observe antiseptic precautions in respect to each detail of
the operative procedure, and after the removal of the canula or needle,
if a drainage-tube is not necessary, close the {1023} wound
antiseptically.If drainage is necessary, keep the cavity empty and use
proper solutions to prevent septic decomposition.When an abscess of
the liver is pointing, the best place to puncture is where the abscess
is most prominent and it walls thinnest, but if the accumulation of pus
is encysted and there is no attempt at effecting an exit, the
exploring-needle should be passed into the interior of the right lobe,
the most usual site of suppuration.If pus be reached, a larger trocar
may be inserted to evacuate the cavity thoroughly.Repeated insertion
of the needle-trocar is preferable when the abscess is small, but when
the accumulation is large and sufficiently firm attachments to the
abdominal parietes exist, a drainage-tube will be necessary.In what direction soever discharge of an abscess may take place, the
general indications are to support the powers of life by food and
stimulants.It is useful, by
the application of a firm flannel bandage, to keep the liver in its
proper position and maintain it there.When pointing of an abscess
occurs, a large flaxseed poultice is a soothing and a mechanically
supporting application.DEFINITION.--By the term acute yellow atrophy is meant an acute
affection of the liver, characterized by rapid wasting or degeneration
of the organ, accompanied by the systemic symptoms belonging to an
acute acholia or cholaemia.It is an acute, diffused inflammation, with
atrophy of the proper gland-elements.It has been called icterus
gravis, malignant icterus, hemorrhagic icterus, malignant jaundice,
etc.HISTORY.--Cases having a more or less exact resemblance to acute yellow
atrophy have been occasionally reported from the earliest period.Amongst English physicians, Bright[120] was one of the first to give an
accurate account of the clinical history of some well-defined cases.Rokitansky[121] was really the first to define the disease from the
pathological standpoint, and it was he who designated it acute yellow
atrophy, this term being intended to signify the nature of the
objective changes.The first treatise ever published on the disease as
a distinct morbid entity was the monograph of Horaezek,[122] which
appeared in 1843.Amongst the French, Ozonam in 1847 was the first to
recognize and describe the disease as a distinct affection, although
Andral[123] had several years before mentioned an affection of the
liver which corresponded in some of its features to this affection.In
1862, Wagner[124] asserted that many of the cases of acute yellow
atrophy were only examples of acute phosphorus-poisoning, and that no
real distinction exists between the two affections.This statement has
been warmly disputed by various German observers, but there is no doubt
a close resemblance between the two affections.[Footnote 120: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 1836, vol.[Footnote 121: _Handbook of Pathological Anatomy_, Am.[Footnote 122: Quoted by Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious
Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 123: _Clinique medicale_, 1839, tome ii.[Footnote 124: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1862, p.CAUSES.--There can be no doubt that acute yellow atrophy is a very rare
disease, since so few examples are found post-mortem.In the course of
a very large experience in autopsical examinations I have met with but
{1024} one characteristic example.[125] According to Legg, it is "one
of the rarest diseases known to man."[Footnote 125: _General Field Hospital_, December, 1863.]Several theories have been proposed to explain the occurrence of this
affection, but without success.It has been ascribed to an excess in
the production of bile, to stasis in the bile, and to a sudden
saturation of the hepatic cells with biliary matters contained in the
portal vein.That these supposed causes are really influential in
producing the malady can hardly be entertained.That there is a
peculiar poison which has a causative relation to the disease is
rendered probable by the fact that a condition closely allied to this
disease is produced by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other
poisons.Is it not a ptomaine generated under unknown conditions in the
intestine?Especially does the morbid anatomy of phosphorus-poisoning
nearly agree in all its details with icterus gravis--so nearly that by
many German authorities they are held to be identical.Age has a certain influence in the causation of this disease.It is
rarely seen in early life, Lebert in a collection of 63 cases having
found only 2 before ten years of age, yet there has been a well-marked
case at three, and Hilton Fagge reports one at two and a half years of
age.Nevertheless, much the largest number occur between fifteen and
twenty-five years of age, and the maximum age may be fixed at sixty.The influence of sex in the pathogeny is most remarkable.It is true in
Lebert's collection of 72 cases there were 44 men and 28 women, but it
is now known that he did not properly discriminate in his selection of
supposed examples of the disease.The statistics of all other observers
are opposed to those of Lebert.Thus, in Frerichs' collection of 31
cases, carefully sifted to eliminate error, there were 22 women and 9
men.Legg has also collected 100 cases of acute yellow atrophy, and of
these 69 were women or girls.The most active period of life--from
twenty to thirty years of age--is the usual period for the appearance
of this disease.More than one-half of Lebert's cases occurred between
fifteen and twenty-five; and of Frerichs', two-thirds happened between
twenty and thirty years of age.In Legg's collection of 100 cases, 76
were between fifteen and thirty-five years of age.What is the
condition of women at this period in life which renders them so
susceptible to this malady?There can be no doubt that pregnancy is the
great factor.Of 69 cases especially interrogated on this point,
examined into by Legg, in 25 pregnancy was ascertained to exist.In
Frerichs' collection one-half were women in the condition of pregnancy.The period of pregnancy at which the disease appears varies from the
fourth to the ninth month, the greatest number occurring at the sixth
month.So long ago as 1848, Virchow drew attention to the remarkable
changes in the liver due to pregnancy.Sinety[126] has studied the
effect of lactation on the liver, and has ascertained the existence of
fatty degeneration.There is a form of jaundice which accompanies
menstruation, as shown by Senator,[127] Hirschberg, and others.These
facts indicate a certain relationship between the sexual system of the
female and the liver, but they do not indicate the nature of the
connection, if any exist, between this condition and acute yellow
atrophy.[Footnote 126: _De l'Etat du Foie chez les Femelles en Lactation_,
Paris, 1873 (pamphlet).][Footnote 127: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, 1872, p.615, "Ueber
Menstruelle Gelbsucht."]The influence of depressing emotions has been supposed to be effective
{1025} in producing this disease, but it is more than doubtful if such
a relationship exists.Lebert, however, refers 13 of his cases to this
cause, but Legg, who bases his statements on the study of 100
carefully-recorded cases, is sceptical regarding the effect of such
influences.Syphilis has in some instances appeared to be the
principal, if not the only, pathogenetic factor, and Legg[128] compares
the action of the virus of syphilis to the effect of phosphorus,
mercury, etc.[Footnote 128: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The anatomical changes occurring in this disease
indicate the existence of a systemic condition: the lesions are not
limited to the liver, but involve various other organs.The changes in
the liver should be first described, since the name of the disease is
derived from the alterations in this organ.As the name indicates, the
lesions are atrophic, but not all examples show this.In some cases
there is little change in the size of the organ; in others the wasting
is extreme; certainly in all typical examples the liver is reduced in
size.The variations in size observed are probably due to the stage at
which the inspection is made: if early, the organ may not be reduced in
size, may be even somewhat enlarged by the deposition of new material;
if later, the atrophic changes will be more or less pronounced.When
the atrophy has taken place, the size of the liver is reduced to
one-half, even to one-third, of its original dimensions; it is then
soft, almost like pulp, and cannot maintain its shape, but flattens out
on the table.The capsule is much wrinkled and the color of the organ
is yellowish, variegated by islets of reddish or brownish-red color,
these spots being somewhat depressed below the general surface and
having a firm texture.On section the boundaries of the lobules are
either lost or have become very indistinct, the line of section being
bloodless.The knife with which the sections are made becomes greasy.In some instances ecchymoses are discovered under the capsule, and
rarely hemorrhagic extravasations in the substance of the liver.The
bile-ducts are found intact, as a rule.The greatest change in the size
of the liver is observed in the left lobe.The duration of the disease,
as has been indicated above, has a marked influence over the size and
condition of the liver.The atrophic shrinking of the liver occurs more
decidedly after the ninth day.In general, the tissue of the liver is
soft and pulpy in consistence.On microscopic examination the most
important alterations are seen to have occurred in the hepatic cells;
ultimately, these cells disappear, being replaced by fatty and
connective-tissue detritus; but before this stage is reached important
alterations have taken place in the form and structure of these bodies:
the cells become granular and fatty, and lose their sharpness and
regularity of contour, especially at the periphery of the lobule, but
ultimately all the cells within the lobule undergo atrophic
degeneration.In this atrophic degeneration of the hepatic cells, in
their fatty degeneration, and ultimately entire disappearance, consist
the real proofs of the disease.The red islets of tissue already
alluded to consist of the fatty detritus mixed with crystals of
haematoidin.More or less increase of the connective tissue is noted in many of the
cases--increase of connective tissue with numerous young cells formed
around the vessels and the bile-ducts (Waldeyer[129]).The changes in
the {1026} liver would surely be incomplete without some references to
the minute organisms which play so important a part in modern
pathology.Waldeyer was the first to demonstrate the presence of
bacteria in the pigment-remains of the hepatic cells.Other observers
have been unable to detect them, so that at present the parasitic
origin of this affection remains sub judice.Important changes also take place in the spleen, but the opinions on
this point are somewhat contradictory.Frerichs found the spleen
enlarged in most of his cases; Liebermeister, on the other hand, and
Legg,[130] find that the spleen is enlarged in about one-third of the
cases.When the atrophic changes occur in the liver, more or less
swelling of the splenic veins must occur in consequence of portal
obstruction.The peritoneum, especially the omental part, is the seat
of multiple ecchymoses, and the endothelium is fatty.The mesenteric
glands are usually swollen.More or less blackish or brownish fluid,
consisting of altered blood, is usually found in the stomach, and the
same, assuming a tar-like consistence, in the large intestine.Ecchymoses of rather small size are distributed over the stomach and
intestines.The epithelium of the stomach-glands is found granular and
disintegrating, and a catarrhal state of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane exists throughout.The secretions are never normal, and the
stools are wanting in bile or present a tarry appearance, due to the
presence of blood.[Footnote 130: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _supra_.]They consist essentially
in a granular and fatty degeneration of the tubular epithelium, whence
the altered appearance of the cortex.Multitudes of bacteria crowd the
pyramids.Ecchymoses also are found in the mucous membrane of the
pelvis of the kidney, in the bladder, and indeed all along the
genito-urinary tract.The muscular tissue of the heart is in a state of acute fatty
degeneration, beginning with a granular change which may at the outset
be of very limited extent and involve but few fibres.The endo- and
pericardium are studded with ecchymoses or marked by hemorrhagic
extravasations, and the pleura presents similar appearances, but not to
the same extent.The brain does not always show evidences of change, but in many
instances there are ecchymoses of the meninges; the walls of the
vessels are affected by fatty degeneration.The tissues of the body are more or less deeply stained with bile.The
pathological change on which the jaundice depends has been variously
stated, but the most probable explanation is that which refers it to
mechanical obstruction of the bile-ducts, either by catarrhal swelling
or fatty degeneration of the epithelium.Notwithstanding the prominence
of the hepatic symptoms, acute atrophy of the liver is probably only
one element in a constitutional morbid complexus.SYMPTOMS.--Acute yellow atrophy begins in two modes--the grave symptoms
preceded by mild prodromes, or the most serious symptoms appear at the
onset.The usual prodromes are
referable to the gastro-intestinal canal, and consist of loss of
appetite, nausea, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth, headache, and
general malaise.Indeed, the opening attack may be much like an {1027}
ordinary bilious seizure or acute gastro-duodenal catarrh or a sick
headache.In some cases the initial symptoms--nausea and
diarrhoea--appear to be induced by an indigestible article of food.Jaundice never fails to be present at some period, but is usually one
of the prodromic symptoms.It has no special characteristics by which
the gravity of the approaching seizure may be measured.It is usually
rather deep, and all parts are deeply stained, but the coloration may
be limited to the body and upper extremities.No change in pulse or
temperature, except the usual depression of both functions, is to be
observed; the urine is deeply stained with pigment, and the feces are
grayish, colorless, or parti-.The period of time elapsing before the serious symptoms come on is not
constant; from one week to several months have been the variations
observed.In a minority of the cases no prodromes have occurred, but
the grave symptoms have declared themselves at once.From the
appearance of the jaundice up to the onset of severe symptoms the time
has varied from two weeks to several months, but has rarely exceeded
three months.During this time there may be nothing to indicate the
gravity of the approaching symptoms; in fact, the case then, as at the
onset, seems to be one of simple gastro-duodenal catarrh associated
with catarrhal jaundice.The onset of serious symptoms is most usually
announced by dilatation of the pupil.If, therefore, in a case of
apparently simple catarrhal jaundice, especially in a pregnant female,
there should occur without apparent reason a marked and persistent
dilatation of the pupil, the possibility of the case being one of acute
atrophy should be apprehended.This symptom is not, alone, of
sufficient value to decide the character of the case, but then an
obstinate insomnia comes on, violent headache is experienced, there is
more or less confusion of mind, and jactitations or an extreme
restlessness occurs.When such pronounced nervous symptoms appear the
character of the attack is explained.Various divisions have been proposed to mark the type of the symptoms:
thus, the icteric period embraces the prodromal symptoms with jaundice;
the toxaemic period is that stage characterized by profound nervous
disturbances.Ozonam has divided the symptoms into those of the
prodromal period and those of the serious stage, the latter being
subdivided into the symptoms of excitation and those of collapse.There
may be no prodromal period, however; without any preliminary symptoms
the patient is suddenly seized with delirium and passes into a
condition of coma and insensibility, or the first evidence of serious
illness may be convulsions.It is probable, however, that in even the
most sudden cases mild prodromal symptoms had occurred, but were
overlooked.There is much variability in the symptoms of the toxaemic
period.There are three symptoms: excitement with delirium, sometimes
delirium ferox; coma, less or more profound; and convulsions.Legg has
numerically expressed the relative frequency of these symptoms thus: Of
100 cases of unquestionable acute atrophy, 76 had become comatose, 59
were delirious, and 32 had suffered convulsions.[131] According to the
same authority, delirium and coma were associated together in about
one-half of the cases, but in pregnant women coma often occurs alone
(Legg).Usually, when convulsions happen there has been either coma or
delirium.With these cerebral symptoms there are often present various
{1028} disturbances of motility and sensibility, such as local
convulsions, jactitations, hiccough, extreme restlessness, paralysis of
the sphincters, and incontinence of urine and feces or retention,
grinding of the teeth, exalted sensibility of the skin, or it may be
complete anaesthesia, severe itching of the surface, etc.[Footnote 131: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, _loc.cit._]

During the toxaemic period, and directly dependent on the retention of
excrementitious matters in the blood, hemorrhages occur from the mucous
surfaces, from wounds, and into the various serous membranes.A changed
state of the blood being present in all cases of this disease, the
proportion in which extravasations take place is high--in about 71.3
per cent.according to Liebermeister, and 80 per cent.The latter author regards these estimates as rather low.When
hemorrhage occurs in the stomach in small amount, it presents itself as
coffee-grounds or as black vomit, and in the intestine in the form of
black, tarry stools or melaena.Hemorrhage may also occur from the
surface of an ulcer, from a fresh wound, a leech-bite, etc.; but the
most usual form of extravasation of blood after the gastro-intestinal
is epistaxis or bleeding from the nose.Women who abort, as they are
very apt to do when this disease comes on, may suffer from frightful
hemorrhage, and deaths have been thus caused.Various opinions have
been expressed as to the cause of the hemorrhagic condition--by some
attributed to the changes in the composition of the blood; by others to
the alterations of the vessel walls; both factors are doubtless
concerned.During the prodromic period the temperature of the body, as in the case
of ordinary uncomplicated jaundice, is rather depressed below normal,
sometimes as much as two degrees; but when the toxaemic stage comes on
the body-heat rises to a variable extent, but usually over 100 degrees
F. In some cases no febrile movement can be detected; in others a very
considerable elevation of temperature occurs, but very rarely attains
to 105 degrees or 106 degrees F. The pulse becomes very rapid, in some
instances rising to 140; but without any apparent cause it may fall
suddenly to 70 or 80, and these fluctuations may take place several
times a day.The rise of temperature and a very rapid pulse may come on
in the final coma only; and immediately after death, as Legg points
out, the body-heat may attain the maximum elevation.As the toxaemic period develops the tongue becomes dry, glazed,
fissured, sordes form on the teeth and lips, the breath becomes fetid,
and the breathing may assume the Cheyne-Stokes type.The nausea and
vomiting of the prodromal period persist, and the ominous
coffee-grounds appear in the rejected matters, or grumous masses--clots
acted on by the gastric juice--are brought up.Black, pitch-like, or
tarry stools, the result of hemorrhage, are passed toward the
end--involuntarily when liquid.When no blood is present the stools are
grayish and without bile.Constipation may be the condition instead of
diarrhoea in about one-third of the cases.Various eruptions have been observed on the skin, such as petechiae,
roseola, eczema, etc., but their very variety, as their occasional
appearance, indicates their accidental relationship to the disease.The urine is much altered in character, but it is usually acid in
reaction, although it has been observed neutral or alkaline.The
specific gravity is at or nearly normal, and it has a deep-brownish or
bilious hue {1029} due to the presence of bile-pigment.The most
important change in the composition of the urine is the diminished
quantity of urea or its entire disappearance; the phosphates, and
especially the chlorides, are also usually diminished in amount; and
albumen and leucin and tyrosin appear to a lesser or greater extent,
together with hyaline, fatty, and granular casts.Although the observations are somewhat contradictory, it seems pretty
definitely established that the blood is more or less altered in
composition, morphological and chemical.The red corpuscles are
diminished in amount, and often deformed; the white corpuscles are
increased; and excrementitious products--urea, leucin, tyrosin, and
cholesterin--are found in greater or less quantity.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Although, as a rule, the course of
acute atrophy is rapid, it is not invariably so.In some instances the
prodromic symptoms have continued through several months, but,
according to Thierfelder, one-half of the cases terminate in from three
to five weeks, and in only 10 per cent.The course of the disease is extremely rapid in pregnant
females, rarely extending beyond the second week.An extended course of
the disease is due to delay in the prodromic stage, the toxaemic period
being always absolutely and relatively shorter.In the condition of
pregnancy the danger is increased by the hemorrhages, and the early
termination is due chiefly to this factor.When the duration of the
disease is protracted and its evolution normal, the accumulation of
hepatic excrementitious matters sets up cerebral disturbance, which
becomes a pronounced feature of the case.As in the
course of the disease the hepatic cells undergo solution and
disintegration, their restoration can hardly be regarded as possible,
certainly not probable.Any curative result must, then, be wrought in
the prodromic period, when the diagnosis must be viewed with some
mistrust.DIAGNOSIS.--George Harley[132] maintains the singular doctrine that
acute yellow atrophy is only the "sporadic form of the contagious
jaundice of the tropics," or yellow fever.He bases his opinion on the
identity of their symptoms, pathological anatomy, mortality, and
contagious character; for he affirms that acute yellow atrophy may
exhibit contagious power in temperate climates.[Footnote 132: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.As acute yellow atrophy comes on as an ordinary catarrhal jaundice, it
is impossible to distinguish it from the latter affection during the
prodromal period.When cerebral symptoms, black vomit, and tarry stools
appear, the area of hepatic dulness very decidedly diminishes, and
leucin and tyrosin replace urea in the urine, acute atrophy may be
suspected.Acute phosphorus-poisoning, as regards its symptomatology and morbid
anatomy, does not differ from acute yellow atrophy, and many cases of
the latter have been mistaken, it is supposed, for the former.To
distinguish between them the history of the case must be carefully
ascertained.When, after the prodromal symptoms, which may not be accurately
diagnosticated, there occurs a rapid decline in the area of hepatic
dulness, hemorrhages take place from the mucous surfaces, stupor and
delirium {1030} supervene, and urea disappears from the urine, being
replaced by leucin and tyrosin, there can be no difficulty in coming to
a conclusion: the case must be one of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--It was formerly supposed that a case of acute yellow
atrophy must necessarily prove fatal, but this opinion must now be
modified, since examples of cure of supposed cases have been reported
from Oppolzer's clinic,[133] by Lebert,[134] by Harley,[135] and
others.As at the onset the symptoms cannot be distinguished from a
bilious attack or from catarrhal jaundice, the treatment must be
appropriate to these states.When the serious symptoms begin, a large
dose (scruple j) of quinine should be at once administered, and half
the quantity at regular intervals to keep up the cinchonism.Phosphate
of soda, with some arseniate and such mild hepatic stimulants as
euonymin, iridin, etc., should be given to maintain a gentle aperient
action.Experience has proved that active or drastic cathartics do harm
rather than good; on the other hand, mild laxatives, especially those
having cholagogue action, seem to do good.[Footnote 133: Thierfelder, _op.cit._]

[Footnote 134: _Ibid._]

[Footnote 135: _Diseases of the Liver_, Amer.Important symptoms arising during the toxaemic period require remedies
to combat them.Nausea and vomiting, and also diarrhoea, are best
relieved by carbolic acid and bismuth in combination.Hemorrhage
requires, when intestinal, the chloride and perchloride of iron; when
from other mucous surfaces, ergotin, gallic acid, and other
haemostatics.The depression of the vital forces should be treated by
small and frequently-repeated doses of alcohol, by quinine, by iron,
and, under some conditions, by digitalis.After the disintegration of
the hepatic cells has been produced no remedies can be of any service.Until this occurs, however, it seems to the author well worth while to
attempt to stay the destruction by the administration of those remedies
which, by their accumulation in that organ, indicate a special affinity
for its tissue.These drugs are phosphorus, antimony, gold, silver, and
mercuric chloride.By the timely administration of one or more of these
would it not be possible to stay the progress of the atrophic
degeneration?The Liver in Phosphorus-Poisoning.DEFINITION.--Poisoning by phosphorus may seem to be a toxicological
question rather than a merely hepatic disease, but as the morbid
complexus thus induced is so similar to acute yellow atrophy that the
conditions are regarded as identical by many of our German colleagues,
it is necessary to enter into some details regarding it.PATHOGENY.--Phosphorus-poisoning occurs at any period from youth to old
age, but is most common from twenty to thirty years of age.Women seem
more inclined to effect self-destruction in this way than are men,
probably because phosphorus matches are so readily obtained.Children
may munch match-heads in a spirit of mischief.That form of chronic
poisoning seen in workmen in match-factories, and consisting in
necrosis of bone, etc., does not come within the scope of the present
inquiry.A body poisoned by phosphorus does not exhibit a tendency to
putrefactive decomposition within the usual period.The tissues are
more or less {1031} deeply stained by bile-pigment, and this coloration
extends to pathological fluids as well.The serous and mucous membranes
contain points of blood-extravasation, but they are especially numerous
in the serous membranes.Hemorrhages of this kind are due to two
causes--to the disorganization of the blood, and to fatty degeneration
of the arterioles.The heart is also more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration, the muscles granular, the striations obscure or
obliterated, and the whole soft and easily torn.The spleen is usually
enlarged--often, indeed, to twice its natural size.The liver presents
highly-characteristic alterations.When death occurs early the organ is
generally enlarged, infiltrated with fat, the connective tissue
undergoing hyperplasia; but in more advanced cases atrophy has taken
place, the cells have disappeared and are replaced by fat-granules,
crystals of leucin and tyrosin, connective tissue, etc.--in fact, the
changes characteristic of acute yellow atrophy.The jaundice has been
variously interpreted.As the bile-ducts in advanced cases are found to
contain no bile, but only a colorless mucus, the advocates of a
haematogenic jaundice hold that the jaundice is due to a failure of the
liver to excrete the biliary principles in the blood; whilst the
opponents of this view maintain the existence of an obstruction in the
ultimate ducts.Harley[136] has recently brought forward some strong
facts and arguments--which we believe can be successfully
controverted--maintaining the former view.The jaundice of
phosphorus-poisoning, if Harley's opinion prove to be correct, must be
regarded as a haematogenic jaundice.[Footnote 136: _Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]

The mucous membrane of the stomach, as might be supposed, is more or
less ulcerated or in an advanced state of catarrh, and the gastric
glands are affected by fatty degeneration.The kidneys are affected in a similar manner to the liver; the
epithelium is fatty and sometimes detached, and the same process is
found to occur in the vessels and epithelium of the cortex.SYMPTOMS.--Not only in the morbid anatomy, but in the symptoms, do we
find that a very remarkable resemblance exists between acute yellow
atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning.As phosphorus is usually swallowed in
bulk, some hours may elapse before the local symptoms begin, for the
contents of the stomach and the tough mucus lining the mucous membrane
may, and usually do, prevent immediate contact of the poison with the
mucous membrane.When the stomach is entirely empty the symptoms may
begin in an hour or two.The symptoms produced may be arranged in two
groups--those due to the local irritation excited by the poison; those
due to its systemic impression.In the first group belong burning in
the gullet, pain, nausea, and vomiting.According to Lewin,[137] who
has collected a number of cases for analysis, vomiting occurs in 26 out
of 32 instances of poisoning.Some hours--often, indeed, three or four
days--then elapse before the systemic symptoms begin.Vomiting, which
was for the time being suspended, occurs again, and instead of the mere
contents of the stomach, containing more or less phosphorus, blood,
somewhat changed by the gastric juice--chocolate- or as
coffee-grounds--appears in the vomited matters.The evacuations from
the bowels may at first, as the contents of the stomach, appear
phosphorescent, and afterward exhibit the appearances due to the
presence in them {1032} of altered blood.At this time, if the liver be
examined it will be found somewhat enlarged and tender to pressure, and
on or about the third day jaundice appears; but it should not be
overlooked that jaundice, as Bamberger[138] has shown, may be postponed
to the second or third week after the phosphorus has been taken.[Footnote 137: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band xxi.514 _et seq._]

[Footnote 138: Legg, _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_,
_loc.cit._]

In favorable cases the area of hepatic dulness decreases and the
jaundice declines.In the fatal cases certain nervous phenomena become
prominent.There occur drowsiness, developing into coma, with
intercurrent attacks of delirium which may be of a maniacal character;
convulsions, spasmodic attacks, dilated pupils, and involuntary
evacuations.The disorganization of the blood and the fatty change in
the vessels are exhibited in the hemorrhages from the gastro-intestinal
mucous membrane.The nervous phenomena are due chiefly to the retention
in the blood of various excrementitious matters which it is the
function of the liver to separate from the blood.Flint's theory of
cholesteraemia has been so abundantly disproved that no one upholds it
at the present time, but the cerebral symptoms are properly referred to
the retention of all hepatic excrement.The temperature in phosphorus-poisoning rises from 99 degrees to 102
degrees F., but it may reach in severe cases to 103 degrees to 105
degrees F., and at death or immediately afterward to 105 degrees, even
to 107 degrees F. The same fact is true of acute yellow atrophy.With
the jaundice the pulse declines, but in the further progress of the
case, especially toward the close, the pulse becomes rapid and small.The changes occurring in the urine are highly significant.The amount
of urea decreases as the symptoms increase in severity, and leucin and
tyrosin take its place.If the case tends to recovery the urea again
increases in amount, but if the tendency is in the opposite direction
the quantity of urea steadily diminishes.Bile acids and bile-pigment
are found in quantity, and albumen is present in small amount.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Phosphorus-poisoning is necessarily
an acute affection, but the duration of cases is much influenced by the
form in which the poison is taken.If in a liquid and diffusible form,
as oleum phosphoratum, the local and systemic symptoms will develop in
a few hours, but if in solid masses, as particles of match-heads, many
hours (six to ten) may elapse before the local irritation begins.The
proportion of cures in phosphorus-poisoning varies from one-fourth to
one-half of the cases.Much depends, however, on the promptness and
efficiency of the treatment.The prognosis is the more favorable the
earlier proper measures of relief have been instituted.If the case has
proceeded to jaundice, hemorrhages, black vomit, etc.without the
administration of suitable antidotes, little can be expected from any
kind of treatment.DIAGNOSIS.--The history of any case involved in doubt is indispensable
to a correct conclusion.The phosphorescent appearance of the matters
vomited or passed by stool may make the differentiation comparatively
easy; but if the case has passed beyond this stage,
phosphorus-poisoning can be separated from acute yellow atrophy only by
the history of the case.If the fact of the administration of
phosphorus is successfully concealed, no differentiation can be made,
since {1033} even the best authorities hold to the identity of the
toxic symptoms produced by this poison and of the morbid anatomy, with
the symptoms and lesions of acute yellow atrophy.TREATMENT.--The poison should be evacuated as quickly as possible by
emetics and proper diluents.The best emetics are sulphate of copper,
apomorphia, and ipecacuanha, the antimonial and mercurial emetics being
unsuited, since their effects are similar to those of phosphorus.Oleaginous protectives do not prevent, but really favor, the absorption
of phosphorus.Decoctions of flaxseed, slippery elm, acacia, etc.are
suitable demulcents and protectives.The fatty matter in food, eggs,
etc.will have an injurious effect by promoting the solution and
absorption of the phosphorus, and should hence be excluded from the
diet.The most effective antidote is oleum terebinthinae, and the most
suitable preparation is the French acid oil.Freshly-distilled
turpentine appears to be almost if not entirely useless.It is probable
that the American oil which is old and has been exposed to the air for
many months will answer the purpose, but it cannot be too strongly
insisted on that the turpentine which has proved to be efficient in
phosphorus-poisoning is the French acid oil.Turpentine when exposed to
the air absorbs oxygen as ozone, and to this principle are probably due
the curative effects of old turpentine.Phosphorus when acted on by
this agent is converted into a spermaceti-like substance entirely
devoid of toxic power.As rapidly as possible the poison should be
acted on by the antidote, and then the stomach should be evacuated,
using, caeteris paribus, the sulphate of copper, since this forms an
insoluble phosphide with any portion of free phosphorus, whilst at the
same time it empties the stomach of its contents.Although the
immediate results of the poison may be thus removed, the damage to the
red corpuscles and to the whole mass of the blood requires special
management.The success of transfusion, as practised by Jurgensen,[139]
proves that the substitution of fresh blood may save life when the
existing blood-supply is inadequate to the performance of its proper
functions.Mary went to the office.It follows that if the toxic effects of phosphorus have
continued for several days, blood-transfusion will be necessary in
those cases characterized by an inability to recuperate notwithstanding
the successful removal of the poison.[Footnote 139: _Berliner klinische Wochenschrift_, No.For the inflammatory symptoms produced by the local action of
phosphorus, opium in some form is indispensable.This remedy is equally
valuable as a means of maintaining the vital resources and to prevent
the evil results of shock and inflammation.DEFINITION.--Under the term carcinoma of the liver are included primary
and secondary cancer of the liver.The malady with which we are now
concerned is the primary affection, occurring in the organ proper or in
some pathological new formation connected with it.ETIOLOGY.--Heredity is the most important factor.A careful
investigation of the reported examples demonstrates that from 15 to 20
per cent.owe their origin to hereditary influence clearly, and
probably {1034} considerably more are indirectly derived in this way
when the immediate connection may not be demonstrable.Next to
heredity, age must be regarded as the most important pathogenetic
influence, much the largest number occurring at from forty to sixty
years of age.It is a malady of advanced life, therefore, rather than
of youth or middle age.Excluding the female organs from consideration,
it is quite certain that sex has little special influence, and that
males and females are affected about equally.Primary cancer of the liver is comparatively infrequent, occurring in
not more than one-fourth of the cases.Frerichs collected 91 cases, and
of these 46 were secondary to cancer in organs having vascular
communication with the liver.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Under the term cancer of the liver are included
several distinct forms of morbid growth, but united in the
characteristic of malignancy.From the merely clinical standpoint this
characteristic is the most decisive bond of union between them, and
serves as the point of departure in the study of this affection.Primary cancer of the liver is divisible into two forms: 1, as a
single, defined tumor; 2, as an infiltration through the whole mass of
the organ.[140] Secondary cancer occurs in nodular masses, and with
extreme rarity as an infiltration.The form of cancer is really the
same; the differences in structure are only apparent, the variations
being due to the relative proportion of cells, fibres, and vessels.If
the fibrous stroma is abundant and the cells small in quantity, the
form of structure approaches scirrhus; on the other hand, if the cells
largely preponderate, the type is encephaloid; if vessels predominate,
it is called telangiectatic.The usual form in cancer of the liver is
the soft, cellular variety, encephaloid or medullary.When the
cancerous new formation is nodular, the masses vary in size from a pea
to a child's head,[141] and are numerous inversely as their size.When
the cancer occurs as a solitary tumor, it may attain to enormous
dimensions.It has a spherical shape usually, protrudes from the
surface of the organ somewhat irregularly, and the overlying peritoneum
is thickened, cloudy, and adherent from a local inflammation.The
central portion, whether there be one, several, or many nodules, is
depressed, giving an umbilicated appearance to the tumor; and this
central depression is found to be soft, almost diffluent, and full of
juice.The fibrous stroma which extends through this central soft
material has a reticulated arrangement and a shining, fibrous
appearance.The cancerous masses are not confined to these nodules, but
extend into the surrounding hepatic structure, push their way into the
portal (especially the hepatic) veins, block the ducts, and invade the
lymphatic glands in the fissure of the liver.[Footnote 140: Virchow, _Krankhaften Geschwulste_, _loc.cit._; Perls,
_Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.448 _et seq._;
Frerichs, _A Clinical Treatise, etc._, Syd.281 _et seq._]

[Footnote 141: Forster, _Lehrbuch der Pathologischen Anatomie_, by
Seibert, Jena, 1873.]When the cancerous new formation takes the form of an infiltration of
the organ instead of distinct nodules, the liver is usually uniformly
enlarged and its outlines preserved.[142] The peritoneum is opaque,
thickened, and adherent.The organ is traversed by fibrous bands, and
the {1035} intervening portion is a soft, juicy pulp, stained by the
imbibition of bile.In extreme cases hardly any portion of the proper
hepatic tissue remains, but is replaced by a cancerous new formation
having the same shape.[Footnote 142: Perls, _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lvi.448 _et seq._]

As regards the minute structure of cancer of the liver, it may be
regarded as a degeneration (cancerous) of the proper gland-cells and of
the epithelium of the bile-ducts.As cancer develops in the liver it is
to be noted that the cellular elements preponderate over the fibrous or
the stroma, and hence the new formation presents the characteristics of
softness, rapid growth, and a multitudinous cellular hyperplasia.As
regards the form of the new cells, it cannot now be doubted that they
are descendants of the secretory gland-cells and of the epithelial
lining of the ducts.According to some observers, it is to the
proliferation of the proper gland-cells that the new formations owe
their origin; according to others, to the hyperplasia of the cells
lining the ducts.As the growth of the new formation can take place
only through an adequate blood-supply, it becomes very important to
ascertain its source.There can be little doubt that primary cancer of
the liver receives its nutrient supply through the hepatic artery, in
connection with which new capillaries form in the pathological tissue.Secondary cancer of the liver is the usual form of the specific
manifestation.From the merely clinical standpoint the primary
affection is the more important.From the pathological point of view
the secondary implication of the liver may be a true metastasis or a
mere communication by contiguity of tissue.The most usual metastasis
occurs from epithelial cancer of the face (Schuppel), but the ordinary
communication of the new formation is from primary cancer of the
stomach, intestine, pancreas, mesentery, etc.The cancer elements, as
the author has several times verified, crowd the lymphatics and veins,
and through these channels reach the liver and other parts.As the
cancer elements in the case of secondary implication of the liver are
distributed chiefly by the portal vein, it follows that there must be
numerous secondary foci and multiple nodes.Cancerous infiltration
under these circumstances is the rarest possible form for the new
growth to take.The size and number of nodes forming in these cases of
secondary implication of the organ vary greatly--from two or three to
twenty, or a hundred, or even more.As regards the form, structure, and
ultimate behavior of the secondary formation, they do not differ from
the primary.As respects the relative proportion of stroma and cellular
elements--fibres and cells--they vary greatly, some presenting the firm
texture of a predominating fibrous stroma, others the softness and
ready diffluence of the excessive cellular production.The latter is
undoubtedly the usual condition, and when the nodular masses are
incised an abundant creamy juice exudes.With the development of these
nodules an increase in the size of the liver takes place and the organ
has an uneven and indurated feel.As the cancerous masses develop the
proper hepatic structure undergoes atrophy, and finally little is left
of the organ but the cancerous new formation.The blood-vessels,
lymphatics, and peritoneal investment are invaded, the first mentioned
most decidedly; and especially are organized exudations the favorite
seats of cancer new formations, those, for example, about the
gall-bladder and cystic duct resulting from repeated attacks of passage
of calculi.{1036} Secondary changes take place in the cancerous nodes.As the
cells develop pressure is brought to bear on the vessels supplying them
and on each other, with the result of fatty degeneration of the central
portion, which effects the change in the form of the nodules and in
their consistence, already mentioned.The blood-supply to the cancerous
nodes in the liver is derived from the hepatic artery, as Frerichs has
determined by carefully-made injections; they also are new formations
of exceedingly delicate structure, and form a network about the
periphery of each mass or node.By reference to these anatomical
considerations it is easy to understand the failure of nutrition of the
central portions of the nodes.Pigment cancers of the liver are rare as secondary formations, and
excessively infrequent as primary formations.They are, properly
speaking, melano-sarcomas (Schuppel).They are more often metastatic
than merely secondary--that is, transferred from different parts, as in
the case of melanotic sarcoma of the choroid--than due to neighboring
disease transferred by contiguity of tissue.This variety of cancer, so
called, takes the form of multiple nodes or of diffused infiltration,
the former more frequently; but both modes of development may go on at
the same time.The nodes vary in size from a pea to a child's head,
have a grayish, brownish, or blackish tint, and exude on section a
fluid not creamy like true cancer-juice, but rather watery and
containing black particles floating in it.In the case of diffuse
infiltration the pigment masses are thoroughly distributed through the
original hepatic tissue.In both forms the size and weight of the organ
are enormously increased.In the case of the melanotic infiltration the
whole organ is uniformly enlarged, reaching in a few months the
enormous size of twelve to twenty pounds.Sarcomas also occur very rarely as primary growths in the liver, but
secondary sarcomas are more frequent.There are fibro-sarcoma,
lympho-sarcoma, and osteo-sarcoma as secondary deposits, the first
being very firm in consistence, the second soft and medullary, and the
last of hard, bony consistence.SYMPTOMS.--We are especially concerned here with primary cancer of the
liver.The secondary disease is so obscured by the main and primary
lesion that a diagnosis may be impossible.Furthermore, the progress of
the original disease is that which demands immediate consideration.As,
therefore, the secondary implication of the liver is of relatively
trifling importance, and only an incident in the course of the main
disease, the matter for consideration now is primary cancer of the
liver.It is the fact that in some, even a considerable proportion, of the
cases the onset and progress of cancer of the liver are very obscure.For some time the symptoms may be of the vaguest description.The usual
history is this: A person of forty to sixty years begins to fail in
flesh and strength, becomes sallow, has disorders of digestion, pain
and uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, and the bowels are now
confined, now relaxed.The abdomen, notwithstanding the general loss of
flesh, increases in size, and the superficial veins are enlarged; very
considerable pain is experienced in the right hypochondrium, and often
extreme tenderness to pressure is a pronounced symptom.The pains are
not limited to the hepatic region, out extend widely from this point in
all directions.On palpation the {1037} liver is found to be enlarged,
its texture indurated, and its outline irregular and nodular, and
pain--often, indeed, quite severe--is developed by pressure.The condition of the liver on palpation is best ascertained by suddenly
depressing the abdominal wall with the tips of the fingers arranged in
a line.Displacing thus the movable bodies in the cavity, the liver is
quickly reached, and nodules, if they exist, are readily felt.If the
new formation has developed from exudations about the gall-bladder and
cystic duct, it may be felt by suddenly depressing the walls of the
abdomen over this organ in the usual position of the fissure.In the case of general cancerous infiltration of the organ, with the
remarkable enlargement which occurs in such cases, there will be
present an obvious distension of the right hypochondrium; the
intercostal spaces will be forced outward and the arches of the ribs
rendered more prominent; the area of hepatic dulness, both vertical and
transverse, will be increased; and the limits of dulness will move with
a full inspiration downward, and with a full expiration upward.This
mobility of cancer-nodules of the liver with the inspiratory and
expiratory changes serves to distinguish them from tumors of the
abdominal walls.Seen early, the changes in the size of a nodule or of
the liver itself may be noted from week to week,[143] especially in
cases of rapidly-growing cancer.[Footnote 143: Murchison, _Clinical Lectures_, p.As the cancerous new formations extend into the portal system within
the liver, obstruction to the portal circulation results from the
blocking of the blood-current.Also, interference in the portal
circulation arises by compression of the vessels from without, either
through the accumulation of cancer-products in the liver or by the
enlargement of the lymphatics in the fissure of the organ.In what way
soever it may be produced, the practical fact remains that ascites is a
frequent symptom, occurring in somewhat more than one-half of the
cases.It may be a clear serum
containing a small proportion of albumen; it may be  by bile or
be of a deeper greenish or reddish hue; it may contain flocculi of
lymph and numerous leucocytes floating in it; and the ordinary serum
may be rendered cloudy and be filled with shreds of exudation in
consequence of peritonitis, or bloody because of hemorrhage from a
softening nodule.When the fluid is considerable in amount the
difficulty of ascertaining the condition of the liver is greatly
enhanced, and symptoms due to the interference of the fluid with the
action of various organs are introduced into the complexus of morbid
signs.Especially is the upward pressure of the ascitic fluid, and the
consequent interference in the movements of the lungs and heart, a
source of considerable distress.First, a local and afterward a general
peritonitis ensues as a consequence of the extension outwardly of the
new formations to the peritoneal layer, and its implication by
contiguity of tissue or the rupture of a spreading fungous growth and
hemorrhagic extravasation into the cavity.The peritoneal complication
is not only a serious addition to the sufferings experienced by the
patient, but it adds to the difficulties of a diagnosis.In the case of
a celebrated savant who died of cancer of the liver (seen by the
writer) there was such a pronounced peritonitis that the diagnosis made
by the attending physician was chronic peritonitis.When this
complication occurs, there takes place {1038} a decided increase in the
local tenderness, and this increased sensibility to pressure quickly
extends over the abdomen, causing a general exquisite tenderness.Besides this tenderness characteristic of most cases of peritonitis,
distension of the abdomen and the decubitus peculiar to this state are
obvious symptoms.It is therefore clear that the occurrence of
peritonitis not only contributes to the severity and painfulness of the
case, but seriously complicates the diagnosis.It has been already stated that pain in the right hypochondrium is a
nearly constant symptom in cancer of the liver.With the initial
symptoms, uneasiness, heaviness, a sense of pressure in the hepatic
region are experienced, and as the case progresses more or less acute
pain develops as a rule.In cases of cancer
involving the deeper portion of the liver there may be little pain, and
in some rare cases of cancer involving the external part of the
liver--the capsule and peritoneum--but little pain is experienced.In
much the largest proportion of cases the pain is severe, and the
production of any considerable pain means the implication of the
hepatic plexus of nerves or the hepatic peritoneum.It follows, then,
that the pain in the former case is not limited to the locality of the
disease, but is more or less widely distributed through the anatomical
relations of the hepatic plexus, being felt in the epigastrium, the
walls of the chest, the shoulders, etc.In secondary cancer of the liver, following cancer of the stomach,
vomiting is a constant symptom, but also in those cases of primary
disease in which the left lobe is especially enlarged, relatively, are
nausea and vomiting pronounced symptoms.At the onset of the malady the
appetite fails and a gastro-intestinal catarrh is set up.More or less
catarrh of the bile-ducts also ensues.The interference with nutrition
thus occasioned is enhanced in those cases in which the obstruction of
the ducts is sufficient to prevent the escape of bile into the
intestine.Jaundice is not a constant symptom, occurring in little more
than one-third of the cases.When it occurs, the peculiar stools are
present and the intestinal digestion is deranged, as in cases of
ordinary obstruction to the ducts.In two cases of cancer of the liver
occurring in the writer's practice, and examined by post-mortem, there
were calculi present in the gall-bladder; in one case the principal
calculus was egg-shaped and the size of a pullet's egg.The nutrition rapidly fails from the beginning of cancer of the liver.The downward pace is accelerated when the gastro-intestinal digestion
fails and vomiting occurs after taking food.The skin becomes dry and
wrinkled, and if not jaundiced has a peculiar tint, varying in depth of
color from an earthy or fawn-like hue to a deep bronze.Failure of
strength is a pronounced symptom from the beginning, and is out of
proportion to the loss of flesh.As the wasting advances the decline of
strength is accounted for, but the feeling of weakness and the distaste
for exertion which occur so early are very significant signs of
internal cancer, although they do not indicate the position of the
neoplasm.The urine declines in amount as the case progresses.It is usually very
high-, contains bile-pigment when jaundice is present, and other
forms of pigment produced by conditions not at present known.Sometimes
albumen is present, and leucin and tyrosin rarely.{1039} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As has been already set
forth, cancer of the liver may present so few really distinctive
symptoms as to escape recognition.Under favorable circumstances the
diagnosis may be comparatively easy.In forming an opinion it is useful
to review the whole course of the malady and draw conclusions not only
from the characteristic signs, but from the development of the symptoms
as a whole.A case of cancer of the liver occurs usually after the middle period of
life.The person so affected begins to decline in flesh and strength,
has uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, disorders of digestion, and
begins to have a pallid or earthy hue of the countenance.Presently,
much pain is felt in the hepatic region, the organ distinctly enlarges,
and some effusion of fluid and much flatus increase the dimensions of
the abdomen.Much tenderness, often exquisite sensibility, is produced
by pressure over the liver, and often over the whole abdomen.By
careful palpation nodules can be made out and their growth noted in
those cases free from peritoneal inflammation.The abdominal swelling
and tenderness incommodes the lungs, and a semi-erect decubitus is
assumed to relieve the pressure on them; the breathing becomes short,
catching, hurried, and painful, and sometimes a most distressing
hiccough is superadded to the other sufferings.Jaundice appears, or the earthy hue of the skin deepens
into a bronze discoloration.The case may be terminated by some
intercurrent disease--by an attack of pleuritis, pneumonia, by
peritonitis from rupture or perforation, by intra-peritoneal
hemorrhage, by an exhausting diarrhoea.The natural termination is by
gradual failure of the powers, by marasmus, the immediate cause of
death being due to cerebral anaemia, to failure of the heart from fatty
degeneration of the cardiac muscle, from thrombosis of the portal vein,
from the development of a hemorrhagic state, and hemorrhages from the
various mucous surfaces, etc.The duration is much influenced also by
the character of the cancer, whether scirrhous or medullary.The latter
are not only more rapidly growing, more destructive of the hepatic
tissue, and more rapidly distributed to neighboring organs, but more
quickly perforate the capsule and excite a fatal result by hemorrhage
or by peritonitis.The average duration of cancer of the liver is
variously stated.Having reference to my own personal observation,
controlled by the experience of other observers, the duration is from
three to nine months, one year being exceptional.There are cases in
which the symptoms are very acute, the progress rapid, the whole course
from the initial symptoms to the termination being completed in from
two to three months.It need hardly be observed that no case of cancer
of the liver has been cured.If
any case has seemed to be cured, it may be asserted with confidence
that cancer of the liver did not exist.DIAGNOSIS.--The differential diagnosis is concerned, first, with the
existence of cancer; second, with its form.As cancer causes
enlargement of the liver in two textural conditions--namely, uniformly
smooth, and nodular--it must be differentiated from other diseases
producing similar results.Amyloid disease and echinococcus cysts
present us types of the former; cirrhosis and syphilis, of the latter.The history of the amyloid disease and of the echinococcus cyst is very
different, and both {1040} develop much more slowly.Amyloid disease of
the liver arises simultaneously with the same form of degeneration in
other organs, and is connected with suppurative disease of some kind,
with syphilis, with chronic malarial poisoning, etc., and may occur at
any age.Echinococcus cysts enlarge painlessly and do not impair the
vital forces; the liver is elastic, and under favorable circumstances
presents by palpation the purring-tremor symptom.Cirrhosis may have to
be differentiated at two periods--during the time of enlargement,
which, however, is rather brief; and during the stage of contraction
and nodulation.The history in cancer and in cirrhosis is different:
the age, the habits of life, the rate of hepatic change, are opposed in
the two diseases; the diminution in size with nodulation is
characteristic of cirrhosis; enlargement with nodulation belongs to
cancer.The rapid progress of cancer, the wasting, the debility, the
cachexia, serve to distinguish it from all other affections of the
liver except acute yellow atrophy and phosphorus-poisoning; both,
however, are so different in history and development as not to require
differentiation.It may be quite impossible in latent cases to
distinguish primary cancer of the liver from secondary, but in those
examples of the disease occurring in the stomach, intestines, and
pancreas there is usually an antecedent history of the primary malady
which distinctly separates it in point of time and the character of the
symptoms from the secondary implication of the liver.Cancer of the
gall-bladder, and especially of the organized exudation about it, may
not be readily separated from cancer of the pancreas or of the
duodenum.In doubtful cases the history of attacks of hepatic colic
becomes an important element in making the differentiation.TREATMENT.--As we are not in possession of a cure for cancer, the
treatment of cancer of the liver must be palliative.Anodynes to
relieve pain, paracentesis of the abdomen to remove accumulation of
fluid which causes distress, carbolic acid to check nausea and
vomiting, and the usual haemostatics for hemorrhage, are the measures
most necessary.In fact, the treatment must be throughout
symptomatic--for the relief of symptoms as they arise.DEFINITION.--By amyloid liver is meant a deposit in the cells of the
organ, in its vessels and interstitial tissue, of a peculiar albuminoid
matter called amyloid because of a superficial resemblance to
starch-granules.Various designations have been applied to this
condition of the organ; thus it has been entitled waxy liver and
lardaceous liver, because of the apparent resemblance to wax and lard
respectively.CAUSES.--There exists in the blood a peculiar material, albuminoid in
form, applied in the normal state to the structure of
tissue--dystropodextrin, as it is called by Seegen--which, when
precipitated under certain conditions not now known, assumes the
peculiar appearance with which we are now familiar under the term
amyloid.The character of the amyloid matter was first distinctly set
forth in 1858 by Virchow, who also discovered the characteristic
reaction by which it can always be detected.The reaction to iodine
gave to the material the designation amyloid, or starch-like, by which
it is chiefly known.The {1041} circumstances inducing the deposit of
this material are by no means clearly understood.It has long been
known that suppuration, especially in connection with bone, has had a
distinct influence.Syphilis, especially the tertiary lesions
accompanied by pus-formation, has an evident causative relation.Chronic malarial infection has a more distant and doubtful, but still
recognized, power to develop this morbid state.Of the various causes
above mentioned, the most frequent is the suppuration of pulmonary
cavities.In regard to the influence of this, however, it must be
remembered that no form of suppurative disease is so common.The
relative frequency of the association between suppurating cavities and
amyloid disease is not greater than long-standing necrosis with an
extensive sequestrum is with the same state; but the actual number of
the former is greater.Amyloid disease of the liver is most frequent
between the ages of ten and thirty, but it may occur at any age, the
period in life being determined by the operation of the causes.Thus,
Frerichs' statistics are: under ten there were 3 cases, from ten to
twenty there were 19, and from twenty to fifty there were 37 cases.Men
are, relatively to sex, more frequently attacked, and in the proportion
of three-fourths, but this difference means, of course, the character
of men's occupations and their greater liability thereby to the
accidents and diseases incident to such employments.Besides the pathogenetic factors above mentioned, it may be well to
refer in this connection to the effect of long-standing neoplasms.It
has been found that amyloid disease is produced in some subjects by the
cachexia resulting from the slow development and persistence of such a
new formation.The special character of the neoplasm is of less
importance in respect to this condition than the constitutional
condition--the cachexia--induced by its slow growth and interference
with nutrition.Although long-standing disease, especially of a
suppurative kind, is known to be necessary to cause amyloid disease,
Cohnheim[144] has lately published some facts which seem to prove that
the degeneration may occur more speedily than has been heretofore
supposed.He has shown, contrary to the previously-accepted view, that
amyloid degeneration may follow in three months after the reception of
a gunshot wound.He records three cases in which the amyloid deposits
ensued in six, five, and three months, respectively.[Footnote 144: _Virchow's Archiv_, vol.271 _et seq._, "Zur
Kentniss der Amyloidentartung."]According to the author's observation, a peculiar somatic type is
either necessary to, or at least is greatly promotive of, the amyloid
degeneration.If, for example, the same suppurative process occurs in a
person of a blond and lymphatic type and in another of brunette and
nervo-muscular type, the former will be much more likely to suffer from
amyloid change than the latter."The gelatinous progeny of albuminous
parents" is the mode of expression used to designate this particular
type.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--To use the term amyloid liver is rather
misleading, since this indicates the restriction of the morbid process
to the liver, whereas it is perfectly well known to be rather widely
distributed through various organs and tissues of the body.The term
amyloid is itself confusing, since the albuminoid material so
designated is not really starch-like.The corpora amylacea, so called,
differ materially from starch-granules, and still more from the amyloid
matter.According to {1042} Wagner,[145] these substances "have nothing
in common."In the study of the amyloid deposit it has not been
possible to separate it from the tissue in which it is imbedded; hence
the published analyses of this peculiar material are probably far from
correct.However, it has been rendered probable that the amyloid
deposit has close affinities with fibrin.One of the theories--that of
Dickinson of London--assumes that this material is fibrin deprived of
the potash associated intimately with it.According to Seegen,
dystropodextrin, a material existing in normal blood, agrees with
amyloid matter in its most essential characteristics.Although
Dickinson's theory is not tenable, it has served a useful purpose in
showing the close affinity of fibrin with this pathological product.What view soever may be entertained of its nature, it is certain that
the material to which we apply the term amyloid is of albuminous
origin.Under circumstances with which we are now unacquainted this
material is deposited from the vessels, and, instead of undergoing
organization and contributing to the structure of tissues, remains
unorganized and unappropriated.It is known that this deposition of the
amyloid material is related to the process of suppuration and to
certain cachexiae, but the intermediate steps remain unknown and
inexplicable.[Footnote 145: _A Manual of General Pathology_, by Prof.325 _et seq._]

The amyloid matter is first exuded into the coats of the finest
ramifications of the hepatic artery, and therefore the first appearance
of the disease is in the middle zone of the lobules.In this respect
pathologists are agreed: that the amyloid deposits first appear in the
walls of the vessels.Wagner maintained, in opposition to Virchow, that
the exudation is limited to the vessels and does not extend to the
hepatic cells, which perish by pressure and consequent atrophy.It seems most probable, however, that
the ramifications of the hepatic artery and all the capillaries of the
lobule are affected, and that the deposits in them lead to atrophic
degeneration of the cells.In consequence of this extensive implication of the vascular system of
the liver important changes occur in the size, density, and appearance
of the liver.The organ is greatly enlarged in all its diameters.When
felt through the walls of the abdomen its outline is distinct, it is
firm, even hard, to the sense of touch, and it projects from a finger's
breadth to a hand's breadth below the margin of the ribs.The increase
of size of the amyloid liver is very great, attaining in weight, on the
average, twice that of the normal organ; but this size may be largely
exceeded in exceptional instances.In respect to shape and outline the
amyloid liver does not differ from the normal organ; for although its
dimensions are increased, its relations to the parts adjacent are not
altered.The weight of the amyloid liver may reach ten, twelve, even
sixteen pounds avoirdupois.The color of the amyloid liver is very
different from that of the normal organ: instead of having the
reddish-brown tint, it becomes grayish, yellowish, or reddish-gray.In
consistence the amyloid liver is firm and rather elastic and doughy,
and on section the margins of the incision are well defined, even
sharp.A very characteristic feature of the cut surface is its
paleness, anaemia, or bloodlessness, and scarcely any blood is exuded,
even from the large vessels.The appearance of the incised surface of
the liver has been described by comparison with various substances:
according to one, it is waxy; according to another, it is lardaceous.A
thin {1043} section of a part of the liver far advanced in the amyloid
change is distinctly translucent, almost transparent; but a marked
difference is observable between the amyloid matter and the lobules
proper, even in the cases of extreme deposit.The lobules are separated
by an opaque yellow border, and the centre of each is marked by a spot
of a similar yellow color.The amyloid material is remarkable for its power to resist the action
of chemical agents and putrefactive decomposition.The test originally
proposed by Virchow--iodine--continues to be the most characteristic.Orth[146] suggests a method of applying it which is very excellent in
respect to the clearness with which the reaction is shown: A large,
thin section of the affected liver is placed in a saucer of water
containing some iodine, and after the reaction has taken place is laid
on a white plate.Iodine tincture, diluted or the compound solution, is
brushed over the affected region, when the amyloid matter assumes a
deep mahogany tint and the normal tissues a merely yellowish hue.The
distinctness of the reaction may be increased by brushing over the
iodized surface some dilute sulphuric acid, when the amyloid matter
takes a deep violet, almost black, color.[Footnote 146: _Diagnosis in Pathological Anatomy_, Riverside Press,
1878, p.Only a part of the organ--namely, the smaller vessels--may be involved
in the degeneration, and this may be restricted to patches or parts of
the organ.With the amyloid change there may be associated syphilitic
gummata, or the liver may be more or less advanced in fatty
degeneration or in cirrhosis.Those parts of the organ not invaded by
the disease are not often entirely normal; they are more or less
darkened in color by venous congestion, distinctly softer, etc.The
amyloid change is not limited to the liver, but extends to the kidneys,
lymphatic glands, the intestinal mucous membrane, etc.SYMPTOMS.--As the amyloid change in the liver is usually coincident
with a simultaneous alteration of other organs, and as the deposits
characteristic of the affection are dependent on long-previous disease
of an exhausting kind, it is not surprising that the subjects of this
affection present the evidences of a cachexia.To the effects of a
chronic malady we have added the complications growing out of the
amyloid change in the liver, associated, as it usually is, with amyloid
degeneration of other important organs.The symptomatic expression of amyloid liver is therefore mixed up with
various derangements that occur simultaneously, but especially with the
causes inducing the existing cachexia, with chronic suppuration of
pulmonary cavities, or in connection with diseased bone, with the
syphilitic cachexia, or with chronic malarial toxaemia.With what cause
soever the cachexia may be associated, the symptomatology of amyloid
liver is secondary to, or ingrafted on, the conditions produced by the
cachexia.The liver is enlarged in all well-marked cases from a
finger's breadth to a hand's breadth or more below the inferior margin
of the ribs; it is also firm to the touch, well defined, elastic, and
its margin rounded, but yet well defined.There is usually no
tenderness nor pain, and, without any uneasy sensations to indicate the
change taking place, the organ is found to have slowly enlarged,
sometimes to an extraordinary extent.Careful palpation may also
demonstrate an enlargement of the spleen.When the abdominal muscles
are relaxed and there is no swelling of the abdomen by flatus or
peritoneal effusion, the very considerable enlargement of {1044} the
liver can be readily ascertained.If the effusion is not so great as to
distend the abdomen unduly, the increased consistence and dimensions of
the liver can still be made out with comparative ease.The hepatic
functions are not always sufficiently disturbed to produce
characteristic symptoms.In a small proportion--scarcely one-tenth--of
the cases does jaundice appear, and when present it is due, usually, to
enlargement of the lymphatics in the hilus of the organ, and thus
directly compressing the hepatic duct.In the writer's experience,
although jaundice has not occurred, there was present a peculiar dark
earthy or bronzed tint of the skin, significant of chronic hepatic
troubles.Obstruction of the portal circulation is rather unusual, and
the explanation is to be found in the fact that the amyloid
degeneration occurs first in the radicles of the hepatic artery.In
about one-fourth of the cases ascites is present, but in a somewhat
larger proportion hemorrhoids, blackish, tarry stools, and other
evidences of portal congestion.When the intestinal arterioles are
attacked, an intractable colliquative diarrhoea comes on; the stools
are offensive, sometimes light from the absence of bile, sometimes dark
from decomposition or the presence of blood.When the stomach
arterioles are also involved, which is usual under these circumstances,
the blandest and simplest articles of diet will pass unchanged or
simply decomposed.Blood may be vomited sometimes in large quantity
from thrombic ulcers, but the matter ejected from the stomach when the
case is well advanced is a thin, watery fluid, faintly acid or neutral,
and greenish or brownish in color.An enlarged spleen is often present, produced by the same
conditions--by amyloid degeneration.The same change taking place in
the kidney, the urine becomes pale, abundant, of low specific gravity,
and albuminous.General dropsy supervenes in a majority of the cases
finally, due largely to the hydraemia; and of this condition ascites is
a part.In some cases enlargement of the abdomen is the first step in
the dropsical effusion, and may throughout be the most prominent, as
the author has seen.In other cases oedema of the feet and legs is the
first evidence of dropsy; in still others the dropsy is general from
the beginning.Amyloid liver may coexist with a fairly good state of the bodily
nutrition, but if digestion and assimilation be interfered with by any
of the causes above mentioned, the strength rapidly declines and
emaciation reaches an extreme degree.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--As amyloid liver is never a
substantive affection, but secondary to some constitutional malady or
to long-continued suppuration, its course must be considered in
relation to the agency producing it.It is very silent in its origin
and progress, and causes no pronounced symptoms until it attains
considerable size and its functions are interfered with by the extent
of the deposits.The history of the affection to which it is secondary
therefore precedes the onset of the amyloid change and accompanies it
throughout.The enlarged organ, with the results of its enlargement in
altered functions of the abdominal organs, is a symptom superadded to
existing disturbances.The period elapsing in the course of a chronic
suppurative disease before the amyloid change occurs differs greatly in
different cases, and may be stated as from three months (Cohnheim's
case) to many years.Many of the cases terminate by an intercurrent
disease; others by uraemic {1045} convulsions; a very few by hemorrhage
from the stomach or intestines; and those pursuing their course
uninterruptedly, by exhaustion.By some a cure at the beginning of
the morbid deposits is regarded as possible, and examples of cures have
been reported.The writer has seen supposed cases of amyloid liver
terminate in recovery.There must always remain an impression that in
such instances an error of diagnosis was committed.Those of syphilitic
origin are probably more curable, but syphiloma of the liver may be
confounded with amyloid disease, and hence the cure may be referred to
the latter.DIAGNOSIS.--Amyloid degeneration of the liver may be confounded with
the various non-febrile enlargements of the organ.An important element
in making the differentiation is the history of suppuration in
connection with bone, with lung cavities, with constitutional syphilis,
with chronic malarial toxaemia, etc.From fatty liver, amyloid
degeneration is distinguished by the history as just sketched; by the
fatty tendencies of the body in the former, emaciation in the latter;
by the concomitant changes in the spleen, kidneys, and elsewhere; and
by the subsequent history, fatty liver terminating by a weak heart
usually, whilst the amyloid disease ends in the modes described in the
preceding paragraph.From hydatid disease, amyloid liver is
differentiated by the history, by the difference in the physical
characteristics of the enlargement, by the presence of the purring
tremor in the one, its absence in the other, and especially by the
subsequent course.In all doubtful cases the use of an aspirator-needle
and the withdrawal of some fluid containing the characteristic hooklets
of the echinococcus will serve to determine the nature of the growth.From cancer, amyloid liver is separated by the previous history, by the
nodular character of the enlargement, by the pain, and by the cachexia
and associated derangements.Whilst amyloid liver is secondary to
suppurative diseases, cancer is usually secondary to cancer of the
stomach or other organ within the limits of the portal circulation.TREATMENT.--As amyloid disease owes its origin to syphilis, to chronic
malarial toxaemia, to suppuration, these, so far as they are remediable
conditions, should be cured as speedily as may be, to prevent the
development of the amyloid disease or to arrest it if begun.Unfortunately, the condition of the liver is not recognized until the
morbid change is effected, and therefore practically irremediable.The treatment necessarily involves that of the morbid state to which
the amyloid deposits are owing.The syphilitic disease requires iodine
and mercury; the malarial, quinine, iodine and the iodides, eucalyptus,
iron, etc., according to the state of each case; and surgical diseases,
especially necrosis of bone, should be effectively treated by suitable
surgical expedients.The cause being removed if possible, what means,
if any, can be resorted to to cause the absorption of the amyloid
matter?The only specific plan of treatment hitherto proposed is that
of Dickinson,[147] based on his theory of the constitution of amyloid
matter; according to which the amyloid deposits consist of fibrin
altered by the separation of the potash and soda salts, which have been
eliminated in the pus.If this theory be admitted, the obvious
indication is to supply the alkaline materials.The cases reported by
Dickinson in which this theory was {1046} practically demonstrated were
not sufficiently improved to lend any empirical support to this method.[Footnote 147: _The Pathology and Treatment of Albuminuria_, p.214 _et
seq._]

The medicinal remedies which do any good are the iodides--notably the
iodides of ammonium, of iron, of manganese, etc., the compound solution
of iodine, and the double iodide of iron and manganese.As the
officinal ointment of the red iodide of mercury, rubbed in over the
splenic region, does so much good in chronic enlargement of the spleen,
it is probable that it will prove effective in this form of enlargement
of the liver.The writer has observed results from it in such cases
that justify him in strongly urging its employment.The method of its
application consists in rubbing perseveringly a piece of the ointment,
a large pea in size, over the whole hepatic area, and repeating it
daily until some irritation and desquamation of the skin is produced,
when it should be suspended until the parts will bear renewed
applications.Besides the topical application of the red iodide, this
remedy may be given internally with advantage without reference to
syphilitic infection.It seems to the writer probable that bichloride
of mercury may be as useful, as it is certainly more manageable.The
chloride of gold and sodium, arsenic in small doses, and the metallic
tonics, so called, may be useful carefully administered, especially the
first mentioned, which the writer believes has some real power over the
disease.As the hepatic functions are
much disturbed, if not entirely suspended, it is necessary to give
those foods which are converted into peptones in the stomach.As a
rule, fats, starches, and sweets are mischievous, and milk, meats,
oysters, and the nitrogenous foods best adapted to nourish the patient.If the diarrhoea should prove exhausting, the mineral acids, with
opium, are the best remedies.Nausea and vomiting are best relieved by
carbolic acid mixture, and hemorrhages by the solution of the chloride
or subsulphate of iron.Fatty Liver; Fatty Degeneration of the Liver (Hepar Adiposum).DEFINITION.--By the term fatty liver is meant a change in the organ
characterized by the excessive quantity of fat- or oil-globules
contained in the cells of the parenchyma.CAUSES.--The liver acts, under normal conditions, as a reservoir for
the surplus fat, which it gives out as the demand is made.It is not
only the fat brought to the liver by the blood which accumulates in the
organ, but it apparently possesses the power to transform certain
substances--albumen, for example--into fat.An important causative
element, therefore, is the quantity of fat present in the food
habitually consumed.This has been proved by the investigations of
Radziejewsky[148] and others, who have shown that the fat in the food
is stored up in the normal places of deposit, one of which, of course,
is the liver.Another causative element is the formation of fat from
the albumen of the hepatic cells in consequence of diminished
oxidation.In respect to both causes the consumption of oxygen is an
important factor.The insufficient supply of oxygen {1047} which is a
necessary result of a sedentary life leads thus, directly, to the
accumulation of fat in the liver-cells.A constitutional predisposition
is also an important factor.There are those who under certain
conditions of daily life store up large supplies of fat, and others who
under the same conditions continue lean.Women more than men are
subject to such inherited predispositions.[Footnote 148: _Virchow's Archiv fur path.Anat., etc._, Band lvi.Again, fatty liver occurs in the course of certain cachexiae, notably
phthisis.In this case the obstructive pulmonary lesions interfere with
the process of oxidation, and also maintain a constant hyperaemia of
the portal system.This condition of the liver also occurs in the
cancerous cachexia, in anaemia and chlorosis of long standing, in
chronic suppurative diseases, etc.The dyscrasia of chronic alcoholism
is a very common cause of fatty liver.At the same time that
hyperplasia of the connective tissue is taking place the fat is
accumulating in the hepatic cells.So great is the accumulation of fat
in the blood that the serum presents a milky appearance.This excess in
the quantity of fat is rather due to diminished oxidation, to lessened
combustion, than to increased production.Another causative element of
the fat-production in cases of alcoholism is the interference of
alcohol with the process of digestion and assimilation.Poisoning by phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, and other metals sets up an
acute fatty degeneration of the liver.Pregnancy, lactation, and
suppuration also have the same effect, but to a slighter and less
permanent extent.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Fatty liver agrees with amyloid liver in that
the fatty deposits increase the size and weight of the organ.The
surface is smooth, the peritoneal investment unaltered, and the margins
rounded.Sometimes the organ is merely increased in thickness,
sometimes in diameter.It has a greasy feel and cuts like a mass of
fatty tissue.Examined at a low temperature--below freezing--it seems
like a mass of suet, the proper structure being almost extinguished in
the fatty metamorphosis.The outline of the lobules remains distinct
even in cases far advanced in the fatty degeneration, but in the
extreme cases it is obliterated, the cut surface presenting a uniformly
yellowish or grayish-yellow tint.The fatty liver is also wanting in
blood; it is dry, and on section only the largest vessels contain any
blood.When cardiac disease of a kind to produce congestion of the
venous system exists--for example, mitral or tricuspid lesions--the
same relative decrease in the quantity of blood in the liver is
observable after death, although during the life of the subject the
opposite condition may have been present.The cause of this
bloodlessness of the fatty liver is to be sought in the pressure
exerted by the growing fat-cells.Not all cases of fatty liver are advanced to the degree indicated in
the above description.From the normal size up to the maximum attained
by the most advanced fatty liver there are numerous gradations in the
quantity of fat and in the dimensions of the organ.Fatty degeneration
may accompany cirrhosis, in which the liver is contracted.The deposits
of fat may take place in particular areas.In cases of fatty liver per
se the deposit occurs within the liver-cells, as may be demonstrated on
microscopic examination, the initial change consisting in the formation
of granules in the protoplasm which ultimately coalesce, thus producing
{1048} fat-globules or cells.The fatty change in the hepatic cells
proceeds in a certain methodical manner from the cells at the periphery
of each lobule to the centre.The quantity of fat deposited in the
liver in cases of fatty change is very great.In the normal condition
of the organ fat exists, according to Perls,[149] in the proportion of
3 per cent.When the condition of fatty
liver exists the quantity of fat rises to 40, even 45, per
cent.--almost one-half.It is important to note, as was pointed out by
Frerichs, that in an inverse ratio with the increase of fat was the
quantity of water.[Footnote 149: _Virchow's Archiv_, _supra_.]That more or less fatty change in the liver is not incompatible with a
normal functional activity is quite certain, but the boundary between
health and disease is by no means well defined in respect to the
quantity of fatty change in the liver-cells.The liver, within certain
limits, is a mere reservoir of the surplus fat of the body, and hence a
variable, but not excessive, amount of accumulation of fat is not
incompatible with a normal functional performance of the organ.The
limits of a merely functional state and of a diseased state are not,
therefore, very clearly defined.In certain inferior animals, as
Frerichs has shown, a fatty condition of the liver is normal.SYMPTOMS.--The signs and symptoms of fatty liver are by no means well
defined.This state of the organ, as a rule, accompanies the general
tendency to fatty metamorphosis and deposit in the body.It is a
symptom in the course of phthisis, of chronic alcoholism, and of
various forms of metallic poisoning, but under these circumstances
there is no material change in the course of the symptoms produced by
this complication.As an independent affection it rarely, if ever,
exists alone.So far as its symptoms can be defined, they are referable
to the organs of digestion and assimilation and to the liver itself.The appetite is generally good, but distress after eating, acidity and
heartburn, eructations of acid liquid and of certain articles of diet,
are experienced.The stools are usually rather soft or liquid, wanting
in color, whitish or pasty, and occasionally dark, almost black, owing
to the presence of blood.The
discharges are often offensive from the decomposition of certain
constituents of the food, acid and burning because of the presence of
acetic, butyric, and other fat acids, or merely offensive because of
the formation of hydrogen compounds with sulphur and phosphorus.Notwithstanding the derangement of the stomachal and intestinal
digestion, the deposition of fat continues in an abnormal ratio.With
the increase in body-weight a decline in muscular power takes place.The respiration is hurried on the slightest exertion, and dyspnoea is
produced by any prolonged muscular effort.The circulation is feeble
and the pulse slow in the state of repose, but on active exertion the
pulse becomes rapid and at the same time feeble.The sleep is disturbed
by horrifying dreams, and only on assuming a nearly sitting posture can
the patient sleep with any degree of quietude.In these cases of fatty liver a very considerable mental inquietude,
despondency, even hypochondria and melancholia, result.The relation of
insufficient hepatic excretion to the mental state is yet sub judice,
but there can be no doubt that some connection exists.From the
earliest {1049} period hepatic derangements--as the term hypochondria
denotes--have been associated with certain disorders of the mind.This
relation certainly holds good in respect to the mental perturbation
occurring in cases of fatty liver.With a rotund countenance and a
well-nourished body there is associated very considerable mental
despondency.Without distinct jaundice the skin has an earthen or tallow-like hue,
the conjunctiva is muddy or distinctly yellow, and now and then
well-defined jaundice appears.The urine is rather scanty, high- because of the presence of
bile-pigments, and deposits urates abundantly.When jaundice
accompanies fatty liver the urine will be very dark, muddy, thick, and
will react to the usual tests for bile, urates, etc.The area of hepatic dulness is, as a rule, enlarged in cases of fatty
liver.The deposition of fat in the cells adds to the gross size of the
organ, and hence the inferior margin extends below the border of the
ribs to a degree determined by the amount of increase in its substance.If the liver can be felt, it is smooth, not hard and resisting, and is
free from nodules.Usually, however, owing to deposits of fat in the
omentum and in the abdominal walls, the outlines and condition of the
liver cannot be ascertained, and must remain merely conjectural.Rather, therefore, by implication than by direct examination can the
condition of the liver be ascertained.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of fatty liver, as an
element in a general change not of a toxic character, is essentially of
a chronic character.The fatty liver of acute phosphorus, antimonial,
and other forms of poisoning is acute and fatal, but it is not these
forms with which we are here concerned.Acting the part of a reservoir
of the surplus fat stored up in the body, which may be disposed of
under normal and physiological conditions, the fatty liver becomes by
careful management a normal organ again.The course, duration, and
termination will therefore largely depend on the nature of the
management pursued.A fatty liver cannot, then, be regarded as fatal,
or even as dangerous to life per se.The course and termination will
therefore be those of the associated condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The determination of the existence of fatty liver will not
be difficult in all those cases in which this condition may properly be
suspected; for example, in phthisis, in chronic alcoholismus, in
obesity, and in cases of habitual indulgence in eating and drinking.If
in these cases the organ is distinctly enlarged, is smooth, and is
flabby in outline; if at the same time the digestion is deranged, the
stools are light in color, there are hemorrhoids, flatulence, acid
indigestion, and torpid bowels,--a fatty liver may be reasonably
suspected.The subjects of fatty liver are usually obese, and present
the characteristics typical of that condition, or they are the victims
of alcoholismus or present the evidence of habitual indulgence in the
pleasures of the table.The differentiation of fatty liver from amyloid
degeneration, from cystic disease, and from other maladies causing
enlargement of the organ is made by reference to these points in the
etiological history--by a careful study of the condition of the organ
itself and of the organs associated with it in function.As the amyloid
liver is more likely to be confounded with the fatty liver, it should
be noted that the former is an outgrowth of the process of suppuration,
that the organ {1050} is hard in texture, and that amyloid change
occurs at the same time in other organs--conditions opposed to those
characteristic of the fatty liver.Cancer of the liver is accompanied
by a peculiar cachexia; the body wastes, and the enlarged liver is hard
and nodular instead of being smooth and flabby.TREATMENT.--When fatty liver is a symptom merely, its treatment is
merged into that of the primary condition.Thus, in phthisis and in the
various forms of metallic and phosphorus-poisoning the condition of the
liver is quite secondary.There are cases of obesity, however, in which
the fatty change in the liver is a part of the general morbid process,
and must be treated accordingly.There are still other cases in which,
without a decided tendency to obesity, the food habitually consumed is
of a fatty or fat-forming nature.The first requisite in the treatment
of fatty liver is to amend the diet.From the time of Hippocrates down
to Mr.Banting it has been recognized that the starchy and saccharine
constituents of the food, as well as the fatty, contribute to the
formation of fat.In arranging a dietary in cases of fatty liver this
fact should be regarded.Besides excluding the fats, saccharine and
starchy substances should be cut off.The diet should be composed of
fresh animal foods, game, fish, oysters, and such succulent vegetables
as lettuce, celery, spinach, raw cabbage (cole-slaw), etc.Amongst the
articles excluded should be bread, but the greatest difficulty is
experienced in its withdrawal, many patients declaring themselves
unable to live without it.In such instances a small biscuit
(water-cracker) may be allowed, but, as far as may be accomplished,
bread should be cut off from the diet.If there are acidity, heartburn, pyrosis, and regurgitation of acid
liquid, much good may be expected from the administration of diluted
nitric acid before meals, especially if there be considerable uric acid
in the urine.The simultaneous administration of tincture of nux vomica
will prove useful if the appetite is poor and the digestion feeble.When the complexion is muddy, the conjunctivae yellow, and the tongue
coated, excellent results are had from the persistent use of phosphate
of sodium.Even better results may be had from a combination of the two agents, a
teaspoonful of the pulverized phosphate being given with one-fortieth
of a grain of the arseniate of sodium.Alkalies, as lithium citrate,
solution of potassa, etc., are unquestionably useful as remedies for
obesity and fatty liver, but they must be administered with a proper
caution.Also, the permanganate of potassium has seemed to the author
to be especially valuable as a remedy for these states.Remedies to increase the activity of the portal circulation and
diminish congestion of the hepatic vessels are useful at the outset,
but the anaemia which succeeds renders their use improper at a later
period.Amongst the hepatic stimulants of great use in those cases
characterized by whitish, pasty stools, yellow conjunctivae, etc., are
resin of podophyllin, euonymin, baptisin, and others having the same
powers.Saline laxatives are also useful, but to a less extent.It must
be remembered, however, that these subjects are wanting in bodily
vigor, often suffer from weak heart, and always have flabby muscles, so
that they bear all depleting measures badly.The hepatic stimulant of
greatest utility in these cases is sulphate of manganese.The writer
has had excellent results from a {1051} combination of quinine and
manganese.For the general state, which denotes insufficient oxidation
according to the chemical pathologists, permanganate of potassium is a
remedy of value, as above mentioned.The best form in which to
administer this is the compressed tablet, and the dose usually is two
grains.As chalybeate tonics are indicated, the oxidizing power of the
succinate of the ferric peroxide, the remedy so warmly advocated by
Buckler, may be utilized with advantage.The combination of quinine,
iron, and manganese in pill form, or the syrup of the iodides of iron
and manganese, or the phosphate of iron, quinine, and strychnine, are
tonics adapted to the relief of the depression accompanying this
malady.AFFECTIONS OF THE BILIARY PASSAGES.Catarrh of the Bile-Ducts.HISTORY AND DEFINITION.--Although catarrh of the bile-ducts had been
incidentally referred to by some previous writers, notably by Stokes of
Dublin, Virchow[150] was the first to treat of this condition
systematically.Amongst recent writers, Harley[151] appears to be the
only one disposed to question the importance of catarrh of the
bile-ducts as a factor in the production of jaundice.Even in
phosphorus-poisoning the appearance of jaundice, at one time supposed
to be haematogenic in source, has been referred to a catarrh of the
bile-ducts.[152] It seems probable that opinions have too decidedly
veered toward the importance of this condition as a factor in the
production of jaundice.[Footnote 150: _Archiv fur path.117 _et seq._]

[Footnote 151: _Diseases of the Liver_, _supra_.][Footnote 152: Wyss, _Archiv der Heilkunde_, 1867, p.CAUSES.--Catarrh of the bile-ducts has been referred to all those
causes which can excite a catarrhal process in any situation.Amongst the systemic may be placed peculiarities of
constitution or idiosyncrasy.A tendency to hepatic disorders is a
feature in certain types of constitution, and, as such types are
transmitted, the hepatic disorders seem to be inherited.In such
persons, possessing the so-called bilious nature, catarrh of the
biliary passages is not uncommon, and a special susceptibility to it
apparently exists.The atmospherical and other causes which in some
subjects will set up a catarrh of the bronchi will in the bilious type
induce a catarrh of the duodenum and bile-ducts.The malady is not
inherited; only the character of bodily structure which favors it under
the necessary conditions.Climatic changes and certain seasons, especially the autumn, are
influential causes.Exposure to cold and dampness, the body warm and
perspiring, will set up a catarrhal process in the bile-ducts and
intestine, especially in those having the special susceptibility which
belongs to certain bodily types.Malarial miasm is an especially active
cause in malarial regions.The writer has seen many examples in various
parts of the United States within the malaria-breeding zone.Other
miasmatic agencies are not without importance.The exhalations from the
{1052} freshly-upturned soil of some cities, the gases from cesspools
and sewers, and illuminating gas exert a causative influence.The bad
air thus made up has been happily called civic malaria.The most influential causes of catarrh of the biliary passages are
local in origin and in action: they are the agencies which induce
catarrh of the duodenum.Disturbances of the portal circulation should
be first named.Whenever obstructive lesions of the cardiac orifices
exist, whenever the pulmonary circulation is impeded by disease of the
lungs, the portal vein is kept abnormally full, and as a necessary
result of the stasis a catarrh of the mucous membrane follows.Congestion of the portal system may be a result of vaso-motor paresis.The abdominal sympathetic may be the seat of various reflex
disturbances: those of a depressing kind induce stasis in the portal
system.Certain medicinal agents have this effect, and prolonged and
severe cutaneous irritation, it is probable, may act on the portal
circulation in the same way.The action of cold on the peripheral
nerves may be similarly explained.Catarrh by contiguity of tissue is the most frequent factor.Catarrh of
the duodenal mucous membrane is the initial condition, and from thence
the process extends to the bile-ducts.Although the duodenum may be
alone affected, the usual state of things is a gastro-intestinal
catarrh, the stomach and the whole length of the small intestine being
simultaneously diseased.When the catarrhal process is thus diffused
the duodenal mucous membrane is most deranged, probably because the
acid and fermenting chyme is first received here, and what acridity
soever it may possess attacks this part in its greatest strength.It
must be remembered that the secretion of the duodenal glands and of the
pancreas and liver must also have an abnormal character; hence those
foods which in the healthy condition of things are digested in this
part of the canal undergo ordinary putrefactive decomposition and
furnish very irritating products.This observation is especially true
of the fats: the fat acids are in the highest degree irritating.The
digestive fluid of the duodenum has a more or less pathological
character, because the catarrhal process not only interferes with the
habitually easy flow of the gland secretions, but, extending to the
gland elements themselves, gradually alter their structure.Gastro-intestinal catarrh results from the misuse of foods and the
abuse of certain condiments and of spirits.Excess in the quantity of
starchy, saccharine, and fatty foods which undergo conversion and
absorption in the intestine, habitually consumed, decomposition of such
portions as escape proper digestion ensues, and the products of this
decomposition exercise an irritant influence on the mucous membrane.The daily consumption of sauces and condiments and of highly-seasoned
foods has a constant irritating action; but more influential than any
other causative agency is the abuse of malt liquors and spirit.Mary went to the bedroom.Whilst
the latter acts more on the stomach and the liver proper, the former
affect more the duodenal mucous membrane and the bile-ducts.To these causative agencies must be added a pathological state of the
bile itself.Under conditions not now known the bile seems to acquire
acrid properties and set up a catarrh in passing along the ducts.PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--The area affected by the catarrhal process
varies greatly.The termination of the common duct for a short space
may be the only part affected, but with this there is always more or
less, {1053} sometimes most extensive and severe, duodenal catarrh,
followed by jaundice.The extent to which the common duct is affected
may be exactly indicated by the staining with bile, which extends down
to the point of obstruction.The catarrhal process may invade the whole
extent of the common duct, the cystic duct, gall-bladder, and the
ramifications of the tube throughout the organ.The first change observable is a more or less considerable hyperaemia
of the mucous membrane; but this is rarely seen, because the
examination cannot be made at the time when this condition is present.The epithelial layer is swollen, sodden, the cells cloudy, undergoing
rapid multiplication and desquamating.The cast-off cylindrical
epithelium, mucous cells, and serum make up a turbid mixture, which,
with bile, fills the smaller ducts, and may in places, especially at
the orifice of the common duct, form an obstruction sufficient to
prevent the passage of the bile; which may, however, be readily pressed
out with a little force.Especially near the end of the common duct the
mucus is apt to accumulate, and a plug of it, often tenacious and
somewhat consistent, obstructs the orifice.It is probable that whilst
catarrh is the chief cause of jaundice, it may also, by a merely
intermittent activity, cause the condition of biliousness--now so far
relieved as to permit the bile to descend into the intestine, now so
much obstruction as to prevent the escape of any considerable part of
that formed.When the common duct is the seat of the catarrhal process,
and the outflow of bile thus prevented, it accumulates in the
gall-bladder, which may be so far distended as to present a
recognizable tumor of pyriform shape through the abdominal parietes.When the catarrhal process invades the finer ducts the appearances are
somewhat different.There are no bile-stains along the course of the
common and cystic ducts, and the gall-bladder is empty, or at most
contains only some mucus, with altered bile.The tubes at or near their
ultimate ramifications contain a turbid mucus composed of cylindrical
epithelium and lymphoid cells, and tenacious enough to close them
firmly.More or less hyperaemia of the liver-structures proper, and
consequent increased dimensions of the organ, a more or less active
catarrhal condition of the duodenal mucous membrane, accompany the
changes in the finer ducts.SYMPTOMS.--There are marked differences in the behavior of the more
acute cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts and the chronic examples of
the same disorder.The former is held to be the most frequent cause of
jaundice, whilst the latter is an important element in the so-called
bilious state, in lithaemia, and as a secondary condition in some
cardiac and pulmonary diseases.Also, the morbid complexus of catarrh
of the bile-ducts includes the symptoms of duodenal and gastro-duodenal
catarrh.The acute form of this disease sets in with the symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh.Usually, after indulgence in too highly
stimulating food or in some article having a specially irritating
character, an attack of acute indigestion supervenes.The tongue is
more or less heavily coated, the breath heavy, the taste bitter, pasty,
or sourish, the appetite poor or actual repugnance to food, especially
to the offending articles, is experienced, and nausea, not unfrequently
vomiting, ensues.The epigastrium and the hypochondriac regions have a
heavy, overloaded, distressed, {1054} and sore feeling; there is some
tenderness to pressure; sometimes the gall-bladder, abnormally full,
may be detected by careful palpation; and the area of hepatic dulness
will usually be increased.The abdomen is more or less distended by
gases, and eructations of offensive gases (hydrogen and sulphur
compounds, volatile fat acids, etc.)Constipation exists when
the catarrhal process is limited to the duodenum, and the stools
consist of hard lumps having a light yellow, clay-, or whitish
appearance.When the whole extent of the small intestine is affected,
the stools will be soft, liquid, or watery, and will vary in color from
yellow to gray or white.In some cases the fecal matters will have an
offensive odor--the odor of decomposition--and considerable discharges
of very foul-smelling gas will attend the evacuations.This symptom
will occur when the intestinal digestion is suspended and the contents
of the bowel in consequence undergo putrefactive decomposition.During the initial period of the disorder the urine will simply be
high- and loaded with urates and uric acid, but when jaundice
supervenes the pigment will convert the urine into a dark,
coffee-, and somewhat thick liquid.With the onset of the malady symptoms referable to the nervous system
appear.Headache, dizziness, and hebetude of mind are present, and now
and then an attack of catarrh of the bile-ducts will have the objective
signs of an ordinary migraine or sick headache.Usually, however, as
the intestinal and hepatic troubles develop, headache and some mental
hebetude come on, but when jaundice supervenes the headache becomes
more severe, and very considerable mental depression, irritability of
temper, and moroseness are experienced.Chilly sensations, with flashes
of heat, are felt at the outset, but with the appearance of jaundice
the sensation of coldness predominates.In some cases, the intestinal
catarrh being extensive, there will be, after some preliminary
chilliness, a febrile movement, but this is never of a pronounced
character, and in the slighter cases of the disease or when the
catarrhal process is limited to the bile-ducts, there is no elevation
of temperature.With the first symptoms the pulse is somewhat
quickened, but as the bile acids accumulate in the blood they effect a
decided slowing of the heart's action, the pulse falling as low, it may
be, as 50 per minute.This lessened activity of the circulation is
accompanied by corresponding reduction of temperature, the body-heat
falling a degree or more.The most distinctive symptom of catarrh of the bile-ducts is jaundice.In the acute or quickly-developing form above described of catarrhal
icterus the symptoms of gastro-intestinal disturbance precede the first
indication of jaundice from five to eight days.Yellowness of the
conjunctiva and of those parts of the body exposed to the air is the
first manifestation; afterward the jaundice hue becomes general.The
tint varies in depth from a faint gamboge-yellow, only discernible in a
favorable light, to a deep greenish- or brownish-yellow.In the more chronic cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts the symptoms are
simply those of a gastro-duodenal catarrh, to which some hepatic
disturbances are superadded.Some abdominal uneasiness felt in the
epigastrium and in the right hypochondrium, especially in two to three
hours after meals; flatulence, sometimes accompanied by colic; {1055}
constipation, persistent or alternating with diarrhoea--in the one case
in hard lumps with more or less mucus adherent, in the other soft or
liquid, and in both cases having a rather golden-yellow color, grayish
or black and tar-like appearance,--such are the symptoms referable to
the intestinal canal.The disturbances in the hepatic functions
produced by the catarrhal swelling of the mucous membrane of the ducts
are further exhibited in a somewhat sallow, earthy, or muddy
complexion, yellowish tint of the conjunctiva, high-, acid urine
loaded with urates and phosphates.Such subjects, although having, it
may be, a keen appetite, rather lose than gain in weight: they
experience lassitude, headache, much depression of spirits, and the
mental symptoms are most pronounced during the time intestinal
digestion is going on.In fact, the morbid complexus is rather that of
intestinal catarrh; nevertheless, the slight degree of obstruction to
the outflow of bile occurring in these cases has an influence both in
the intestinal digestion and in the nutritive functions.Any degree of
obstruction, as has already been pointed out, leads to serious
structural change of the liver, and this in turn produces well-defined
symptoms.Disturbances of the hepatic functions, even jaundice, accompany the
paroxysms of malarial fever.Without the occurrence of fever, catarrhal
jaundice may come on during the course of chronic malarial poisoning.Catarrh of the bile-ducts is the pathogenetic factor in these cases.More especially in malarial regions, but also in temperate and warm
climates, paroxysmal attacks, with or without jaundice, are
comparatively frequent.These acute seizures occur in those having the
chronic form of the malady, and are excited by sudden climatic changes,
by excesses in eating, especially by the use of improper articles of
diet.Considerable nausea, flatulence, and constipation or diarrhoea,
weight, tension, and soreness in the right hypochondrium and sometimes
in the shoulder, chilliness, general malaise, headache, and an
increasing icterode tint of the skin, constitute the complexus of
symptoms belonging to these cases.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Acute catarrh of the bile-ducts
with jaundice has a well-defined course--in its mildest form, with
little gastric or gastro-intestinal disturbance--lasting ten days or
two weeks; in the ordinary form, with the accompanying gastro-duodenal
catarrh, running its course in a month to six weeks.In the chronic
form, with acute exacerbations due to indiscretions in diet or to
climatic influences, the course of the disease is chequered by
vicissitudes, the result of the causes just mentioned, and its duration
must therefore be indefinite and, as a rule, protracted.Catarrh of the
bile-ducts, or catarrhal jaundice, usually terminates in health after a
period of functional derangement of the intestines and liver.Without
exhibiting any features of a special character, some cases do not pass
through this benign course: the intestinal catarrh sets up an
ulcerative process at one or more points in the duodenum; but more
especially the obstruction to the free course of the bile caused by the
catarrhal swelling of the mucous lining of the ducts induces structural
changes in the liver--an hypertrophy of the connective-tissue elements,
a sclerosis.DIAGNOSIS.--There are but two signs which indicate the nature of the
disorder, and only one that is really distinctive.Intestinal
indigestion with slight coincident biliary derangement is one, and
jaundice is the {1056} other.When, after the signs and symptoms of
gastro-duodenal catarrh have declared themselves, jaundice appears,
there can be no question as to the nature of the case.The diagnosis is
more difficult in the chronic cases with exacerbations due to the
exciting causes above mentioned, for the persistence of the jaundice
will suggest the occurrence of some permanent organic lesion.The
differentiation of the various kinds of jaundice has already been made.TREATMENT.--Regulation of the diet is of the first importance.Those
foods requiring the intestinal juices for their solution and
absorption, and which cannot be properly digested when a duodenal
catarrh exists or when bile is absent, should of course be excluded
from the diet.These articles are the fats, starches, and sweets.The
mucus playing the part of a ferment, these substances are converted
into various secondary products of an irritating character.Flatulence
is caused by the evolution of carbonic acid gas and the hydrogen
compounds of sulphur and phosphorus; and acetic, butyric, and other
acids not only change the reaction of the intestinal juices, but are
directly irritating to the mucous membrane.In the acute cases a diet
of skimmed milk, taken hot and at three hours' interval, and after the
acute symptoms have subsided, in conjunction with some other aliment,
is the most appropriate mode of alimentation.Meats, fish, eggs, and
oysters are the chief articles of diet, besides the milk, during the
whole course of the more chronic cases; and to these may be added the
succulent vegetables, as lettuce, spinach, celery, raw cabbage, and
tomatoes.If, in consequence of irritability of the mucous membrane or
of idiosyncrasy, any article occasions distress, it should be omitted
from the diet.The medicinal management includes the administration of remedies for
gastro-intestinal catarrh.The treatment of catarrhal jaundice has been
discussed.When constipation exists, saline laxatives, especially
phosphate of sodium and Rochelle salt, are useful.If there be
diarrhoea, the most appropriate remedies are bismuth, with or without
carbolic acid, Hope's mixture, oxides of zinc and silver, and other
mineral tonic astringents.The propriety of the administration of special hepatic
stimulants--cholagogues--has been much disputed.When the disorder
consists merely in an obstruction to the outflow of bile, the utility
of stimulating the production of this secretion seems more than
doubtful.Much harm has been done by the indiscriminate use of mercury.Its power to increase the production of bile having been assumed, and
the quantity of bile present in the feces being manifestly less in
cases of catarrhal jaundice, it followed that mercury should be
employed in this disorder.Modern experience has quite demonstrated its
inutility in the mode and for the purpose to which it was formerly
devoted.Nevertheless, good effects are had from calomel in small doses
as a sedative to the mucous membrane.When there are nausea, headache,
vertigo, and constipation present, excellent results may be had from
the 1/20 gr.of calomel, exhibited at short intervals until
the bowels are moved.If calomel possessed the property formerly
ascribed to it, of stimulating the hepatic functions, it would be
contraindicated in catarrh of the bile-ducts.This contraindication
exists in respect to all hepatic stimulants.If there be decided irritability of the stomach and constipation,
{1057} Seidlitz powders may be given at regular intervals.Phosphate of
sodium in drachm doses is highly useful for the double purpose of a
laxative effect and to prevent the tendency to inspissation of the
bile, which is one of the most important results of catarrh of the
bile-ducts and gall-bladder.In the more chronic cases the persistent
use of sodium phosphate is to be highly commended.In this disease, especially as it occurs in gouty subjects, sulphate of
manganese is often decidedly serviceable.If anaemia and debility
coexist, this remedy can be combined with sulphate of iron and sulphate
of quinine--a combination which the writer has found peculiarly
effective under such circumstances.When oxidation is deficient and the
urates are present in the urine in excessive quantity, good effects are
had from the permanganate of potassium, a tablet containing two grains
being given four times a day.In the more chronic cases the salts of
silver, copper, and zinc are really very useful, especially the oxides
of silver and zinc; and of these the former is more efficient.Better
than any of those mentioned is arsenic, as arseniate of sodium or as
Fowler's solution, but the best results are had from small or medium
doses persistently used.If there be much intestinal catarrh and
consequent diarrhoea, bismuth and aromatic powder, oxide of silver,
Fowler's solution with a little opium, Hope's mixture, etc.It is in catarrh of the bile-ducts that nitric and nitro-muriatic acids
have proved useful, rather than in cirrhosis and other diseases of the
liver-tissues.They prevent fermentation, promote oxidation, and
increase the activity of the assimilative functions.When there occurs
active fermentation of certain foods, and consequently considerable
flatulence, excellent results are obtained from the members of the
antiseptic group--from creasote or carbolic acid, salicylic acid,
biborate of sodium, the benzoates, etc.To these may be added quinine,
the dose of which will be determined by the purpose for which it is
prescribed.So often is catarrhal jaundice of malarial origin that
quinine becomes a remedy of high importance in the cases occurring in
the malarial-forming zone.Certain special plans of treatment have been proposed for the cure of
catarrhal jaundice.One of the most effective of these is enemata of
cold water.By means of an irrigating apparatus the large intestine is
well distended with water once a day for several days.The first enema
has a temperature of 60 degrees F., and subsequent injections are a
little warmer.The increased peristalsis of the bowels and the reflex
contractions of the gall-bladder dislodge the mucus lining and
obstructing the gall-ducts.When the bile flows into the intestine,
digestion is resumed and the catarrhal inflammation subsides.But with
the irrigation method may be employed other remedies, as above
indicated.Faradization of the gall-bladder has been used successfully for the
expulsion of the stored-up bile and the removal of the mucus
obstructing the ducts.It is applied by means of one moistened sponge
electrode placed directly over the gall-bladder, and the other on the
opposite side of the body and posteriorly.A slowly-interrupted faradic
current is then passed.This expedient is not suitable when the case is
acute in character.{1058} Biliary Concretions; Gall-Stones; Hepatic Calculi; Hepatic
Colic.DEFINITION.--There are two classes of concretions which may occasion
symptoms: inspissated bile and regularly-formed gall-stones.Slowly-developing symptoms of jaundice from obstruction may arise from
the deposit of particles of inspissated bile in the hepatic ducts, or
sudden attacks of hepatic colic be due to the passage of concretions.When biliary calculi reach the intestines, certain kinds of disturbance
may be caused by their presence there.Under the term biliary
concretions must be considered, therefore, the mechanism of their
production, their composition, the symptoms caused by their passage
through the ducts (hepatic colic), and the intestinal disturbance due
to their retention in the bowel.Formation: Inspissated Bile.--Those concretions consisting of
inspissated bile are irregularly-shaped masses of a brownish,
greenish-brown, or reddish-brown color, friable and crumbling into a
gritty dust with slight pressure of the fingers.When recent and before
drying, they are softer, almost pultaceous, and may take the form of
the canal through which pressed.But as seen after drying they present
the appearance of a dark vegetable extract, dried and partly
pulverized.When examined as found in the gall-bladder or lodged in the
larger hepatic ducts or distributed in irregular fragments (gall-sand)
in the various hepatic passages, they present the shape, color, and
general characteristics of a partly-dried vegetable extract roughly
broken up, but still soft enough to take any shape from pressure.The
writer has seen them thus in situ accompanying regularly-formed
gall-stones in a case of gunshot wound of the liver.These masses of
inspissated bile differ from gall-stones in composition; they consist
of bile, but with a preponderance of the coloring matter.According to
Harley,[153] who has given a more correct account of these bodies than
any other systematic writer, their composition is as follows:

  Water    5.4
  Solids  94.6

The contents of the solids are--

  Bile-pigment                84.2
  Cholesterin                  0.6
  Salts (iron, potash, soda)  15.2

[Footnote 153: _The Diseases of the Liver, with and without Jaundice,
etc._, by George Harley, M.D., F.R.S., Philada., 1883, p.Some years ago, before I was aware of the nature of such concretions.I
detected a number in examining the stools of a patient who had in quick
succession many attacks of hepatic colic, but as the usual form of
concretion was looked for and not found, the relation of these bodies
to the symptoms in the case was not understood.I now recognize the
value of Harley's observations on these bodies.The biliary concretion which is properly a gall-stone has a definite
form and a more or less well-defined crystalline structure.The most usual form is octagonal or hexagonal or
polyangular, with smooth facets, corresponding to points of contact of
other calculi.Instead of smooth facets and sharp angles, the
concretion may be studded with irregularly-shaped masses.When there
are numerous {1059} calculi present, they have smooth surfaces and
rather sharp angles, made, not by attrition, as has been supposed, but
by deposition of the new material under pressure.When they have this
form there are many present, but the number of facets does not indicate
the number of calculi, and the absence of facets is not proof of the
absence of other calculi.The smooth opposing surfaces are not always
plane, but may be convex or concave to fit the shape of the adjacent
bodies.Calculi may be globular, ovoid, cylindrical, and truncated cones.The
largest in my collection is egg-shaped, and nearly filled the
gall-bladder which contained it, a little mucus free from bile-elements
only being present.If a concretion forms in a duct or a single one is
present in the gall-bladder, the shape is determined by the pressure of
the walls of the duct or of the gall-bladder, respectively.As found in
the stools, and still somewhat soft, the shape will represent the form
of the common duct through which it has been pressed.Such a soft,
recently-formed gall-stone will have the crystalline structure and
chemical constitution of these bodies, and will therefore differ from,
apparently, similar masses of inspissated bile.Although a round,
ovoid, or cylindrical calculus indicates the absence of others because
there are no evidences of mutual pressure and adaptation, a positive
conclusion cannot be reached in that way, for the gall-bladder may
contain numerous calculi of long-standing, and a recent concretion
formed in a duct be discharged with the usual symptoms.The number of calculi which may be present at any time or be produced
in the course of years ranges from one to several thousand.The number
is in inverse ratio to the size.One case[154] is reported in which
7802 calculi were found in the gall-bladder, but they must have been
very minute in size.Of the specimens now in my collection, there are
230 obtained from one gall-bladder, which they entirely filled; they
are nearly uniform in size, have an average weight of two grains, and
contain four, five, and six smooth facets.Another collection of
calculi removed from a closed gall-bladder contains 45, of large size,
distending the organ and forming a tumor which projected beyond the
margin of the liver.Hepatic calculi are rarely solitary; hence if one
attack of hepatic colic occur, others may be expected.[Footnote 154: Frerichs, _op.In color gall-stones vary from a clear white to a dark-brown, almost
black, tint.The most usual tint of the mature calculi in the
gall-bladder is that of the ripe chestnut.Long stay in the intestines
increases the depth of the color, until it becomes almost black; on the
other hand, detention in the gall-bladder has a slightly bleaching
action; but the real cause of difference of color is the presence or
absence of pigment.If composed of pure cholesterin, the color will be
whitish, opaque, or glistening and almost translucent.In size gall-stones vary from the smallest pea up to a hen's egg.When
several hundreds are contained in the gall-bladder, they will usually
be of the dimension of a medium-sized pea.Two large solitary
concretions in my possession are respectively 2 inches and 1-1/2 inches
in long diameter, and 1 inch and 3/4 of an inch transversely.Very much
larger calculi have, however, been recorded; thus, one mentioned by
Frerichs is 5 inches in length and 4 inches in circumference.The most
frequently {1060} encountered calculus, at least in this country, is
polyangular in shape and of the size of a large pea.Globular or ovoid
seems to be the prevailing form, and the dimensions that of a small
pea, in Germany, according to Frerichs and Von Schuppel, but this
statement must refer to the initial shape of these bodies.Not all hepatic calculi have defined mathematical forms, but may
consist of branching cylinders composed of irregular nodular masses,
not unlike the concretions of inspissated bile.As a rule, in each case
where the calculi are multiple there is uniformity of color, shape, and
composition.The
calculi obtained from each subject are in one case white, polyangular,
rather unctuous, and nearly equal in size; in another, chestnut-brown
in color, polyangular in shape, and varying slightly in size, but
uniformly characteristic in shape; and in a third, singular in number,
ovoid in shape, dark-brown in color.When fresh they contain
considerable water, and at all times are hygroscopic.Dried in the air,
they are composed of--

  Water    4
  Solids  96
         ---
         100

The solids consist of--

  Cholesterin                  98
  Pigment                       1
  Inorganic or mineral matter   1
                              ---
                              100

Such are the constituents, according to Harley, of the usual
concretion, the cholesterin calculus.But as other varieties are
encountered occasionally, it may be well to give the composition of
these.The following table by Ritter, to be found in _Robin's Journal_
for 1872 (p.60), is a correct representation of the contents of
different specimens:

---------------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+-----

The above may be regarded as the average composition, expressed in
round numbers.The variations from these figures will be comprehended
in two parts.A calculus consists of three several parts: the nucleus, the body, the
rind.A calculus of small or medium size may be a nucleus for the
formation of a large one.Usually the nucleus consists of a bit of
mucus, casts of the biliary ducts (Thudicum), inspissated bile, a
blood-clot, a liver-fluke or other parasite, as a desiccated
round-worm, or some foreign body, as a seed, or, as in one reported
example, a globule of mercury.[155] {1061} The central mass of mucus
may contain a large proportion of pigment or crystals of cholesterin or
lime-salts, giving it special characteristics.[156] There may be
several nuclei.Fauconneau-Dufresne reports an instance in which a
pyramidal concretion contained four, and Guilbert a globular stone with
five, distinct nuclei.Such examples of calculi having multiple nuclei
are produced by the adhesion whilst in a soft state of two or more, and
the subsequent addition of material to the conjoint mass, welding it
into a single stone.A few calculi are homogeneous throughout, composed
of nearly pure cholesterin, mixed intimately with a little coloring
matter and lime salts.The cholesterin calculus will have a somewhat
translucent appearance, will be a dead white or a yellowish-white, or
present a greenish- or brownish-yellow tint through the white.Even the
white calculus, apparently composed of nearly pure cholesterin, will be
found on section to contain traces of a nucleus.By long detention in a
gall-bladder whose duct is permanently occluded, and is therefore free
of fluid, the mucus nucleus may so shrivel as to leave a cavity which
is merely stained.One of my specimens--a solitary calculus of large
size--exhibits this peculiarity.[Footnote 155: Thudicum, J. L., _On Gall-stones_, London, 1863; also
Frerichs, _op.[Footnote 156: Cyr, Jules, _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_,
Paris, 1884, p.11 _et seq._]

The body consists of cholesterin, nacreous or darkened by pigment,
deposited in radiating lines or in concentric layers, or in both
together.Pigment may be intimately incorporated with the cholesterin
or deposited between the layers of this substance, pure or nearly pure,
forming an alternating arrangement.The crust or rind usually is smooth, unctuous to the touch, firm, but
when broken with the finger-nail readily crumbles.When composed of
lime salts, or when the cholesterin is mixed with varying proportions
of these salts and of pigment, the surface is still smooth, but
thicker, firmer, and darker in color.The rind may not be smooth, but
studded with wart-like projections, or it may consist of several layers
of earthy matter separated by pigment.These layers may be very
friable, and readily crumble and fall off.In some instances the crust,
several lines in thickness, is the body of the calculus, and the cavity
contains only a light honeycomb of mucus and pigment.The specific gravity of gall-stones composed of crystallized
cholesterin is nearly that of water.Air-dried calculi will float on
water, but the recent ones, full of moisture, sink.The relation of the
weight of the calculus to that of the bile is more important.As the
specific gravity of bile ranges from 1020 to 1026, it is obvious that
on this fluid air-dried calculi will float, but, holding in the recent
state much water, ordinary gall-stones will sink.Those containing much
mineral matter will have a correspondingly high specific gravity--much
higher than bile.ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF HEPATIC CALCULI.--Certain conditions are
necessary to the formation of these bodies on the part of the bile and
on the part of the gall-bladder and ducts.Constituted for the most
part of cholesterin, which exists in such small quantity in normal
bile, there must be some change in the composition of this fluid to
increase the quantity or to diminish the solubility of that
constituent.It will conduce to a better understanding of the subject
to premise the composition of the bile: {1062}

  Bile contains, in 1000 parts,
    Water            860
    Solids           140

  The solids of bile are,
    Glycocholate and Taurocholate of soda  90.8
    Fat                                     9.2
    Cholesterin                             2.6
    Mucus                                   1.4
    Pigment and extractive                 28.Salts                                   8.-----
                                          140.Normal bile is neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction.If the
reaction become acid from any cause, the constituent cholesterin is
precipitated; and this occurs the more readily the larger the
proportion of this substance held in solution.Cholesterin is an
excrementitious material found in the blood and excreted by the liver.It represents in part, probably, the waste of nervous matter, but more
certainly of the fatty tissues in general.Conditions of the system in
which the metamorphosis of the fatty elements occurs more freely--as
obesity, advancing life, etc.--are accompanied by an increased
production and excretion of cholesterin.So long as the neutral state or the alkalinity of the bile is
maintained, the cholesterin will be kept in solution, although its
relative proportion may be in excess of the normal.A lack of the soda
constituent of the system is one factor, but the most important is a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane of the bile-ducts and
gall-bladder.The mucus formed plays a double role: it furnishes a
nucleus about which cholesterin crystallizes; it acts as a ferment and
inaugurates a process of acid fermentation which results in the
precipitation of cholesterin.When all the conditions favorable to the
separation and crystallization of cholesterin are present, any foreign
body may serve the purpose of a nucleus.The articles which have thus
served have been enumerated.A by no means infrequent combination is that of bilirubin with calcium;
and this may constitute the nucleus or form a part of the body or the
crust of a calculus.The mechanism of its formation is not unlike that
of the cholesterin concretion.Bilirubin is soluble in alkalies, and is
precipitated from its solution by acids.It follows that when acid
fermentation takes places under the influence of mucus, bilirubin may
be precipitated in combination with calcium.The salts of sodium and
potassium are much more abundant in bile than those of lime, but the
latter much more often enter into the formation of calculi because of
their slighter solubility.Other combinations of bile-pigments, mucus,
and the salts of the bile take place, but they are relatively less
frequent.The principal lime salt is the carbonate, and this combines
in varying proportions with the bile acids, the fat acids, and
bile-pigment.Certain physical conditions are not less important than the chemical in
the production of hepatic calculi.Accumulation of bile in the
gall-bladder, stasis, and concentration are essential conditions.If
bile remains long in the gall-bladder, it becomes darker in color and
more viscid, its specific gravity rises, and the relative proportion of
solids increases, doubtless because of the absorption of a part of the
water.The reaction--which, as has been stated, is in the fresh state
neutral or {1063} alkaline--becomes acid in consequence of a
fermentative change (Von Gorup-Besanez) set up by the mucus.If a
catarrhal state of the mucous membrane exist, the mucus, epithelium,
and lymphoid cells cast off play the part of a ferment.The lime which
is so important a constituent of biliary concretions is not present
even in concentrated bile in sufficient amount to account for its
agency in the formation of these bodies, is furnished by the diseased
mucous membrane (Frerichs).Indeed, numerous crystals of carbonate of
lime have been seen in situ in contact with the mucous membrane in
cases of chronic catarrh.It follows, then, that catarrh of the biliary
passages has an important causative relation to that pathological
condition of the bile which precedes the formation of calculi.In this
connection we must not lose sight of the researches made by Ord[157] on
the action exerted by colloids on the formation of concretions.The
mucus is the colloid; cholesterin, lime, and soda salts are the
crystalloids.These latter diffusing through the colloid medium, the
resulting combinations assume spheroidal forms.The union of bilirubin
and lime salts illustrates the same principle.[Footnote 157: _On the Influence of Colloids upon Crystalline Forms and
Cohesion, with Observations on the Structure and Mode of Formation of
Urinary and other Calculi_, by W. Miller Ord, M.D., F.R.C.P.Lond.,
etc., London, 1879.]CAUSES.--We have here to consider the external conditions and the
general somatic influences which lead to the formation of biliary
concretions.Besides other
agencies due to advancing life, the increase of cholesterin is an
influential factor.The less active state of the functions in general,
diminished oxidation, loss of water, and concentration of the bile are
influential factors in determining the formation of hepatic calculi in
advancing life, as the opposite conditions oppose their production in
early life.Although not unknown in infancy, at this period in life and
until twenty years of age they occur but rarely.Fauconneau-Dufresne,[158] of 91 cases, had 4 in infants; Wolff[159] had
1 in a collection of 45 cases; and Cyr,[160] 2 cases under ten in a
group of 558 cases.The following table illustrates the influence of
age on the productivity of gall-stones:

p.[Footnote 160: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, Paris, 1884,
p.Although there is a general correspondence in the results of the
observations on the age most liable, there are differences.Thus, Cyr,
whose figures represent the experiences at Vichy, makes the age of
maximum liability from twenty to forty years--distinctly earlier than
any other observer; and hence it is necessary to bear in mind the
extreme latitude of his diagnosis.Of my own collection, 30 in number,
all doubtful cases {1064} excluded, there were 20 between thirty and
fifty years, and 10 between fifty and seventy.Of these, 22 occurred in
subjects between forty and sixty.The period of maximum liability is
about fifty years of age.Cyr refers the difference of his statistics
from those of other observers to the character of the patients.The
preponderance in the number of cases of hepatic calculi at or about the
fiftieth year is referable to the lessened activity of the nutritive
functions at this period, and to the increase in the relative
proportion of cholesterin in the blood in advanced life (Luton[161]).Charcot[162] maintains that after sixty biliary calculi are more
frequent, but owing to the physiological conditions then existing the
migration of these bodies is effected without notable inconvenience.[Footnote 161: Jaccoud's _Dictionnaire encycloped._, art."Voies
Biliaires;" _idem._, _Bull.de Therap._, March 15, 1866.][Footnote 162: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.According to most authorities, females are more liable to the formation
of gall-stones than are men.Thudicum, after an analysis of the
statistics given by the most experienced and celebrated authorities,
places the proportion at 3 to 2.Von Schuppel gives the same figures.Cyr, whilst recognizing this estimate as true of the great mass of
observations on this point, finds that in his own cases the
preponderance of females over males was even greater, being 4 to
1--inversely to the liability of the sexes to gout; but this excess is
to be explained by the character of the subjects falling under his
observation.Women are subjected to influences which favor the
formation of these concretions, such as pregnancy, sedentary habits,
diet of a restricted character, the use of corsets, and the somatic
changes at the climacteric period.The social state, by reason of the conditions associated with a good
position in life, has an influence in the production of calculi.Luxurious habits and indulgence in the pleasures of the table are
important factors, and hence this malady is encountered amongst the
better class of patients in private practice rather than amongst
laboring people in the hospitals.As the somatic conditions which exert a predisposing action, and the
social circumstances also favoring the formation of hepatic calculi,
are transmitted, heredity is by some classed among the etiological
factors, but it can only be regarded as indirect.Malarial influences unquestionably exert a very powerful influence as
this malady occurs in this country.Paroxysms of intermittent either
induce or accompany the seizures of hepatic colic, and chronic malarial
poisoning exerts a direct causative influence through the hepatic
disturbances and the gastro-duodenal catarrh which are associated with
it.Attacks of hepatic colic are extremely frequent in the malarial
regions of the West and South.It may be, however, that this malady is
frequent rather in consequence of the diet of pork than of climatic
causes, for it is probable that indulgence in such food plays an
important part in the formation of biliary concretions (Harley).Due
allowance made for diet, climate is yet, no doubt, an influential
factor.In warm, especially in malarial, regions the functions of the
liver are taxed to compensate for the increased action of the skin and
lungs; but this organ is, besides, affected by the poison of malaria,
and to the congestion caused by it is superadded a catarrhal state of
the bile-ducts and of the duodenum.A {1065} pathological condition of
the bile itself is first induced; then the fermentative changes set up
by the mucus cause the separation and crystallization of pigment and
cholesterin.Certain seasons favor the formation of biliary concretions, because
then the special influences which operate at all times are more active
and persistent.These seasons are fall, winter, and early spring, and
gall-stones are more numerous then in consequence of the activity of
the malarial poison, the character of the diet then employed, and the
lessened oxidation due to the more sedentary life.Climate is a factor
of some consequence, but not in the direction that might have been
supposed.Gall-stones are more common in temperate than in tropical
climates--a statement confirmed by the observation of the physicians of
India.They are, according to Harley, quite common in Russia, where
also they attain to extraordinary dimensions; but these circumstances
are not due to the climatic peculiarities of that country, so much as
to the diet habitually consumed, consisting so largely of fatty
substances.Of all the conditions which favor the production of gall-stones, none
are so influential as the bodily state and the associated dietetic
peculiarities.Those troubled with these concretions, as they have
occurred under my observation, have been either obese or have had a
manifest tendency in that direction.They have had a strong inclination
for the fat-forming foods, also for starchy, saccharine, and fatty
articles, such as bread and butter, potatoes, beans and peas, pork,
bacon, and fat poultry, etc.Harley thinks indulgence in bacon (p.Thudicum rejects this notion on chemical grounds,
for obesity and the free consumption of fat cannot be concerned in the
production of these bodies, because cholesterin is an alcohol.[163] The
agency of a fatty diet has been so strongly indicated in clinical
observations, and the relation of cholesterin to the fats so obvious,
that it can hardly be doubted the free consumption of fat in food
contributes directly to the formation of calculi.A catarrhal state of the duodenal mucous membrane
existing, and the bile excluded by swelling and obstruction of the
bile-ducts, fats are decomposed, and the fat acids, absorbed into the
portal blood, contribute to those chemical changes in the bile which
result in the precipitation of cholesterin.Beneke[164] traces a
connection between atheromatous degeneration of the vessels and the
formation of biliary concretions.A general increase in the amount of
fat in the body is usually coincident with the atheromatous change, and
at the same time the relative proportion of cholesterin in the bile
becomes greater.[Footnote 163: _A Treatise on Gall-stones_, p.Indulgence in the starchy and saccharine foods plays a part in the
formation of gall-stones not less, if not more, important than the
consumption of fats.A diet of such materials is highly fattening, and
if the necessary local conditions exist they readily undergo
fermentation, and thus cause or keep up a catarrh of the mucous
membrane.Too long intervals between meals, Frerichs[165] thinks, is more
influential than errors of diet in causing concretions.The bile
accumulates in the gall-bladder, and the condition of repose favors the
occurrence of those changes which induce the separation and
crystallization of cholesterin.{1066} Obstacles to outflow of every
kind have the same effect.The largest calculus in my possession was
obtained from a case of cancer of the gall-bladder which compressed,
and finally closed, the cystic duct.Sedentary habits have the same
mechanical effect, but, as already pointed out, insufficient air and
exercise act by lessening oxidation.Corpulent persons indulging in
rich food and avoiding all physical exertion, those of such habits
confined to bed by illness or injury, the literary, the well-to-do,
self-indulgent, lazy, are usual subjects of this malady.Any condition
of things which causes a considerable retardation in the outflow of
bile will have a pathogenetic importance, especially if the causes of
chemical change, the lessened quantity of taurocholic and glycocholic
acid, and an increased quantity of cholesterin, coexist.Moral causes,
as fear, anxiety, chagrin, anger, etc., have seemed to exercise a
causative influence in some instances (Cyr).[Footnote 165: _A Clinical Treatise on Disease of the Liver_, Syd.To the causes of retardation of the bile-flow mentioned above must be
added catarrh of the bile-ducts.This acts in a twofold way--as an
obstruction; a plug of mucus forming the nucleus.It has already been
shown that fermentative changes may be set up by the mucus, which plays
the part of a ferment, an acid state of the bile resulting.Situation of Gall-stones, and their Destiny.--The gall-bladder is, of
course, the chief site for these bodies, but biliary concretions and
masses of inspissated bile may be found at any point in the course of
the ducts.Single stones may be impacted at any point in the cystic,
hepatic, or common duct, or masses composed of numerous small calculi
may take the form of a duct and branches, making a branching calculus
of the shape and size of the mould in which it is cast.Such casts may
be hollow, thus permitting an outlet to the bile, or they may
completely close the tube, and a cyst form, the walls of which grow
thicker with connective-tissue deposits.Stones of very large size may
be thus enclosed, Frerichs having seen one the size of a hen's egg
formed about a plum-seed, which was the nucleus.In some rare instances
the major part of the larger tubes have been filled with inspissated
bile, through which the fluid bile could only be slowly filtered.Calculi are not often found in the hepatic duct, since they can only
lodge there in descending from the smaller tubes, and hence are too
small to become wedged in.The usual site, as has been sufficiently
explained, is the gall-bladder.At the entrance to the cystic duct and
at the terminus of the common duct in the duodenum are the points where
migrating calculi are most apt to be arrested.Spontaneous disintegration of gall-stones sometimes occurs.Cholesterin
being dissolved off of the corners and edges, the cohesion of the mass
is impaired and it falls apart in several fragments.By very slight
mechanical injury air-dried calculi will be broken up.In the
gall-bladder two factors are in operation to effect the disintegration
of the contained calculi: the movements of the body, by which the
corners and the borders are crumbled; the solvent action of the
alkaline bile on the cholesterin.When, however, these concretions are
made up of lime and pigment, their integrity can be impaired only by
the process of cleavage; no solvent action can take place.Various changes occur in the ducts or in the gall-bladder in
consequence of the presence of these concretions.Whilst a catarrhal
state of the mucous {1067} membrane of the ducts is an element of much
importance in the process by which concretions are formed, on the other
hand the presence of these bodies excites catarrh, ulceration,
perforation, and, it may be, abscess of the liver.When concretions
form or are deposited in the ducts, they cause inflammatory reaction,
the walls yield, and the neighboring hepatic structures may also be
affected by contiguity.The dilatation of the tube is usually
cylindrical, much more rarely sacciform.The neighboring connective
tissue may undergo hyperplasia and a more or less extensive sclerosis
occur.More frequently the calculus ulcerates through, and an abscess
is produced which will take the usual course of that malady.Very
rarely a calculus is found enclosed in a separate sac and surrounded by
healthy hepatic tissue (Roller).[166]

[Footnote 166: _Berliner klin.42, 1879; _ibid._, Nos.16, 17, and 19 for 1877, Fargstein.]As the gall-bladder is the usual place for the formation and storage of
gall-stones, the changes in connection with this organ are the most
important.The calculi may be so numerous or so large as to distend the
gall-bladder and cause it to project from under the inferior border of
the liver, so as to be felt by palpation of the abdominal wall.The
stones may be few in number and float in healthy bile, or they may fill
the bladder to the exclusion of fluid, the cystic duct being closed
permanently; or there may be, with one or more concretions, a fluid
composed of mucus, muco-pus, serum, and bilious matter.The mucous
membrane may be in a normal state, but this is rare; usually it is
affected by the catarrhal process, and atrophic degeneration has taken
place to a less or greater extent; the rugae are obliterated, the
muscular layer hypertrophied.When attacks of hepatic colic have
occurred, more or less inflammation of the peritoneal layer of the
gall-bladder and cystic duct is lighted up, and organized exudations
form, changing the shape and position of the organs concerned.It is
usual in old cases of hepatic colic to find the gall-bladder bound down
by strong adhesions, the cavity much contracted or even obliterated,
the cystic duct closed, and the neighboring portion of the liver the
seat of sclerosis.Such inflammatory exudations about the gall-bladder
may become the seat of malignant disease--of scirrhus.Several examples
of this have been reported, and one has occurred in my own practice.The contact of a gall-stone, especially of a polyangular stone, may
cause ulceration of the mucous membrane.This is the more apt to occur
if the muscular layer of the gall-bladder is hypertrophied, especially
if certain fasciculi are thickened and overacting, leaving intervening
parts weak and yielding to the pressure of the stone forced in by the
spasmodically contracting muscles.Finally yielding, the stone and
other contents of the gall-bladder escape into the cavity of the
abdomen.Adhesions to neighboring parts may prevent rupture.Such
adhesions are contracted with the colon, the duodenum, the stomach, and
other organs.In some rare instances the closed gall-bladder has
undergone a gradual process of calcification, the mucous membrane
losing its proper structure, the muscular layer degenerating, and a
slow deposit of lime salts taking place, the ultimate result being that
the biliary concretions are enclosed in a permanent shell.As above indicated, biliary concretions may remain where deposited for
an indefinite period.Very often they migrate from the point of
formation, the gall-bladder, into the duodenum, producing
characteristic {1068} symptoms called hepatic colic.As the size of the
ducts increases from above downward, obviously but little vis a tergo
is needed to propel the concretions onward.The chief agency in the
migration of these bodies is the discharge of bile.Common observation
shows that the symptoms of hepatic colic usually declare themselves in
two or three hours after a meal--at that time when the presence of the
chyme in the duodenum solicits the flow of bile.The gall-bladder
contracts on its contents with an energy in direct ratio to the amount
of bile present, and with the gush of fluid the concretion is whirled
into the duct.Once there, the cystic duct being unprovided with
muscular fibres, the onward progress of the stone must depend on the
flow of bile; and, as the canal is devious, this may not always carry
the concretion into the common duct.Just behind the neck of the
gall-bladder the duct makes an angle somewhat abrupt, and here also its
folds project into the canal, so that at this point the stone is apt to
lodge; but much depends on the size and shape of the calculus.If it
pass through the cystic duct, the inflammation resulting may close the
canal, several instances of which have fallen under my observation.The
next point where stoppage of the migrating calculus may, and frequently
does, occur is the orifice of the common duct in the duodenum.This
orifice has a funnel shape, the smaller extremity toward the intestine,
the object of this being to prevent the entrance into the duct of
foreign bodies from the intestine.A diverticulum is thereby made
(Vater's) in which a concretion may lodge, partly or wholly preventing
the escape of bile into the bowel.The various forces concerned in the
propulsion of the concretion onward from the common duct into the
intestine are the discharges of bile, the contraction of the few
muscular fibres in the walls of the duct, the respiratory movements,
especially forced expiration, coughing, sneezing, vomiting,
defecation--in fact, all of those acts in which the abdominal muscles,
the diaphragm, and the sphincters are simultaneously brought into
strong contraction.The symptoms produced by the migration and stoppage
of a concretion will vary according to the size and shape of the stone,
and the consequent diminution in the amount of bile discharged or its
complete arrest.In other words, the stone may be firmly wedged in,
completely closing the canal against the passage of bile, or it may lie
loosely in the diverticulum Vateri, acting as a sort of ball valve, now
permitting a gush of bile, and now stopping the passage-way more or
less tightly.The migration of calculi may take place by ulcerating through into
neighboring hollow organs.Usually the first step consists in stoppage
of the bile.To the accumulating bile mucus is added, and the
gall-bladder or the duct--usually the common or cystic duct--dilates,
often to a considerable extent, and, adhesions forming, discharge
ultimately takes place through some neighboring hollow organ.The
routes pursued by such fistulous communications are various.The organs
most frequently penetrated are the stomach, duodenum, and colon, less
often the urinary passages, and very rarely the portal vein.Numerous
examples of external discharge of calculi have been reported.The most
usual, as it is the most direct, is the fistulous connection of the
gall-bladder or common duct with the duodenum.Solitary stones of
immense size have been thus discharged.Murchison[167] gives references
to many interesting {1069} examples, and the various volumes of
_Transactions of the Pathological Society_ are rich in illustrative
cases.The symptoms produced by the migration of calculi by the natural
route and by ulceration into other organs will be hereafter considered.[Footnote 167: _Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of the Liver_, 2d
ed., p.487 _et seq._]

SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF GALL-STONES AT THEIR ORIGINAL
SITE.--Very large calculi or numerous small ones may be present in the
biliary passages without causing any recognizable symptoms.The
migration of these bodies by the natural channel and by ulceration into
the duodenum may also be accomplished without any local or systemic
disturbance.[168] That the retention of calculi may not induce any
characteristic reaction by which they may be recognized is probably due
to the fact that the gall-bladder, in which they chiefly form,
possesses but slight sensibility, and as it is in a constantly changing
state of distension or emptiness according to the amount of bile
present, it is obvious that a foreign body made up of the biliary
constituents, and having nearly the same specific gravity as the bile,
is not likely to cause any uneasiness or recognizable functional
disturbances.Furthermore, the slowness with which biliary concretions
form enables the organ to accommodate itself to the new conditions.The
lack of sensibility which is a feature of the gall-bladder, and which I
have had the opportunity to ascertain by actual puncture in an
individual not anaesthetized, is in some instances supported by a
general state of lowered acuteness of perception.There are great
differences in respect to readiness of appreciation and promptness of
response to all kinds of excitation in different individuals.To what
cause soever we may ascribe the lack of sensibility, the fact remains
that in not a few cases of gall-stones in the gall-bladder there are no
symptoms to indicate their presence.On the other hand, there are some
disturbances that have a certain significance.[Footnote 168: Amongst the numerous examples of this kind to be found
recorded may be mentioned the case reported by M. L. Garnier, Agrege a
la Faculte de Medecine de Nancy (_Archives de Physiologie normale et
pathologique_, No.176): An hepatic calculus, weighing 24.5
grammes, was discharged without any symptoms or even consciousness on
the part of the patient, a man of sixty years.He had had colic and
jaundice, but these subsided entirely, and there was no further
disturbance.As has happened in so many instances, this stone must have
ulcerated through into the bowel without causing any recognizable
symptoms.]The subjective signs are uneasiness--a deep-seated sensation of
soreness--felt in the right hypochondrium, increased by taking a full
inspiration and by decubitus on the left side.Pain or soreness,
sometimes an acute pain, is experienced under the scapula near the
angle, at or about the acromion process, and sometimes at the nape of
the neck.In one case under my observation within the past year a
patient who had had several attacks of hepatic colic, the usual
polyangular stones having been recovered, had from time to time severe
pain over the right side of the neck, shoulder, and scapula,
accompanied by a severe herpes zoster in the district affected by the
pain.This is of course an extreme example, but it is very suggestive
of the relation which may exist between hepatic disturbances and
shingles.Attacks of gastric pain coming on some time after food, and
not soon after, as is the case in true gastralgia, are usual in the
early stage of the disease--are constant, according to Cyr,[169] who
quotes approvingly an observation of Leared on this point.Migraine
{1070} or sick headache and vertigo occur in many cases, but it may
well be doubted whether these symptoms are not due to the accompanying
gastro-duodenal catarrh, which is a nearly constant symptom.Acidity,
flatulence, epigastric oppression, a bitter taste, a muddy rather
bilious complexion, and constipation are symptoms belonging to catarrh
of the gastro-duodenal mucous membrane.Some additional information may be supplied by
palpation.When the gall-bladder is distended with gall-stones, or is
in the enlarged state which occurs when the common duct is obstructed,
it may project beneath the inferior border of the liver far enough to
be felt.In thin persons a grating sound, produced by the friction of
the calculi, may be heard, the stethoscope being applied as palpation
is made over the hypochondrium.It is rare that these symptoms can be
elicited, since the calculous affection of the liver occurs for the
most part in persons of full habit, in whom the abdominal walls are too
thick to allow of the necessary manipulation.There may be also some
tenderness on pressure along the inferior margin of the ribs,
especially in the region of the gall-bladder.[Footnote 169: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.SYMPTOMS DUE TO THE MIGRATION OF GALL-STONES BY THE NATURAL
CHANNELS.--A calculus passing into the cystic duct from the
gall-bladder causes the disturbance known as hepatic colic or bilious
colic, because of the jaundice which accompanies the major part of
these seizures.But jaundice is not a necessary element in these cases;
it is not until the concretion reaches the common duct that the passage
of bile into the intestine is interfered with.The gall-bladder has a
function rather conservative than essential, for its duct may be
permanently closed without apparently affecting the health.The time when an attack of hepatic colic is most likely to occur would
seem to be determined by the flow of bile; for this, as has been
stated, is the chief factor in moving calculi along the ducts.As, no
doubt, the presence of the chyme in the duodenum is the stimulus for
the production of bile and also for the contractions of the
gall-bladder, it follows that a few hours after meals is the time when
the attacks of hepatic colic would a priori be expected.This is in
accord with experience, but there are exceptions.In one of the most
formidable cases with which the writer has had to deal--the diagnosis
confirmed by the recovery of the calculi--the most severe attacks
occurred in the early morning.According to Harley,[170] colic from the
passage of inspissated bile occurs when the stomach and duodenum are
most nearly empty--from ten at night until ten in the morning--and this
he relies on as a means of diagnosis, but the exceptions are too
numerous to assign much importance to this circumstance.[Footnote 170: _On Diseases of the Liver_, p.The onset of pain is usually sudden, but it may develop slowly from a
vague uneasiness in the region of the gall-bladder; or after some pain
and soreness at this point, accompanied by nausea, even vomiting, the
paroxysm will begin with very acute pain.The situation of the pain is
by no means constant, and usually varies in position in the same case.The point of maximum intensity is near the ensiform cartilage, outward
and downward two or three inches, about the point of junction of the
cystic and common duct.From or about this region the pain radiates
through the epigastrium, the right hypochondrium, upward into the
chest, {1071} backward under the scapula, and downward and inward
toward the umbilicus.In some instances under my observation the most
acute suffering was located in the right iliac region, in others in the
lumbar region, and in still others in the epigastrium.The position of
the pain may be such as to draw attention from the liver, and thus
greatly confuse the diagnosis.In a well-defined attack the pain is
intense, shooting, and boring, irregularly paroxysmal; the patient
writhes in agony, screams and groans, rolls from side to side, or walks
partly bent, holding the part with a gentle pressure or rubbing with an
agonized tension of feeling.Meanwhile the countenance is expressive of
the intensest suffering, is pallid and drawn, and the body is covered
with a cold sweat.Nausea presently supervenes, and with the efforts to
vomit a keen thrust of pain and a sense of cramp dart through the
epigastrium and side.Very considerable depression of the vital powers
occurs; the pulse becomes small, feeble, and slow, or very rapid and
feeble.The patient may pass into a condition of collapse, and, indeed,
the pain of hepatic colic may cause death by sudden arrest of the
heart's action.The cases which prove fatal in this way are doubtless
examples of fatty heart, the degeneration of the cardiac muscle being a
result of the action of the same factors as those which cause
gall-stones to form, if the relation of general steatosis to these
bodies which I have set forth prove to be true.The pain is not
continuously so violent as above expressed: it remits from time to
time, and seems about to cease altogether when a sudden access of
anguish is experienced and the former suffering is renewed, and, it may
be, more savagely than before.The pain of an attack of hepatic colic
has no fixed duration.It will depend on the size of the calculus, on
the point where impacted, and on the impressionability of the subject.The severity of the seizures varies within very wide limits.The attack
may consist in a transient colic-like pain, in a mere sense of
soreness, in epigastric uneasiness with nausea, or it may be an agony
sufficient to cause profound depression of the powers of life--to
destroy life, indeed.The usual attack of hepatic colic is one in which
severe suffering is experienced until relief is obtained by the
exhibition of anodynes.Under these circumstances the subsidence of the
pain may be rather gradual or it may be sudden: in the former case, as
the effects of the anodyne are produced, we may suppose that the spasm
subsides and the stone moves onward, at last dropping into the
intestine: an enchanting sense of relief is at once experienced.Very
serious nervous disturbances may accompany the pain.Paroxysms of
hysteria may be excited in the hysterical; convulsions occur in those
having the predisposition to them from any cause, and in the epileptic.The onset of a severe seizure is announced by chilliness, sometimes by
a severe chill.Now and then the paroxysms commence with the chill, and
the pain follows.It occasionally happens that the attacks in respect
to the order in which the symptoms occur, and in their regularity as to
time, behave like an ordinary ague.In fact, there appear to be two
modes or manifestations of the attacks of hepatic colic in malarious
localities: those in which the phenomena are merely an outcome of the
passage of the calculi; those in which an attack of intermittent fever
is excited by the pain and disturbance of hepatic colic.To the first
Charcot[171] {1072} has applied the phrase fievre intermittente
hepatique.It is supposed to correspond pathogenetically to urethral
fever produced by the passage of a catheter.On the other hand, the
second form of intermittent can occur only under the conditions
producing ague.A calculus passing in a subject affected with chronic
malarial poisoning, the latent malarial influence is aroused into full
activity, and the resulting seizure is compounded of the two factors.The truly malarial form of calculus fever differs from the traumatic in
its regular periodicity and the methodical sequence of the attacks,
which occur in the order of an intermittent quotidian or tertian.During the attacks of hepatic colic, when protracted and severe, a
sense of chilliness or distinct chills occur, sometimes with the
regularity of an intermittent; but these differ from the seizures which
the chill inaugurates at distinct times, the intervening period being
free from disturbance.[Footnote 171: _Lecons sur la Maladies du Foie_, p.The fever which accompanies some severe paroxysms of hepatic colic has
a distinctly intermittent character, hence the name applied to it by
Charcot.There are two forms of this calculus fever as it occurs in
malarious localities: one intermittent, coming on during a protracted
case, and immediately connected with and dependent on the passage of
the stone; the other a regular intermittent quotidian or tertian, which
determines and accompanies the paroxysm of colic.A case occurring
under my observation very recently, in which these phenomena were
exhibited and the calculi recovered, proves the existence of such a
form of the malady.In this case with the onset of the pain a severe
chill occurred; then the fever rose, followed by the sweat, during
which the pain ceased, but much soreness and tenderness about the
region of the gall-bladder, and jaundice, followed in the usual way.At
the so-called septenary periods also attacks come on in accordance with
the usual laws of recurrence of malarial fevers.In many instances, probably a
majority, the pulse is not accelerated, rather slowed, and the
temperature does not rise above normal.The inflammation which follows
an attack of hepatic colic will be accompanied by some elevation of the
body-heat, and fever will occur when ulceration of the duct and
perforation cause a local peritonitis; but these conditions are quite
apart from those which obtain in the migration of calculi by the
natural channel.Nausea and vomiting are invariable symptoms of hepatic colic.First the
contents of the stomach are brought up, then some glairy mucus only,
with repeated and exhausting straining efforts; and with the sudden
cessation of the pain there may appear in the vomit a quantity of
bilious matter, the contents of the gall-bladder liberated by the
passage of the stone into the intestine.If bile is present in the
vomit from the beginning, it may be concluded that the obstruction is
not complete.The abdomen may be distended with gas--is
usually, indeed, when constipation exists.Free purgation gives great
relief.The stools are composed of scybalae chiefly at first, afterward
of a brownish offensive liquid, and when jaundice supervenes they
become whitish in color, pasty, and semi-solid.Now and then it happens
that a copious movement of the bowels takes place as the attack is
impending, but during the paroxysm no action occurs.Jaundice is an important, but not an invariable, symptom.It comes on
within the first twenty-four hours succeeding the paroxysm, and appears
{1073} first in the conjunctiva, thence spreading over the body
generally.The intensity of the jaundice depends on the amount of the
obstruction: if complete, the body is intensely yellow; and if partial,
the tint may be very light.The very slight degree of obstruction which
suffices to determine the flow of bile backward has been already
stated.There may be no jaundice, although all the other symptoms of
the passage of gall-stones may be present.Such is the state of the
case when a calculus enters and is arrested in the cystic duct.Under
these circumstances the natural history differs from that which obtains
when the obstruction is in the common duct and ends abruptly by the
discharge of the calculus into the intestine.After the persistence of
the symptoms of hepatic colic for a variable period without jaundice,
this sign of obstruction may appear, indicating the removal of the
stone from the cystic into the common duct.The symptoms accompanying
the jaundice--the hebetude of mind, the slow pulse, the itching of the
skin, the dark- urine--have been sufficiently detailed in the
section on that topic in another part of this article.The duration of the jaundice is different in different cases, and is
influenced by the degree and persistence of the obstruction.When the
obstruction is partial and the stone is soon removed, the jaundice will
be slight and will disappear in a day or two; on the other hand, when
the stone completely blocks the passage and is slowly dislodged, the
jaundice will be intense and will persist for ten days to two weeks.After the paroxysm has passed, if severe, the liver will be swollen,
more or less tenderness will be developed by pressure, and in some
instances, a local peritonitis coming on, there will occur the usual
symptoms of that condition.Although all the symptoms produced by the passage of biliary calculi
may be present, some uncertainty will always be felt unless the body
causing the disturbance is recovered from the feces.A
properly-conducted search is therefore necessary.As this is so often
done inefficiently and the calculus not found, an error of diagnosis
may seem to have occurred.Every stool should be examined in the mode
hereinafter described for a number of days after the attack until the
calculus is found.It should be remembered that only air-dried calculi
float on water.The stool, as soon as passed, should be slowly stirred
up in water sufficient to make a thin mixture, and all solid particles
removed for further examination, the thinner portion poured off, and
more water added from time to time until only solids remain at last.It
should not be forgotten that masses of inspissated bile, biliary sand,
may produce symptoms not unlike those due to gall-stones proper, and
hence all particles having the appearance of this material should be
examined chemically.Place some of the supposed bile on a white plate
and pour over it some drops of strong sulphuric acid, when the
biliverdin will take on a brilliant scarlet color.The discharge of particles of inspissated bile causes symptoms not
unlike those due to the migration of biliary calculi, but there are
points of difference.A strongly-marked case diagnosticated biliary
calculi, and in which masses of inspissated bile were discharged in
great quantity, will furnish the symptomatology to be now described.The onset of the paroxysms of pain is less abrupt than is the case with
gall-stones, and the attacks may occur at any time; the pain also
subsides more gradually, and hardly {1074} ceases at any time, but
revives every now and then, so that several days, even weeks, may be
occupied with one seizure.Jaundice is less apt to follow, and indeed
well-defined jaundice rarely occurs in this affection.There is much
swelling of the liver, also considerable tenderness, and relief is most
certainly afforded by free purgation, anodynes seeming rather to keep
up the disturbance, probably by checking the hepatic secretions.Attacks of hepatic colic may be expected to recur when a calculus with
multiple facets migrates, but the time when its associates may be
expected to move cannot be predicated on any data now available.Single
attacks may happen at intervals of weeks, months, or years.The
migration of one large stone may so dilate the ducts as to facilitate
the passage of those that remain behind, thus ensuring a recurrence of
the seizures at an early period.IMPACTION OF CALCULI AND MIGRATION BY ARTIFICIAL ROUTES.--The point at
which impaction takes place is an element of great importance.The size
of the calculus is far from being decisive as to the certainty of
impaction or as to the untoward results.A not unfrequent accident is
the blocking of the cystic duct at its opening, thus preventing the
influx or outgo of bile from the gall-bladder.If the stone does not
ulcerate through, in this position it does no damage, for the
gall-bladder, as has been stated, may be closed without any apparent
detriment.Just at the bend of the cystic duct, near its origin, is the
point where arrest of a calculus is most likely to take place.The next
most likely point is the duodenal end of the common duct.When
impaction occurs a local inflammation comes on, an exudation is poured
out, ulceration begins, and presently the peritoneum is reached.Adhesions usually form with the neighboring organs, but now and then
perforation takes place, and bile, pus, and the calculus are
precipitated into the peritoneal cavity.A fatal peritonitis follows,
as a rule; but rarely the inflammation is localized, and an abscess
forms which pursues the usual course of such accumulations; or
adhesions may take place about the site of the perforation and prevent
a general inflammation of the peritoneum.In this way a very large sac
may be produced, with the ultimate result of rupture into the general
cavity, although a fistulous communication may be established with some
neighboring organ, permitting safe discharge in this direction.A gall-stone impacted in one of the hepatic ducts or in the main duct,
ulcerating through, may form an abscess not distinguishable from other
solitary hepatic abscesses except by the presence of the concretion
causing the mischief and the absence of the usual conditions giving
rise to these accumulations of pus.It is probable that fatal abscesses
of the liver not infrequently are caused in this way in extra-tropical
countries.Adhesions forming to neighboring hollow organs or to the
external integument, such abscesses discharge, carrying out the
calculus with them.In this way may be explained the discharge by the
intestine of calculi much too large to have passed by the natural route
and unattended by the usual symptoms of hepatic colic.These
gastro-intestinal biliary fistulae extend from the gall-bladder and the
larger ducts to the stomach, to the duodenum, and to the transverse
colon; but of these the communication with the stomach is the least
common.The adhesion of the gall-bladder or common duct to the duodenum
or colon may be direct, exudations uniting {1075} the two parts without
the intervention of an abscess cavity, or such a sac or cavity may be
interposed.In some cases the discharge of biliary calculi is effected
through these routes with so little disturbance as to escape notice, or
the symptoms may be only vague indications of a local inflammation in
the neighborhood of the liver.Biliary fistulae communicating externally, caused by the migration of
calculi, are comparatively common.They have the clinical history, and
are usually treated as cases, of hepatic abscess.Sometimes hundreds of
calculi are thus discharged.In such instances it may be assumed that
communication has been established with the gall-bladder.Hepatic
abscess thus due to the migration of calculi may discharge into the
pelvis of the kidney, into the ascending vena cava, or through the
lung, but these places of outlet are comparatively uncommon.COURSES AND COMPLICATIONS.--Although symptoms cease for the time being
when the calculus passes into the duodenum, and although in most
instances no after unpleasant effects are experienced, there are cases
in which the presence of the concretion in the intestine proves to be
fruitful of mischief.Calculi of very large size--from a pigeon's to a
hen's egg--are also found in the intestine, without the occurrence of
symptoms indicative of their migration.It has been shown that this
silent migration of calculi from the liver-passages to the intestinal
is not uncommon.Hepatic concretions are distinguishable from the
intestinal by their crystalline form and by their composition.The
former are usually polyangular, and are composed of cholesterin
crystallized about a nucleus of bile-pigment, inspissated bile, or
mucus.After entrance into the intestine, lime salts and mucus are
deposited in successive layers, so that the form of the calculus is
modified and its size increased.The solitary ovoid concretion is most
frequently found in the intestine, without previous symptoms of hepatic
source, and, although increased in size in the intestine, it retains
its original shape.A specimen of this kind now in my possession
illustrates these points.It is composed of cholesterin crystallized in
radiating lines and concentric rings about a central nucleus of
inspissated bile.Around the hepatic concretion there have formed
layers of lime and mucus since it has reached the intestine, and after
drying this rind became brittle and was readily detached.The
polyangular calculus is apt to form the nucleus of a scybala-like mass
of feces; hence in the search for these bodies every such mass should
be broken up.An example of this has recently come under my own
observation.Concretions of all sizes, having reached the intestines,
as a rule pass down without creating any commotion, and are silently
discharged.Obstruction of the bowels is one of the results.A great may cases have
been collected by Murchison,[172] as many more by Leichtenstern,[173]
of impaction of the intestine produced by an accumulation of feces
about a biliary concretion.A calculus may be retained in a fold or
diverticulum of the small intestine, and may indeed cause a loop to be
formed which in turn readily twists, becoming an immovable obstruction.This mode of obstructing the bowels is less common than the simple
impaction.It is affirmed by some authorities, especially by Von
Schuppel, that obstruction of the bowels--impaction--is more often
caused by stones that have ulcerated through into the {1076} intestines
than by those that have descended by the common duct; and this
conclusion must be reached if jaundice has not been present.It is not
only the size of the calculus which determines impaction, as has been
stated: several may be agglutinated in one mass, and reflex spasm of
the muscular layer may be induced by their presence in the bowel.Nevertheless, some enormous concretions have been found in the canal,
and others have been discharged without special trouble.Hilton Fagge
exhibited to the Pathological Society[174] of London two gall-stones
passed with the stools, measuring 2-1/2 by 1-1/5 inches in long and
short diameter, and Fauconneau-Dufresne[175] refers to concretions of
the size of a hen's egg.Mention has been made of one in the writer's
possession of the size of a pullet's egg, which, until its discharge,
caused a train of characteristic symptoms.These immense bodies may
have ulcerated through from the gall-bladder or may have grown by
successive deposits of carbonate and phosphate of lime after reaching
the intestine.[Footnote 172: _Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, p.[Footnote 173: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, vol.[Footnote 174: _Transactions of the London Pathological Society_, vol.cit._]

The symptoms caused by the presence of concretions in the intestines
are, when pronounced, sufficiently characteristic.At a variable period
after an attack or attacks of hepatic colic the disturbance begins.The
condition of impaction above referred to does not differ from ordinary
fecal accumulation.It is true that occasionally the intestinal
irritation due to the presence of these bodies in some instances
preceded the symptoms of impaction, but usually there is no evidence to
indicate that the stoppage of the bowel is due to anything else than
feces.The irritability manifested by the intestinal mucous membrane
when gall-stones are present varies remarkably.There may be only some
ill-defined pain which, as a rule, indicates the position of the
calculus, or it may be pain with a feeling of soreness, or it may take
the form of violent colic, with nausea, vomiting, and depression.In my
own cases pain was experienced at or near the ileo-caecal valve, where
one was lodged, and along the descending colon, where the others were;
the pain and soreness ceased when these bodies were discharged.In a few instances gall-stones are brought up by vomiting.The most
remarkable example of this is a case to be found in the _Transactions
of the Pathological Society_ (vol.129): A woman ninety-four
years of age vomited a stone the size of a nutmeg.In the reported
examples violent pain, nausea, and much vomiting preceded the discharge
of the calculus.Like other foreign bodies, a gall-stone may ulcerate through the
intestine, producing fatal peritonitis.Many conditions due to the presence of biliary concretions, and which
arise during their migrations, may be viewed as complications.Many of
those produced directly have been described as a part of the proper
course of the malady; others are local and reflex, and these may with
propriety be considered as complications.First in importance are those
due to obstruction and the local inflammation.The passage of a calculus along the duct excites an inflammation of the
mucous membrane, which by contiguity of tissue invades the peritoneal
layer if the stone is retained for a sufficient time, and especially if
it is immovably lodged.The stoppage in the flow of bile leads to
dilatation of the ducts, and a change takes place in the character of
that fluid, {1077} owing to the admixture of mucus with the bile and to
the pouring out of a pathological secretion: it loses the bilious
appearance and becomes a merely sero-purulent fluid.Serious changes
ensue in the structure of the liver, as was first suggested by O. Wyss
and Leyden, and afterward more especially by Wickham Legg[176] and
Charcot.[177] A ligature to the common duct in animals is followed in
so short a time as two weeks by hyperplasia of the connective tissue
and atrophy of the gland-elements.It has been ascertained that similar
changes ensue in man from the impaction of a calculus in the common
duct.Under these circumstances the size of the liver, as indicated by
the area of hepatic dulness, at first enlarges, and subsequently more
or less contraction, coincident with the atrophy, ensues.When the
cystic duct is obstructed the contents of the gall-bladder increase,
and become ultimately sero-purulent (dropsy).In some instances, the
walls of the abdomen being thin, a globular elastic tumor may be felt
projecting from beneath the liver.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports for 1873_.See also
_Treatise on Diseases of the Liver_, by the same author, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 177: _Lecons_.]Angiocholitis, or inflammation of the duct, is caused by the passage,
especially by the impaction, of a calculus.The inflammation may extend
by contiguity of tissue and involve the surrounding parts.Several
cases have been examined by the writer in which the gall-bladder and
the cystic and common duct were imbedded in a mass of organized
exudation.An extension of inflammation may take place, and be confined
to the hepatic peritoneum.Heavy organized exudations will form,
adhesions be contracted to the diaphragm, to the parietal peritoneum,
and to the neighboring organs, and the capsule, thickened and
contracting, will ultimately induce changes in the structure of the
adjacent part of the liver.When the inflammation extends to the
peritoneum there are the usual systemic symptoms, and locally acute
pain, increased by the respiratory movements and by pressure, and
assuming a constrictive character; nausea and frequent vomiting, and
often a very troublesome hiccough, caused, doubtless, by implication of
some branches of the phrenic nerve; constipation, etc.The relation of biliary colic to cancer of the biliary passages was
first noted by Frerichs, who ascertained the occurrence of gall-stones
in 9 out of 11 cases of cancer of these parts.Hilton Fagge[178]
reports a case of the kind, and the writer can add another from his own
observations.The most important of the reflex symptoms are those pertaining to the
circulatory system.The action of the heart becomes irregular in rhythm
and diminishes in force.The circulation of the bile acids in the blood
causes slowing of the heart's action, as has been set forth in the
section on jaundice; but that is a direct consequence, and is not a
reflex impression.Potain was the first to show that the structure of
the heart is affected.A mitral murmur is a recognized symptom in the
icterus of gall-stones, but Potain[179] has shown that the real seat of
this murmur is the tricuspid, and that the affection of the heart is a
dilatation of the right cavities.The physiological reason for this
condition of the heart is the rise of tension in the pulmonary artery,
which is secondary to irritation of the splanchnic nerves; and to this
factor is also due the reduplication of the first sound and the
accentuation of the second sound--characteristic signs of the cardiac
change in these cases.[Footnote 179: Cyr, _Traite de l'Affec.cit._]

{1078} There are certain reflex nervous troubles in cases of hepatic
colic, some of them of great importance.One of the lesser troubles is
herpes zoster.A very violent attack in the course of the distribution
of the first, second, and third cervical nerves has happened in a case
under the writer's observation.There have been reported from time to
time cases of sudden death during the paroxysms of hepatic colic, in
which a calculus lodged in Vater's diverticulum, at the intestinal
extremity of the common duct, was the cause of the accident.An
explanation of this result is to be found in the intimate nervous
communications between the liver and the heart through the solar plexus
and the large number of ganglia contained in Vater's diverticulum.The
most severe pain is felt as the calculus is passing through the orifice
of the common duct into the intestine, and here also the spasm of the
muscular fibre is most tense.The so-called crushing-blow experiment of
Goltz illustrates how intense suffering, such as the passage of a
gall-stone, can paralyze the heart through the solar plexus.The
depression of the heart's action does not always occur on the instant,
but it may be gradual--several hours, even a day or two, being occupied
in the suspension of activity.Leigh of Liverpool[180] has reported an
example of death in six hours in a female of thirty, previously in good
health; Cornillon,[181] another in a female of fifty-three, who died in
twelve hours from the beginning of the paroxysm; Williamson,[182] a
female of fifty-one years, who expired on the fourth day;
Habershon,[183] two, who died during the paroxysms at a period not
stated; and Brouardel, one which was the subject of a medico-legal
investigation.In the first case the calculus was yet in the
gall-bladder, the appearances indicating that persistent spasms had
occurred to force the calculus into the cystic duct; in the others in
which the position of the stone is mentioned, it was engaged in the
orifice of the common duct or had reached the intestine.[Footnote 180: _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1867, vol.[Footnote 182: _The Lancet_ (London), vol.[Footnote 183: _Lectures on the Pneumogastric_, 3d Lecture.]In several instances sudden death has resulted from uncontrollable
vomiting induced by the paroxysms of hepatic colic.Trousseau[184]
mentions a case in which strangulated hernia and death ensued in
consequence of the violent vomiting brought on by the passage of a
calculus.[Footnote 184: _Clinique medicale_.]DIAGNOSIS.--Unless the distension of the gall-bladder is sufficient to
cause a recognizable tumor, gall-stones in that organ do not produce
symptoms by which they can be diagnosticated.If sudden attacks of
violent pain in the right hypochondrium, accompanied by nausea and
vomiting and followed by jaundice, have occurred from time to time,
then the presence of biliary concretions may be suspected if the
symptoms belonging to them are present in the intervals between the
seizures.The migrations of calculi produce symptoms so characteristic
that error is hardly possible.The only disorders with which an attack
of hepatic colic may be confounded are gastralgia and hepatalgia.As
regards the first, the distinction is made by the seat of pain, by the
absence of after jaundice, and by the lack of a concretion passed by
stool.As the diagnosis may depend on the finding a concretion, the
writer must again affirm the importance of a properly-conducted search
of all the stools passed for several days after the paroxysm.{1079} Hepatalgia is diagnosticated with great difficulty, for the pain
has the same seat, the same character, but as a rule it does not
terminate so abruptly, is not accompanied by such severe vomiting and
depression, jaundice is absent, and no stone can be found in the
evacuations.Both gastralgia and hepatalgia occur in the subjects of
neurotic disturbances--in the pale, delicate, and hysterical--whereas,
as a rule, hepatic colic happens to the obese, to the persons of active
digestion addicted to the pleasures of the table.The passage of calculi may be confounded with flatulent colic, with the
pain caused by lead and other mineral poisons, with impaction, internal
strangulation, local peritonitis, and similar causes of sudden and
violent pain.The differentiation is made by attention to the seat and
character of the pain, by the previous history, and especially by the
absence of jaundice and of a concretion.From renal colic the hepatic
is separated by the position of the pain, by the direction taken by it,
and by the retraction of the testicle, the irritability of the bladder,
and the appearance of blood in the urine--all characteristic symptoms
of the renal affection.TREATMENT.--The treatment of biliary concretions includes the remedial
management for the calculi in position, for the paroxysms of hepatic
colic caused by the migration of these bodies, and for the results and
complications.Treatment of the Calculus State: Of Inspissated Bile.--As the particles
of inspissated bile are deposited along the larger hepatic ducts, and
form in consequence of a deficiency in the amount of glycocholate and
taurocholate of soda, two methods of treatment are to be carried out:
free purgation by an active cholagogue to wash out the offending
substance, and the exhibition of a soda salt to promote the alkalinity
of the bile and the consequent solution of the bile-pigment.Harley's
method, which he strongly urges, consists in the administration of "one
or two drachms of sulphate of soda in a bitter infusion every morning
before breakfast, or from twenty to thirty grains of bicarbonate of
soda, along with a drachm of taraxacum-juice in a bitter infusion,
every night at bedtime at regulated intervals for a month or so,
according to the constitution of the patient and the severity of the
symptoms."As persons who suffer from inspissation of the bile are naturally
bilious, it is of the first importance in the prophylactic treatment to
regulate the diet.Indulgence in malt liquors, in fatty and saccharine
articles of food, must be forbidden.Acid fermentation in the course of
duodenal digestion should be prevented by withholding the starches and
sugars.Peptonized foods, given with an alkali, are highly useful.Milk, fresh meat, and the succulent vegetables are the proper
constituents of a diet for these subjects.Bread is one of the most
offending articles, and should be restricted in amount as much as
possible.Next to a suitable diet, systematic exercise is a measure of the
highest utility in these cases.A daily morning sponge bath of a weak
alkaline water not only maintains the skin in a healthy state, but also
promotes the oxidation processes of the body.The alkaline mineral
waters of Wisconsin, Michigan, Virginia, and other States, especially
of the Bethesda Spring of Wisconsin, may be drunk with great advantage
to accomplish the same purpose.{1080} We possess direct means for preventing inspissation of the
bile--remedies which act in the physiological way by increasing the
proportion of glycocholate and taurocholate of soda.Harley prefers the
sulphate and bicarbonate for this purpose, but my experience is in
favor of the cholate and phosphate of sodium, especially the latter;
for, whilst it plays the part of a soda salt, it exerts a decided
cholagogue action, thus effecting the results achieved by the combined
use of sulphate of soda and taraxacum.A cure may be confidently looked
for in this malady by the persistent use of sodium phosphate--drachm j
ter in die.It seems to act more efficiently when given dissolved in
hot water.The paroxysms of hepatic colic due to the passage of inspissated bile
are to be treated in the same way as when this condition of things is
caused by the migration of formed calculi.The action of cholagogue
purgatives is more decidedly beneficial in the attacks due to the
passage of inspissated bile.Biliary Calculi in Situ.--Notwithstanding their crystalline form and
firmness of texture, it is possible to effect the gradual solution of
biliary calculi.Outside of the body it is easy to dissolve a calculus
in chloroform, in Durande's remedy, etc., if time enough be given, but
the problem is a far more difficult one when the calculus is in
position in the gall-bladder or in a hepatic duct.As Trousseau[185]
has wisely observed, it is not safe to apply to conditions within the
body conclusions reached by experiments in the laboratory.Nevertheless, facts are known which justify the belief that an
impression may be made on concretions in the gall-bladder.The motion
of respiration and the voluntary actions of the abdominal muscles cause
more or less attrition and breaking off of the angles and margins of
the crystals, thus permitting the solvent action of the bile.If,
however, the bile continues in the state in which it was at the time of
the crystallization of the cholesterin, it will make no impression on
this substance.We have now the means of restoring its power to
dissolve crystallized cholesterin.As a necessary preliminary, fracture
of the crystals must be effected.This may be accomplished, when the
natural forces have failed to effect it, by manipulation of the
gall-bladder through the walls of the abdomen, but especially by
faradization.Excellent results have been achieved by this
last-mentioned expedient, but no satisfactory explanation has been made
of its methodus medendi, unless we accept the mechanical effect of the
muscular movements.In applying the faradic current an electrode is
introduced into the rectum, and the other, a sponge well moistened, is
placed over the gall-bladder.An interrupted galvanic current is
indicated, the electrodes in the position just mentioned, when a
migrating calculus is stopped on its way.Such an application has
rendered important service in a few cases.[Footnote 185: _Clinique medicale de l'Hotel Dieu de Paris_.]Except that calculi have been found in a state of decay, their angles
and edges broken, divided by cleavage, there is no evidence that they
have undergone solution when in situ, except the clinical evidence
which consists in a disappearance of the symptoms.The remedy of
Durande, which consists in a mixture of ether and turpentine--three
parts of the former and two of the latter--has been celebrated since
the close of the last century, and is yet much employed in France,
notably at Vichy.It {1081} is preferred by Cyr,[186] who advises its
administration in capsules taken immediately before meals.Chloroform
readily dissolves calculi out of the body, and hence it has been
proposed, and indeed much used, for the purpose of effecting their
solution in the gall-bladder; but, as Trousseau urges, there is no
warrant for the belief.Corlieu,[187] who first proposed its use, and
afterward Bouchut,[188] maintained that chloroform does exert this
solvent action, and reported cases in confirmation; but there are so
many sources of fallacy that such evidence must be viewed with
suspicion.It has usually been administered in small doses (five
minims) three times a day for a long period.That it is beneficial by
stimulating the flow of pancreatic secretion and by allaying spasms is
probably true, but that any quantity which can be administered in
safety will act as a solvent of cholesterin concretions cannot be
believed.[Footnote 186: _Traite de l'Affection calculeuse du Foie_, p.[Footnote 187: _Gazette des Hopitaux_, 1856, June 19.][Footnote 188: _Bulletin gen.If solution of hepatic calculi is possible under any circumstances, the
most rational mode of effecting it would seem to be to restore that
condition of the bile which in the normal state maintains cholesterin
in the state of solution.Cholesterin is precipitated and crystallizes
about a nucleus when the glycocholate and taurocholate of soda are
deficient in amount.The agents most effective in restoring the solvent
power of the bile are the salts of soda, of which the sulphate is
preferred by Harley.In 1873 the cholate of soda was brought forward by
Schiff, who prescribed it in doses of 50 centigrammes (8 grains nearly)
three times a day, to be gradually increased until digestive or
circulatory troubles arose.This remedy, which is eminently rational
from the point of view above indicated, has apparently been of decided
service in many published cases and in the writer's experience.It will
be found, however, that five grains three times a day is as large a
quantity as can be easily borne.Another soda salt which in my own hands has proved in a high degree
effective is the phosphate.As has been explained when referring to its
use in cases of disorders due to inspissated bile, it has a distinct
cholagogue action, but the chief sources of its utility in this
affection are its chemical and resolvent powers.The usual quantity is
one drachm three times a day, dissolved in sufficient warm water.Bile itself, in the form of inspissated ox-gall, was formerly much
used, a scruple to a drachm being given three times a day, and not
without good results.It was also prescribed with chloride of ammonium.For the gastro-duodenal catarrh and the accompanying catarrh of the
bile-ducts this combination is sometimes useful.I have recently proposed a new expedient for effecting the solution of
hepatic calculi.This method consists in puncture of the gall-bladder
with a fine exploring-trocar, and the injection through the canula,
after withdrawing the stylet, of a suitable solvent.Durande's remedy,
chloroform, and other solvents can be introduced in this way without
injury to the parts.I have punctured the gall-bladder, removed its
contents, and explored its interior without damaging the organ in any
way and without leaving after traces.The measure proposed offers no
special difficulties in its execution.The Paroxysms of Hepatic Colic.--The pain of hepatic colic being {1082}
the most acute suffering known to man--in its severest form at
least--the most powerful anodynes are required.The measures employed
for relief of pain happen to be the most efficient for promoting the
expulsion of the calculus and for limiting, if not preventing, the
subsequent inflammation.As soon as the character of the seizure is
manifest a hypodermatic injection of morphine and atropine--1/8 to 1/2
grain of the former and 1/200 to 1/80 grain of the latter--should be
given; ether administered by inhalation if necessary; and by the
stomach chloroform, chlorodyne, or chloral.As the stomach is usually
exceedingly irritable, the subcutaneous injection of remedies is a
precious resource: this failing or contraindicated, relief may be given
by the rectal injection of laudanum or chlorodyne.As relief is often
afforded by the act of vomiting, the attempts to empty the stomach
should be encouraged, and to this end large draughts of warm water
should be given.Hot fomentations and mustard plaster should be applied
over the right hypochondrium, and an entire warm bath may be used if
available.Great relief is usually afforded by the action of purgatives.The
irritability of the stomach forbids the employment of drastic
purgatives, yet podophyllin resin is warmly commended by Dobell.It
must be given in small doses, and preferably dissolved in spirit.Calomel in one-grain doses, every four hours until it purges, allays
nausea and lessens the after-uneasiness in the right hypochondrium, but
mercurial treatment given with a view to a supposed cholagogue effect
only does evil by prolonged administration, especially if ptyalism is
induced.If evidences of portal congestion are present, such remedies
as euonymin, iridin, baptisin, and others of the cholagogue group give
good results.The most effective of the remedies of this kind is
ipecacuanha, given in purgative doses: the emesis induced by it favors
the extrusion of the stone, and the powerful cholagogue effect relieves
the portal congestion.Twenty grains at once, and repeated if need be
in three hours, is a suitable quantity.The various complications which may occur, and the results which follow
the migration of the calculus, require treatment adapted to the
conditions existing, and will be mentioned in the sections devoted to
these topics.Occlusion of the Biliary Passages; Stenosis of the Ductus Communis
Choledochus.DEFINITION.--By occlusion of the biliary passages is meant an
obstruction, internal or external, of the hepatic, cystic, or common
duct.The causes of the obstruction are various, but the results are
quite uniform; hence the term includes a complexus of symptoms of a
very distinctive type.Occlusion may be congenital or acquired: it is
the latter with which we have especially to deal.Stenosis signifies a narrowing which in its extremest form produces a
nearly complete obstruction; when the canal is entirely closed the term
occlusion is applied.Stenosis also may be congenital or acquired.PATHOGENY.--The conditions producing narrowing of a hepatic duct or its
complete obstruction are numerous, and some of them complex in their
relations.As regards the ducts themselves, the interference may {1083}
be entirely within the canal, or it may affect the walls, or it may be
wholly extraneous; as, for example, when a cancer of the pancreas
encroaches on the common duct.It will be convenient to consider the
causes of stenosis and obstruction from these points of view: 1,
internal; 2, of the duct walls; 3, extraneous.The most usual situations for the occurrence of those changes that lead
to occlusion by inflammatory adhesions are the beginning of the cystic
duct, obstruction of which is of little moment, and the end of the
common duct, which finally proves fatal.The passage of a large polyangular calculus may cause such irritation,
abrasion of the epithelium, and subsequent inflammatory exudation as to
effect a direct union of the opposing sides of the canal.This takes
place at the beginning of the cystic duct especially, since, owing to
the spasm of the gall-bladder and the absence of muscular fibres in the
walls of the duct, the stone crushes into, without passing through, the
canal.The inflammatory exudation thus excited may close the duct.Not
unfrequently the gall-bladder, full of calculi, is thus shut off from
the liver permanently.In one instance the writer has seen a calculus
wedged into the orifice of the cystic duct, whilst just beyond the
lumen was permanently obstructed by an organized exudation.Permanent
closure of the cystic duct is of far less consequence than of the
common duct, and may, indeed, be a conservative condition, as in the
case above mentioned, where numerous polyangular calculi may have
migrated, except the closure of the passage.The most usual point of obstruction in the course of the common duct is
the intestinal end, but various processes are employed to effect it.The first in importance is catarrhal inflammation.This seems the more
credible when it is remembered that to a simple catarrh of the mucous
membrane is due the temporary stoppage of the duct, producing jaundice
in much the largest proportion of cases.When the epithelium is
detached and granulations spring up from the basement membrane,
adhesions of the surfaces will readily take place, and the union may be
so complete as that all traces of the duct will disappear.It is
probable that in many, if not in most, of these cases the initial
condition of the canal is that of simple catarrh, the more positive
changes in the mucous membrane arising from peculiarities in the
tissues of the individual affected, or from local injury caused by the
passage of a concretion or irritation of pathological secretions of the
duodenum.Stenosis, and finally occlusion, of the common duct may arise from the
cicatrization of an ulcer.They
may result from catarrhal inflammation of a chronic type, much new
connective-tissue material forming, and in the process of
cicatrization, with the contraction belonging to it, the lumen of the
canal is so far filled up that the passage of bile is effectually
prevented.They may be produced in that state of the tissues which
accompanies certain cachectic and profoundly adynamic conditions, as in
severe typhoid fever.Such ulcers may also be due to the mechanical
injury effected by the migration of a gall-stone.In cicatrizing, a
tight stricture, impermeable to the passage of bile, may result, or the
lumen of the canal be entirely obliterated.In the latter case the duct
itself may disappear and leave no trace.An ulcer situated at the
duodenal end of the common duct and extending into the {1084} duodenum
may also in the process of healing so contract as to render the orifice
impermeable to bile.The same effect may follow the cicatrization of an
ulcer of the duodenum in the immediate vicinity of the orifice of the
common duct.Without the intervention of an ulcer as a means of explaining closure
of the common duct, this accident may be caused by a catarrhal
inflammation which effects denudation of the basement membrane, and
thence union may be produced by the mere contact of the
freshly-granulating surfaces.Congenital occlusion of the bile-ducts or
obstruction occurring in a few days after birth, it is probable, is
effected in this way, but no direct evidence of the process has thus
far been offered.During intra-uterine life, as at any period in
after-life, it seems necessary to the production of such changes that a
peculiar constitutional state must exist; otherwise, such a result
might happen to every case of catarrhal inflammation of the bile-ducts.The extent of the changes is further evidence in the same direction;
for not only are the walls of the duct in permanent apposition and
adhesion, but the duct degenerates into a mere fibrous cord, and in
some instances is nearly, even entirely, obliterated.[189]

[Footnote 189: _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.The cystic or common duct--the latter to be chiefly considered--may be
occluded by the retention in its lumen of some foreign body.The
impaction of a biliary calculus has already been repeatedly referred
to, but there are some additional points demanding consideration.The
larger concretions may be stopped in the neck of the gall-bladder;
those small enough to enter the canal may be arrested at its bend
behind the neck, and the very entrance of the cystic duct may be
blocked, as in a case examined by the writer.The hepatic duct is very rarely permanently occluded.As the calibre of
this canal continuously enlarges downward, there is no point at which a
stone is likely to be arrested; nevertheless, it occasionally happens
that such an obstruction does occur.An example has occurred under the
observation of the writer, but the cause was a gunshot wound of the
liver.The most usual, and for very obvious reasons the most important, of the
sites where occlusion occurs is the common duct and at the termination
of the duct in the small intestine, the intestinal orifice.Just behind
and to the right of its orifice the duct is dilated into a fossa--the
diverticulum Vateri; and here concretions of a size to pass along the
common duct are stopped.It is not essential that the stone fit the
canal: it may do so and prevent any bile passing into the duodenum; it
may be a polyangular body, and, though wedged in, leave spaces through
which more or less can slowly trickle.Again, the diverticulum may contain numerous concretions,
which distend the canal greatly, but through the interstices of which
some bile can flow.Other foreign bodies very rarely close the intestinal end of the ductus
communis; thus, for example, a cherry-seed, a plum-seed, a mass of
raisin-seeds, may slip into the orifice after the passage of a
gall-stone has stretched it sufficiently.A much more common cause of
occlusion is an intestinal parasite, which crawls in and is fastened.The common round-worm is the most frequent offender, and much less
often liver-flukes find a lodgment there.{1085} The ductus communis choledochus may be closed by agencies acting
from without.They are various, but the most common are the
carcinomata.Primary cancer of the gall-bladder and gall-ducts,
although not of frequent occurrence, is by no means rare.It develops
in connection with the connective-tissue new formations produced by the
inflammation following the migration of large calculi.A very
instructive example has been examined by the writer.The patient, a
woman aged forty-eight, had had numerous paroxysms of hepatic colic,
and after death, which followed a protracted stage of jaundice by
obstruction, a large ovoid calculus, filling the gall-bladder, was
found, and an extensive organized exudation of inflammatory origin was
the seat of carcinomatous disease involving the cystic and common ducts
and closing the lumen of both.Cancer of the pylorus, of the duodenum,
of the pancreas, of the right kidney, and of the liver itself, not
unfrequently by exterior pressure permanently occlude the common duct.To this category of obstructing causes must be added enlarged lymphatic
glands of the transverse fissure, large fecal accumulations, tumors of
the ovaries and uterus, aneurisms of the abdominal aorta, and
especially aneurism of the hepatic artery, several examples of which
have been reported, and one has occurred in a case seen by the writer.The effects of obstruction are much less important when the cystic duct
is closed.The contents of the gall-bladder accumulate, constituting
the condition known as dropsy of the gall-bladder.A catarrhal state of
the mucous membrane is set up; the muco-pus formed mixes with the bile,
and the mixture undergoes fermentative changes which further alter its
character and impart to it irritating qualities, in consequence of
which the mucous membrane becomes more decidedly inflamed, and a still
more purulent fluid forms, so that ultimately the contents of the
gall-bladder are entirely purulent, and that organ may attain to
enormous size.Instead of a catarrhal inflammation leading to
suppuration, the mucous membrane may pour out serum abundantly, the
biliary contents and mucus disappear by absorption, and finally the
gall-bladder will be moderately distended by a serous-like fluid.No
further disturbance ensues, and the gall-bladder, thus shut off from
participation in the hepatic functions, ceases to give trouble.The results are far different when the obstruction occurs in the
hepatic or common duct, for then the bile can no longer perform its
double function of secretion and excretion--of contributing materials
necessary to digestion and assimilation, and excreting substances whose
removal is necessary to health.The liver continuing to functionate
after closure of the duct is effected, obviously the secretion of bile
continues to accumulate, and the irritation of the mucous membrane
causes a catarrhal state; mucus is poured out, and serum escapes from
the distended vessels.If the hepatic duct only is obstructed, the
dilatation will not involve the cystic duct and gall-bladder, but as
the common duct at its termination is occluded, usually the whole
system of tubes will be affected by the ensuing changes.The
alterations already described as occurring in the gall-bladder take
place in all the hepatic ducts.The bile-elements are absorbed, and the
fluid distending the whole system of hepatic tubes becomes finally a
semi-transparent serum or a very thin sero-mucus, having in bulk a pale
sea-green color.Although an intense jaundice {1086} coexists with the
obstruction, no portion of the bile escapes into the ducts.At the
beginning of the obstruction more or less bile is in the tubes, and
then the fluid will have a distinct biliary character; but as it
accumulates, first the bile-constituents disappear, then the
mucus--which at the outset was formed freely--is absorbed, and at last
only a colorless serum remains.This fluid, which has been examined
chemically by Frerichs, is found to be slightly alkaline, to have only
2 per cent.of solids, and to present no trace of any biliary
constituent.As the fluid accumulates the gall-bladder and ducts
dilate, sometimes to an enormous extent, the fluid they contain
amounting to several pints.The walls of the ducts grow thinner, and
may finally give way with the pressure or from external violence, the
fluid exciting an intense and quickly-fatal peritonitis.Important
changes occur in the structure of the liver also.With the first
retention of bile the liver conspicuously enlarges, and may indeed
attain to twice its normal size, but it subsequently contracts, and may
lessen in as great a degree as it had enlarged.Changes begin in the
glandular structure as pressure is brought to bear on the cells by the
enlarging ducts.The liver-cells become anaemic and the protoplasm
cloudy, but granular and fatty degeneration does not take place.Even
more important as an agency affecting the condition of the hepatic
cells is the hyperplasia of the connective tissue, which ensues very
promptly when an obstruction to the flow of bile arises from any cause,
as has been shown by Legg[190] and Charcot.[191] The liver on section
has a rather dark olive-green color, and is firmer in texture, owing to
the increased development of the connective tissue; the cells are
bile-stained and contain granules of coloring matter and crystals of
bilirubin, and although they are at first not altered in outline,
subsequently more or less atrophy is produced by the contraction of the
newly-formed connective tissue and the pressure made by the dilated
hepatic ducts.[Footnote 190: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.352
_et seq._]

[Footnote 191: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.205 _et
seq._]

SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms produced by occlusion of the cystic duct are
not sufficiently characteristic to be diagnosticated with any
certainty.When an attack of hepatic colic has slowly subsided without
jaundice, and an elastic tumor, globular or pyriform in shape, has
appeared from under the inferior margin of the liver in the position of
the gall-bladder, dropsy of that organ may then be suspected.As
paracentesis of the gall-bladder may be performed with ease, safety,
and little pain, the diagnosis may be rendered more certain by the use
of the exploring-trocar.Obstruction of the hepatic or common duct is accompanied by symptoms of
a very pronounced and distinctly diagnostic character.Without
referring now to the antecedent symptoms or to those belonging to the
obstructing cause, the complexus of disturbances following the
obstruction is the subject to which our attention must be directed.The
great fact dominating all other considerations is the stoppage of the
bile, whether this has occurred suddenly or slowly.Jaundice begins in
a few hours after the canal is blocked.At first there is yellowness of
the conjunctiva, then diffused jaundice, deepening into the intensest
color in two or three weeks, or, when the obstruction is sudden and
complete, in a few hours.At first the color is the vivid jaundice
tint, a citron or salmon or yellow-saffron hue, but this gradually
loses its bright appearance, grows darker, and passes successively into
a brownish, bronze-like, and ultimately a {1087} dark olive-green,
which becomes the permanent color.Under some moral emotional
influences there may be a sudden change to a brighter tint, lasting a
few minutes, but otherwise the general dark olive-green hue persists
throughout.In a few instances, after some weeks of jaundice, the
abnormal coloration entirely disappears, signifying that the liver is
too much damaged in its proper glandular structure to be in a condition
to produce bile.Such a cessation of the jaundice is therefore of evil
omen.Pruritus, sometimes of a very intense character, accompanies the
jaundice, in most cases appears with it, and in the supposed curable
cases it has persisted after the cessation of the discoloration.The
irritation may become intolerable, destroying all comfort, rendering
sleep impossible, and so aggravating as to induce a highly nervous,
hysterical state.The scratching sets up an inflammation of the skin,
and presently a troublesome eczema is superadded.In some of the cases
a peculiar eruption occurs on the skin and mucous membranes, entitled
by Wilson[192] xanthelasma.It has been carefully studied by Wickham
Legg,[193] who has ascertained the character of the changes occurring
in the affected tissues, and also by Mr.[194] As a rule,
this eruption appears after several months of jaundice, and manifests
itself first on the eyelids, then on the palms of the hands, where it
makes the most characteristic exhibit, and after a time on the lips and
tongue.It occurs in irregular plaques of a yellowish tint slightly
elevated above the general surface, and rarely assumes a tubercular
form.As was shown by Hilton Fagge, xanthelasma occurs more especially
in the milder cases of catarrhal icterus that had been protracted in
duration, but it is also occasionally seen in the jaundice of
obstruction.[Footnote 192: _Diseases of the Skin_, 6th ed., Lond., p.[Footnote 193: _On the Bile, Jaundice, and Bilious Diseases_, p.317
_et seq._]

[Footnote 194: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.According to the stage of the disease during which the examination is
made the liver will be enlarged or contracted; more or less tenderness
may be developed by pressure in the area occupied by the ducts, and a
tumor in a position to effect compression may possibly be detected.The
area of hepatic dulness will be increased in the beginning of all the
cases in which the obstruction is complete, but will remain normal so
long as the flow of bile persists despite the obstruction.When
enlarged, the liver can be felt projecting below the inferior margin of
the ribs, and with it, in most cases, the elastic globular body, the
gall-bladder.The state of the hepatic secretion, and in consequence
the duration of the obstruction, may be ascertained by puncture of the
gall-bladder and withdrawal of some of its contents for examination.The presence of unaltered bile will indicate recent obstruction; of
serum, will prove long-standing interruption of bile-production.The
presence of concretions in the gall-bladder will indicate the character
of the obstructing cause, and an increased amount of bile of a normal
or nearly normal kind will be conclusive evidence that the obstruction
is in the course of the common duct.In a fatal case of permanent
occlusion examined by myself the cystic duct was closed by inflammatory
adhesions and the common duct was stopped up by a calculus.The enlarged area of hepatic dulness will, in a protracted case, not
continue.The proper secreting structure, the hepatic cells, undergo
atrophy, {1088} and the increased connective tissue--to the development
of which enlargement of the organ is mainly due--contracts.The
ultimate result is that the liver becomes sclerosed, and is distinctly
smaller, the area of hepatic dulness diminishing to a greater relative
extent than the area of dulness due to hypertrophic enlargement.The
contraction of the liver goes on at the rate that several months are
required to make the result evident on percussion and palpation.Not
unfrequently, the contraction is too slight to affect the percussion
note of the right hypochondrium, and then, to realize the condition of
the organ, the history and rational signs must be closely studied.Whilst the liver thus varies in size, the gall-bladder remains enlarged
and projects from the under surface of the organ, elastic, globular,
and distinctive.The shrinking of the liver from around it makes the
impression of growing size; it may be increasing, indeed, but more
frequently the enlargement is merely apparent.Whether the liver be enlarging or diminishing in size, its functions
are impaired, or indeed entirely suspended.As the digestive canal
receives the bile immediately on its production, it will be best to
begin with the gastro-intestinal disorders which accompany occlusion of
the bile-ducts.The appetite is either wanting entirely and food is
loathed, or an excessive or canine appetite is experienced.The latter
belongs rather to an early stage of the disorder, and comes on after
the first disturbance of the stomach belonging to the immediate effects
of the occlusion.The former is the result of long-standing
interference with the primary assimilation.The tongue is coated with a
thick yellowish fur, which, drying, is detached in flakes, leaving the
mucous membrane beneath red, raw, fissured, and easily bleeding.The
taste is bitter, and the mouth has a pasty, greasy, and unclean
feeling.There is much thirst, and as a rule the patient experiences a
keen desire for acid drinks and for fresh fruits.The stomach is rather
intolerant of food, and nausea comes on as soon as it enters the
stomach.The mucus and stomach-juice accumulating over night, in the
morning there is much retching and nausea until the acid and rather
foul contents of the organ come up.When food is retained it causes
much distress, gases of decomposition accumulate, distending the
stomach and giving prominence to the epigastrium, and eructations of
offensive gas, with some acid liquid, occur from time to time.Similarly, in the intestines the foods undergo decomposition instead of
normal digestion; gases of putrefaction are evolved, the abdomen
generally is swollen, and flatulent colic results.Very irritating fat
acids are liberated by the decomposition of the fatty constituents of
the food, which, with the acid products of the fermentation occurring
in the starch and sugar of the diet, cause a sensation of heat and
distress through the abdomen.Usually, the bowels are torpid, but in
some cases the stools are relaxed, having the consistence and
presenting somewhat the appearance of oatmeal porridge.They may be
firm, moulded, even hard.The gas discharged and the stools are
offensive, with a carrion-like odor.Sometimes decomposing articles of
food can be detected in the stools by very casual inspection--always,
indeed, when the examination is intimate.An excess of fat is also a
characteristic of the condition induced by occlusion of the ducts,
especially when the pancreatic duct is closed, as does happen in cancer
of the head of the pancreas.{1089} A significant change in the color of the stools takes place.They lose their normal brownish-red tint and become yellowish or
clay- or white, pasty, or grayish.Sometimes the stools are very
dark, tar-like in color and consistence, or more thin like prune-juice,
or in black scybalae.The most usual appearance of the stools in
occlusion is grayish, mush-like, and coarsely granular.The very dark
hue assumed at times or in some cases signifies the presence of blood.A dark tint of the evacuations may be caused by articles of food, as a
greenish hue may be due to the use of spinach; a clay- tint to
the almost exclusive use of milk; a grayish tint to the action of
bismuth; a bilious appearance to the action of rhubarb; and many
others.When the occlusion is partial, although it be permanent,
sufficient bile may descend into the duodenum to color the stools to
the normal tint, and yet all the other signs of obstruction be present.The bile-pigment, not having an outlet by the natural route, by the
intestine, passes into the blood; all the tissues of the body and the
various secretions and excretions, notably the urine, are stained by
it, constituting the appearance known as jaundice or icterus.This
malady has been described (see ante), but it is necessary now to give a
more specialized account of those conditions due more especially to the
prolonged obstruction of the biliary flow.These are a morbid state of
the blood; changes in the kidneys and in the composition of the urine;
a peculiar form of fever known as hepatic intermittent fever; and a
group of nervous symptoms to which has been applied the term cholaemia.It has already been shown that but little pressure is required to
divert the flow of bile from the ducts backward into the blood.Changes
consequently ensue in the constitution of the blood and in the action
of the heart and of the vessels.The bile acids lower the heart's
movements and lessen the arterial tension; hence the pulse is slower,
softer, and feebler than the normal.Should fever arise, this
depressing action of the bile acids is maintained; and hence, although
the temperature becomes elevated, the pulse-rate does not increase
correspondingly.There are exceptions to this, however, in so far that
the heart and arteries are in some instances little affected, but it is
probable under these circumstances that there are conditions present
which induce decomposition of the bile acids.The most important result of the action of the bile on the constitution
of the blood is the hemorrhagic diathesis.Soon after the occlusion
occurs in very young subjects--at a later period in adults--the
occlusion having existed for many months, in some cases only near the
end, the disposition to hemorrhagic extravasations and to hemorrhages
manifests itself.From the surface of the mucous membranes, under the
serous, in the substance of muscles, the hemorrhages occur.Epistaxis,
or nasal hemorrhage, is usually the first to appear, and may be the
most difficult to arrest.The gums transude blood, and wherever
pressure is brought to bear on the integument ecchymoses follow.The
conjunctiva may be disfigured and the eyelids swollen and blackened by
extravasations, and the skin of the cheeks and nose marked by stigmata.Haematemesis sometimes occurs, but the extravasations into the
intestinal canal more frequently--indeed, very constantly--take place
in a gradual manner, and impart to the stools a dark, almost black,
tar-like appearance.In the same way the urine may contain fluid blood
and coagula, or it may have a merely smoky {1090} appearance from
intimate admixture with the blood at the moment of secretion.Both the bile-pigment and bile acids exert an injurious action on the
kidneys.In cases of prolonged obstruction not only are the tissues of
the organ stained by pigment in common with the tissues of the body,
but the epithelium of the tubules, of the straight and convoluted
tubes, are, according to Moebius,[195] infiltrated with pigment.In
consequence of the size and number of the masses of pigment, the tubes
may become obstructed and the secretion of urine much diminished.Other
changes occur, due chiefly to the action of the bile acids, according
to the same authority.These alterations consist in parenchymatous
degeneration.The urine contains traces of albumen in most cases, and,
according to Nothnagel,[196] always casts of the hyaline and granular
varieties stained with pigment.As the alterations in the structure of
the kidneys progress, fatty epithelium is cast off, and thus the
tubules come finally to be much obstructed and the function of the
organ seriously impaired.To cholaemia then are superadded the peculiar
disturbances belonging to retention of the urinary constituents.[Footnote 195: _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.[Footnote 196: _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.326;
also, Harley, _op.One of the most interesting complications which arises during the
existence of obstruction of the bile-ducts is the form of fever
entitled by Charcot[197] intermittent hepatic fever.Although its
character was first indicated by Monneret,[198] we owe the present
conception of its nature and its more accurate clinical history to
Charcot.As has already been pointed
out, the passage of a gall-stone may develop a latent malarial
infection or a febrile movement comparable to that caused by the
passage of a catheter, and known as urethral fever.Charcot supposes
that true intermittent hepatic fever is septicaemic in character, and
can therefore arise only in those cases accompanied by an angiocholitis
of the suppurative variety--such, for example, as that which follows
the passage of calculi.Illustrative cases of this fever, one of them
confirmed by an autopsy, have been recently reported by E. Wagner,[199]
who is rather inclined to accept Charcot's view of the pathogeny.A
remarkable case has been published by Regnard,[200] in which the
angiocholitis was induced by the extension of echinococcus cysts into
the common duct.Whilst there are some objections to Charcot's theory,
on the whole it is probably true that this intermittent hepatic fever
is produced by the absorption from the inflamed surface of the ducts of
a noxious material there produced.It may be likened to the fever which
can be caused by the injection of putrid pus into the veins of animals.[Footnote 197: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie, etc._, p.178 _et

_supra_.]Intermittent hepatic fever, as its name implies, is a paroxysmal fever,
having a striking resemblance to malarial fever, but differs from it in
less regularity of recurrence, in the fact that urea is below the
normal amount instead of increased, and in the effect of quinine, which
in the case of malarial fever is curative, but not curative in hepatic
fever.The paroxysms are sometimes quotidian, rarely double quotidian,
tertian, quartan, and even longer, and in the same case all of these
varieties may occur; on {1091} the other hand, there may be entire
regularity of the seizures.The severity of the chill, the maximum
temperature, and the amount of sweating vary within considerable
limits; there may be merely a slight sense of chilliness or a severe
rigor; the temperature may rise to 101 degrees or to 104 degrees F.,
and there may be a gentle moisture or a profuse sweat.There does not
seem to be any relation between the extent and severity of the local
mischief and the systemic condition.The period of onset of intermittent hepatic fever, and its duration and
mode of termination, are by no means readily determined.Cyr fixes on
the paroxysms of colic as the beginning, but he obviously confounds the
chill and fever caused by the passage of a calculus with the true
intermittent hepatic fever.In a carefully-observed case, the facts
confirmed by an autopsy, E. Wagner[201] gives the clinical history of a
typical example of this malady: Gall-stones were found in the duodenum,
in the common and cystic ducts, but the most important one was a
polyangular stone obstructing the hepatic duct.There was an ulcer with
thickened margin at the entrance to the gall-bladder, and the mucous
membrane of the common duct near the intestinal orifice had a smooth,
cicatricial aspect of recent origin, indicating inflammatory
ulceration.The conditions favorable to the production of a morbid
material of a kind to induce septicaemic fever were therefore present.The onset of fever occurred ten days after the last seizure, time being
thus afforded for the local changes necessary.The duration of the
fever in this case was five months, but the existence of pulmonary
phthisis with cavities will explain this apparently protracted hepatic
intermittent fever.The duration of the disease in its usual form is
uncertain, and ranges between a week and two months, or even three
months, according to Charcot.[202]

[Footnote 201: _Deutsches Archiv fur klinische Medicin_, Band xxxiv.[Footnote 202: _Lecons sur les Maladies du Foie_, p.Suspension of work by the liver necessarily involves retention in the
blood of various excrementitious matters.The attempt of Flint[203] to
establish the doctrine of cholesteraemia has not been supported by the
evidence of contemporary or subsequent physiologists.This theory
denies to the other constituents of the bile any morbific action, and
concentrates those disturbances known as cholaemia on the effects of
cholesterin.As uraemia signifies not merely the presence of urea in
the blood, but of all of the toxic substances excreted by the kidneys,
so the word cholaemia comprehends all the constituents of bile having
power to derange the organism by their presence in the blood.[Footnote 203: _The American Journal of the Medical Sciences_, 1862, p.349 _et seq._]

By cholaemia is meant those disturbances, chiefly nervous, which are
due to the presence of biliary excrementitious matters in the blood,
and not less to the effect on nutrition of the absence of bile from the
process of digestion in the intestine.As the atrophic changes proceed
in the liver, the quantity of urea and uric acid in the urine
diminishes, and presently leucin and tyrosin appear.Amongst the means
of differential diagnosis of hepatic intermittent fever from malarial
fever Charcot mentions the quantity of urea present--in the former
greatly lessened, in the latter much increased.There is, however, a
source of fallacy here not mentioned by Charcot: that is, the
variations in the amount of urea due to destruction of the hepatic
secreting structure.It follows that as changes {1092} occur in the
kidneys, to the condition of cholaemia is superadded the derangements
belonging to uraemia.When the occlusion has existed for some time--a variable period, partly
due to peculiarities of individual structure--there come on certain
characteristic symptoms of nervous origin: headache, hebetude of mind,
dull hearing, obscure or hazy vision, xanthopsia; somnolence and
greatly increasing stupor, leading into coma; rambling and incoherence
of mind, passing into delirium; muscular twitching, subsultus; muscular
weakness, deepening into paralysis; and finally, it may be, general
convulsions.As these derangements of the nervous system develop, a
light febrile movement supervenes, so that the whole complexus has the
typhoid type, or, as it can be more definitely expressed, the patient
thus affected lapses into the typhoid state.COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--Occlusion of the gall-ducts is an
essentially chronic malady in the greatest number of cases.As a rule,
the causes of obstruction operate slowly, but to this rule there are
exceptions.Permanent occlusion may take place suddenly, as when a
gall-stone is impacted immovably in the common duct, or when a
round-worm makes its way into the duct and is firmly fixed there,
incapable of further movement.When occlusion is once effected the gradual changes occurring in the
liver lead to slow decline of the nutrition; the bile-elements
circulating in the blood poison it and set up alterations in the
structure of the kidney, and ultimately, the brain becoming affected,
the end is reached by convulsions and coma.Although permanent
occlusion, if unrelieved, terminates in death, a small proportion of
cases get well, either in consequence of giving way of the obstructing
cause or from the opening of a new route to the intestine.Thus, a
calculus lodged in the fossa of Vater may suffer such injury to its
outer shell as to yield to the action of solvents, or, suppuration
occurring around it, the stone may be loosened and forced onward, or
ulceration may open a channel into the bowel.An incurable malady
causing the occlusion, the termination in death is only a question of
time.There are several
factors, however, whose value can be approximately estimated.When the
obstructing cause is merely local--as, for example, a gall-stone or the
cicatrix of a simple ulcer--the duration of the case is determined by
the mere effect of the suspension of the hepatic functions.As the
eliminating action of the liver and the part played by the bile in the
intestinal digestion are necessary to life, it follows that the
complete cessation of these functions must lead to death.The rate at
which decline takes place under these circumstances varies somewhat in
different subjects.Probably two years may be regarded as the maximum,
and three months the minimum, period at which death ensues when no
other pathogenetic factor intervenes.DIAGNOSIS.--To determine the fact of occlusion is by no means
difficult: the persistent jaundice, the absence of bile in the stools,
and the appearance of the bile-elements in the urine are sufficient.It
is far different when the cause of the occlusion is to be ascertained.The ease and safety with which the exploring-trocar can be used in
cases of supposed obstruction of the cystic duct enable the physician
to decide with confidence points which before could only be matters of
mere {1093} conjecture.The writer of these lines was the first to
puncture the gall-bladder and to explore, by means of a flexible probe
passed through the canula, the course of the duct.[204] It is possible
in this way to ascertain the existence of gall-stones in the
gall-bladder, to find an obstruction at the entrance of the cystic
duct, to demonstrate the presence of echinococci cysts, and to remove
for microscopical examination pathological fluids of various kinds.More recently, Whittaker and Ransohoff[205] of Cincinnati have
attempted the detection of a gall-stone impacted at any point by the
introduction of an exploring-needle; and this practice has been
imitated by Harley[206] of London, but without any reference to the
pioneer and prior investigation of his American colleagues.The case of
Whittaker and Ransohoff survived the exploratory puncture, but Harley's
case proved fatal from traumatic peritonitis.Notwithstanding this
untoward result, Harley persists in the advocacy of this method.It
must appear to any one familiar with the intricate arrangement of the
parts composing the anatomy of this region a most hazardous proceeding,
and hardly to be justified in view of the superior safety and certainty
of my method.To explore the interior of the gall-bladder an
aspirator-trocar is introduced; any fluid intended for microscopical
examination is then withdrawn, and through the canula a flexible
whalebone bougie is passed.[Footnote 204: _The Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic_ for 1878-79; also, W.
W. Keen, M.D., "On Cholecystotomy," _The Medical News_, Sept., 1884.][Footnote 205: _Lancet and Clinic_, 1884.][Footnote 206: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1884.]When icterus comes on in a few days after birth and persists until
death ensues by convulsions and coma, there can be no doubt regarding
congenital absence or impermeability of the common duct.Permanent
retention-jaundice, accompanied by the characteristic symptoms of that
condition immediately succeeding an attack of hepatic colic, is
probably due to impaction by a calculus.When, at or after middle life,
in a patient with a history of former attacks due to gall-stones, there
begins a fixed pain in the right hypochondrium, and subsequently
retention-jaundice, the existence of a malignant growth in connection
with the cicatricial tissue and ancient organized exudation should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if subsequently a tumor
can be felt.If with a localized pain slowly-developing jaundice,
intestinal indigestion, fats and oils appearing unchanged in the
stools, and a condition of prostration more than is properly referable
to the derangement of the hepatic functions, come on in a man or woman
after thirty-five, cancer of the head of the pancreas should be
suspected; and this suspicion will be confirmed if a tumor can be
detected in that situation.It should not be forgotten, however, that
in emaciated subjects the head of the pancreas may be so prominent as
to be mistaken for a scirrhous growth.A pulsating tumor of the right hypochondrium, accompanied by jaundice,
may be an aneurism of the hepatic artery.Pulsation may be communicated
to a bunch of enlarged portal lymphatic glands, which will compress the
common duct, but in this case, as the increase in the size of the
glands is due to caseous, amyloid, or cancerous deposits, there will be
found a source whence these morbid products are derived, and will
explain the nature of a tumor thus constituted.The differentiation of hypertrophic cirrhosis from occlusion of a
slowly-forming character is by no means easy.In both jaundice {1094}
gradually appears; in both the liver is enlarged, but in hypertrophic
cirrhosis much more than in occlusion; and in the latter the
gall-bladder is full--may indeed be distended--whilst in the former it
is empty or contains but little bile.The history of the case may
indicate the nature of the symptoms.Previous attacks of hepatic colic,
and the symptoms of occlusion supervening on the last, are highly
significant of calculous occlusion.TREATMENT.--To ascertain the nature of the occlusion is a necessary
preliminary to any exact treatment.In many cases this must remain a
mere conjecture, when, of course, the treatment is only symptomatic.When it is probable or certain that the duct is obstructed by a
calculus, two methods may be resorted to for its removal: one method is
to break up the calculus by mechanical means; the other is to effect
its solution by chemical agents.Fracture of an impacted calculus is not a merely fanciful expedient.If
the site of the obstruction is ascertained, an attempt may be made to
penetrate the calculus by an aspirator-needle passed through the
abdominal walls, according to the method of Whittaker and Ransohoff.The dangers attendant on this mere puncture are great, and a fatal
result has occurred in one of the very few cases in which it has been
done.Less severe and dangerous methods for attempting the
disintegration of a calculus should be first tried, as follows: Make
firm friction with the fingers along the inferior margin of the ribs
and toward the epigastrium and umbilicus, whilst the opposite side
posteriorly is supported by the hand spread out and applied firmly.A
strong faradic current sent through the region of the gall-bladder and
ducts has in several instances seemed to do good--indeed, to remove
obstructions.A calculus impacted may be dislodged either by the
fracture of its surfaces or by the strong muscular contractions of the
abdominal walls and of the muscular layer of the duct.Most calculi are
easily broken, and when the smallest breach is made in the external
crust disintegration follows; and some calculi are so friable as to
yield to slight pressure.Furthermore, the slightest solution in the
continuity of the rind disposes the whole mass to dissolve in suitable
menstrua.Mechanical rupture is so important a step in the process of
disintegration of an impacted calculus that so serious an operation as
section of the abdomen as a preliminary to it should be considered.The
cavity exposed, the obstructed duct is found, and its retained calculus
is mashed without section of the duct.I find one instance[207] in
which this was done as a subordinate part of a cholecystotomy, and the
breaking up of the stone proved to be easy of accomplishment.It is
also the method of Tait, who proposes to mash the calculus by means of
suitable forceps fitted with padded blades.[Footnote 207: Harley's case, _op.cit._]

I have suggested a means of effecting solution of an impacted calculus
which seems, on further reflection, well worthy of consideration.The
proposal is to inject, through a canula introduced into the
gall-bladder, one of the solvents of the cholesterin calculus before
mentioned.I have already used the canula as a duct for the passage of
an exploring-sound, and have by means of it explored the interior of
the gall-bladder.It is quite as feasible to inject through the canula
a solvent, successive charges of which can be thrown in and withdrawn
by the aspirator.{1095} That the usual solvents introduced by the stomach can effect the
solution of impacted calculi has been declared impossible by
Trousseau;[208] and with this conclusion I unhesitatingly agree.I have
already discussed this part of the subject, and need now only refer the
reader to that section.[Footnote 208: _Clinique medicale_, _loc.cit._]

The various causes of obstruction besides calculi do not offer an
inviting field for the exercise of therapeutical skill.Each case must
be treated according to the nature of the obstructing cause; hence to
make an accurate diagnosis is an essential preliminary to suitable
treatment.DISEASES OF THE PORTAL VEIN.Thrombosis and Embolism of the Portal Vein; Stenosis; Pylephlebitis.DEFINITION.--By the terms at the head of this section are meant the
various pathological processes which induce coagulation of the blood in
some part of the portal system.As the portal vein is made up of many
branches coming from the various organs of the abdominal cavity except
the kidneys, and as it empties, so to speak, into the liver, it is
obvious that various and complex derangements will ensue on the
formation of thrombi.CAUSES.--Thrombosis of the portal vein occurs under three general
conditions: the blood is in a readily coagulable state; the action of
the heart is weak and the blood-current sluggish; the circulation
through the vein is impeded by external pressure.The coagulability of
the blood is increased in diseases characterized by an excess of its
fibrin-producing constituents, of which cirrhosis of the liver may be
mentioned as one having this peculiarity.In chronic maladies of a
depressing kind there may be simply a weak action of the heart, or the
muscular tissue of the organ may be affected by a fatty and atrophic
degeneration.The external pressure by which the blood-current through
the vein is impeded may be caused by the newly-formed connective tissue
of Glisson's capsule, by enlarged lymphatics in the hilus of the liver,
or by tumors of various kinds.The first named of these causes of
compression--atrophic cirrhosis--is most frequently acting.Very
rarely, organized exudations of the peritoneum may be so situated as to
compress the portal vein.This result can only happen when the hepatic
portion of the peritoneum is involved.Pylephlebitis exists in two forms: the adhesive and suppurative.The
former results in changes not unlike those of simple thrombosis.The
blood coagulates in the affected part of the vessel, the clot is
organized, and the vessel ultimately forms a solid rounded cord which
is permanently occluded.The suppurative variety is so different in its
origin and in its results that it requires separate treatment, and I
therefore postpone the consideration of it to the next section.{1096} SYMPTOMS OF THROMBOSIS AND ADHESIVE PYLEPHLEBITIS.--It is a
remarkable fact that the biliary function of the liver is not
necessarily affected in cases of occlusion of the portal vein.It is
true, in advanced cases of cirrhosis, when the interlobular veins are
obliterated by the pressure of the contracting newly-formed connective
tissue, the functions of the liver are arrested in so far as the damage
thus caused extends.Notwithstanding the blocking of the portal,
sufficient blood reaches the hepatic cells by the anastomosis between
the hepatic artery and the interlobular veins--an anatomical connection
demonstrated by Cohnheim and Litten.[209] So long as this anastomosis
continues bile will be formed, although the portal vein is occluded.[Footnote 209: _Virchow's Archiv_, Band lxvii.153, "Ueber
Circulationsstorungen in der Leber."]The most significant symptoms of thrombosis of the portal vein are the
sudden formation of ascites, which quickly assumes a very high grade,
and equally sudden passive congestion of the gastro-intestinal mucous
membrane, enlargement of the spleen, and distension of the superficial
veins of the abdominal parietes.When these symptoms succeed to
cirrhosis of the liver, or appear after the formation of a tumor in the
hepatic region, or come on in the course of phthisis or chronic
inflammation of the hepatic peritoneum, the existence of thrombus of
the portal vein may be reasonably suspected.Coincidently with the occlusion of the portal vein the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane becomes the seat of a catarrhal
process, and to the fluid thus produced is added a much more abundant
transudation from the distended capillaries.Nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea result, the rejected matters being serous, watery, and in
many cases tinged with blood.Now and then quite a severe hemorrhage
takes place, and the blood is brought up by vomiting (haematemesis) or
is discharged by stool.Hemorrhoids form, and, in large masses
protruding, much pain is experienced, and free bleeding may result from
rupture of a distended vein.The veins of the abdominal parietes, which in the normal state are
invisible or at least not prominent, and which form anastomoses with
the portal, when the obstruction occurs dilate, sometimes to a
remarkable extent.The most important anastomosis is that between the
femoral and saphena and internal mammary and epigastric veins.When the
hepatic branches of the portal are closed, but the trunk remains
pervious, the parumbilical vein enlarges greatly, and, communicating
with the superficial veins of the anterior part of the abdominal walls,
forms a radiating network of tortuous veins to which is given the
striking title of caput Medusae.The most significant symptom of portal thrombosis is a quickly-forming
ascites.It is true, ascites is a common symptom in advanced cirrhosis,
but the rapid accumulation of fluid and the prompt filling of the
cavity after tapping distinguish that which arises from portal
thrombosis from all others.Besides its excessive extent, the ascites
presents the usual symptoms.Due to the same cause as the enlargement of the superficial veins, the
hemorrhages, the ascites, etc., there occurs considerable hypertrophy
of the spleen in many of the cases.It sometimes happens that the new
compensatory circulation and the hemorrhages from some part in the
{1097} usual route of the portal so dispose of the blood that the
spleen does not enlarge sufficiently to be readily made out.COURSE AND TERMINATION.--It is obvious that a condition such as that
induced by thrombosis of the portal must be comparatively quickly
fatal; but the cases vary in duration as the compensatory circulation
is more or less complete.Whilst the majority of cases terminate within
two weeks, instances of several months' duration are not unknown, but a
fatal termination, sooner or later, is inevitable in all cases.Coming on in the course of some chronic affection of the liver or some
obstructing cause exterior to the organ, there soon follow ascites,
nausea and vomiting, haematemesis, bloody stools of a liquid character,
enlargement of the spleen, distension of the abdominal veins, and the
distressing symptoms produced by an excessive accumulation of fluid in
the peritoneal cavity.DIAGNOSIS.--As there is no symptom of thrombosis of the portal which
may not be caused by advanced cirrhosis, the diagnosis rests on the
rapid production of the attendant phenomena and their conjoint
appearance.TREATMENT.--A symptomatic treatment is alone possible.The highly
irritable and congested intestinal mucous membrane precludes the
employment of hydragogue cathartics.Salines which cause outward
diffusion from the vessels are the only cathartics which can be used
with propriety.Action of the kidneys and of the skin must be
maintained.To this end the resin of copaiba in pilular form and
pilocarpine subcutaneously may be used.If the strength of the patient
will permit, leeches around the anus can be applied, and much relief
may be expected from free bleeding.It is probable that opening a
swollen hemorrhoid would give the same kind of relief as that caused by
a free hemorrhage.In any case the benefit derived from treatment must
be merely palliative and temporary.Suppurative Pylephlebitis.PATHOGENY.--Primary pylephlebitis rarely if ever occurs.On the other
hand, the secondary form is by no means uncommon; it succeeds to
ulcerative or purulent inflammation at some point in the circuit of
origin of the portal radicles.The most frequently-occurring cause is
ulceration and suppuration of some part of the intestinal tube, and
hence the most common result is multiple abscess of the liver.Pylephlebitis has often resulted from typhlitis; from ulcers of the
large intestine, as in dysentery; from such traumatic injuries as tying
hemorrhoids; from proctitis; from ulcers of the stomach and similar
morbid processes elsewhere within the range of origin of the portal
system.The inflammatory or ulcerative action
extends to and involves the walls of the veins, or some morbid material
diffuses through the vein walls.In either case coagulation of the
blood in the vessel ensues, and the clot undergoes a series of changes
resulting in the formation of emboli, which, carried into the main
current, are subsequently lodged in the hepatic capillaries.There are three steps in the morbid process: the changes in the vein
wall; the production and transformation of the thrombus; and the
formation of secondary suppurating foci in the liver.{1098} The appearance of the tunics of the inflamed vessels varies with
the stage at which they are examined.At first the walls of the vessels
are reddish from congestion, succulent, and swollen, infiltrated by
leucocytes and inflammatory exudation and the cellular elements
undergoing proliferation.The intima especially is much altered in its
appearance and structure, becoming thick, opaque, grayish or yellowish
in color, and having adherent to it a thrombus passing through its
characteristic changes.Ulceration of the intima then occurs, and the
purulent elements, with shreds of tissue, mingle with the degenerating
blood-clot, and ultimately there remains a purulent depot lined with
sloughing, even gangrenous, contents.Emboli detached from such
decomposing thrombus are arrested in the vessels of the liver, and
there set up a suppurating phlebitis, ending in an abscess formation,
or a quantity of pus from the original point of ulcerative phlebitis
passes into the portal vein, and is generally distributed through the
hepatic branches, here and there foci of suppuration being established
by the deposit of decomposing emboli.There may be numerous small
abscesses irregularly distributed through the liver, or there may be
one or two larger collections of pus.Very often the vessel whose
occlusion by a suppurating embolus has caused the mischief is
destroyed, and hence no communication with the abscess-cavity can then
be traced.These abscesses are not limited by a line of inflammatory
demarcation or by a limiting membrane, but the hepatic tissue adjacent
is congested and infiltrated with pus.Ulceration, abscesses, or purulent inflammation occurring at any point
within the area of origin of the radicles of the portal vein may induce
pylephlebitis and consequent hepatic abscess.There are two points at
which, suppuration established, secondary pylephlebitis is most apt to
occur: the caecum; the rectum.As respects the former, the symptoms of
typhlitis precede the hepatic disturbance; and as respects the latter,
usually dysentery, or rather proctitis, is the initial disease.In both
sources of the hepatic trouble the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
chiefly concerned--a fact explicable by reference to the sluggishness
of the circulation and the distended condition of these veins, whence
it is that thrombus is very readily induced.Numerous instances of
pylephlebitis following suppurative lesions of the caecum have been
reported.One of the most recent, and at the same time typical,
examples of such conditions is that published by Bradbury[210] of
Cambridge, England.The initial lesion was "an ulcer the size of a
split pea" situated near "the junction of the vermiform appendix and
caecum.""The hemorrhoidal veins and the inferior mesenteric above were
filled with breaking-down clot and pus," and "the liver contained many
abscesses of various sizes, the largest about the size of a lemon,
which had burst through the diaphragm."As is so often the case, the
ulcer of the caecum produced no recognizable disturbance, and important
symptoms were manifest only when the emboli lodged in the liver set up
suppuration, when there occurred the usual signs of hepatic abscess.In
the West and South hepatic abscess due to pylephlebitis, induced by
proctitis, with ulceration of the rectum, is a common incident.Various
examples of this kind have fallen under my own observation.The
relatively greater frequency of this form of pylephlebitis is due to
the fact above {1099} stated, that the inferior hemorrhoidal veins are
voluminous, have a sluggish current, and are liable to over-distension
by pressure of feces and by external abdominal bands and clothing.Cases of a corresponding character arise from suppuration and
ulceration elsewhere within the portal circuit.Thus, Bristowe[211]
reports a case in which pylephlebitis resulted from an ulcer of the
stomach, the neighboring veins becoming implicated and the usual
results following.[Footnote 210: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, Sept.450,
"Proceedings of the Cambridge Medical Society."][Footnote 211: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_,
vol.When inflammation has begun in a radicle of the portal vein, it may
proceed to the liver by contiguity of tissue, the whole intervening
portion of the vessel being affected.Probably more frequently the
intra-hepatic portion of the portal is inflamed by emboli, and the
adjacent hepatic tissue then undergoes suppuration, as has been already
set forth.SYMPTOMS.--There being two points of disease--the primary lesion of the
peripheral vessel and the secondary results in the hepatic portion of
the portal--the symptomatology must have a corresponding expression.The stomach, the caecum, or the rectum, or some other organ or tissue,
being occupied by a morbid process, there will be a characteristic
complex of symptoms.Taking up the most usual primary disturbance, a
typhlitis or an ulcer of the caecum, there will be pain, tenderness,
and possibly fever, occupying in point of time the period proper to
such a malady and an amount of disturbance of function determined by
the extent of the lesion.The symptoms caused by a single small ulcer
of the caecum, as in the example narrated by Bradbury, may present no
characteristic features and may have little apparent importance, and
yet the lesion is productive of very grave consequences.When from any of the causes mentioned above a thrombus forms in a vein
of the portal system in consequence of the extension of the
inflammation about it, the case, what importance soever it previously
had, now takes on new characters.The onset of the inflammation of the
vein walls and the puriform degeneration of the thrombus is announced
by a chill--a severe rigor, or chilly sensations at least.At the time
of the chill, and sometimes before it, pain is felt, significant of the
lesion in the vein.When proctitis or typhlitis precedes the
pylephlebitis, pain appropriate to the malady is a significant symptom;
but the pain which comes on with the beginning of the inflammation in
the liver is a new sign.The most frequent sites of the pain are the
right hypochondrium and the epigastrium, but it may also be felt in the
left hypochondrium or in either iliac fossa.Unless there be diffuse
peritonitis the pain is accompanied by a strictly-localized tenderness
to pressure.The situation of the pain may afford an indication of the
vein attacked, and when there are two points at which pain is
experienced, one may originate at the first situation of the morbid
action; the other will be due to pylephlebitis.The fever succeeding the chill is decided, and in some cases may attain
to extraordinary height--a manifestation indicative of the pyaemic
character of the affection.The fever intermits or remits, with a more
or less profuse perspiration.The febrile phenomena are similar in
their objective expression to malarial fever, but there is an important
difference in respect to the periods of recurrence of the chills.The
paroxysms are very irregular as to time: there may a daily seizure at
different hours, or there may be several chills on the same day.In
other words, the {1100} paroxysms have the pyaemic characteristics
rather than the malarial.After a time the intermittent phenomenon
ceases, and there occurs a remission merely, the exacerbation being
preceded by chilliness and succeeded by sweating.The sweats are
characteristically profuse and exhausting.During the sweating the
temperature begins to decline, and reaches its lowest point just before
the chilly sensations during the early morning announce the onset of
the daily exacerbation of the afternoon and evening.The thermal line
exhibits many irregularities until the febrile movement assumes the
remittent type, when there occur the morning remission and nocturnal
exacerbation.The maxima may be from 103 degrees F. to 105 degrees,
even to 106 degrees.When the pain and chill come on, disturbances of the digestive organs
ensue.When a large vein of the portal system is occluded, the
remaining veins must be over-distended, and congestion of a part or of
all of the digestive tract will be a result.An acute gastric catarrh
is set up.The appetite is lost, the stomach becomes irritable, and
vomiting is a usual incident.Sometimes the disgust for food is
extreme, and the nausea and vomiting are almost incessant.The vomited
matters consist of a watery mucus mixed with thin bile after a time,
and now and then of a bloody mucus.Thrombosis of a stomach vein may
occur, to be followed by an acute ulcer, and from this considerable
hemorrhage may proceed, when the vomit will consist of blood.Such an
accident, happening to the mucous membrane of the intestine, will be
indicated by bloody stools if the ulceration is low down, or by
brownish, blackish, or chocolate- stools if higher up in the
small bowel.The tongue has usually a characteristic coating in these cases.Large
patches of a rather heavy and darkish fur form, and, cast off from time
to time, leave a glazed and somewhat raw surface.Sometimes there is a
profuse salivary flow, but more frequently the mouth is dry.The lips
are fissured or contain patches of herpes, and the buccal cavity may be
more or less completely lined by patches of aphthae.Diarrhoea is a usual symptom, the stools being dark when mixed with
blood, or grayish and pasty or clay- when there is jaundice.Three-fourths of the cases of pylephlebitis are free from jaundice.This symptom may occur at the onset when the common duct is obstructed
by a calculus, but in other cases it appears when the formation of pus
in the liver exerts sufficient compression of the hepatic ducts to
prevent the passage of the bile.When jaundice occurs, it is accompanied by the usual symptoms.The
urine, previously unchanged, is now  by bile-pigment, and the
alterations in the renal structure and function belonging to jaundice
also take place.It sometimes happens that the obstruction of the portal vein is
sufficient to cause enlargement of the superficial veins of the
abdomen, but the duration of the disease is usually too brief to permit
much deviation from the normal, except rarely.In the cases
characterized by the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis the abdomen will
present a swollen and tense appearance, and there will be acute
tenderness to pressure.The area of hepatic and splenic dulness is not
increased from the outset, but is evident, as respects the spleen, soon
after the obstruction at the liver, and as respects the liver when the
formation of abscesses occurs.{1101} COURSE, DURATION, AND TERMINATION.--The course of pylephlebitis
is compounded of the disturbance at the original point of disease, and
of the secondary inflammation at the several points in the liver where
emboli set up purulent inflammation.There are, therefore, two distinct
symptom-groups, and a short intervening period in which the first is
being merged into the second.The duration is variable, but the extreme
limits are not remote from each other, the condition of pylephlebitis
terminating in from two weeks to three months, the shorter being the
more usual.The termination is death, doubtless invariably; for, as in
true pyaemia arising from other causes, the septic changes in the blood
are such as to preclude the possibility of a return to the normal
condition.DIAGNOSIS.--The main point in the diagnosis consists in the occurrence
of an evident local inflammation, followed by the signs of suppuration
in the hepatic region coming on subsequent to ulceration and
suppuration at some point in the peripheral expansion of the portal
system.Thus, when a proctitis with ulceration of the rectum has been
in existence for some time, there occur pain and tenderness in the
hepatic region, accompanied by an irregularly intermittent fever and by
profuse sweating, it can be assumed with considerable certainty that
emboli have been deposited in some one or more of the terminal branches
of the portal.The evidences of hepatic trouble--swelling of the organ,
jaundice, etc.--and of portal obstruction, which then supervene,
indicate with some precision the nature of the case.TREATMENT.--Although pylephlebitis wears a most unfavorable aspect, the
possibility of a favorable result should always be entertained by the
therapeutist.As absorption of medicaments must be slow--indeed, uncertain--by the
gastro-intestinal mucous membrane when there is portal occlusion, it is
well to attempt treatment by the skin and subcutaneous connective
tissue.Gastro-intestinal disturbance--nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhoea--should be treated by a combination of bismuth, creasote, and
glycerin--remedies acting locally chiefly.Ammonia--the carbonate and
solution of the acetate--is indicated, and should be given for the
purpose of dissolving thrombi and emboli.Corrosive sublimate, carbolic
acid, and quinine can be administered by the subcutaneous areolar
tissue.Quinine may also be introduced by friction with lard, and in
considerable quantity.V. PARASITES OF THE LIVER.Echinococcus of the Liver; Hydatids of the Liver.DEFINITION.--The echinococcus is the intermediate or larval stage in
the development of the Taenia echinococcus--the completed
parasite--whose chief habitat is the intestine of the dog.As the
natural and clinical history of parasites is elsewhere treated of, the
subject is here confined to the development of echinococci cysts in the
liver, its ducts, and vessels.CAUSES.--The presence of echinococcus vesicles in the liver is due to
{1102} the migration of the embryo from the intestinal canal.As
Davaine[212] has ascertained by analysis of all the recorded examples
previous to the publication of his treatise, echinococci are found in
as large a proportion in the liver as in all the other organs combined.This statement is repeated with approval by Cobbold[213] and by
Heller.[214] The embryo, set free in the intestine from the food or
drink containing the ova, starts on its migration.There are several
reasons why the liver is selected for its habitat: it is the largest
accessible organ; the common duct and the portal vein offer the most
convenient roadway for reaching and penetrating its substance.The
exact route or routes of which the parasite avails itself in migrating
have not been definitely settled, although Friedreich has shown that
the portal vein is the medium of transmission of the Echinococcus
multilocularis.The comparative frequency with which the liver is
entered indicates that the portal vein is the favorite route of
migration.[Footnote 212: _Traite des Entozoaires et des Maladies vermineuses,
etc._, par C. Davaine, Paris, 1877, p.[Footnote 213: _Entozoa_, by T. Spencer Cobbold, M.D., F.R.S., London,
1874, p.iii of _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia_, p.PATHOLOGY AND SYMPTOMS.--The number of echinococci reaching the liver
varies from one to ten or twelve or more.They increase in size from
the time of their deposit in the organ, and ultimately attain to large
proportions.The rapidity of growth depends somewhat on the character
of the tissue in which imbedded, and the amount of disturbance of
function is determined by the position of the parasite in the organ.Echinococci may be deposited in any part of the liver--in the substance
of the organ, in the ducts, or in the vessels--but the most usual site
is near the capsule, and, developing outwardly in the direction of
least resistance, impart to the outline of the organ an irregular
contour.As the echinococci develop, the adjacent parts of the liver
pressed upon undergo atrophy, but the connective tissue of the organ
contributes to the formation of the dense capsule which envelops them.But as the increase in size is not rapid, although continuous, if the
cysts are situated at the periphery and adjacent to the capsule, they
may be present for many months without causing any distinct symptoms.In a case occurring under my own observation last year the only symptom
which attracted attention was an enlargement of the hepatic region, and
on examination a characteristic elastic, irregular, and painless tumor
could be readily detected by sight and touch occupying the right
hypochondrium and extending into the epigastric and umbilical regions.When the echinococci cysts impinge on the portal vein or on the hepatic
duct, there will be caused the usual results of such pressure--ascites
or jaundice, or both conditions may occur simultaneously, with
obstruction of both vein and duct.When the cysts develop downwardly,
the stomach and intestines will be displaced, and nausea and vomiting,
diarrhoea or constipation, and, it may be, considerable pain of a
colic-like character, will be caused.An upward development of the
cysts gives rise to more pronounced disturbances.The diaphragm is
pushed upward, the heart displaced, and the lungs, especially the
right, compressed.Occasionally the diaphragm is softened and
perforated by the pressure of the enlarging cysts, and the lungs are
ultimately tunnelled, the parasites being discharged by the bronchi.{1103} The growth of an echinococcus tumor may spontaneously cease, and
then retrograde changes take place, leading to its final disappearance.This arrest of development may occur without any obvious cause, but now
and then such a change from the ordinary course of tumors may be
effected by an external injury, as a blow on the abdomen, but more
frequently the death of the parasite is caused by ulceration into a
bile-duct, and the entrance of bile, which is a poison to these
hydatids.It sometimes happens that, opening into a duct of large size,
the daughter and granddaughter vesicles are slowly discharged through
it into the intestine, and thus a cure is effected.Inflammatory action
occurring in the cysts, adhesions may form and rupture into a
neighboring cavity take place.Direct communication may be established
with the intestine, or the cavity of the pleura or peritoneum be
entered, with results entirely disastrous.A necessarily fatal termination must also ensue when the hydatids
penetrate the ascending vena cava, but this accident is, fortunately,
very rare.The passage outward through the abdominal wall is an exceedingly
uncommon but fortunate issue of echinococcus of the liver, for in this
mode the hydatids may be discharged without much difficulty.The echinococcus vesicle is enveloped in a dense, resisting, and
elastic capsule, constructed out of the connective tissue of the part
in which it is deposited.The innermost layer of the vesicle is the
germinative (endocyst), and from its granular surface are developed the
brood-capsules and their scolices--_i.e._ the head with its suckers and
crown of hooklets.[215] Each vesicle may contain not only daughter, but
also granddaughter, progeny, numbering from a dozen up to many
thousands, and they will vary in size from the head of a pin to a
pullet's egg.It follows that the mother vesicles must also greatly
vary in size: they range from a large pin's head to a child's head.The
vesicles or sacs contain a clear, faintly yellowish, or opalescent
fluid, neutral or slightly alkaline in reaction, and holding in
solution a large per cent.of sodium chloride, but free from albumen.The specific gravity of the fluid ranges from 1007 to 1015, according
to the quantity of sodium chloride present.Succinic acid and also
haematoidin are usual constituents, besides the ingredients already
mentioned.[Footnote 215: _Entozoa_, Cobbold, p.273 _et seq._, chapter viii.]Although the form of hydatid or echinococcus cyst above described is
the usual one, there is occasionally produced an anomalous development
of the parasite, which from its resemblance to colloid cancer was
supposed to have this character until Virchow[216] unravelled the
mystery by demonstrating its true structure.This form of the parasite
is designated Echinococcus multilocularis.Its resemblance to colloid
cancer is the more striking because of the tendency of the interior of
the mass to undergo degeneration, to disintegrate, and to break up into
pus-sacs with greenish, cheesy, and bilious contents.An Echinococcus
multilocularis tumor is of almost stony hardness; it has a very dense
fibrous structure, intersected by cavities with thick gelatinous
contents.These minor cavities[217] are sacs of echinococci, but they
depart widely from the typical form, well-defined scolices being seldom
encountered.[Footnote 216: _Archiv fur Anat._, Virchow, vol.[Footnote 217: Carriere, quoted by Davaine, _op.{1104} Echinococci of the liver develop very slowly, and it is
characteristic of them to attain to very large proportions in most
cases without causing any very pronounced symptoms.There are certain
signs common to hydatids in any situation; there are others which are
due to particular circumstances.A hydatid tumor of the liver is smooth but somewhat irregular in
outline, and elastic, when it develops downward, extending below the
margin of the ribs.If, however, it grows upward, the area of hepatic
dulness extends in that direction beyond the usual limits; the
diaphragm is pushed up, the lungs forced upward to the left and
compressed, and the heart also displaced upward toward the left.The
extension of the tumor downward, in the direction of least resistance,
is more usual.If the walls of the abdomen are sufficiently thin, the
tumor large enough, and if made up of many daughter vesicles, there may
be evoked by palpation the very characteristic sign known as hydatid
purring.To produce this effect an oscillation must be caused by a
sudden impulse communicated to the tumor on one side, the hand resting
against the other side.This sensation is likened to the impression on
the eye of the vibration of a bowl of jelly.Even when there is a
well-defined tumor this symptom is comparatively infrequent, but if
present it is pathognomonic, since no other kind of tumor possesses the
property of oscillation and elastic collision of its several
constituents.When the tumor is so situated as to occlude the hepatic or common duct,
jaundice will be a symptom, and when the stomach is pressed upon there
will be epigastric oppression and nausea.If the vena cava is impinged
on or the portal vein, the usual results--ascites and oedema of the
lower extremities and of the scrotum--will be manifest.There is, of
course, nothing distinctive in these results.The Echinococcus multilocularis, situated in the substance of the
liver, causes the usual disturbances of a new formation in such a
position.Much of the hepatic tissue is destroyed by its growth, and
many of the minor ducts closed.Jaundice is an early symptom--the
first, indeed, in many cases--and is also one of the most persistent.It is present, according to Griesinger, in 10 out of 13 cases.The
usual gastro-intestinal disorders belonging to jaundice occur under
these circumstances; also the nervous disturbances of cholaemia.[218]

[Footnote 218: Davaine, _op.Enlargement of the spleen is a very frequent symptom, being present,
according to Davaine, in 11 out of 13 cases, and, according to Heller,
in 25 out of 29 cases, in which this fact was made the subject of
direct inquiry.Pressure on the vena cava causes oedema of the inferior extremities in
a small number of cases; and on the vena porta, ascites.There may
occur thrombosis of the portal, in which event the ascites will form
very quickly, and return as quickly after tapping.The usually placid course pursued by echinococcus of the liver may be
much modified by inflammation and suppuration.Having occurred, the clinical history
corresponds to other cases of hepatic abscess, and the reader is
therefore referred to the section on that topic for fuller information.DIAGNOSIS.--At the outset of echinococcus of the liver the {1105}
differentiation of the tumor from other tumors, and of the disturbances
produced by it as contrasted with the effects of other morbid growths,
becomes exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.The size,
painlessness, elasticity, the purring tremor of the echinococcus tumor,
afford a sure basis for constructing a diagnosis, and as ultimately
developed they become the means of accurate differentiation from other
morbid growths of that locality.All doubt as to the nature of a given
hydatid tumor of the liver may be set at rest by the use of the
aspirator.The discovery of the characteristic hooklets of the scolex
in the fluid withdrawn from the tumor will be conclusive as to the
presence of echinococci.The hooklets may be absent, as in the case of
acephalocysts, but the fluid is characteristic in other respects: it
contains a large quantity of chloride of sodium and is free from
albumen.Very great difficulty is experienced in diagnosticating an echinococcus
tumor developing from the upper surface of the liver, pushing the
diaphragm and lungs upward and displacing the heart to the left.Whilst
the physical signs may be, and are, usually alike when the condition
calling for diagnosis has existed for some time, there are means of
differentiating in the history of the cases and in the initial
symptoms.The origin and growth of the echinococcus tumor are obscure and free
from constitutional disturbance; the onset of a pleuritic exudation is
marked by pain, fever, and hurried respiration and by physical signs of
a characteristic kind.It is true there are cases of so-called latent
pleurisy in which a hydrothorax forms without any well-marked
indications, but it will usually be found that some local pain, hurried
breathing, or other symptoms existed from the beginning.Those cases of
hydrothorax accompanying renal and cardiac diseases are readily enough
associated with their original cause.Echinococcus of the liver may be confounded with abscess of the liver,
but a differentiation can be readily made by attention to a few
considerations, except in the rare condition of the Echinococcus
multilocularis which has proceeded to suppuration.In this latter
condition there are no means of differentiation, since an
abscess-formation has already occurred, nor is there any need to
attempt a distinction without the occasion of a difference.Echinococcus differs from abscess in history, in the character of the
swelling, and in progress.Abscess of the liver is preceded by
paroxysms of hepatic colic, by inflammatory ulceration of some part of
the intestinal tract, or by local injury--traumatism.The onset of a
hydatid tumor is silent and painless.The swelling of the liver when an
abscess forms is not considerable at any time, and appears to be a
uniform enlargement of the organ, except when the pus tends to make its
way through the walls of the abdomen externally.An enlarging
echinococcus tumor is an obvious projection from the surface of the
liver at some point, and it does not have the characteristic
tenderness, the fluctuation of an abscess matured and ready to
discharge, and the constitutional disturbance; but it does have a
peculiar elasticity, and now and then may present that eminently
characteristic sign, the purring tremor.The use of the
exploring-trocar will usually suffice to clear up all doubts by the
withdrawal of the characteristic fluid of the hydatid cyst or of pus.DURATION AND TERMINATION.--The progress of an echinococcus {1106} tumor
is exceedingly slow, and the development of symptoms produced by its
extension is early or late according to its position and to the nature
of the parts impinged on.A spontaneous cure may take place under the
rather rare circumstances of an opening into the hepatic duct or one of
its principal divisions, and the gradual discharge of the cysts by this
outlet into the intestine.Next to this mode of termination, the most
fortunate direction taken by the enlarging cysts is through the walls
of the abdomen externally.When the growth is upward through the lungs,
the symptoms belonging to empyema or hydrothorax, with pulmonary
abscess, ensue, and the termination is fatal after a protracted course.Rupture into the peritoneal cavity is a fatal event.Ulceration into
the intestine, and the discharge of the cysts through the route thus
made, may effect a cure, but more frequently the fistulous
communication becomes a means of forming a fecal abscess.The result in any case of hydatids of the liver is much influenced by
the mode of treatment adopted and the period at which it is undertaken.As these parasites can be readily reached and destroyed by safe means,
obviously the more early the diagnosis is made and the treatment
carried out, the less the injury done to the hepatic structures and
neighboring parts.TREATMENT.--Prophylactic.--As the intestine of the dog is the natural
habitat of the Taenia echinococcus, and as the hydatid is the first
stage in the development of the ovum and the second in the life-history
of the parasite, the means of prophylaxis consist in preventing
contamination of human food and water with the dog's excrement, which
contains the ova of the parasite.In Iceland, where hydatid disease is
very prevalent, dogs and human beings living in the same huts and
obtaining their water-supply by melting the snow just about them,
contamination of food and drink must readily occur.In this country
such conditions cannot exist; nevertheless, cases of hydatids are not
infrequent.The chief, if not the only, source of contamination is
through the consumption of such uncooked vegetables as lettuce, celery,
cabbage, etc., in the folds of which the ova may be retained, and from
which an ordinary washing does not suffice to detach them.It follows
that such articles of food should be minutely inspected and cleansed
before being placed on the table.Boiling and filtration are the means of removing impurities of this
kind from potable waters.Therapeutical.--The remedial management of cases of Taenia echinococcus
is necessarily restricted to that stage in their development when by
increasing size the functions of organs begin to be affected.Internal
medicines given with the view to arrest the growth of the parasite are
useless.Formerly, such attempts were made and successes were claimed,
but it is now known that no medicine can act on organisms enclosed as
these are in a dense capsule.It is needless to occupy space with
therapeutical details of this kind, but mention may be made of the
agents that were supposed to be effective.Laennec held that baths of a
solution of common salt had a distinct curative effect.The internal
use of iodide of potassium and the local application of iodine paint
were believed to cure a case in St.George's Hospital, London, in the
practice of Mr.Kameela was, in Iceland, supposed to
have a curative effect, but notwithstanding this the physicians of that
island resort to very heroical surgical methods in the treatment of
this affection.{1107} The one means of relief consists in the removal of the vesicles,
either by suitable incisions or by compassing the death of the
parasite, after which the power of nature may be adequate to the cure.In Iceland large incisions are made into the tumor at its most
prominent part, and, although accidents are not uncommon, the results
in many cases are eminently satisfactory.The accidents are shock,
hemorrhage, and especially peritonitis.Under favorable circumstances
now no procedure is more satisfactory in its results than free incision
and drainage.The tumor should be prominent, adherent all round to the
peritoneum, and the walls of the abdomen thin to ensure complete
success without accident.At the present time, so great have been the
advances in abdominal surgery, this operative procedure may be
preferable in some few cases presenting the favoring conditions above
mentioned.Very simple expedients, however, suffice in most cases.This is now much practised in Iceland, and, as the
statistics show, with considerable success.Thus, Hjaltelin[219]
reports 100 cases cured in this way, and in his own hands this
expedient proved successful in 41 out of 50 cases operated on.In
Australia, where hydatid disease is also quite common, simple puncture
has effected a large proportion of cures,[220] and is the method of
treatment usually pursued.In England puncture has the approval of some
of the best authorities.[221]

[Footnote 219: Davaine, _op.[Footnote 220: _The Medical Times and Gazette_, August, 1873, p.[Footnote 221: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_ for 1872:
discussion participated in by Gull, Bryant, Greenhow, etc.]The mode of performing this operation consists in the introduction of
an exploring-trocar into the most prominent part of the tumor.It may
be withdrawn at once or be permitted to remain for a few minutes to
several hours.The dangers are suppuration in the sac and peritonitis;
but the former, although sometimes accompanied by severe constitutional
symptoms, is not likely to endanger life, and even formidable
disturbances due to the latter are usually recovered from.The facts
show that puncture very rarely indeed causes dangerous, especially
fatal, symptoms.An eruption of urticaria has been observed to follow
puncture with the trocar, and also aspiration, in a considerable
proportion of the cases, but it has no special significance.Since the introduction of the aspirateur, puncture and withdrawal of
the fluid by means of this instrument has been practised more
frequently, and this appears to be a more effective procedure, than
simple puncture with an exploring-trocar, although in most cases the
escape of the contained fluids suffices to destroy the parasite.The
aspirateur is less likely to permit the escape of fluid into the
peritoneal cavity or the entrance of air into a vein punctured by
accident.If puncture with the trocar or aspiration be practised, shall
all the fluid be withdrawn at once?The answer to this question may be
decided by the character of the sac.Does it contain daughter and
granddaughter vesicles?If so, one puncture may not permit the escape
of much fluid; but in any event it is the practice of the most
judicious and experienced authorities[222] to withdraw as much as
possible of the contents of the cysts at the first operation.Formerly,
a method practised by some French surgeons consisted in successive
tappings, a small quantity of fluid being drawn off each time.[223]
{1108} There is no good reason for this method of treatment now, and it
seems to have been discontinued.[Footnote 222: _Transactions of the Clinical Society_, _loc.cit._]

[Footnote 223: Davaine, _supra_.]Yet another method of treatment, but less effective than puncture or
aspiration, consists in injecting into the sac, after the removal of
its contained fluid, certain agents toxic to hydatids.A solution of
the extract of fern, alcohol, solution or tincture of iodine, and bile,
are the chief remedies thus employed.It has long been known that bile
is destructive of these parasites, and cases have occurred of
spontaneous cure in which the opening of the growing cysts into a
bile-duct has secured the entrance of bile and consequent arrest of
growth and atrophy of the hydatids.Several successful cases have been
reported in which the injection of aspidium (male fern) was the
effective agent, but the threatening symptoms produced by it, and the
comparative freedom of other methods of treatment from such
disturbances, do not recommend the injections of fern.In the case
reported by Pavy[224] the extract of fern was mixed with a solution of
potassa.[Footnote 224: _Lancet_ (London), July, 1865.]Injections of iodine in solution or in the form of tincture have been
more frequently practised than of any other material.Davaine,[225] who
finds it less successful than simple puncture and aspiration,
recommends, as affording the best results, a dilute aqueous solution of
iodine.Alcohol, a solution of permanganate of potassium, and various
antiseptic agents have been used to some extent, but none of them
possess any advantages over more simple measures.The latest proposal for the treatment of hydatid cysts, and probably
the most effective consistent with entire safety, is electrolysis.Originally suggested by Althaus[226] to those who first employed the
measure on any considerable scale, it had been mentioned thirty years
before by Budd, and appears to have been first practised in Iceland on
a single case.The first elaborate attempt to establish electrolysis on
a sound basis as a regular procedure was made by C. Hilton Fagge and
Mr.[227] They operated on eight cases, and all were
successful.The method consists in the introduction of two needles
connected with the negative pole, and the application of the
positive--a moistened sponge--on the exterior in the neighborhood of
the hepatic region.The strength of current employed by Fagge and
Durham was that furnished by a battery of ten cells, and which by
previous trial was found to decompose a saline solution.The two
electrolytic needles, connected with wires attached to the negative
pole, were introduced into the most prominent part of the tumor about
two inches apart.The current was allowed to pass about ten minutes
usually, sometimes a little longer, the sponge on the exterior--the
positive pole--being shifted occasionally.The tumor may be rendered somewhat more tense and
appear to be enlarged, but more frequently it becomes softer and is
lessened in size, the increase of size being due to the disengagement
of hydrogen gas, and the diminution caused by the escape of more or
less fluid.In one case
no symptom followed, and in this the result was regarded as doubtful,
although a cure was considered probable.In the others more or less
{1109} constitutional disturbance followed, the symptoms being pain and
fever, the temperature ranging between 100 degrees and 103 degrees F.
The duration of the fever was from two to nineteen days, the latter in
one case only.As has been observed in some of the cases treated by
puncture or by aspiration, a rash appeared on the skin--in some
instances scarlatinous, in others of urticaria.It is a curious
circumstance that an eruption of urticaria is reported to have appeared
in one subject in whom a rupture of the sac into the peritoneal cavity
is supposed to have occurred.[Footnote 226: _On the Electrolytic Treatment of Tumors, etc._, London,
1867.][Footnote 227: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, 1871, p.1 _et seq._]

Although so little change in the tumor occurs immediately after the
operation, yet it undergoes slow absorption, and ultimately disappears.The time occupied in the disappearance of the tumor varies from a few
weeks to many months, the difference being due probably to the
situation of the growth, those occupying the substance of the liver
requiring a longer time to fill up.Fagge and Durham report a case in which simple acupuncture was followed
by a result apparently as good as obtained by electrolysis, and other
similar experiences have been published.If the simple introduction of
a needle suffices to arrest the growth of a hydatid cyst and induce its
atrophy, of course the more complex procedures will be abandoned.The tendency of the treatment of hydatid cysts has constantly been
toward simplicity, and the success occurs in a direct ratio thereto.In
forming an estimate of the relative value of the methods of treatment,
the average of mortality of each plan becomes the most important
factor.Simple tapping and paracentesis, the most frequently adopted
mode of treatment, is not without immediate and remote danger.Of 46
cases carefully tabulated by Murchison,[228] there were 3 deaths
properly attributable to the operation; but the after
results--suppuration of the cyst and its consequences, peritonitis,
etc.--cannot be measured so accurately.About two-thirds of the cases
thus treated result in cure, and in a majority of these a single
operation suffices.The injection of the various substances which have
been employed for that purpose does not seem to increase the proportion
of cures, and their use distinctly enhances the dangers of the
treatment.At present, the decision as to the method of treatment to be
employed in any case should be made between simple tapping,
electrolysis, and acupuncture.Of these, the last mentioned, it can
hardly be doubted, is the method which is most desirable, for although
it has not been employed so largely as the others, thus far the results
have been better: the percentage of recoveries without accident has
been higher relatively than by other methods of treatment.As
acupuncture presents no special difficulties or dangers, and is but
little painful, it may be tried first, reserving more formidable
measures for the failures by this simple expedient.[Footnote 228: _Clinical Lectures on Diseases of the Liver_, _loc.cit._]


Distoma hepaticum and Distoma lanceolatum (Liver-Flukes).The Distoma hepaticum, entitled by Linnaeus Fasciola hepatica, occurs
very frequently in herbivorous animals and occasionally in the biliary
{1110} passages of man.[229] It is, however, less important than the
Distoma lanceolatum, which, although much smaller than the former,
occurs in much larger numbers.[Footnote 229: Davaine, _Traite des Entozoaires_, Paris, 1877, p.240
_et seq._; also, Cobbold, _Entozoa_, p.Distoma hepaticum is a leech-like parasite from 25 to 30 mm.in length,
of a brownish color, smooth to the naked eye, but thickly covered with
minute spikes or spines to be seen with a low power, and provided with
a cephalic (entrance to oral cavity) and an abdominal sucking disk,
which are also organs of locomotion.John went back to the bedroom.The Distoma lanceolatum owes its
name to its lancet shape; it is smaller than D. hepaticum, measuring
about 8 mm.in length and half this or less in width; it is unprovided
with spines, but contains two suckers at the side.Both parasites are
hermaphrodite; the ova, according to Cobbold (p.166), have "an average
longitudinal diameter of 1/180, whilst their greatest transversal
measurement is about 1/270."These ova are capable of some movement,
provided as they are with a ciliated envelope.The disease known as the rot in sheep, and a peculiar cachexia entitled
by Davaine la cachexie aqueuse, are caused by the presence of distoma.The ova gain access to man through the use of unwashed cress, lettuce,
and similar vegetables eaten in the raw state, and in drinking-water.The number of reported examples
collected from all sources by the indefatigable Davaine is twelve.[230]

[Footnote 230: _Ibid._, p.253 _et seq._]

The larger distoma passes into the common and hepatic duct and
gall-bladder, whilst the smaller (lanceolatum) enters the finer
ramifications, and, there multiplying, several consequences may ensue.The irritation caused by their presence and development will excite a
more or less severe cholangitis, or, accumulating in sufficient
numbers, an actual obstruction will be induced, and jaundice and
structural alterations of the liver will in turn be brought on.The DIAGNOSIS of such a malady is, in the very nature of the case,
uncertain at best, and in most cases impossible.Nevertheless, it may
be made in rare instances.The existence of the rot may cast suspicion
on the mutton and kitchen vegetables so situated as to suggest the
possibility of contamination with the ova of distoma.Definite and
conclusive information will be afforded by the presence of the ova,
still more of the more or less fully-developed parasite, in the feces
of a patient effected by the symptoms of catarrhal jaundice or
occlusion of the biliary passages.By tapping the gall-bladder
parasites may be withdrawn.The SYMPTOMS are those common to cases of catarrh of the bile-ducts
(cholangitis), catarrhal jaundice, or occlusion of the passages, as may
be.As these have been detailed under their respective heads, it is not
necessary to repeat the observations already made.As regards the TREATMENT, in addition to the methods of management
recommended in such cases it may be stated that the use of certain
parasiticides offers a reasonable prospect of good results.Creasote,
bichloride of mercury, thymol, eucalyptol, oil of wintergreen
(gaultheria), and similar agents are rational remedies and should be
fairly tried.{1111} Parasites in the Portal Vein.The entozoon which by its presence in the blood causes the disease
chyluria also inhabits the portal vein.In some parts of the
world--Brazil more especially--this disease is exceedingly common.It
has occurred also in two or three instances in England, and the writer
has had a case within the past year (1884) in Philadelphia.The
parasites in this case were found in immense numbers in the urine.The blood of the portal vein sometimes is actually filled, and the
liver substance itself is penetrated, by them, but nothing is known of
the alterations they induce in these organs.When cases of haematuria
or chylous urine due to the Filaria sanguinis hominis occur, the
changes are not confined to the urinary organs, but often, doubtless,
involve the liver.There are no signs in the present state of our
knowledge by which the existence of these parasites in the portal vein
and liver can be determined.{1112}

DISEASES OF THE PANCREAS.BY LOUIS STARR, M.D.Until the middle of the seventeenth century the prevalent views upon
the functions and diseases of the pancreas were vague in the extreme.By some the organ was regarded simply as a cushion provided for the
protection of the neighboring blood-vessels and nerves; by others it
was looked upon as the seat of lesion in many very diverse diseases, as
ague, hypochondriasis, melancholia, and so on.In 1642, Wirsung's discovery of an excretory duct demonstrated the fact
that the pancreas was a special organ, and initiated the successful
investigation of the physiology and pathology of the gland.For many
years after this, however, little progress was made, and it is only
comparatively recent investigations that have furnished definite and
reliable information upon the subject.Even now our knowledge of the
clinical and pathological features of diseases of the pancreas is far
behind that of many of the other viscera of the body, the chief reasons
for this being the uncertainty in regard to the physiology of the gland
and the rarity with which its lesions are primary and uncomplicated.ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.--The pancreas is a long, somewhat flattened,
narrow, acinous gland, pinkish-white in color, and of looser texture
than the salivary glands, which it otherwise closely resembles in
structure.It is hammer-shaped, measures from six to eight inches in
length, one and a half inches in breadth, and about three-fourths of an
inch in thickness, and varies in weight from three to five ounces.The
gland is situated in the upper part of the abdominal cavity; the
expanded portion, or head, lies in the concavity of the duodenum;
thence it extends transversely across the epigastric and both
hypochondriac regions on a level with the first lumbar vertebra and in
contact with the posterior abdominal wall.As it passes toward the left
it gradually decreases in size, and the narrowest part, or tail, rests
against the spleen.Behind the organ are the crura of the diaphragm,
the aorta, the inferior cava, the superior mesenteric vessels, and the
solar plexus; in front of it, the stomach and the left lobe of the
liver.Its anterior surface alone is invested with peritoneum, being
covered by the posterior layer of the lesser omentum.The ascending
portion of the head is intimately connected with the duodenum by dense
connective tissue, and at times the descending portion, by extending
backward and outward, forms an almost complete ring around the gut; the
body is loosely attached by connective tissue to the posterior
abdominal wall, and the {1113} left extremity and tail are joined to
the left kidney and suprarenal capsule and to the spleen by loose
areolar tissue.The gland is supplied with arterial blood by branches
springing from the pancreatico-duodenal and splenic vessels; its veins
join the splenic and superior mesenteric veins; its lymphatics
communicate with the lumbar glands; and its nerves are branches from
the solar plexus.The principal excretory duct, the canal of Wirsung,
has at its widest part the calibre of a goose-quill.It begins by the
union of five small branches at the tail, and extends transversely
through the substance of the gland from left to right, nearer the lower
than the upper border, and the anterior than the posterior surface; it
is joined throughout its course by numerous small branches from the
acini, which enter it at acute angles.In the head the duct curves
slightly downward, and as a rule opens with the ductus choledochus into
the ampulla of Vater in the second portion of the duodenum; sometimes,
however, it has a separate opening into the intestine.A second,
smaller, duct runs from the ascending portion of the head, and usually
joins the main duct, but may also open independently.The acini of the gland are from.045 mm.in diameter, and
are composed of a very thin membrane lined with pavement cells.The
thin walls of the excretory ducts are formed of connective tissue and
elastic fibres, and are lined by a single layer of small cylindrical
epithelial cells.The terminal extremities of the ducts form a complete
network around the glandular cells, resembling the intralobular biliary
canaliculi.The acini are imbedded in a mass of adipose tissue which
contains the vessels and nerves.The topographical relation of the head of the pancreas to the ductus
choledochus is of clinical importance.As a rule (fifteen times in
twenty-two, Wyss), the bile-duct descends near the head, toward the
duodenum; frequently it runs through this part of the organ, being
either partially or entirely surrounded by the gland substance.Now,
when the bile-duct merely passes over the pancreas, any enlargement,
unless excessive, would simply push it aside, but when it passes
through the head, a comparatively slight amount of disease is
sufficient to close it entirely and cause jaundice.It is only since the observations of Bernard in 1848 that the
prominence of the pancreatic juice as a digestive fluid has been
recognized.It fulfils several important purposes: in the first place,
it emulsifies the fatty articles of food; secondly, it converts starch
and cane-sugar into glucose; and, finally, it supplements the action of
the gastric juice upon nitrogenous materials and completes their
digestion.Daniel went to the bathroom.Each of these changes is probably brought about through the
agency of a special ferment (Danilewsky).The pancreatic juice is not
secreted continuously.According to the observations of Bernstein,
there are two separate secretory flows following each ingestion of
food--one occurring shortly after the food enters the stomach; the
other a few hours later, corresponding in time to the passage of the
food from the stomach into the intestine, the latter being followed by
a period of rest until the next meal.Both the condition of nausea and
the act of vomiting arrest the secretion.When the vagus is divided and
the central extremity of the cut nerve is irritated, the secretion is
also arrested, and remains checked {1114} for a long time.The arrest
in each instance is attributed to reflex action of the spinal cord and
sympathetic nerve.At the same time, irritation of the mucous membrane
of the stomach caused by the presence of food increases the flow of
pancreatic juice, and so too does simple section of the nerves which
accompany the arteries.It would seem, therefore, that the gland is
under the influence of two sets of nerves from the vagus--one
inhibiting, the other exciting, its secretion.GENERAL ETIOLOGY.--Pancreatic disease occurs more frequently in men
than in women.No period of life is exempt from it, but it is most
commonly met with in the aged.The predisposing causes are
constitutional syphilis, pregnancy, and hereditary tendency.Among the
apparent exciting causes may be mentioned the habitual over-use of
alcoholic drinks, gluttony, the excessive use of tobacco, suppression
of the menstrual flux, the abuse of purgatives, excessive and prolonged
mercurial medication, and mechanical injuries, either prolonged
pressure or blows upon the epigastrium.As a secondary affection,
disease of the pancreas is associated with chronic diseases of the
heart, lungs, liver, alimentary canal, and abdominal glands, and the
organ may be the seat of metastatic abscesses and tumors.GENERAL SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The objective symptoms are--rapid and extreme
emaciation of the entire body; sialorrhoea; obstinate diarrhoea with
viscid stools; fatty stools; lipuria; and the presence of masses of
undigested striped muscular fibres in the stools.The well-established fat-absorbing and peptonizing properties of the
pancreatic juice furnish a ready explanation of the wasting of the body
which occurs when this secretion is arrested, diminished in quantity,
or altered in quality by disease.Emaciation is not a constant symptom
of pancreatic disease.A number of cases are mentioned by Abercrombie,
Claessen, and Schiff in which, notwithstanding disease of the gland and
complete closure of the duct, revealed by post-mortem examination, the
patients during life were not only well nourished, but even moderately
corpulent.In such instances it is probable that the digestive
functions of the absent pancreatic juice are more or less adequately
performed by the bile and succus entericus.When present, emaciation is
an early symptom; it is at the same time progressive, and is usually
very intense in degree, being most marked in those cases where there is
associated hepatic disease or obstruction to the passage of bile into
the intestine, where the disease of the pancreas interferes
mechanically with the processes of nutrition by pressing upon the
pyloric extremity of the stomach or upon the duodenum, and when the
organ is the seat of carcinomatous growths.In the last-named
condition, in addition to the perversion or arrest of the secretion,
the loss of flesh is attributable to the general causes of malnutrition
attendant upon carcinoma wherever situated.Sialorrhoea, or an excessive secretion from the salivary glands, is
noticeable as a symptom of disease of the pancreas only when there is
an associated lesion of the stomach, either of a catarrhal or cancerous
nature.Under these circumstances a quantity--six or eight
fluidounces--of a colorless, slightly opalescent, and adhesive and
alkaline fluid may be expelled from the mouth at once as an early
morning pyrosis; or by frequent and repeated acts of expectoration,
following a sudden filling of the mouth with fluid, a large bulk of
thin saliva may be expelled {1115} during the day.This hypersecretion
must not be looked upon as any indication of an especial sympathy
existing between the salivary glands and the pancreas, neither can it
be regarded as a pancreatic flux with a regurgitation of the fluid from
the duodenum into the stomach and thence through the oesophagus into
the mouth, since during the nausea that must always attend the passage
of the intestinal contents into the stomach the pancreatic secretion is
arrested, and since the liquid contains salivary, and not pancreatic,
elements.The diarrhoea pancreatica is the least constant of all the objective
symptoms; in fact, constipation is present in many pancreatic
affections, notably carcinoma.The fecal evacuations in this condition
are frequent, thin, viscid, and contain an abundance of leucin.Under
the microscope the leucin appears either in the form of concentrically
sheathed globules, or as small crystalline rods and scales collected
together in the form of wheels or aggregated in clusters.This form of
diarrhoea may be attributed to a hypersecretion from the pancreas.That the presence of fat in the stools is an important diagnostic
symptom of pancreatic disease is proved both by clinical and
experimental observations.The characters of these stools vary
considerably.The fat may appear mixed with the feces in small lumps,
ranging in size from a pea to a hazelnut, yellowish-white in color,
soluble in aether, and easily melted and burned.Again, after the
evacuation has become cool fat may be seen covering the fecal masses,
collected into a thick cake around the edges of the containing vessel,
or, when the feces are liquid, floating as free oil on the surface.Finally, the fat may be in a crystalline form, the crystals being
needle-shaped and aggregated into sheaves and tufts.It may be present only in small quantities, or may
even be entirely absent from the evacuations in those cases in which
the secretion from the pancreas is simply diminished, and the amount is
greatest in those instances where there is a simultaneous arrest of the
pancreatic and hepatic secretions.It must be remembered, too, that
even in health the stools may contain fat; this occurs when an excess
of oleaginous food is consumed and after the administration of castor
oil or cod-liver oil.These conditions must be eliminated, therefore,
in estimating the value of fatty stools as a diagnostic symptom; if,
then, at the same time, coincident disease of the liver can be
excluded, the symptom becomes almost pathognomonic.The appearance of
fat in the stools may be due not only to an arrest of the pancreatic
secretion, but also to pressure upon the large lymphatic trunks,
interfering with the circulation of the chyle and checking the
absorption of fat from the intestine.Usually, the amount of fat expelled is in direct proportion to the
quantity consumed, but occasionally the former greatly exceeds the
latter.In such cases there must be some other source for the evacuated
fat than the food; and it is probable that fat from the adipose tissue
passes into the blood, and thence through the mesenteric vessels into
the intestine.This theory would likewise account in part for the rapid
and extreme wasting, and for another less frequently observed
symptom--namely, lipuria.A case is recorded by Clark of medullary
cancer of the pancreas with nutmeg liver, and another by Bowditch of
cancer of the pancreas and liver in which lipuria was noted.The fat
was observed, after the urine had cooled, floating about on the surface
in masses or globules; differing, {1116} therefore, from chyluria, for
in this condition the fat is present in the form of an emulsion, and
gives the urine either a uniform milk-like appearance, or, after it has
been allowed to stand, rests upon the surface in a creamy layer.When the pancreatic secretion is arrested, most of the animal food
which has escaped gastric digestion will pass unchanged through the
intestine and give rise to another characteristic condition of the
evacuations--namely, the presence in the feces of undigested striped
muscular fibres.The amount of these fibres, and indeed their
appearance at all in any given case, will depend directly upon the
nature of the food consumed.SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS.--The subjective symptoms of disease of the
pancreas are abnormal sensations in the epigastrium, and pain.The abnormal sensations in the epigastrium are weight and pressure,
attended at times by praecordial oppression and discomfort.The feeling
of weight is usually deep-seated, may be intermittent or constant, and
is generally increased or developed by pressure.It is often influenced
by position, the assumption of the erect posture or turning from side
to side giving rise to a stretching or dragging sensation, as if a
heavy body were falling downward or moving about in the upper abdomen.The pain may be due either to an inflammation of the peritoneum
covering the gland or to pressure upon the solar plexus, and
consequently varies in character.When it depends upon localized
peritonitis, it is constant, circumscribed, and deeply seated in the
epigastrium at a point midway between the tip of the ensiform cartilage
and the umbilicus; it is rather acute, and is greatly augmented by
pressure.The second variety occurs in paroxysms, and is neuralgic in
character, the sharp, excessively severe lancinating pains extending
from the epigastrium through to the back, upward into the thorax, and
downward into the abdomen.These paroxysms--in reality attacks of
coeliac neuralgia--are attended by great anxiety, restlessness, and
oppression and a tendency to syncope.That calculi in the duct of
Wirsung, tightly grasped at the position of arrest, may give rise to
paroxysms of pain analogous to biliary colic, cannot be doubted, though
there are no positive facts in support of this view.PRESSURE SYMPTOMS.--When the pancreas becomes enlarged it encroaches
upon the neighboring blood-vessels and viscera, interferes with their
functions, and thus produces prominent symptoms.The ductus choledochus from its close relation to the head of the gland
is especially liable to become obstructed, with the consequent
production of chronic jaundice and the general effects of the absence
of bile from the intestinal canal.Pressure upon the portal vein gives
rise to enlargement of the spleen; on the inferior cava, to oedema of
the feet and legs; and on the aorta, occasionally, to aneurismal
dilatation of the vessel above the point of obstruction and to
subsequent alteration in the size of the heart.By encroaching on the
stomach an enlarged pancreas may cause either displacement of the
viscus or stenosis at its pyloric extremity, attended with occasional
vomiting of large quantities of grumous, fermenting liquid, pain,
constipation, general failure of health, and the distinctive physical
signs of dilatation of the stomach.The duodenum may also be pressed
upon and more or less occluded, and pain and vomiting occur several
hours after food is taken.Occasionally hydronephrosis is {1117}
produced, the accumulation being usually in the right kidney and due to
obstruction of the corresponding ureter.A sufficient number of cases have been collected to show that there is
an intimate connection between disease of the pancreas and diabetes
mellitus.One or other condition may take the precedence, melituria
occurring during the progress of pancreatic disease, demonstrating the
onset of diabetes, and the appearance of fatty stools in diabetes a
secondary involvement of the pancreas.Various theories have been
advanced to account for this association, but the true explanation
seems to be based upon the experiments of Munk and Klebs.By
experimenting upon dogs these observers found that extirpation of the
solar plexus produced either permanent or temporary diabetes, whereas
section of the hepatic and splanchnic nerves, removal of the pancreas,
or ligature of the duct of Wirsung was without effect.From the
intimate anatomical relation of the pancreas to the solar plexus it is
easy to understand how disease of the gland may give rise to
alterations in the nerve-structure, either by direct pressure or by the
extension of inflammation along the nerve-fibres connecting the gland
with the ganglia; and these alterations in time produce diabetes.In
the instances in which diabetes is the primary affection the condition
of the pancreas, as proved by post-mortem section, is usually one of
simple or fatty atrophy; and it may be assumed that a lesion of the
solar plexus is the cause of both diseases, the changes in the pancreas
being produced in a similar way to the atrophy of the submaxillary
gland after section of the vaso-motor nerves in Bernard's experiments.The same nerve-lesion may give rise to bronzing of the skin, and two
cases are recorded in which disease of the pancreas (cheesy
infiltration, cancer) was attended by this symptom.PHYSICAL SIGNS.--To make a successful exploration of the pancreas the
stomach and colon should be as far as possible empty, and the patient
placed in a position, with the head and shoulders slightly elevated and
the thighs drawn up toward the belly, to relax the abdominal muscles;
or if necessary this relaxation must be brought about by the
administration of aether.The knee-elbow position is often preferable
to the dorsal position in practising palpation.The condition of the gland giving rise to physical signs is one of
enlargement, affecting chiefly and primarily its head, and due
generally to the presence of some morbid growth.Inspection reveals either a diffuse bulging of the upper third of the
abdomen to the right of the median line, or a well-defined tumor
situated beneath the right costal border, about the line of junction of
the right hypochondriac and epigastric regions.Often the pancreatic
tumor does not come in direct contact with the abdominal wall, but
presses against and thrusts forward the left lobe of the liver,
producing simply a prominence in the epigastrium.In the first
condition palpation elicits an ill-defined sense of resistance; in the
second, the fingers readily outline a tumor, which is slightly movable,
rounded in shape, firm or fluctuating, with a smooth or nodulated
surface, usually tender to the touch, and often giving a false impulse
transmitted from the aorta lying beneath; and in the third, the smooth
surface and the sharp edge of the left lobe of the liver are easily
distinguishable.{1118} Percussion over a pancreatic tumor is commonly dully-tympanitic,
absolute flatness occurring only when it is very large and comes
directly in contact with the abdominal wall, pushing aside the stomach
and intestines.On auscultation a blowing murmur may, in some instances, be heard over
the tumor.These murmurs are due to pressure upon the aorta, and must
be distinguished from the sound produced in aneurism of this vessel.The various complications of pancreatic disease, such as dilatation of
the stomach, ascites, and secondary lesions of the liver, greatly
modify the physical signs, and sometimes entirely prevent an
exploration of the gland.INFLAMMATORY AFFECTIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Acute Idiopathic Pancreatitis.It occurs most frequently in males during and
after adult life, and the strumous diathesis appears to predispose to
it.Intemperance, the suppression of normal or morbid discharges, and
traumatism act as exciting causes.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The pathological changes may be divided into
two stages.In the first the gland is deep red in color, intensely
injected with blood, greatly increased in consistence, enlarged to the
extent of two or three times its normal size, and when an incision is
made the divided lobules feel firm and crisp.The interlobular tissue
is sometimes dotted with bloody points, and the same hemorrhagic
changes may occur in the connective tissue surrounding the gland.In
this stage resolution may occur or the inflammation may pass into
suppuration.At the beginning of the second, or suppurative, stage
numerous minute collections of pus are seen scattered throughout the
gland in the interacinous tissue; these gradually collect into a single
large abscess, and at times the whole gland is converted into a mere
pus-sac, the capsule being much thickened.In other instances the
formation of pus is entirely peripancreatic.The pus is usually
inodorous and creamy, but is sometimes grayish-white or greenish in
color; it then has a faint disagreeable odor, and occasionally is very
fetid.When mixed with pancreatic juice it becomes clear and yellowish
in color, and contains numerous minute curd-like masses.In the first stage secondary peritonitis may arise from a simple
extension of the inflammatory process, and bands of lymph are formed,
gluing the pancreas to the neighboring organs.In the second, fatal
acute peritonitis may result from the bursting of an abscess into the
peritoneal cavity.These abscesses also occasionally open into the
duodenum or stomach.Gangrene and peripancreatic sloughing occur very
exceptionally, and are probably due to extensive hemorrhagic changes.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The disease may be preceded for an indefinite
period by symptoms of impaired gastric or intestinal digestion, but its
onset is usually sudden.The attack begins with colic or continuous
{1119} deep-seated pain, starting in the epigastrium and extending
toward the right shoulder or the back, and quickly becoming very
intense.The pain is attended by pallor of the face, great
restlessness, praecordial anxiety, dyspnoea, and faintness.The tongue
is furred or dry and red; thirst is increased; the appetite is lost;
there are frequent eructations, nausea, and constant vomiting of a
clear, greenish, viscid fluid; the vomiting produces no sense of
relief, and even increases the epigastric pain.The bowels are
obstinately constipated.The epigastric region is tense, tumid, and
excessively tender, so that it is usually impossible to elicit the
physical signs of enlargement of the gland.There is moderate pyrexia,
with evening exacerbations, and the pulse is increased in frequency.These symptoms progressively increase in severity, and reach their
maximum intensity in from three to five days.The pulse then becomes
small, compressible, and irregular, the extremities cold, the face
hippocratic, and death takes place in a state of collapse.The fatal
termination is preceded by the symptoms of acute peritonitis in the
cases which are complicated by an extension of inflammation or the
rupture of an abscess into the peritoneal cavity.Recovery is quite possible in the early stage of the disease.On the
other hand, the course may be greatly protracted by a change in the
type of the inflammation, resulting in induration and enlargement of
the gland or in the formation of chronic abscesses.Again, when
peritonitis from extension has been confined solely to the portion of
the peritoneum that covers the gland, and has resulted in the formation
of fibrinous bands binding the pancreas to the adjacent viscera, the
symptoms of pancreatitis will on subsiding give place to those of
obstruction of the stomach, duodenum, or bile-duct.DIAGNOSIS.--The diseases most likely to be confounded with acute
pancreatitis are biliary colic and the catarrhal form of acute
gastritis.From biliary colic it is distinguished by the absence of rigors,
jaundice, enlargement of the liver, and a tender pyriform tumor
corresponding in situation to the gall-bladder and due to its
distension with accumulated bile.The pain in both affections is sudden
in its onset, and very similar in character and distribution; but when
caused by the passage of a gall-stone it usually begins either after a
heavy meal or after some severe muscular exertion or shaking of the
body--circumstances inoperative in the production of the pain of
pancreatitis.The pain, too, in the former condition is less severe at
first, increases gradually in severity, is more paroxysmal, is at the
outset lessened by pressure, and is often temporarily relieved by the
act of vomiting.The attacks at the same time are rarely isolated, and
all doubt is removed when the pain ceases suddenly and a calculus is
discovered in the feces.Acute gastric catarrh is almost always traceable to the ingestion of
some irritant substance, usually alcohol or food of bad quality.This
history, together with the liability of the attack to occur during the
course of chronic dyspepsia, the comparatively trifling severity of the
pain, the headache, the irregularity of the bowels, the condition of
the urine, which is either high- or deposits lithates
abundantly, and the tendency of the affection to become chronic, are
the points of distinction between this and the pancreatic disease.{1120} Acute inflammation of the stomach, or gastritis proper,
resulting from corrosive poisons, presents a train of symptoms entirely
different from those of acute pancreatitis.TREATMENT.--Absolute rest is essential.The diet should consist of milk
guarded by lime-water and of meat-broths, this food being administered
in small quantities--one to two or three fluidounces of the milk and
lime-water or half as much broth--at proper intervals.In the early
stage an effort must be made to reduce the inflammation by the
application of ice to the epigastrium or of leeches to the same region,
or preferably to the anus.The excessive pain demands the free use of
opium.The nausea and vomiting may be relieved to some extent by
directing the patient to swallow small lumps of ice, and by the
employment of iced carbonic-acid water and the effervescing draught;
and the tendency to constipation may be overcome by enemata.Later in
the course of the disease, if the epigastric tenderness permits of it,
light linseed poultices should be placed over the upper abdomen.During
the stage of collapse alcoholic stimulants and the application of heat
to the extremities are necessary.The occurrence of acute peritonitis
or other complications and sequelae demand appropriate treatment.In this condition the pancreas may be the seat of either acute
parenchymatous inflammation or of metastatic abscesses.Acute parenchymatous degeneration of the muscles, kidneys, liver, and
so on is recognized as a frequent lesion in the acute infectious
diseases, particularly typhoid fever; and it is under these
circumstances, and in association always with similar changes in some
of the organs mentioned, that parenchymatous degeneration of the
pancreas takes place.Metastatic suppurative inflammation is very rare: it has been observed
in cases of disease of the testicles after the operation of extirpation
of these organs, and occasionally in puerperal peritonitis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--In parenchymatous inflammation the gland at
first is hardened, swollen, and reddened, and on section presents a
reddish-gray surface, with indistinctness of the glandular structure,
due to the amount of swelling of the acini.Under the microscope the
gland-cells are found to be enlarged; they contain several nuclei,
their protoplasm is infiltrated with fatty granules, obscuring the
nuclei to a certain extent, and their outline is well defined.These
alterations are most marked in the head of the gland.After a time the
hypertrophy of the cells, by pressing upon the blood-vessels, produces
an anaemic condition and the organ becomes pale; in the advanced stages
softening occurs.Metastatic suppurative inflammation leads to the formation of a single
large abscess or to multiple minute purulent collections.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Parenchymatous degeneration gives rise to no
distinctive symptoms.Its occurrence in typhoid fever or other
infectious disease may be suspected when after prolonged hyperpyrexia
there are enlargement of the liver and spleen and albuminuria.The
appearance of jaundice (from pressure) increases the probability of
involvement of the pancreas in the general gland-change.{1121} The development of rigors, alternating with flushing, during the
course of one of the lesions liable to be attended with metastatic
abscesses in the pancreas might suggest the formation of pus in the
gland, but an absolute diagnosis is impossible.Several cases are on record pointing to the possibility of a metastasis
of mumps from the parotid gland to the pancreas.In these the
disappearance of the parotiditis was followed by symptoms resembling
those of idiopathic pancreatitis--namely, thirst, fever, loss of
appetite, anxiety, and burning in the epigastrium, with deep-seated
pain extending toward the right side; in addition there was diarrhoea,
with numerous, yellowish, watery stools.In one case that resulted
fatally the secondary diarrhoea suddenly ceased and the parotid
swelling reappeared.At the autopsy the pancreas was found to be
swollen, reddened, engorged with blood, and indurated.Such a
metastasis, however, must be very infrequent, and more extended
observations are necessary to establish its course and clinical
features.The first form of acute secondary pancreatitis may be a comparatively
unimportant complication of the acute infectious diseases, or, together
with the parenchymatous degeneration of other organs, may form a
distinct element in the fatal issue of these diseases.Metastatic abscesses are prone to be followed by ulceration and the
formation of fistulous communications with the neighboring viscera.TREATMENT.--The management of secondary inflammation of the pancreas is
regulated solely by the indications derived from the originating
disease.Inflammation of the connective tissue of the gland usually occurs after
adult life, and depends upon a variety of causes.The secondary form, due to long-continued venous engorgement resulting
from lesions of the cardiac valves and from chronic disease of the
lungs or liver, is the most frequently observed.Other causes are closure of the duct of Wirsung, the retained secretion
producing pressure upon the glandular tissue; the extension of
inflammation from adjacent organs, as the bile-duct when there is an
impacted gall-stone, or the stomach and duodenum, especially in cancer
and perforating ulcer, where the floor of the ulcer is formed by the
pancreas; the pressure of tumors, as aneurisms of the abdominal aorta
and coeliac axis; chronic alcoholism; and syphilis.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--The lesion may be limited to the head or to
isolated portions of the gland, or be uniformly distributed.The
general changes are a hyperplasia of the interacinous connective
tissue, with subsequent contraction and atrophy, or, in extreme
instances, entire destruction of the glandular elements proper, the
organ becoming granular and firmer and tougher than normal.A section
shows a pale surface, studded at intervals with white spots, from which
little cheese-like and fatty masses may be squeezed, and, when there
has been intense hyperaemia, with minute collections of reddish pigment
and small hemorrhagic cysts, indicating previous interstitial
hemorrhages.{1122} When the contraction causes closure of the small excretory ducts
or of the duct of Wirsung itself, the section shows secondary cysts and
beaded canals.In exceptional instances of acquired syphilis the pancreas is the seat
of gummata or sclerosis, but in congenital syphilis hyperplasia of the
glandular connective tissue frequently occurs, being usually associated
with specific lesions of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and general
glandular system.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--As chronic pancreatitis rarely attains a
sufficient degree of development to interfere seriously with the
function of the organ, the disease is usually latent, or masked by the
symptoms of the originating lesion in secondary hyperplasia, or by the
associated diseases of the abdominal viscera in alcoholism and acquired
syphilis.When due to hereditary syphilis, the foetus is stillborn or death takes
place soon after birth, and there are no characteristic symptoms.Occasionally, however, especially when it depends upon a complete
obstruction of the duct of Wirsung, a diagnosis may be made from the
presence of emaciation, fatty stools, and melituria, with epigastric
pain of a neuralgic character, and the discovery of a deep-seated,
dense tumor extending transversely across the epigastrium.The duration is indefinite, and varies greatly with the cause.While a
return to the healthy condition is possible during the early stage of
the lesion, the usual course is similar to that of chronic interstitial
inflammation in other organs.TREATMENT.--The management, when a diagnosis can be made, must be
guided mainly by the etiological indications.The restoration of the
functions of the heart, lungs, or liver when these organs are at fault,
the abstinence from alcohol in the drunkard, and an energetic use of
mercurials or iodide of potassium in syphilis, are of the first
importance in arresting the disease.A persistent course of mild
purgatives and of cathartic mineral waters is serviceable.Pain should
be relieved by belladonna or opium.The diet must be simple and
digestible, and if an arrest of the pancreatic secretion be indicated
by the appearance of fat in the stools, an effort should be made to
supply the deficiency.For this purpose pancreatin, prepared by
precipitation by alcohol from a watery extract of a calf's or pig's
pancreas, may be used.[1] The pancreatin may be given in doses of from
five to fifteen grains, in the form of a pill or in capsules, and at an
interval of two hours after food is taken, or the same quantity of
pancreatin may be added to the food a few moments before it is eaten.Probably the best substitute is a watery infusion of the gland
containing all its soluble principles.To prepare an active infusion
the pancreas must be taken from the animal during the act of digestion.It is then freed from its surrounding fat, and macerated for two hours
in four times its weight of water at a temperature ranging between 25
degrees and 30 degrees C.(58.3 degrees and 61.1 degrees F.).Another
plan is to beat a calf's pancreas in a mortar with six fluidounces of
water until a milk-like fluid is obtained, and strain.One-third of the
infusion obtained by either method is administered after each meal, an
entire pancreas being thus used every twenty-four hours.[Footnote 1: One gramme of pancreatin is sufficient to emulsify fifteen
grammes of fatty substances, to convert eight grammes of starch into
glucose, to digest fifty grammes of fibrin, twenty grammes of
syntonine, and thirty-three grammes of boiled albumen (Raymond).]{1123} The extractum pancreatis,[2] as it is now furnished to the
profession, is a very useful preparation.It may be employed to
peptonize milk, milk-gruel, and broth, or be given in combination with
bicarbonate of sodium at a fixed interval after each meal, as in the
following formula:

  Rx.pancreatis,    drachm j;
      Sodii bicarbonatis, drachm ij;
  M. et.S. One powder to be taken two hours after each meal.[Footnote 2: That prepared by Fairchild Brothers & Foster of New York
has proved the best in my hands.]Peptonized milk is prepared by putting into a clean quart bottle 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium, and
a gill of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place
the bottle in water not so hot but that the whole hand can be held in
it without discomfort for a minute, and keep the bottle there for
exactly thirty minutes.At the end of that time put the bottle on ice
to check further digestion and keep the milk from spoiling.Peptonized milk-gruel is made of equal parts of any farinaceous gruel
and fresh cold milk.To a pint of this combination 5 grains of
extractum pancreatis and 15 grains of bicarbonate of sodium are added,
and the whole allowed to stand in a warm place for thirty minutes, when
the process of digestion must be arrested by placing on ice.Peptonized broth is made in the following way: Take one-fourth of a
pound of finely-minced raw lean beef or mutton or chicken, and one-half
pint of cold water; cook over a slow fire, stirring constantly, until
it has boiled a few minutes.Then pour off the liquor, beat the meat to
a paste, and put both into a bottle with a half pint of cold water.Add
30 grains of extractum pancreatis and 20 grains of bicarbonate of
sodium; shake well, and set in a warm place (110-115 degrees) for three
hours, shaking occasionally; then boil quickly.Finally, strain or
clarify in the usual way and season to taste.MORBID GROWTHS OF THE PANCREAS.Cancer is probably the most common of the chronic affections of the
pancreas.It is usually secondary, being due to an extension of
carcinoma of the stomach, duodenum, liver, or abdominal lymphatic
glands, but there are enough cases on record to show that it may be
primary.It has been discovered in the foetus at birth, but the vast
majority of cases occur after the age of forty.Nothing is known as to the influence of inherited
tendency in the production of the disease, and as little of the
exciting causes, though some authors attach much importance to
prolonged pressure upon the epigastrium and to blows and contusions on
the upper part of the abdomen.ANATOMICAL APPEARANCES.--Primary carcinoma may be either {1124}
scirrhous, encephaloid, or colloid, the first being the variety most
frequently observed.The lesion begins in the head of the gland in the form of several small
nodules which gradually coalesce.Sometimes the whole gland becomes
involved in the new formation; again, isolated nodules may be scattered
throughout its substance, and exceptionally the growth is limited to
the tail or middle portion.When the head alone is involved, the
remainder of the gland either remains healthy, undergoes fatty
degeneration, or becomes indurated.The tumor is rounded in outline and
nodular, and varies in size, density, and color according to the form
of carcinoma present.The duct of Wirsung is ordinarily obstructed,
large retention cysts, containing a yellowish-red liquid, are formed,
and the changes already described under the head of Chronic
Interstitial Pancreatitis take place in those portions of the gland
which are free from carcinoma.The disease is very prone to extend to
the surrounding organs, particularly the neighboring lymphatic glands,
the duodenum, and the liver, rarely to the stomach.When the contiguous
organs are not directly implicated in the carcinomatous changes, they
are subjected to pressure by the tumor, and in the case of the stomach
and duodenum adhesions often form, and are followed by perforation.There seems to be a tendency also to infiltration of the adjacent
subperitoneal connective tissue and to hyperplasia of the fibrous
tissue of the viscera, even when they are not secondarily involved in
the morbid growth, leading to narrowing of the aorta, thickening of the
walls of the stomach and duodenum, and a sclerosis of the liver.Obstruction of the common bile-duct, with dilatation of the
gall-bladder from retention of bile, is a frequent result of the
disease.Secondary carcinoma of the pancreas usually first appears in, and is
limited to, the head of the gland.It seldom occurs in isolated
nodules, but the growth is generally continuous with the primary
cancerous mass.The form is either scirrhous or encephaloid.Wagner
records a case of cylindrical-celled epithelioma following a simple
epithelioma of the mucous membrane of the duodenum; and a similar
instance has come under the author's own observation;[3] but this
variety of morbid growth is rare.The primary growth is almost
uniformly situated in the stomach, duodenum, liver, or gall-bladder,
though occasionally it may be seated in some distant organ; in such
cases the pancreatic tumor appears as an isolated nodular mass.[Footnote 3: _Transactions of the Pathological Society of
Philadelphia_, vol.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The symptoms may be divided into two
classes--namely, first, those which arise from the lesion of the gland
itself; and, secondly, those which depend upon the effect of this
lesion on the neighboring viscera.The features belonging to the first class are general marasmus, pain,
the appearance of fat and perhaps undigested muscular fibres in the
fecal evacuations and of fat in the urine, and the physical signs of an
abdominal tumor.Loss of flesh is one of the earliest symptoms: it is generally
progressive, and is at times so great that the spine can be distinctly
traced through the abdominal walls.Together with this emaciation there
is debility, often extreme, but sometimes not so marked as might be
expected from the degree of wasting.The skin is commonly pale and dry,
and before jaundice is {1125} developed has the ordinary sallow hue of
cancerous cachexia.The features are pinched, and the face wears an
expression of anxiety and suffering.In cases uncomplicated by
peritoneal inflammation the temperature remains about normal, or it may
be lowered as the general exhaustion increases.The pulse is feeble and
slightly increased in frequency.Pain is the most uniformly present and the earliest symptom.It is
always situated deep in the epigastrium, and from thence extends to the
back, to the right or left side, downward to the umbilicus or lower
part of the abdomen, and upward into the chest.It is generally
continuous, but is subject to remissions and paroxysmal exacerbations.During the remissions sensations of distress, of burning, or of dull
pain are experienced at the pit of the stomach; during the
exacerbations, which may last several days, the pain becomes extremely
acute and lancinating and extended in distribution.The ingestion of
food and pressure upon the epigastrium have no constant effect upon the
pain.Quick movements of the body from side to side often increase it
and excite exacerbations.The suffering is greatest in the erect
posture, and on this account the patient bends his body forward so as
to relax the abdominal muscles.The paroxysmal and neuralgic character
of the pain indicates implication of the coeliac plexus.The appearance of fat in the stools is an important symptom, unless
there be at the same time an obstruction to the passage of bile into
the duodenum, indicated by jaundice.Lipuria has been noticed in a few
cases only.In many instances (nearly one-half of the number of recorded cases)
physical exploration reveals the signs of enlargement of the organ.At
times there is merely a sense of fulness and resistance to the touch,
and a modified tympanitic percussion note in one of the three regions
of the upper segment of the abdomen.But usually when a tumor is
present it is readily mapped out by palpation.The tumor is seated in
the epigastrium, and may extend into the right or left hypochondrium or
downward into the umbilical region.It varies much in size, is rounded,
nodulated, firm, slightly movable or fixed, and tender, though
sometimes painless, to the touch.Percussion yields dulness or a
dull-tympanitic sound.On auscultation a blowing murmur may be heard
when the tumor presses upon the aorta; and when this murmur is present
there is usually also transmitted pulsation.The symptoms belonging to the second class arise when the adjacent
viscera become involved in the cancerous disease, or when their
functional activity is disturbed by the encroachment and pressure of
the enlarged pancreas.From the association of a catarrhal condition of the mucous membrane of
the stomach, particularly when the pyloric orifice is obstructed,
several prominent symptoms of gastric catarrh are frequently
observed--namely, sialorrhoea, pyrosis, acid eructations, flatulence,
abnormal sensations, such as burning, weight and oppression in the
epigastrium after taking food, and increased thirst.The tongue varies
in appearance: it may be dry and covered with a brown or yellow fur,
but when the flow of saliva is increased it is peculiarly clean and
moist; and this condition is rather characteristic.The appetite is
also variable; sometimes it remains good {1126} until the end, and
occasionally it is perverted.Hiccough in some cases is an obstinate
and annoying symptom.Nausea and vomiting are late but moderately constant features.Their
relation to the ingestion of food is not fixed.The vomited matter may
consist of food, of glairy mucus more or less tinged with bile, of
colorless liquid, or of a fluid resembling a mixture of bran and water.If there is marked pyloric obstruction with dilatation of the stomach,
large quantities of frothy and fermenting material containing sarcina
ventriculi are rejected at intervals.In the rare cases in which
secondary sarcoma of the viscus is developed the ejecta are bloody or
have the coffee-ground appearance, and the vomiting occurs several
hours after eating, as the new growth is generally situated at the
pylorus.When there is adhesion of the pancreatic tumor to the stomach,
with perforation, both blood and pus are vomited.Dilatation of the
stomach is attended by prominence of the epigastrium and an extended
area of gastric tympany, and in cancer of the pylorus a tumor is often
appreciable on palpation.The fecal
evacuations are hard, and when the biliary secretion is absent from the
intestine they are clay-, and often contain fat.When there is
ulceration of the mucous membrane of the duodenum following secondary
cancer or adhesion, the stools become black and tar-like from the
presence of altered blood.Complete obstipation occurs in mechanical
obstruction of the gut from direct pressure or from bands of lymph.Occasionally, just before death there is diarrhoea, and there may be an
alternation of vomiting and diarrhoea.The symptoms and signs of secondary carcinoma or sclerosis of the liver
may be present, but the most commonly observed indications of impaired
hepatic function depend upon pressure-obstruction of the common
bile-duct.These are jaundice, fatty and clay- stools, and the
appearance of a tumor in the region of the gall-bladder.Jaundice is a
very common symptom.It occurs late in the disease as a rule, is
progressive and persistent, resisting all treatment, and is extreme in
degree, the skin becoming deep-yellow or greenish in color.The tumor
of the distended gall-bladder is pyriform in shape, firm and elastic to
the touch, yields a dull percussion sound, and occupies a position
opposite the extremity of the tenth rib on the right side of the
abdomen.Dropsy occurs in a large proportion of cases (nearly one-half) during
the advanced stages of the disease.It is due to vascular obstruction
occasioned by the pressure of the enlarged pancreas itself or of the
secondarily degenerated coeliac glands, and finally by secondary
lesions of the liver.The dropsy appears either in the form of ascites
or anasarca, is not often extreme in degree, and is subject to
variations, disappearing and reappearing at intervals.Ascites is the
more common form, but both conditions may exist in the same patient.It is impossible in the majority of instances to definitely fix the
date of onset of a pancreatic cancer, but the average duration of the
disease may be stated to be about one year.The uniformly fatal
termination usually takes place slowly from gradual exhaustion or with
the symptoms of an adynamic fever, but death may occur suddenly from
hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The principal features of carcinoma of the pancreas are
extreme emaciation, loss of strength, dyspepsia, pain of a neuralgic
{1127} character in the epigastrium, constipation, obstinate jaundice,
moderate ascites or anasarca, the appearance of fat in the stools,
lipuria, occasional vomiting, and the physical signs of an epigastric
tumor.These symptoms are not pathognomonic, however, and the diagnosis can be
certainly established only when it is possible to exclude primary
disease of the surrounding organs, especially of the stomach and liver.Cancer of the stomach may be excluded by the less-marked character of
the functional disturbances of the viscus; by the absence of frequent
vomiting, haematemesis, and the rejection of coffee-ground material; by
the somewhat different situation and greater immobility of the tumor,
by the seat, distribution, and constancy of the pain; and by the
presence of jaundice and of fat in the stools and urine.Diseases of the liver attended with alterations in the size of the
organ, as cancer, abscess, albuminoid and fatty degeneration, sclerosis
and hydatid tumor, have sufficiently characteristic physical signs and
symptoms to be readily distinguished from cancer of the pancreas.On
the other hand, the tumor of an enlarged gall-bladder is often
confusing.The situation of this tumor opposite the tenth rib and its
pyriform shape are important; other distinguishing points depend upon
the cause of the enlargement.In enlargement from accumulated bile the
tumor is elastic and fluctuating; from accumulation of gall-stones,
hard and nodulated, movable, painless on palpation, and often the seat
of crackling fremitus, produced by manipulation and due to the rubbing
together of several calculi; from cancer, hard, nodular, the size of an
orange, tender on pressure, rapid in growth, preceded by attacks of
biliary colic, and attended by fistulous communications with the
intestines and the passage of gall-stones per anum.In aneurism of the aorta or coeliac axis the tumor may present in the
epigastrium and produce analogous pressure symptoms.But the pain is
more of the character described as wearing, and is usually augmented at
night: on grasping the tumor a uniform expanding pulsation is felt in
place of the to-and-fro movement appreciable in a tumor resting upon a
healthy blood-vessel and receiving a transmitted impulse, while the
constitutional symptoms and course are quite different.The tumor of malignant disease of the omentum, although it appears in
the epigastrium or upper part of the umbilical region, is much more
movable, and is accompanied by ill-defined symptoms very dissimilar to
those of pancreatic cancer.In cancer of the transverse colon the mass may occupy nearly the same
position as a pancreatic growth, but the pain occurs several hours
after food is taken; vomiting is absent, and there is frequently
hemorrhage from the bowels.Chronic pancreatitis is accompanied by symptoms simulating those of
cancer; the enlargement of the gland, however, is not so great, nor are
the indications of pressure upon adjacent organs so prominent.The pain
is less severe, the general failure in health more gradual, the
progress slower, and constipation less common.TREATMENT.--The indications are to maintain the strength of the
patient, to provide a diet that is nutritious and at the same time
easily digested, to allay pain by the employment of narcotics, and to
relieve as far as possible the various symptoms as they arise.The plan
of {1128} administering a calf's pancreas or extractum pancreatis will
prove serviceable when the fecal evacuations contain fat.Nutritious
and peptonized enemata may be of service in some cases.Sarcoma and Tubercle of the Pancreas.Sarcoma of the pancreas occurs with extreme rarity.It is impossible
during life to distinguish it from carcinoma.Tubercle of the gland is infrequently met with.Some pathologists deny
its occurrence, and believe that the cases recorded as such are merely
instances of caseous degeneration of the neighboring glands.When it
does occur, it is always secondary, the primary disease being situated
in the lungs or intestines.The alterations in the gland consist in the
development of cheesy masses or of miliary granulations in the
connective tissue between the acini.The condition gives rise to no
definite symptoms, and its diagnosis during life is impossible.DEGENERATIONS OF THE PANCREAS.Two forms of fatty degeneration occur, either separately or
combined--namely, fatty infiltration and fatty metamorphosis.Fatty infiltration consists of a true hypertrophy of the fat-tissue
normally existing in the gland, or of an increase and extension into
the gland of the peripancreatic adipose tissue.Yellow bands and masses
of fat-tissue appear between the acini, and by constantly increasing in
size lead gradually to a total atrophy of the cells of the acini.The
canal of Wirsung contains a fatty liquid.These changes are found
associated with fatty liver, heart, and omentum, in drunkards
especially.Fatty metamorphosis of the gland consists of a change analogous to
fatty metamorphosis of other organs.When hyperplasia of the
interstitial connective tissue is absent, the organ is flaccid, soft,
and diminished in size; the acinous structure remains distinct, though
the acini and ducts are filled with a fatty emulsion: after this is
discharged or absorbed the gland appears as a flaccid band, and finally
becomes entirely atrophied.Fatty metamorphosis occurs in drunkards, in
diabetes, in advanced age, in cancer, phthisis, and other wasting
diseases.Neither form of fatty disease gives rise to symptoms by which it can be
recognized during life.Albuminoid Degeneration of the Pancreas.This is only found in combination with amyloid change in other organs
of the body, and a diagnosis cannot be made.{1129} Hemorrhages into the Pancreas.Hemorrhages into the pancreas may be divided into three classes.The most common form depends upon passive hyperaemia, the result of
chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, or liver.In this condition the
effusion of blood coexists with chronic inflammatory changes in the
interstitial connective tissue.The appearance at first is of minute
bloody points scattered throughout the areolar tissue; later, these
change into round or oval pigment masses, or spaces containing reddish
serum and surrounded by thickened, rust-, irregular walls.The second class includes the rare cases of hemorrhage resulting from
the rupture of one of the large blood-vessels of the gland, and due to
some pre-existing change in the vessel walls.In these the pancreas is
enlarged, may be converted into a sac containing blood, either fluid or
coagulated or partially crystallized according to the duration of life
after the hemorrhage has taken place, and a ruptured blood-vessel may
be readily discovered on dissection.The condition in which, without any evidence of passive hyperaemia or
gross vascular lesion, the entire pancreas become hemorrhagic,
constitutes the third class.The gland is then dark-red or violet in
color, the meshes of the interstitial tissue are filled with recent or
altered blood, and the acini are stained of a dull-gray hue.The
hemorrhage may extend to the connective tissue surrounding the gland.Finally, the organ becomes soft, the peritoneal covering sloughs, and
fragments of broken-down gland-tissue escape into the peritoneal
cavity.These lesions are so analogous to those which attend thrombosis
occurring in other organs that their dependence upon the same cause
seems probable.The first form of hemorrhage is unattended by special symptoms.In the
second a pulsating tumor may suddenly appear in the epigastrium, and
the ordinary indications of hemorrhage--vomiting, fainting fits, cold
extremities, feeble pulse, and general exhaustion--are present.Death
may occur suddenly or the patient may linger on for months.In the
third condition death usually occurs very suddenly, probably from
pressure upon the sympathetic ganglia.There are no symptoms, and the
rapid termination prevents the development of general peritonitis,
which would otherwise occur from the sloughing of the peritoneum.OBSTRUCTION OF THE PANCREATIC DUCT.Obstruction of the excretory duct is a frequent occurrence in
pancreatic disease, and is due to two classes of causes--namely, 1st,
pressure from without; and, 2d, closure of the canal by catarrhal
swelling of its mucous membrane or by calculi.In the first class may be placed obstruction depending upon contraction
occurring in sclerosis of the gland, upon carcinoma of the head of the
gland, upon peripancreatic adhesions and indurations, upon the {1130}
presence of large gall-stones in the ductus choledochus, and upon
carcinoma of the pylorus and duodenum and enlargement of the
neighboring lymphatic glands.In catarrh of the canal of Wirsung the obstruction results either from
simple swelling of the mucous membrane or from the presence of a plug
of tough mucus.The formation of pancreatic concretions is by no means a rare event,
though these calculi are met with far less frequently than either
gall-stones or salivary concretions.They result from precipitation of
the inorganic ingredients of the pancreatic juice, and are usually
seated in the main duct, although they may be situated in the smaller
branches.They may be single or multiple, as many as twenty having been
counted in one gland.In shape they are spherical, oval, or branched,
with sometimes a smooth, at others a spiculated, surface; their size
varies from that of a minute granule to a small walnut; they are
usually white or grayish-white in color, but may be black; and are
composed of the carbonate of lime or of a combination of the carbonate
and phosphate with oxalate of lime.Coincidently with these calculi it
is common to find concretions in the kidneys and gall-bladder.Concretions composed of insoluble protein substances have also been
found in the pancreatic ducts (Virchow).The most probable causes of the formation of pancreatic calculi seem to
be catarrhal conditions of the mucous membrane of the ducts and an
alteration in the chemical composition of the secretion.Whatever the cause, the obstruction, when complete, leads to retention
of the secretion and the formation of retention cysts.When the obstruction is situated at the duodenal extremity of the duct,
the canal and its secondary branches are either uniformly dilated or
sacculi are formed.These sacculi are round or oval, vary greatly in
size, sometimes reaching the dimensions of the fist or of a child's
head; they may be single, or several of them may be present, differing
in size and causing irregular projections of the outer surface of the
gland.When the obstruction occurs at some point in the course of the
duct, the dilatations and sacculi are found only behind the point of
occlusion.The small cysts contain a fluid resembling the pancreatic
juice; the larger, a whitish, chalky fluid, which in old cases may
contain white friable concretions composed of carbonate and phosphate
of lime, and become purulent, or be stained bright red or
chocolate- from the occurrence of hemorrhage.In such instances
haematoidin crystals can be discovered by the microscope.The interior
of the dilated ducts and of the retention cysts is lined by a single
layer of thin flat cells, with irregular edges and with oval flat
nuclei.The walls are thickened, and composed of superimposed layers of
laminated connective tissue separated from one another by flat
nucleated cells.The secreting structure of the gland undergoes atrophy
from pressure, or fatty metamorphosis takes place, and, although the
gland is increased in size from the presence of the cysts, its
functional power is lost.In addition to causing obstruction of the duct of Wirsung and the
changes mentioned, pancreatic calculi may produce induration, atrophy,
acute inflammation, or even suppuration of the surrounding glandular
tissue.{1131} SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--The main feature is the presence in the
epigastrium of a rounded, smooth, fluctuating, painless tumor.There
are also indications of the absence of the pancreatic secretion from
the digestive tract--notably, emaciation, general debility, and the
appearance of fat in the stools.Jaundice resulting from a coincident
obstruction of the bile-duct is a frequent symptom, and melituria has
been noted in some cases.It is probable, too, that the passage of a
calculus along the duct may give rise to pain resembling in character
and distribution the pain of hepatic colic.Sometimes the termination is sudden from
the rupture of a cyst into the peritoneal cavity or into the stomach or
duodenum, with hemorrhage.DIAGNOSIS.--The absence of pain, of tenderness, and of cachexia,
together with the physical characters of the tumor, distinguishes it
from carcinoma of the gland.Though not likely to be confounded with this disease, both hydatid
tumor of the liver and distension of the gall-bladder must be borne in
mind in making the diagnosis of a fluctuating tumor situated in the
upper third of the abdomen.TREATMENT must be entirely symptomatic.Attention to the general
health, proper regulation of the diet, and the employment of pancreatin
or an infusion of calf's pancreas to supply the place of the deficient
pancreatic juice, are the important steps.Attacks of pancreatic colic
indicate the use of anodynes.In two reported cases in which the cysts were very large paracentesis
for the removal of the fluid contents was resorted to, and there are
two cases on record in which the cysts were extirpated after abdominal
section.Kulenhampff of Bremen records a case of a man, thirty-nine
years of age, in whom, after a succession of severe blows upon the
abdomen, a tumor appeared in the epigastrium.An exploratory incision
was made, and a few ounces of pancreatic fluid evacuated by aspiration.Six days afterward the abdomen was opened, the peritoneum united to the
incision, and antiseptic gauze inserted to produce adhesive
inflammation between the sac and the abdominal wall.Adhesion taking
place after four days, the cyst was opened, a liter of fluid evacuated,
a tent inserted, and an antiseptic dressing applied.For sixteen days
fluid constantly escaped in slowly diminishing quantities, and the
tumor disappeared, a fistulous tract remaining.This completely closed
under the use of tincture of iodine and nitrate of silver at the end of
the seventh week.Thiersch opened a pancreatic cyst and evacuated three
liters of chocolate- fluid; recovery with a fistula followed.From a patient supposed to be suffering from ovarian dropsy Rokitansky
partially extirpated a cyst connected with the tail of the pancreas;
death from suppurative peritonitis occurred on the tenth day.N. Bozeman[4] on December 2, 1880, successfully removed from a woman
forty-one years old a pancreatic cyst weighing, with its contents,
twenty and a half pounds.In this instance also the operation was
undertaken for the removal of a supposed ovarian tumor, the diagnosis
not being established until after the abdomen was opened.[Footnote 4: _New York Medical Record_, Jan.{1132}

PERITONITIS.BY ALONZO CLARK, M.D., LL.D.Italian physicians in the later years of the seventeenth century and in
the early ones of the eighteenth had acquired some knowledge of the
symptoms of the disease we now call peritonitis, but known to them as
inflammation of the intestines.Indeed, it is claimed by some of the
admirers of Hippocrates that there are passages in his writings that
indicate some knowledge of the disease.But this claim will probably be
always received with many doubts as to its validity.In confirmation of the first statement I will transcribe certain
passages from Morgagni's thirty-fifth letter: In inflammation of the
intestines "Albertini had observed the pulse to be low and rather weak,
such as you will find it to have been in general in the foregoing
letter under Nos.He also observed the abdomen to
be tense and hard, the face and eyes to have something unusual in their
appearance."Medical writers, indeed, agree in the tension of the
abdomen, but they add many other symptoms, which prove beyond a doubt
the intestines to be inflamed; yet they mean that evident inflammation
which all may easily ascertain, and not that obscure disorder which we
now speak of, and which few suspect" (gangrene of the intestines)."By
the same writers it is also supposed that there is an obstinate
costiveness and continual vomiting."Morgagni refers to the assistance rendered by Albertini, Valsala, Van
Swieten, Rosa, and others in elucidating this subject.It is singular,
considering the clearness of his perception of the symptoms of
inflammation of the intestines, that he should be so greatly confused
regarding gangrene and sphacelus of the same parts.He looks on these
as the result of inflammation, and when the two classes of cases are
considered and compared, the result is a contrast and not a
resemblance.Yet he supposes that the differences are to be accounted
for by the different modes in which the same disease may be developed
in different persons.Another thing obtrudes itself on the attention in these letters: that
while a number of post-mortem examinations are reported of those who
had died of inflammation of the intestines, of gangrene and sphacelus
of the intestines, of hepatic abscess opening into the peritoneal
cavity, there is no record of finding in the abdomen anything
corresponding to what is now known as the inflammatory effusions from
serous membranes.I have searched his works, not for {1133}
peritonitis, for the word was not in use in his day, but for some
account of inflammation of the intestines or of some disease in the
description of which symptoms are named that distinguish or belong to
peritonitis, and with the single exception of pain the search has been
fruitless.Cullen in 1775 mentions the disease, but says that so little is known
about it that he will not attempt a description of it.Bichat died in 1802 in the thirty-eighth year of his age.I am not able
at present to lay my hand on his _Pathological Anatomy_; I therefore
quote from Chomel's article on peritonitis in the _Dictionnaire de
Medecine_ to show his claim to important studies regarding that
disease: "For a long time peritonitis was confounded under the name of
inflammation du bas ventre with inflammations of the abdominal viscera;
and it is to Bichat belongs the merit of having proved that
inflammation of the peritoneum is a disease distinct, and that it ought
to be separated from enteritis, gastritis, etc., as pleurisy is
separate from pneumonia.The studies of Gasc and of Laennec soon
confirmed the opinion of Bichat, and assured to peritonitis the
important place which it ought to occupy in all nosological tables.It
has become since then a subject of numerous observations and of
interesting researches regarding the causes de sa marche and the
lesions it causes."The references are not given by Chomel, but they are probably these:
Laennec, _Histoire des Inflammations du Peritoine_, 1804; and Gasc,
_Dictionnaire des Sciences Med._, p.Gasc says that the twenty years next preceding his publication
witnessed the first stage of the true history of peritonitis.Walther
in 1786 had contributed some facts, and S. G. Vogel in 1795, but the
rounding off and completing their work was left for Bichat.MORBID ANATOMY.--The first thing that strikes the observer in the
post-mortem examination of a person who has died of this disease is the
tendency of the intestines to protrude through the cut made in the
abdominal wall.This is produced by their dilatation generally, both
small and large, by gas.No gas, under these circumstances, ever
escapes from the peritoneal cavity unless there has been perforation of
the alimentary canal somewhere.While the intestines are in this manner
dilated, the stomach is small and usually empty.On the surface of the intestines there will be found a layer of
coagulated fibrin, often very thin and delicate, requiring a scraping
of the surface of the peritoneum to demonstrate it, but commonly
obvious enough, and sometimes quite abundant.This same false membrane
can be found on the viscera covered by the peritoneal membrane, on its
anterior extension, and most at the point of contact of one coil of the
intestine with another.Incorporated with this new membrane or lying
under it will often be seen blood-spots, thin, translucent, diffused,
and having ill-defined boundaries.The blood-vessels themselves are not remarkably congested.Here and
there may be spots where some redness remains, and the vessels are
larger than natural.But the congestion and redness, which analogy
leads us to {1134} believe belong to the active stages of the disease,
have in great degree disappeared after death.The peritoneal membrane itself has hardly become thickened, certainly
not in marked degree, but it has lost its lustrous surface, is, at
least in parts, of an opaline color, as if it had absorbed diluted
milk, and there is an effusion of serum or slight oedema on its
attached surface.Whatever may be the popular opinion regarding the
termination of inflammation of the bowels in mortification, whatever
the opinion of the older physicians, it is safe to say that gangrene of
the peritoneum has never been the result of uncomplicated, diffuse,
acute peritonitis.Peritonitis from strangulation of the intestine or
analogous causes is of course excepted.But in puerperal peritonitis I
have noticed a fact to which I have nowhere seen an allusion.The
parietal peritoneum is at two points in the abdomen but loosely
attached to the wall.One of these is on the anterior wall, anterior to
and a little above the iliac fossa; the other is above and below the
kidney on each side of the body.In these parts I have seen the
membrane forced off from its attachment to the walls, which with it
made a sac containing pus.Such an abscess, if the patient live long
enough, would doubtless cause the death of the membrane.There is in almost every case of peritonitis more or less of serous
effusion, commonly not seen at first on opening the abdomen, for it has
sunk into the pelvis.It is transparent, of a yellowish hue, and
sometimes flocculi of lymph are found in it.Whether the inflammation of the peritoneum extends to organs covered by
it is a question that has been much discussed; but it is admitted that
these organs, to a shallow depth on their surface, have an unnatural
color; and when it is remembered that the peritoneum is nourished by
vessels not exclusively its own, but running along its attached
surface, and distributed as well to the surface of the organs it
covers, it is easy to admit that to a very limited depth the organs
partake of the inflammatory disease.This supposition gives an easy
explanation of the constipation which is so prominent a feature among
the symptoms of the disease.The manner in which the false membrane is disposed of in those who
recover is an interesting question.Forty or more years ago Vogel
described the process by which the new effusion became a living tissue,
and the manner in which blood-corpuscles and blood-vessels were formed
in it; and another author had found that the time needed to complete
this vascularization was twenty days.But now Bauer and most of the
German writers inform us that the coagulated fibrin is converted into
fatty matter and is absorbed, and that when adhesions occur they result
from the coalescence of a new formation of the connective-tissue
elements built up into granules.The question, then, arises, Will the
chemical constitution of fibrin permit its conversion into oil?If it
will, then the further question presents itself, By what chemical
action is the change effected within the body?I do not intend to
discuss these questions, but propose them by way of expressing some
doubt regarding the accuracy of this statement.I have always supposed that the epithelial layer of the peritoneum was
pushed off by the first of the effusions in peritonitis, and that this
was one of the causes of the lustreless appearance of the membrane.This {1135} opinion I have never attempted to confirm or correct by the
microscope.He says: "The deposition of
fibrin occurs before the endothelium presents any changes.This
fibrinous effusion encloses, primarily, hardly any cellular elements,
and only a few cast-off endothelial cells are to be found in it.The
endothelium itself is swollen and turbid; the cell-body is increased in
size; the contents are granular; multiplication of the nuclei is
apparent; the cells are, in fact, in active division.In the tissue of
the serous membrane itself, soon after the deposition on its surface,
an accumulation of indifferent (?)cells takes place, especially around
the vessels, so that the spaces between the vessels are thus completely
filled up.The fixed connective-tissue corpuscles take part in the
inflammatory process."Delafield says: "If the autopsy is made within a few hours after death,
we find the entire peritoneum of a bright-red color from congestion of
the blood-vessels; but that is all: there is no fibrin, no serum, no
pus; epithelial cells are increased in size and number."For this kind
of peritonitis he proposes the term cellular.He finds it in cases of
local abscess of the abdominal cavity in which inflammatory action has
extended over the whole membrane, and particularly on the omentum also,
in the first two days of puerperal peritonitis."The ordinary form of
acute peritonitis is attended with changes in the endothelium and fixed
connective tissue, and with the production of serum, fibrin, and pus."He describes the migration of white corpuscles of the blood through the
walls of capillaries to become pus-cells, and then says: "Minute
examination shows that two distinct sets of changes are going on at the
same time: first, a production of fibrin, serum, and pus; second,
swelling and multiplication of the endothelial cells.If the
inflammation is very intense, the pus and fibrin are most abundant; if
milder, the changes in the endothelium are more marked."I have said above that the epithelium is early washed off by the
inflammatory effusions.In opposition--or, perhaps better, in
correction--of this idea, Delafield says: "There may be a considerable
amount of pus produced, and yet the layer of endothelium remains in
place.""If, however, the pus and fibrin are produced in large amounts,
the endothelium falls off and leaves the surface of the peritoneum
bare."The connective-tissue cells of peritoneum, he says, undergo but
little change in the first three days of the inflammation, "but by the
seventh day these cells are marked by increase in size and number in
all parts of the peritoneum."Two or three times in my life I have met with a peculiar arrangement of
the false membrane and serum of peritoneal inflammation, of which I do
not remember to have seen a description.It is this: the serum is
enclosed or encysted in bladders, the walls of which are the false
membrane.There may be two or three layers of these bladders, one upon
another, all more or less flattened, and each holding from two to six
ounces of fluid.It would seem that in these cases the inflammatory
activity rose and fell in its progress, early reaching the point at
which coagulable lymph was effused, then falling to the stage in which
serum alone escaped.This serum lifted the false membrane irregularly,
so that several pools were formed.After this the inflammation returns
to the fibrous exudation stage, and gives to these bladders a floor
which blends with the {1136} roof at the edges, and thus makes a
complete sac.Once more the inflammatory action is changed in its
intensity, so that the only effusion is serum; and this serum again
raises the new layer of false membrane into bladders--not always or
generally in the exact position of the first series.Still again, the
inflammation may be so changed as to make a fibrinous flow to this
second series of bladders.I am not certain that I have seen a third
series of these rare productions.They have doubtless been seen by
other persons, and may have been described.I have not been an
exhaustive reader on the subject, but I can well understand how they
may have been called hydatids on examination of the sacs without
looking at the contents.The fluid in the cysts is simply serum, with
no echinococcus sacs, and then the number of these inflammatory sacs
greatly exceeds the probable number of the fibrous sacs of hydatids.Pus in large quantity is not often a product of simple acute diffusive
peritonitis, although it is frequently found in that form of the
disease that attends puerperal fever, septicaemia, or erysipelas.Yet I
have seen it a few times.The pus is not generally pure, but is mixed
with serum in different proportions, and there will be seen at the same
time deposits of lymph attached to the peritoneum or scales of it
floating in the fluid effusion, or both.There is reason to believe
that in the cases of this class a very large proportion are fatal in
the acute stages, but in the cases that live for a few weeks the pus is
disposed to collect in pools and become abscesses by adhesions around
them at their borders.These abscesses are disposed to find an exit
from the body.In one case four abscesses that were found in this way
in different parts of the abdominal cavity had each burrowed toward the
umbilicus, and were actually discharging their contents at this point
when I saw the case.In another case one abscess only was formed, and
in four weeks it had perforated the colon.The opening was nearly an
inch in diameter.Kalantarians says, in eight examinations of the solar and hypogastric
plexus in persons who had died of acute peritonitis changes which he
regards as inflammatory had occurred, with subsequent opaque swelling
of the nerve-cells, ultimate fatty degeneration, brown pigmentation,
and atrophy.In chronic peritonitis the cells are often converted into
amorphous pigment matter, with increase and sclerosis of the ganglionic
connective tissue.Still, it is worthy of notice that these changes do
not express themselves in symptoms in those that recover.ETIOLOGY.--Numerous writers have expressed a doubt whether a
spontaneous acute peritonitis ever occurs, or if it is ever primary its
occurrence in this way is very rare.Habershon[1] has presented the
case with more apparent force than any other writer.He studied the
record of five hundred autopsies of peritonitis made at Guy's Hospital
during twenty-five years, but he "cannot find a single case thoroughly
detailed where the disease could be correctly regarded as existing
solely in the peritoneal serous membrane."[Footnote 1: _Medico-Chirurgical Trans._, vol.In twenty-five years
the records were probably made by a number of different persons, and
persons of varying views and varying capacity and judgment.It is
possible that the quotation may embrace some of the changes already
referred to as the consequences of peritonitis.It does embrace the
cases {1137} "when inflammation of the serous membrane occurs in the
course of albuminuria, pyaemia, puerperal fever, erysipelas, etc."It
also includes "peritonitis caused by general nutritive changes in the
system," as seen "in struma, cancer, etc.," "comprising also those
cases in which the circulation of the peritoneum has been so altered by
continued hyperaemia (modifying its state of growth) that very slight
existing causes suffice to excite mischief, as in peritonitis with
cirrhosis, disease of the heart, etc."With these explanations the statement differs widely from what it would
seem to mean without them.It is far from saying that peritonitis
always follows some abdominal lesion and is caused by that lesion.Habershon's paper was published twenty-three years ago, and during all
these years the curative treatment of peritonitis, to which the paper
itself gave currency, has enabled us to study our cases after recovery
as well as before the sickness, and it can hardly be doubted that a
much larger proportion of the cases are primary and idiopathic than
either Louis or Habershon found reason to admit.That a large number
are produced by preceding lesions and constitutional conditions no one
will be likely to doubt.Among the 500 post-mortem examinations of peritonitis reported by
Habershon, he found preceding disease or injury recognizable in the
abdominal cavity in 261.:

  From hernia, of which 19 were internal obstruction.35
  From perforation of the stomach, ileum, caecum and appendix,
    colon, etc.(other 13 mentioned with hernia, or with caecal
    disease).43
  And leading to fecal abscess (2 otherwise mentioned).17
  From typhoid ulceration without perforation .5
  From disease or operation on bladder and pelvis, viscera, etc.42
  From disease of the liver and gall-bladder.11
  From acute disease of the colon (3 others enumerated with
    perforation).3
  From disease of the caecum or appendix (9 others previously
    mentioned).3
                                                                   ---
                                                                   261

Habershon says that in the (his) second and third divisions of the
cases the causes were as follows:

  From Bright's disease .63
  From pyaemia, 13; erysipelas, 5; puerperal fever, 10; with
    pneumonia, 3.31
  From strumous disease .9
                                                                   ---
                                                                   240

I have drawn thus liberally from Habershon's paper because it is the
only paper that I know, in any language, founded on the analysis of a
large number of cases (for five hundred post-mortem examinations is a
large number for a disease no more frequent than peritonitis), in the
belief that he dealt with facts and that his conclusions must be of
great value.He may differ with other physicians regarding what
constitutes strumous disease and in the agency of heart disease.He may
have mistaken coincidence for consequence, but the paper bears the
marks of honesty and good faith from the beginning to the end.In Habershon's second division, under which he ranks the cases of
{1138} peritonitis caused by "a changed condition of the blood," he
ascribes 63 to albuminuria.Every physician knows how often meningitis
or pericarditis or pleurisy may occur under these circumstances,
especially in young persons; but, for myself, I cannot but express
surprise at these figures.In one capacity or another I have been
connected with large hospitals for forty-eight years, and have seen
many cases of albuminuria in private practice, and can recall but few
instances in which kidney disease, excepting cancer and other tumors,
has terminated in peritonitis.In modification of this statement,
however, it is proper to add that the hospital physician cannot know
how half the diseases he treats terminate, on account of the American
plan of interrupted service, and even less can he know of the mode of
death in cases which he sees in consultation.Even with this admission,
from my standpoint it is not easy to believe that one-eighth of the
cases of peritonitis are caused by albuminuria.The word pyaemia used by Habershon, it seems to me, ought to be
replaced by septicaemia, and it has been by many of the profession.Sedillot many years ago proved that laudable pus injected into the
blood-vessels of the dog produced no signs of disease, but that septic
pus, so used, was followed by grave symptoms, even death.Among the
author's cases thirteen were associated with the septic poison.He also
found five which he thinks were independent of erysipelas.One in one
hundred is a proportion hardly large enough to establish the relation
of cause and effect against the chances of concurrence.I can make a remark with reference to the inquiry by C. Dubacy in the
October number (1881) of the _American Journal of Medical Sciences_,
whether diphtheria produces peritonitis.When diphtheria became
epidemic among us in 1860 or 1861 for several years, I saw a great deal
of it, but did not recognize any relation between it and peritonitis.The relations of hernia, injuries, and operations to peritonitis need
no commentary.Perforations of the alimentary canal may require some illustrative
statements.These occur most frequently in the vermiform appendix of
the caecum, and are almost invariably caused by some irritating
substance imprisoned in its tube.In some cases it is a seed of some
fruit, as the orange or lemon; in others, a cherry-pit; in one that I
remember it was a small stone, such as is sometimes found in rice; in
others, a hard fecal concretion; in one, a child, a singular formation:
a strawberry-seed was the centre; around this a layer of fecal matter,
around the fecal matter a calcareous layer, on this, again, a fecal
layer, and so on to the number of six layers, the external one being
calcareous.This body was about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, and
may have been years in forming.In this connection I may state, per
contra, that I am informed that in a pathological museum in Boston is
preserved an appendix that contains, and did contain, a large number of
bird-shot, which did no mischief except to enlarge the appendix.This
was from the body of a man who had shot and eaten many birds.My
observation has led me to the belief that a large proportion of the
cases of peritonitis occurring in children are due to perforation of
the appendix.Of the diseases of the liver producing acute diffuse peritonitis, the
foremost, I think, is abscess, single or multiple.The different modes
in which gall-stones may produce it may be illustrated by the following
{1139} cases: (1) A lady died of acute peritonitis.At post-mortem
examination a large abscess was found, bounded above by the liver, in
other directions by adherent intestines; it contained nearly a quart of
pus: at the bottom of the sac was a single gall-stone, very large and
very black; the gall-bladder was perforated and very much shrunken.The
gall-stone had caused an ulceration of the gall-bladder, but none of
the intestines, in this respect differing from the process known as
painless transit of a gall-stone.So the calculus caused the abscess,
and the abscess caused the general peritonitis.(2) A lady between
fifty and sixty years of age had an attack of gall-stone pains; she had
had them before.In a few hours symptoms of peritonitis were manifest,
and she died.The post-mortem examination showed the ductus cysticus
was ulcerated and perforated.Two gall-stones of large size had been
formed in the gall-bladder, and had been pushed forward into the duct
about halfway to the common duct, leaving it enlarged as they advanced.The foremost one had caused an ulcer on the anterior or lower side of
the duct, and bile had escaped, staining all the right half of the
abdominal cavity, and throughout this half only the parts were covered
with false membrane and stained with bile.John Freeland of Antigua had a
patient, a <DW52> woman sixty-five years of age, who had been
suffering from intermittent fever, gastric disorder, and retching.In
one of the vomiting spells she experienced great pain, which, being
relieved by an opiate, soon returned and was attended by tympanitic and
tender abdomen.The
cavity of the abdomen was found filled with blood and bile, the
intestines inflamed and gangrenous in spots, and there was general
peritonitis.The gall-bladder was empty; the hepatic duct was
lacerated, and contained pouches in which gall-stones were encysted.This laceration was surrounded by
evidences of recent inflammation, and caused the general
peritonitis.[2]

[Footnote 2: The _Medical Record_, Dec.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have been attended by
little inflammation of the peritoneum.Death has followed this accident
in twenty to thirty-six hours.There has been little pain, little
tumefaction of the bowels, little tenderness, but a sense of sinking
and a peculiar feeling at the stomach which the patient finds it
difficult to describe.The ulcers of dysentery do at times perforate all the coats of the
colon, and yet do not with any uniformity cause general peritonitis;
but as the destructive process approaches the outer covering the latter
becomes inflamed, and lymph enough is effused to close the opening and
prevent the escape of the contents of the intestine; so that, while
perforation is not uncommon, I have rarely seen diffuse peritonitis
accompanying dysentery.Habershon reports 5 cases in which incomplete typhoid ulcers of the
intestines caused peritonitis, and 15 from the complete perforation.I
believe that the physicians of this country and those of France have
found the complete perforation much the most common.I do not remember to have seen fecal accumulation in the intestines
produce peritonitis at all general.I did see, years ago, a man of
middle {1140} age in whom fecal impaction in the ascending colon had
caused destruction of all the layers of the abdominal wall on the right
side, so that the contents of the intestine were exposed to view in a
space of three inches by two.This implies that there had been
peritoneal inflammation enough to seal the intestine to the abdominal
wall on all the borders of this extraordinary ulcer.The man recovered
in about six months, and returned to his business.The inconsiderable operation of tapping for abdominal and ovarian
dropsy has sometimes been followed by acute peritonitis.In the early
part of my professional life I met with several such cases, and have
witnessed the same from time to time since.These were mostly cases of
dropsy from cirrhosis of the liver.Habershon found 5 such cases, and 7
in the tapping of ovarian cysts.The rupture of ovarian cysts has produced peritonitis, but in a larger
number of cases such rupture, even when the result of violence, has not
led to inflammation; but the kidney secretion has been greatly
augmented and the fluid absorbed, so that the rupture has been
beneficial rather than harmful.Tumors, particularly those of a malignant character, are apt to grow to
the surrounding structures by adhesions the result of chronic
inflammation, but now and then they provoke an acute attack which
becomes general.Benign tumors may, in rare instances, do this.In one
case a man died of acute peritonitis, and the examination showed that a
tumor noticed before death, a very large serous cyst standing out of
the left kidney, downward-forward, was the only lesion that antedated
the inflammation.Infiltration of urine, in any of the several ways in which it can reach
the peritoneum, is a cause of peritonitis.Pelvic cellulitis may also
be a cause, though twenty or thirty cases in succession may run a
favorable course with no secondary lesions; it is still recognized as
one of the occasional causes of peritonitis.Among the rare causes of diffusive peritonitis is perforation of the
intestine by lumbricoid worms.In such cases the product of the
inflammatory action is apt to be sero-purulent, with but a limited
amount of fibrin.E. Marcus reports such a perforation, and it was
called by Peris ascaridophagie.The worms were apparently not found in
the peritoneal cavity, but in the intestines.The perforation had
bloodless edges, which lay quite close upon one another, as if they had
been separated by a piercing action of the attenuated extremity of the
parasite not eaten through.[3]

[Footnote 3: _N.Y.Lusk finds that certain vaginal injections excite a local peritonitis.Sentey gives the details of a case in which a midwife undertook to
procure an abortion by the douche.She used a tube that was large with
a spreading mouth or opening, which probably received the neck of the
uterus in such a way as to prevent the return of the water.It was, in
consequence, forced into the uterus and through one of the Fallopian
tubes into the peritoneal cavity.By this a rapidly-fatal peritonitis
was developed.It would seem that
this mode of procuring abortion can be frightfully misused, however
safe it may be in skilful hands.There is a word still to be said regarding the difference between
peritonitis produced by wounds, operations, violence, and internal
growths, or {1141} what, with a little liberty, may be called traumatic
causes, and that which arises spontaneously or without recognizable
cause.The first shows a tendency to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of the injury, and more frequently does not become
general; while the latter spreads pretty quickly over the whole extent
of the peritoneum.SYMPTOMS.--There is, perhaps, no grave disease whose symptomatology is
more easily interpreted, in which the diagnosis is more easily made,
than the average case of acute diffuse peritonitis.Yet there are
obscure cases which it is difficult to recognize.In a well-marked case the first symptom is pain.Chomel and even some
later writers believe that chill precedes the pain, but to the best of
my recollection it has not generally so occurred to me; and the
question arises, Have they kept the symptoms of puerperal peritonitis
separated from those of simple peritonitis?The pain is first felt in a somewhat limited space in the abdomen, and
pretty rapidly spreads, so that it is soon felt in every part of the
bowels.It may remain greatest in the part where it first began, but
there are many exceptions to this statement.As the disease advances
the pain and tenderness become more marked, and the patient will try to
diminish the tension of the abdominal walls by lying on his back and by
bending the hip- and knee-joints, often also for the additional purpose
of lifting the bedclothes from his abdomen.Often the patient will
resist the physician's movement to examine his bowel with the hand.In
the last few hours of life the pain ceases.The pulse in its frequency follows the advances in the disease.At the
onset it is not much accelerated, but in two or three hours it may
reach 100 to 120 in the minute.Besides becoming more frequent, it
becomes smaller in volume and more tense.Toward the end of a fatal
case it may reach 140 to 160 in the minute and be very small.In the early hours of peritonitis the bowels begin to swell, and
percussion shows that the swelling is caused by gaseous accumulation.This increases as the disease goes on, so that in some the bowels
become greatly distended--so much, indeed, as to diminish the thoracic
space and interfere with the respiration.As the disease advances the
tympanitic resonance may give place to dulness on percussion on the
sides and lower part of the abdomen.Before the introduction of opium in the treatment of peritonitis the
green vomit was a marked feature of the disease.It occurs in other
conditions, but rarely, and its occurrence in this disease was so
common that it was regarded as almost diagnostic.The fluid vomited is
of a spinach-green color, and the color is probably derived from the
bile; at least, I have examined it repeatedly for the blood-elements,
and have not found them.In these days this symptom of peritonitis is
not often observed.Constipation is absolute in uncomplicated peritonitis of ordinary
severity, and I believe is caused by a temporary paralysis of the
muscular layer of the intestine.It has already been stated that the
blood-supply of the peritoneum is through vessels whose capillaries are
shared by that membrane and the tissues which it covers.Inflammatory
action in the peritoneum of average severity would naturally extend to
this muscular layer and render it inactive.When the inflammation
abates it recovers its contractile power.Thus, the intestines become
entirely insensitive to {1142} cathartic medicines.This fact is not
observed in puerperal peritonitis, probably because the large share
which the uterus takes of the disease may act, in some degree, as a
derivative; and then, so far as I know, the muscular layer of the
intestines does not undergo the change of color and appearance in the
latter disease that has been observed in the former.This obstinate
constipation has been noticed from the first discovery of the disease,
and during forty years in the first part of this century many
physicians believed that if they could overcome it their patients would
recover.The present interpretation of this conviction is that if
catharsis, which was very rarely effected, did precede recovery, the
disease was not of a grave type--if, indeed, it was peritonitis at all.Sometimes peritonitis occurs in the course of a diarrhoea; then the
constipation is not at once established, but the symptoms of the two
diseases concur for one or two days, when the diarrhoea ceases.Abdominal respiration ceases when peritonitis is established, either
because the movements of the diaphragm produce pain or because the
diaphragm is partly paralyzed, as is the muscle of the intestines.Then
the gaseous distension of the bowels obstructs the action of this
muscle.As a clinical fact it is important, and has often helped me in
a diagnosis.Another kindred fact is that all the indications of
peristaltic action cease.I have a great many times placed my hand on
the abdomen and patiently waited for a sensation that would be evidence
of intestinal movements, but did not discover any--have placed my ear
on the surface of the abdomen, and have long listened for the gurgling
which is so constant in healthy bowels, and have listened in vain.In
this respect my observations differ from those of Battey, who reports
that he has heard the friction of the newly-made false membrane in
respiration, while I concur with him in the statement that the
sensation of friction can be felt by pressure of the ends of the
fingers into the abdominal wall so as to produce indentation.It should
be said regarding the friction sound in respiration that Battey has the
support of Chomel, and he in his turn quotes Barth and Roger; so that
there may be in this sign more than I have thus far found.The temperature of the body is not, considering the extent of membrane
involved, remarkably high.I have recently attended a most
carefully-observed case in which the temperature never rose above 104
degrees F. It falls below the temperature of health as the disease
approaches a fatal termination.From the time this disease was recognized as a separate and distinct
affection the countenance has fixed the attention of writers.The face
is pale and bloodless and the features pinched, and the general
expression is one of anxiety and suffering.I do not remember to have
seen a flushed face in peritonitis, although the degree of paleness
differs in different patients.The mind is almost always clear, unless disturbed by the medicines used
in the treatment.Yet cases are recorded in which a mild, and still
more rarely a violent, delirium has been noticed.Subsultus tendinum,
and even convulsions, have been witnessed, but whether these symptoms
belong to the peritonitis or to an accompanying uraemia has not
received the attention of those who have witnessed them.The urine is usually scanty and high-, but it does not often
{1143} contain either albumen or casts.This statement is presumably
untrue of the cases in which Bright's disease preceded the peritonitis
and is supposed to be the cause of it--a variety of the disease with
which I have already declared my scanty acquaintance.The urine is
often voided with difficulty, and sometimes retained, so that resort to
a catheter becomes necessary.The symptoms of this disease are not invariable.In one case the
inflation of the bowels is only enough to be perceptible; in another,
as I have said, it becomes a distressing symptom, while in most the
bowels are obstinately constipated.A case may now and then occur in
which evacuations can be procured by cathartics.Pain is regarded by
all physicians as the most constant symptom, and it has existed in
every case that I have seen, or at least tenderness; but the late
Griscom stated to me that a man once came to his office for advice in
whom he suspected peritonitis; but the man asserted that he had no
pain, and the doctor placed his fist on the abdominal wall and pushed
backward till he was resisted by the spinal column, the man asserting
that the pressure did not hurt him; yet he died the next day, the
doctor declared, of peritonitis.This may be credible in view of the
fact that absence of pain in puerperal peritonitis is not very
uncommon.The green vomit, which was expected in all cases forty years
ago, for the most part, as I have intimated, disappears under the opium
treatment.There are persons in whom peritonitis does not accelerate
the pulse beyond 100 beats in the minute.The pain, in rare cases,
remits and recurs with some degree of regularity, in this respect
resembling intestinal colic.Andral reports such a case; I have also
witnessed it.MORTALITY.--Up to the time when the opium treatment was adopted,
peritonitis was a fearful word; a large proportion of those attacked by
it died of it.In 1832, I began to visit hospitals as a medical
student, and for eight years, at home or abroad, was almost a daily
attendant.The number of recoveries of those that I saw in that time
can be counted on the fingers of one hand.This may be regarded as its
natural mortality, for the treatment of that day seemed to exercise
little or no control over it.(Farther on this matter will be referred
to again.)DURATION.--Chomel believed that the disease might prove fatal in
eighteen hours, while he regards its average duration as seven or eight
days.I very much doubt whether peritonitis, not caused by perforation,
violence, or surgical operation, was ever fatal in eighteen hours.I do
not remember any case of shorter duration than two or three days.Then,
on the other hand, the period of seven or eight days in the fatal cases
appears to me too long.In the early part of my professional life I
remember to have looked for death in three or four days.At present, in
the fatal cases, life is prolonged to double or more than double that
time.In the majority of those that recover at present the duration of
the symptoms is from two days to a week; in a few they have continued
fourteen days; and lately I have assisted in the treatment of a case in
which there was little amelioration for forty days, and yet the
peritonitis was cured.DIAGNOSIS.--When the symptoms are fully developed there are few
diseases that are more easily recognized.It is when these symptoms are
slowly or irregularly manifested, or when some other disease which may
account for many of the symptoms occurs with it or precedes it, that
there {1144} should be any real difficulty.It is customary to regard
the danger of confounding the transit of a renal or hepatic calculus
with peritonitis as worthy of comment.But if the reader will turn to
the articles in this work which relate to these topics, he will find
the symptoms so widely different from those enumerated in this article
as belonging to peritonitis that he will be surprised that this item in
the diagnosis should have occupied so much room.In a case already referred to, in which peritonitis followed gall-stone
pains, the transition was so marked by the rapid acceleration of the
pulse and swelling of the abdomen that each of the three physicians in
attendance at once appreciated the significance of the change.A
physician who resided in the country called on me to report his own
case.He had a little before had a very painful affection of the
abdomen which continued for three days.The pain was paroxysmal,
confined to the region of the liver, back and front, for one day; after
that there was some tenderness over most of the abdomen, but no
tympanitis.His pulse became frequent and his temperature advanced to
103 degrees.His physicians believed that these symptoms justified them
in treating him for peritonitis.Yet his position in bed was constantly
changed, and no one attitude long continued--a restlessness which never
occurs in peritonitis, but is common in calculus transits.Add to this
the absence of gaseous distension and of the green vomit, the
paroxysmal character of the pain (though I remember one case in which
peritoneal pain increased and diminished somewhat regularly, but only
one), and, finally, the sudden cessation of the pain, such as often
happens in calculus transit when the calculus passes into the
intestine,--it is plain that his sufferings were caused by a
gall-stone.The elevation of temperature was the result of a
long-continued worry of the nervous system, and the abdominal
tenderness came from the many times repeated contraction of the
abdominal muscles which occurs in hepatic colic.And then, to make the
diagnosis more complete, this gentleman, after twelve or fourteen hours
of pain, became jaundiced--in the end very much so.There was no
absolute constipation, and the stools were of the color of clay from
the absence of bile.The points of difference between renal colic and peritonitis are even
better defined and easier recognized than those between it and hepatic
colic.In intestinal colic there may be some inflation of the bowels, and if
it continues a day or two there may be some tenderness; but it is for
the most part distinguished from peritonitis by the intermittent or
remittent character of the pain, by its greater severity while it
lasts, by its courting, rather than repulsing, pressure, by the
moderate acceleration of the pulse, by no or only slight elevation of
temperature (exception being made for long continuance), by the absence
of the green vomit, by the absence of the fixed position of
peritonitis, etc.There does not seem to me any need of spending time to distinguish
gastritis or enteritis or neuralgia from peritonitis, their symptoms
are so wholly different; and if, as is said, the mucous inflammation
can penetrate all the coats of the stomach or intestine, and so cause
inflammation of the peritoneal layer, that is peritonitis, and will be
distinguished by the proper symptoms of peritonitis.TREATMENT.--Chomel[4] says: "If general peritonitis is intense, it
{1145} should be attacked by the most powerful therapeutic agents.One
should immediately prescribe a large bleeding from the arm--from 500 to
600 grammes, for example--and repeat according to the need once or even
twice in the first twenty-four hours; apply to the abdomen, and
particularly to the part of it where the pain was first felt, leeches
in large number--fifty, even a hundred--as the violence of the disease
may demand and the strength of the patient will permit."He recommends
baths, presumably tepid, and describes an apparatus by which the
patient can be put into the bath and lifted out of it without pain;
prescribes a fixed posture, gentle laxatives, mercurial frictions,
blisters; conditionally and doubtfully, paracentesis, emetics under
certain circumstances--musk, etc.In the treatment of
general peritonitis there is no reference to opium.The word does not
occur, but it does in the treatment of peritonitis following
perforation.In this condition he would, among other things, give opium
a haute dose, but he does not prescribe any repetition or give any
details.It is probable that the idea was obtained from Graves, whose
first use of opium in this accident was in 1821, although its first
publication appears to have been by Stokes in 1832.[Footnote 4: _Dictionnaire de Medecine_, 1841.]Wardell,[5] who has written the latest treatise on the disease we are
considering, relies greatly on bloodletting, but falls short of Chomel
in the quantity of blood he would take--would bleed, not to withdraw a
certain number of ounces, but to produce certain effects.The
venesection is to be followed by the application of leeches--twenty,
thirty, or forty--to the abdomen; after this turpentine applications to
the bowels.After depletion, he says, opium should be given at once:
"two or three grains may be given in urgent cases."Vesication he calls
"another of our aids."He disapproves of cathartics, but when there is
accumulation in the colon would use injections."Opium in the asthenic
form is the chief agent, and Graves and Stokes were among the first
physicians who gave it very largely.""Two or three grains may at first
be prescribed, and a grain every four or three, or even two, hours
afterward.""In perforation there is sometimes great toleration of the
drug.Murchison has known so large a quantity as sixty grains to be
given in three days with impunity."Mercurials, he thinks, are of
doubtful efficacy.In the paragraph devoted to the treatment of
puerperal peritonitis the word opium does not occur, and it is only by
a very doubtful inference that we can assume that he would ever use it.Chomel makes no allusion to the use of opium in the same disease.[Footnote 5: _Reynolds's System of Medicine_.]For two years (1834-36) I was connected with the New York Hospital as
house-physician or in positions by which that office is reached.The
treatment of acute diffuse peritonitis then and there was formulated as
follows: First, a full bleeding from the arm, commonly sixteen ounces,
then a dozen or more leeches to the abdomen; following this, another
bleeding or not, in the discretion of the physician.Meantime, the
patient would take half a grain to a grain of calomel every two hours,
with a little opium "to prevent the calomel acting on the bowels," of
which there was no danger, in truth.Mercurial inunction was used at
the same time.The belief was that after depletion the most important
thing was "to establish mercurial action in the system;" in other
words, {1146} "to diminish the plasticity of the blood."Under this
plan I saw one recovery in these two years.In 1840, I went to Vermont to give a course of lectures in the Vermont
Medical College, and while there was called by the physicians to see
with them several cases of peritonitis.I found that they were treating
the disease on the Armstrong plan; that is, bleeding freely, and then
administering a full dose of opium, as they said, "to prolong the
effects of the bleeding."In most cases there was a second bleeding and
a second administration of opium.Leeches were also used, and
irritating applications to the abdomen, and in some cases purges.I
found they were getting better results than we were in New York, and I
studied their cases as closely as I could, and reached the conclusion
that opium was the curative agent, and that it would be safe to omit
the abstraction of blood.This conviction grew in strength with every
new case, and I saw, with different physicians, several cases, the
disease being more prevalent among the mountains there than in the
city--at least that year.The idea then formed was that to establish
the narcotic effects of opium within safe limits, and continue them by
repeated administration of the drug, would cure uncomplicated
peritonitis--that a kind of saturation of the system with opium would
be inconsistent with the progress of the inflammation, and would subdue
it.There was no theory to build the treatment on, and no explanation
of the action of the drug in my mind.What I saw of the action of two
full doses of opium was the only foundation for the idea.I had in the
course of two years after those observations in Vermont 9 cases of
general acute peritonitis, 8 of which were cured.All these were
reported in succession, as they occurred, to the medical societies and
in my college lectures.The plan was adopted by many members of these
societies and by others with whom I had opportunity of conversing on
the subject, so that soon there were several--I may say many--workers
in the field; and in all instances where the practitioner had the
courage to carry out the treatment favorable reports were returned.Not
that every case of peritonitis was cured, but the recoveries generally
exceeded those that followed any other plan ever before used.No
physician tried it with a proper understanding of its details, and with
courage to execute them, who if living does not practise it to-day.The treatment of puerperal peritonitis is not allotted to me, and I am
very reluctent to encroach in any degree on the province of the very
competent and highly-esteemed gentleman to whom that disease was
assigned.But the history of the opium treatment is very incomplete
without the statement I am about to make, and I trust to his generosity
to forgive this encroachment; and all the more confidently because he
was not at the time acquainted with the manner in which opium was first
introduced into the treatment of puerperal fever.After the curative action of the drug was demonstrated in general
peritonitis, I was anxious to try it in puerperal fever, of which
peritonitis forms a part.But I had no hospital and no obstetrical
practice.In 1847, I was appointed one of the physicians to Bellevue
Hospital, to which an obstetrical department was attached.After one or
two years a single case occurred and was sent to my division.I gave
her 100 grains of opium in four days, with more or less of calomel--I
have {1147} forgotten how much.She recovered, but after the symptoms
of puerperal fever passed away she had secondary abscesses of the
lungs.In 1840 there was a very fatal visitation of puerperal fever in this
hospital, and on invitation of Vache, who then had charge of the whole
institution, I was a daily visitor and took notes of all the cases.It
was from these notes that Vache compiled his report of the epidemic
published in the _Medical and Surgical Journal_.The disease was
fearfully fatal, although every known mode of treatment was tried in
different cases, including Brenan's plan by turpentine, but all, with
one or two exceptions, with the same result.At this time the opium
plan was on its trial, and I had not acquired a confidence in it that
authorized me to try it in these cases.One woman was sent to me in
whom the disease was well advanced.I instructed my house-physician not
how much opium to give, but what effects to produce by it.I found this
woman dying the next day, and that she had taken only three grains of
opium in three doses.In three or four days seven cases were sent me
from the lying-in wards.One was returned for error in diagnosis, and
six put under treatment.Having found that prudence in my
house-physician was so much more conspicuous than courage, another
house-officer, who combined them both, was selected to be in almost
constant attendance.The instruction I gave him was in these words: "I
want you to narcotize those women to within an inch of their lives."He
did it, and saved every one of them.This gentleman is now known over
the whole land as a learned and distinguished surgeon.I feel called
upon to give his name in this connection, that he may be a witness to
the facts I state, and for the admiration with which his nerve and
prudence impressed me.One of these patients took first two grains,
then three grains, then four, and so on till she took twelve grains of
opium at a dose, the intervals being two hours.The state into which
the patient was to be brought I have denominated a state of
semi-narcotism.The quantity of the drug necessary to produce this
state varied surprisingly in different persons.One of these women was
pretty fully narcotized by four grains every two hours.She was watched
with anxiety; restoratives were kept in readiness, but nothing was done
but to suspend the administration of the medicine and to wait.In seven
hours the consciousness was fully restored, and the improvement in her
condition was wonderful.But in a few
hours more the symptoms recurred, and the same medicine was again given
in three-grain doses, and again narcotism was produced.Taught by the
experience of the day before, we waited, and when she recovered from
this second narcotism her disease was completely cured.She took no
more medicine of any sort.This case was very instructive, as it taught
me that over certain cases of puerperal fever opium has absolute
control.From the time here referred to, so long as the obstetrical service was
maintained at Bellevue Hospital, a large proportion of cases of this
fever, as they occurred, were sent to my wards, and in all these years
I have not lost faith in opium.This statement, however, requires an
explanation.Puerperal fever is a compound disease.Its great
inflammatory lesions are found in the uterus and its appendages and in
the peritoneum.{1148} When the inflammation of the uterus is the
dominant lesion, and is purulent, opium has little or perhaps no
control over its fatality; but in the cases in which peritonitis is the
ruling lesion, if begun early, it will show its power.In this
connection I will only add that in private practice the drug has been
perhaps more curative than in the hospital.I have seen many cases in
consultation, and a decided majority have recovered.In some instances
the patient has fallen into a pleasant sleep, only broken by some
administration, and ending with her recovery.In one instance a very
eminent physician had undertaken to treat a case by the opium plan, but
he had administered the drug so timidly that for fourteen days he had
done no more than hold the disease in check.After trial, I found that
I could not induce him to give the drug in my way, and I asked him to
give me sole charge of the patient for twenty-four hours.To this he
assented, remarking, "If you cure her, doctor, I will have it announced
to the profession that she was the sickest person I ever saw get well."In half the time allowed me I was able to establish the opium symptoms
as given farther on, and the lady slowly recovered.The treatment of any form of peritonitis by opium permits the use of
the drug itself, or of any extract or preparation of it which contains
its narcotic qualities, but it is wise to persevere with that one first
chosen unless there is strong reason for a change.This caution is
based on the fact that we cannot change from one to another and be
certain to obtain the same drug activity.For example, we begin with
laudanum, and find what it will do.We cannot take in its place the
sulphate of morphia with the certainty that we can so graduate it as to
get precisely the same effects.Then the quantity which will be
effectual in one case may be quite inadequate for the next.The
tolerance of opium in different persons varies remarkably, and probably
the disease itself increases the tolerance in all.This will be
illustrated by some of the details of this paper.The drug symptoms to be produced are as follows: Subsidence or marked
diminution of the pain; some or considerable tendency to sleep;
contraction of the pupils; reduction of the breathing to twelve
respirations in the minute; in the favorable cases a considerable
reduction in the frequency of the pulse; a gentle perspiration; an
itchy state of skin, or oftener of the nose; absolute inactivity of the
bowels, and after a time a subsidence of the tumor and tenderness in
them; some suffusion of the eyes.Of these several signs of opiumism there is none more easily observed
and none more valuable than the frequency of the respiration; and while
the physician aims to reduce it to twelve in a minute, there are
chances that he will see it fall to something below that.I have often
counted it at seven, and in perhaps two cases it fell to seven in two
minutes; and yet these cases of marked oppression from opium all
recovered.In the cases in which the respiration has fallen so low
there has been considerable obtuseness of the mind; but in no case
except in the hospital patient already referred to have I seen
unconsciousness.Then the sleepiness, so long as the patient is easily
awakened, is wholly within the limits of safety.As to the quantity of opium to be given, I have known two grains every
two hours do the work, and in other cases many times this {1149}
quantity was necessary to produce this condition of semi-narcotism.The
plan is to begin with a dose that is safe--say two or three grains of
opium or its equivalent of sulphate of morphia--and in two hours notice
its effects.If any of the opium symptoms have appeared, repeat the
dose; if none, increase by one grain, and so on at intervals of two
hours till the degree of tolerance in the patient is ascertained.After
that the case can be treated by a diminished occupation of the
physician's time--two or three visits a day.The dose is to be
increased if the opium symptoms diminish before the disease yields, but
always to be diminished or discontinued if narcotism is approaching.The duration of the treatment will be sometimes no more than two or
three days; it may be a week, or even a fortnight, and in one case
already mentioned the symptoms persisted mildly for forty days, and
then yielded.In this case the medicine used was the sulphate of
morphia, and the enormous dose reached by steady and graduated increase
was one grain and a quarter every forty minutes in a boy ten years old.In some puerperal cases the doses have been so large as to require
witnesses to make the statement of them credible, and the
administration of them criminal had not the effect of each dose been
carefully studied and the amount of each measured by the action or
inadequate action of the next preceding one.Here are the doses given a woman who fell sick October 13, 1857; the
record was made by C. H. Rawson during the treatment, and was kindly
given me two or three years ago: On the first appearance of her
disease, while the diagnosis was uncertain, 10 grains of Dover's powder
gave her a quiet night.The next day the disease was more manifest, and
she took of Magendie's solution (2 grains of sulphate of morphine to a
drachm of water) x minims every hour; growing worse, at night she took
xxx minims every hour; the next day, xl minims every hour, and no
change of symptoms.She took in twenty-four hours 32 grains of sulphate
of morphia; slept, but was awakened by the slightest noise.On the
fourth day 3-1/3 drachms of the solution, and opium as follows: at 4
P.M., 3 gr.; at 5 P.M., 4 gr.; at 6 P.M., 5 gr.; at 7 P.M., 6 gr., and
6 gr.Fifth day, in twenty-six hours
took in opium and morphine the equivalent of 208 gr.of opium; on the seventh day, 221 gr.of opium; on
the eighth, 224 gr.; on the ninth, the same quantity; on the tenth, the
same; on the eleventh, 247 gr., pulse subsiding; on the twelfth, 261
gr., other symptoms better; on the thirteenth, 144 gr.hourly; slept for the first time heavily, all other symptoms
improving, bowels moved freely, ate well, tympanites subsiding;
fifteenth day, 1 gr.of opium every two hours, and at night the last
dose.The woman denied the opium habit, and the
medicines were tested by the apothecary.Such doses can only find their
justification in the demonstrated fact that smaller doses will not
produce the degree of narcotism desired.In Keating's edition of Ramsbotham's _Midwifery_ a case is reported by
myself in which a woman, by pretty rapidly increasing doses, reached
forty-eight grain doses of opium, with the effect of curing her disease
and substituting a temporary active delirium.A word of caution is probably necessary regarding the use of opium in
high doses when peritonitis and Bright's disease coexist.I have {1150}
already said that I have but scanty personal knowledge of such a
concurrence, but in Bright's disease alone I have known a large,
non-heroic dose of an opiate fatal.For example: A young man had a
felon on his finger, and did not sleep, so great was his pain.His
physician prescribed 40 drops of laudanum at bedtime.Not sleeping on
this, he took another portion of 40 drops, and in the morning he was
found in a comatose condition, and in the course of the day he died.A
post-mortem examination revealed Bright's disease, which was not before
suspected.A woman took half a grain of the sulphate of morphine--for
what reason I do not know.I was called to see her when she was in a
semi-comatose state.The time between my seeing her and that of taking
the morphine was fourteen or fifteen hours; its removal from the body
was therefore hopeless.Her limbs were swollen with oedema, and the
urine contained albumen and casts.Although the usual means of opposing
the poisonous effects of opium were resorted to, they were of little
use, and the patient died in the course of the day.These are selected
from a considerable number of similar cases that show a similarity in
their action on the brain of opium and urea.It seems that opium
precipitates the uraemic coma, yet the coma produced by these agents
combined is not so profound as that produced by opium alone.There is
in it some movement of the limbs or body or some imperfect utterances,
yet it seems to be more fatal than the coma of opium unaided.Notwithstanding all this, I have met with several cases of cardiac
disease combined with Bright's--perhaps I should say many--in which
half a grain of morphia sulphate has been taken every night to procure
sleep with only beneficial results.This has been observed several
times when physicians have been the patients.These facts are stated to show the hesitation and prudence that should
control the administration of opium when there is urea in the blood,
whether there is peritonitis or not; but a case in which one form of
Bright's disease preceded, and perhaps caused, peritonitis will be more
instructive: A gentleman sixty-eight years of age was attacked by
peritonitis on Thursday evening.There was a moderate chill at the
onset (this being one of the few cases in which I have witnessed this
occurrence).The diagnosis was then uncertain, and he took quieting
doses of Dover's powder, which gave him sleep.The next day the
diagnosis was easily made.The urine was examined for albumen, and none
found.He took only six-eighths of a grain of
sulphate of morphine in the first twenty hours.It was then increased,
so that in the next twenty-four hours he took two grains of the
sulphate in divided doses--a quantity which has been greatly exceeded
in hundreds of cases with the best results; but in this case coma was
the result.on Sunday he was comatose, but not profoundly;
he could be aroused.The breaths were five in the minute, the pulse
increasing in frequency; secretion of urine next to none.After seven hours, while the respiration was growing
more natural, the pulse grew more frequent and the stupor increased.the breathing was fifteen in the minute, and full and
perfectly easy, but the pulse was running at 140, and the coma
unbroken, and the pupils of good size.The effects of the opiate had
passed off, but those of uraemia were profound.After the alarming symptoms occurred we tried to procure another
specimen of the urine for fuller examination, but {1151} could not.It
was only after his death that we procured the evidences that he had
shown symptoms of contracted kidney for months.The urine contained no
albumen at the time of our examination, as very often happens in that
disease.Regarding other points in the opium treatment there is little to be
said.The bowels should be left
entirely at rest till they recover their muscular tone; then they will
expel first the gas, and then the feces; or if, after the inflammation
is subdued, they do not move of their own accord, injections are
admissible.I have often left the bowels absolutely inactive for
fourteen days without any recognizable consequences.If I meet a
physician who believes that leeches are essential, I yield him his
point, but never advise them.I do this because a moderate bloodletting
will do no harm, and little if any good.The same rule I apply to
irritating applications to the surface of the abdomen.Mercurials, I
think, are harmful, and therefore I object to them.As to food, it
should be milk, fresh eggs beaten up with water and pleasantly
flavored, peptones, etc.selected from among those that leave no
refuse.The testimony of physicians who have adopted this plan within my own
circle is unanimously in favor of it.B. R. Palmer of Woodstock, Vt.,
afterward of Louisville, Ky., who was the first to test it, told me
after a few years' trial that he used to dread peritonitis as he would
dread the plague, but with opium in his pocket he met it cheerfully and
hopefully, as he did a pneumonia.Chalmers of New York, who is known by
many readers of this article, has a very extensive practice, and he
told me lately that he had not had a fatal case of peritonitis in
twenty-two years.From whom did the profession
adopt it?In 1836-37, I visited daily the hospitals of London,
Edinburgh, and Paris, was in frequent intercourse with the physicians
of those cities, and never saw a patient anywhere treated by opium, and
never heard the least allusion to it.I can safely appeal to any
physician who was familiar with the history of the profession before
the year 1840, or for two or three years later perhaps, to inquire
whether anything was generally known regarding this treatment of
peritonitis, or whether he himself ever heard of it.Let the inquiry be
made of Willard Parker of New York or Alfred Stille of
Philadelphia--men of a degree of intelligence and learning that has
made them leaders in the profession--and of all the profession at that
time.I venture to assume that they were as ignorant as I was of what
Graves and Stokes had done.The following fact is significant: In 1843, Graves published _A System
of Clinical Medicine_, the preface of which is dated January, 1843.In
this he says he had previously published essays, lectures, and articles
in several medical journals.In this volume he intends, he says, "to
revise what I have written, and to compress the whole within the limits
of a single volume."There is nothing in the table of contents or
explanatory headings of the several chapters of this volume which
alludes to treating peritonitis by opium.It is fair to infer that the
cases treated in 1823 had made little impression on his mind, and that
he did not think his treatment could take rank as a discovery; and yet
Stokes had made favorable mention of it eleven years before this
publication.Graves, then, did not {1152} publish his cases, and the
first knowledge which the profession could have of them was through
Stokes's paper, published in the _Dublin Journal of Medical and
Chemical Science_, No.Perhaps the reason why Stokes's
paper produced so little impression on the profession may be found in
the fact that first numbers of journals of every sort have few readers.Anyway, it was not till after the opium treatment had attracted much
attention in this country that anybody here knew that Graves or Stokes
had ever had anything to do with it.Besides, Graves and Stokes had
only used opium in cases of perforation, and they had no plan or
symptomatic guide in the use of the drug.There is something new and strange in the following case copied from
the _Medical Record_ of May 12, 1883, under the heading, "Operative
Measures in Acute Peritonitis:" "Dr.Reibel relates the case of a
child, eight years old, suffering from acute idiopathic peritonitis.The disease had resisted all treatment, and the child being,
apparently, about to die, it was determined to open the abdomen with a
view to removing the fluid and washing out the peritoneal cavity with a
solution of carbolic acid.No fluid was
found in the abdominal cavity.In prolonging the incision a loop of the
intestine was punctured, as evidenced by the escape of gas and
intestinal fluid.The wound was washed with carbolic acid and covered
with a layer of antiseptic cotton.The following day the little patient
was nearly free from pain, and was able to retain a little milk.The
temperature had fallen from 104 degrees to 101 degrees, and the
tympanitis was almost entirely gone.The (wounded) loop of intestine
was adherent to the abdominal wall, and there had been no escape of
fluid into the peritoneal cavity.The patient made an excellent
recovery."If the statements of this abstract are true, and the future supports
the practice pursued in this case, acute peritonitis is likely to
become a surgical rather than a medical disease.Reibel thinks that
opening the intestine in the way he did is a better plan than the
punctures with the exploring-needle to relieve the patient of the
tympanitis.But it will require more facts than one to persuade the
profession that this mishap of the scalpel can grow into a rule of
practice.(The _Record_ finds this report in the _Journal de Medecine
de Paris_.)I cannot say that I see the value of a distinction made in 1877 by
Gubler between peritonitis and peritonism.By the latter term is meant
the total of nervous and other symptoms that arise in the course of
peritonitis.Trasour has lately revived this distinction, and thinks it
important, and that a light peritonitis may be attended by a grave
peritonism.He holds that the distinction is important, because "the
treatment of peritonism consists in the administration of alcohol,
chloral, and especially of opium in large doses.Of the latter fifteen
grains may be given in twenty-four hours.""The symptoms [of
peritonism] are produced through the agency of the great
sympathetic."[6]

[Footnote 6: _Med.I cannot say that I have seen great effects follow small causes, but
think that, in general, the effects of peritonitis on the pulse,
strength, nervous tone, etc.are, to some extent at least, a measure of
its severity.CONSEQUENCES OF PERITONITIS.--These are usually nothing.When recovery
takes place it is commonly complete, but cases have been known {1153}
in which the intestines have been left bound to the abdominal wall and
to each other, and so made incapable of their natural action.The
results of this are a swollen, tympanitic abdomen and impaction of the
bowels, but the general health may be very good.A woman at Bellevue
was left in this condition, yet she performed the duties of nurse in
one of the wards for some years, and finally disappeared from the
institution, and I do not know how it ended with her--probably by the
breaking up of the adhesions and a return of the bowels to their
natural condition.In some few cases there remains new tissue, which in time is partly
broken up and remains partly attached.In this manner strings and bands
of considerable strength can be formed, and into these loops the
intestine may pass, so as to form an internal hernia of a very
dangerous character.In some bands are formed across the intestine,
which by contraction flatten the tube and obstruct the fecal movement.There is reason to believe that such bands and bridles are formed by
local inflammation of such imperfect manifestation by symptoms that the
patient knows nothing about it.A very striking case illustrating the
possible sequence of this inflammation came under my observation early
in my professional life: A <DW52> woman about twenty-five years of age
gave a very clear history of a peritonitis from the consequences of
which she had suffered two years before I saw her.About six months
after recovery she began to have constipation and to suffer from small
and frequent discharges of urine.The latter gradually grew milky and
to have a bad odor; the constipation grew more and more, and at length
came to be absolute for many days; then would come a diarrhoea of some
hours' continuance, after which she would have a feeling of relief.She was emaciated, and so feeble as
hardly able to leave her bed.She vomited occasionally, and her
appetite for food was all gone.The urine was heavily loaded with pus,
and was ammoniacal.At post-mortem
examination a firm membrane was found strained across the upper strait
of the pelvis, wholly separating the abdominal cavity from the pelvic.The left posterior border was drawn very
tensely over the colon where it passed into the pelvic cavity,
flattening it down completely and making stricture.To the under or
lower surface the fundus of the uterus and the base of the bladder were
firmly adherent, and in this way both were suspended.The effect of
this unnatural suspension of the inactive uterus did not seem to be
noticeable, but with the bladder it was very different: it contained
three to four ounces of water, ammoniacal and full of pus, and it could
never have emptied itself.During the
peritonitis a false membrane was effused on the pelvic viscera in situ.When the period of contraction which is common to all such structures
came, the new membrane was separated from the greater part of these two
organs, but not from their bases.The firm attachment to the brim of
the pelvis did the rest.So unusual a sequel of peritonitis I think
deserves a record.I should add there were no adhesions above the
pelvis.Such a structure as this, found long after the active symptoms
of peritonitis have passed, as also the bands and cords before spoken
of, does not give support to the doctrine that the false membranes are
broken down into fatty matter, and in this condition absorbed.{1154} The possible remote effects of peritonitis are shown in a case
reported by E. A. Mearns to the _Medical Record_, published Sept.15,
1883: A young man, aged nineteen, four years after he had had acute
general peritonitis was attacked with constipation, which was absolute.He had had before occasional attacks of pain in the bowels and
constipation, which were overcome.He had the
train of symptoms usual in intestinal obstruction.There was no fever
or tympanitis, and this time but little pain.There was a tangle and a constriction of the intestines at the middle
of the ileum, caused by the contraction and hardening of the effusion
of the old peritonitis, and the intestine was very much softened.H. B. Sands reports in another number of the same journal: "The patient
was a man about thirty who had suffered from acute obstruction for a
week.When the abdomen was opened the
intestinal coils were found extremely adherent one to another in
consequence of a former peritonitis.A careful search failed to
discover the nature or seat of the obstruction.The abdominal wound was
closed, and the patient died soon after."There is no part of the gastro-intestinal canal that may not, from one
cause or another, become the seat of ulceration.The jejunum is the
part of the tube long supposed to be an exception to this rule, but
even in it one or two observers have found ulcers.These ulcers often
exist without distinctive symptoms, and may go on to cicatrization
without announcing themselves.In the stomach, however, there are
commonly indications which will admit a conjecture of their existence,
and perhaps a diagnosis.Sometimes these ulcers penetrate all the
tissues of the tube and allow the contents of the intestine to escape
into the peritoneal cavity, or they may have destroyed all but the
external layer, and some succussion, as in coughing, sneezing,
laughing, or perhaps straining at stool, may make the opening complete,
with the same results.In these cases it seems to be inevitable that
inflammation should follow, unless it has preceded, the complete
opening and sealed it up by adhesions.The tendency of such an
inflammation is to be local and limited, but when the contents of
intestines escape into the peritoneal cavity it usually becomes
general.These accidents are usually attended by the sudden development
of local pain, by rapid increase in the frequency of the pulse,
paleness, and prostration.The perforation of the vermiform appendix is
often a partial exception to this statement, for, while the local
symptoms are marked, the sympathy of the general system is not so
quickly awakened.The same can be said of perityphlitis.The symptoms
are often local for some time--a day or more; sometimes subside, as if
the disease were cured, and then return in full form.This is produced
by the tendency of the inflammation to limit itself to the immediate
neighborhood of its cause.Lymph is effused at a short distance from
the point of irritation, and seals the parts together, so as to shut in
the offending substance; and though this substance may produce pus in
contact with intestine or appendix, that {1155} fluid is held for a
time, as in abscess.It may be permanently held in its new-made sac
till it burrows into some near part, as the intestine or bladder, or
remain an abscess till opened by Willard Parker's puncture.On the
other hand, the contents of this sac may be increased till it breaks
bounds and causes extension of the peritoneal inflammation or general
peritonitis.In one particular case this process of setting limits and
breaking through them occurred in a young lady four times at intervals
of from one to two days.When the limiting adhesions were established
symptoms would subside, so as to encourage in her physicians the hope,
even the expectation, of recovery; but again and again the fire was
rekindled, and she died eight days after the first attack.In the
greater number of cases the first breaking of the adhesions is followed
by full peritonitis, and this often by death.The perforations of the stomach which I have seen have not been
attended by the severe pain described by most authors, but by a sudden
prostration of strength and a feeling of disquiet and sinking at the
stomach; more of collapse than of inflammation in the symptoms; no
tumefaction of the bowels; almost nothing to indicate the nature of the
accident, but a sudden new sensation in the bowels, a rapid increase in
the frequency of the pulse, it growing small as it increases in
rapidity, and a pale and shrunken countenance, and death in from twelve
to thirty hours.Then, on inspection, hardly any signs of peritonitis
are found.The peritoneal vessels are fuller and the membrane redder
than in health, and its surface covered with the thinnest possible film
of lymphy exudation, and some serum in the deeper parts of the cavity.These ulcerations of the stomach are not always fatal by peritonitis.A
few instances are recorded in which adhesions of the outer surface of
the organ to adjoining organs have taken place, so as to protect the
peritoneum almost wholly from the fatal contact with the gastric
fluids, and death has occurred in some other way.I have a remarkable
specimen illustrating this fact.It was taken from the body of a woman
of about middle age who had long had symptoms of dyspepsia, and had
from time to time vomited a little blood.It was not difficult to
recognize ulcer, but the extent and peculiarities of it could be
learned only by inspection.She died suddenly of copious haematemesis.On examination an ulcer two and a half to three inches in its several
diameters was found, beginning near the pylorus and extending toward
the left, which in this large space had destroyed all the coats of the
stomach and exposed an inch and more of the right extremity of the
pancreas and about the same extent of the liver.The liver and pancreas
were both perceptibly eroded when exposed, and in the latter an artery
that would admit the head of a large pin was opened.The stomach,
outside of this extraordinary ulcer, was strongly attached to the
adjacent organs.The ulcerations of typhoid fever penetrate the intestine about three
times in a hundred cases of the fever.This result is reached by the
study of a large number of cases, and appears to be pretty generally
admitted.The point where this perforation occurs is in the ileum, near
the ileo-caecal valve--within a foot or eighteen inches of it in the
great majority of cases, although it has been known to occur
seventy-two inches above the valve, and it has been seen very rarely in
the caecum.The fever itself may be either severe or mild.Suddenly
severe pain {1156} sets in, oftenest in the lower part of the abdomen,
and spreads rapidly; the pulse is quickly accelerated and becomes
small; and it has been lately stated that in this and other intestinal
perforations the gases of the bowels, escaping into the peritoneal
cavity, will give resonance to percussion over the lower part of the
liver.Fetid gas found in this cavity after death is not without
importance; for example, a distinguished Senator at Washington died not
long ago of a very painful abdominal disease which his physicians
declined to relieve with opium, though the patient pleaded for it.Although the distance he had to
travel was many hundred miles, he found the patient alive and still
suffering.He at once gave morphine for the relief of the pain, but the
patient died.Now, this gentleman had diabetes a year or more before
his death, recognized by his physician at home and also by myself.While under my observation the urine ceased to contain sugar and its
quantity became normal, but soon after this albumen was occasionally
found in it.The quantity was generally small, and casts were only
found now and then.This new disease was mild, and seemed to be, within
certain limits, manageable.He went to Washington under injunction that
he was not to let official and professional labors bear with any weight
upon him.This last sickness and the death would naturally enough be
supposed to be some new phase or consequence of the previous illness.But, while a post-mortem examination was not permitted, the family
wished to have the body embalmed.The family physician accompanied the
embalmer, and as the latter made a cut through the abdominal walls
there was a gush of air laden with fecal odor, and he through this
opening saw the intestines covered with false membrane.He satisfied
himself that the intestine was not opened.This fetid gas came from the
peritoneal cavity.An ulcer had perforated the intestine somewhere, and
caused the death.The final disease could be only remotely dependent on
the patient's previous illness, if at all.His impaired health may have
made the ulcer possible.All kinds of perforations in the bowels, except those of the stomach,
caecum, and appendix, even the cancerous, have one history and the same
symptoms; and if treatment is ever successful in such occurrences it
must all be based on one set of rules--absolute rest, no pressure on
the bowels, and no movements of the muscles that will aggravate it;
food that will be wholly digested and absorbed by the stomach; complete
abstinence from cathartic and laxative medicines, and the free
administration of opium or morphine.By these means, I fully believe,
numbers have already been saved from the fatal consequences of
peritonitis caused by perityphlitis and perforation of the vermiform
appendix--some under my own observation and others under that of my
friends.A boy fourteen years of age was brought to bed by a pain in
the right iliac fossa.After a few hours his father, a physician,
desired me to see him.There was already a perceptible fulness, with
dulness on percussion, in the fossa, and some febrile excitement.I
gave a portion of morphine, and promised to call the next morning.In
the morning a message came from the father stating that the boy was
better and there was no need of further attendance.The pain had returned, and had spread over most of the
bowels.He took tincture of opium, of which
I believe the largest dose was 100 {1157} drops, reached after three or
four days of gradual but steady increase of dose.From that point the
patient got better, and the quantity of the medicine was
correspondingly reduced.There were a relapse and a repetition of the
treatment, and again the disease yielded.During convalescence, about
fourteen days from the attack, the boy, after emptying his bladder, was
suddenly pressed to continue the discharge.Now he voided what appeared
to be blood, two or three tablespoonfuls.It was, however, pus with
blood enough to color it.This purulent discharge from the bladder
continued for about three weeks, the boy steadily recovering his
health.This occurred twenty or more years ago, and that boy is now a
well-known physician.In 1850, or thereabout, I attended a physician through an attack of
typhoid fever.In the third week there was a sudden outbreak of
peritonitis.The opium treatment was resorted to, and he recovered, and
had good health for twenty years after.Peritonitis occurs rarely in
typhoid fever from any other cause than perforation, and its occurrence
in this case at this time, when perforation is more likely to occur,
renders it probable, at least, that this attack was produced by that
cause.March 3, 1883, autopsy of Wm.Fletcher, age 59, iron-worker.23d, he was attacked with pain in the region of the right
iliac fossa; it was severe.There was no chill, but little fever, and
only slight acceleration of the pulse.His stomach was a good deal
disturbed, and the bowels were soon distended with flatus.I saw him on
the Tuesday following, with James D. Elliott.The bowels were a good
deal swollen and very resonant on percussion; pulse 84.His stomach was
still greatly disturbed, so that he retained no food, yet there was no
green vomit, but much flatulency.The movements in respiration were
particularly noticeable, being nearly or quite as much abdominal as in
health.There was a short friction sound in inspiration, but an entire
absence of the sound produced by peristaltic action.There was no
dulness on percussing over the iliac fossa, and no pain on pressure
over any part of the abdomen.I was careful in examining the right
fossa, for the first pain was there, and it was severe; but there was
no physical sign by which the perforation could be ascertained.Still,
my mind dwelt on the probability of perforation, and I expressed my
fears to Elliott regarding it.The bowels had not moved for two or three days.The next day Flint was added to the consultation.The symptoms had
changed but little; the pulse was 102; no pain, no tenderness, no
peristaltic action; slight friction at one point only; the abdominal
respiration was as marked as before.Frequency of respiration, 18;
patient sleepy; pupils only slightly contracted.When we were in
consultation I again expressed my fear of perforation, but Flint
expressed the most decided opinion as to its absence, because there was
dulness to percussion over the liver.I had read his paper on the
intrusion of gas between the ribs and liver in cases of intestinal
perforation, and felt as if I were almost reproved for entertaining the
thought without this physical corroboration.Thursday, March 1st, the stomach had become much more retentive; there
were no pain and no tenderness on pressure; pulse 109; no friction
sound, no sound of peristaltic action, no dulness on percussion over
right iliac fossa, but resonance over the whole abdomen, excepting over
the {1158} pubes; there the resonance was not clear; over a small space
there was dulness; this was ascribed to moderate fulness of the
bladder, and, as there had been no difficulty in emptying it, nothing
was said of it.The abdominal respiratory movements were the same as
before.Friday morning, at 3 A.M., no marked change had occurred in the
symptoms, but from this time onward there was a steady sinking of the
vital powers.The pulse grew small and frequent, the hands became cool,
the breathing more frequent, and without any sudden change or new
symptom he died early in the morning.At the last visit there was no
resonance on percussion over the liver.Autopsy, Saturday, March 3d, 2 P.M.The bowels were distended, as they
mostly are in peritonitis, but not extraordinarily.There was now
pretty free resonance over the liver.The section to open the abdominal
cavity was carefully made, with the aim of ascertaining whether there
was air or gas in the peritoneal cavity.When a half-inch opening was
made through the peritoneum, gas was forced out through it for some
seconds with an unmistakable noise.The bowels were not opened by this
cut.The bowels exposed, a very thin film of false membrane was found
on all the middle and upper portions of the intestines, with a fringe
of injection where the folds came in contact.But two or three inches
above the symphysis pubis the section opened a collection of pus which
extended downward into the pelvis.Somewhere hereabout--neither of us
could say exactly where--was found a lump of fecal matter, not
indurated, as large as a marrowfat pea, the intestine still unopened.Search was made for the vermiform appendix.At first it was not
recognized on account of its remarkable shortness.It was found,
however, pointing directly toward the median line of the body, and was
short because a part had been separated from the rest by slough.The
end of what remained was marked by a border, one-eighth of an inch
deep, of a very dark-green gangrenous color.We did not attempt to
measure the quantity of pus.It was
completely bounded and shut in by adhesions.At no time during life was there resonance over the liver, but there
was some at the time of post-mortem examination before the bowels were
opened, due perhaps to the fact that at death the relaxation of the
muscles allowed the gas to rise higher than it did during life.The
unusual median position of the abscess is important in accounting for
absence of dulness, when it is usually found in slough or ulcer of the
vermiform appendix."A Fatal Case of Typhlitis without Recognizable Symptoms."Under this
title Jose M. Fisser published a case of inflammation of the vermiform
appendix causing general peritonitis in a young woman nineteen years of
age.The peculiarities of the case were that the appendix was not
perforated, and consequently there was no tumor in the right iliac
fossa--that the symptoms were all referred to the epigastrium, without
even tenderness in the fossa.She walked the floor and tossed about in
bed; the highest temperature was 103 degrees, and the most frequent
pulse was 120, and these continued but a short time.Of tympanitis
there was none till near death, and then but little.The obscurity in
diagnosis led to the publication of the case.The cause of this disease
was fecal matter, not very hard, in the appendix.[7]

[Footnote 7: _Med.{1159} As much has been said in this article on the diagnosis of
peritonitis, it may be well to introduce a case where that diagnosis
was conjectural, and yet quite another state existed.H----, when her disease was advanced, twice.My impression was that she
had peritonitis, but this opinion was held with grave doubt.After her
death, Smith sent me the following record of the autopsy: "Mrs.H----
died Friday evening at ten o'clock; next day, at three in the
afternoon, we made an autopsy.No gas or fluid in the peritoneal
cavity; the small intestines inflated almost to bursting, with
injection of the capillaries.In the left iliac region we at once
discovered a portion of the intestine almost black, and on examination
found a firm white band encircling and constricting that portion.Upon
liberating the gas the intestines collapsed, and the constricted
portion was released and easily removed.A further examination showed
that two of the epiploic appendages, coming off from the colon above
the sigmoid flexure, had united at their extreme points and formed a
loop two and a half to three inches long, and through this loop or ring
a portion of the ileum had passed, and was there constricted.The
constricted intestine was about four feet in length.This examination
has been gratifying to me.There was a small quantity of bloody serum
in the peritoneal cavity low down in the pelvis.The dark grumous blood
that passed the bowels on the second and third days can now be
accounted for, and corroborates your remark that the hemorrhage looked
like strangulation.This must be a new
cause of strangulation, and one that we could not anticipate."There was, before I saw her, a single vomit of a suspicious fluid, but
the evidence was not strong enough to enable us to pronounce it
stercoraceous.Some of the observers noticed bloody serum in the
peritoneal cavity, and perhaps some shreds of lymph, but that was in
consequence of the strangulation.This may occur anywhere in the broad extent of the peritoneum, and will
be more or less limited in different cases, or may be limited for a
time, and then become general.The
product of the diseased action may be serum or lymph or pus, or all of
them.The cause of this local inflammation is sometimes very obvious,
in other cases wholly unknown.The consequences vary all the way from
harmlessness to death; the symptoms are as variable as the
consequences, making the diagnosis easy in some cases, in others
impossible.Some cases in which it was not difficult to recognize it
have already been recorded--those caused by perityphlitis and
perforation of the vermiform appendix, for example.In such cases the
local pain, the swelling, the dulness or resonance on percussion,
depending on whether the tumor is made by inflammatory exudation or
gas, together with the general symptoms and the history, leave but
little ground for doubt regarding the character of the disease.Perhaps
one-half the local abscesses which form between the folds of the
peritoneum are recognizable during life by the local, associated with
the general, symptoms.When situated in the posterior and upper part of
the abdominal cavity, the hand gives little, {1160} perhaps no,
assistance, as in the most widely-known case of abscess that has been
recorded in all time.While the physicians were giving to the country
hopeful reports day by day, thousands of medical men shook their heads
and spoke sadly of the prospects.The illustrious patient was losing
rather than gaining strength and flesh, his appetite poor, his
digestion poor--a strong man growing helpless--and, above all, a pulse
that for months never fell below 100.With an adequate cause of
abscess, whether there were chills or not, what else could it be?Thus,
in peritoneal abscesses that cannot be felt the general symptoms are of
great importance to the diagnosis.When abscesses tend to discharge
their contents soon or late--sometimes into the intestine, sometimes
into the bladder, sometimes externally: in such cases there is a fair
chance.Sometimes they burst into the peritoneum: such cases are almost
inevitably fatal; even opium will not cure them.The pus of these
abscesses often has the fecal odor, which it acquires by the
transmission of the intestinal gases through the intestinal walls.I
was attending, with the late James R. Wood, a young lady in whom
peritoneal abscess had been recognized.It was anterior to the
intestines.In the consultation, while we were discussing the propriety
of using the trocar, the mother became alarmed at the odor and
appearance of the urine just passed, and summoned the doctors back to
the chamber.The urine
contained pus which gave off the fecal odor strongly.It should be added that these abscesses, as well as those of
the convex surface of the liver and those that are post-peritoneal,
sometimes pierce the diaphragm and produce empyema, or by previous
adhesion of the lung to its upper surface find a way into a bronchial
tube, and so the pus is expectorated.The history of local fibrinous exudations is not as easily told as that
of the purulent.We find from time to time, on the peritoneum, bands,
patches, or cords of false membrane, which were produced in so quiet a
way that we can get no information regarding the time when they were
formed, and perhaps the subject of them was not aware that anything was
wrong with the bowels till he began to have the symptoms of
obstruction.The omentum is found thickened and contracted.The mesentery and
mesocolon are seen in a similar condition, causing wrinkling and
shortening of the bowels.The spleen has on its surface patches or even
plates, or one great plate, of firm fibrinous deposit, often
cartilaginous in density, sometimes calcareous; and we can rarely fix
the time of these occurrences by any symptoms.It is not always so with
the liver.We are acquainted with a perihepatitis which is acute,
attended by pain in the right side, a febrile movement, and, if the
inflammation reaches the under surface of the organ, by jaundice, and
have learned to combat this with cups and opiates, the latter in rather
free but not heroic doses, and to expect recovery in a few days.This
may leave the liver wholly or partly invested with a layer of false
membrane which may have a sequel of importance.Then, again, we find
the organ invested with a thick contractile membrane, but cannot learn
that the symptoms of perihepatitis have ever occurred.The diseased
action which produced this bad investment appears to be analogous to
that which not only covers the organ with a thinner coat of similar new
tissue, but inlays it everywhere with the same material in cirrhosis.This also is {1161} unattended by local pain.The effects that may
result from this encasing of the liver in a strong contractile capsule
may be illustrated by the following case (the late Buck was the
physician): The patient was an unmarried lady of middle age who had
consecrated her life to charitable works.In searching for the
suffering poor she often had to ascend several flights of stairs.The
time came when she found this fatiguing and a tax on her respiration.She observed at the same time that the bowels were enlarged.She called
Buck, and he had no difficulty in discovering ascitic fluid.He was
surprised, as he knew that her habits were perfectly good, and she had
very little the appearance of an invalid.Notwithstanding the proper
use of the usual remedies for dropsy, the fluid slowly increased, and
at length he was obliged to draw it off.He found it to be a clear,
yellowish serum.In the course of about two years she was tapped four
times.I saw her, with Buck, after these tappings, when the fluid had
again been effused in quantity that half filled the peritoneal cavity.The emaciation was not considerable; there was nothing of the
semi-bronzed color of the skin so common in cirrhosis of similar
duration; her appetite and digestion were not materially impaired; the
temperature was natural; the pulse was increased in frequency only a
few beats.The skin over the abdomen was in a soft, natural state, and
there was nothing that suggested a hyperaemic or inflammatory dropsy.The liver on percussion appeared to be reduced in size.Taking all
things into account, and especially the patient's habits and the
absence cancerous cachexia, it seemed probable that the dropsy arose
from atrophy of the liver, and that the atrophy was caused by an
adventitious capsule of the organ, although the patient had never had
symptoms of perihepatitis.From this point the fluid did not increase
or diminish, but remained stationary till she died, perhaps two years
after, of some other disease.Meanwhile, the lady resumed her favorite
charity-work to a limited extent.At the post-mortem examination the
capsule was found investing nearly the whole liver, but not materially
obstructing the gall-duct.The new membrane was thick and strong,
having a thickness of at least one-twentieth of an inch.The remaining
liver structure was of natural appearance.The organ was reduced to
one-half its natural size.I have doubted whether any disease deserving this name really exists
independent of such low inflammatory action as may arise from the
irritations of tumors or heterologous deposits.This statement refers
to general not local peritonitis.I have never seen anything that would
lead me to believe that acute diffuse peritonitis can be deprived of
its acute character and still continue an inflammation.With me it has
always been death or cure.I have already referred to a case in which
after recovery the bowels were greatly disturbed by tympanitis for
years.But this came from adhesions: her general health was good.I
have at long intervals met with cases of ascites in which the
peritoneal membrane was redder than natural, and in which no
obstruction to the portal {1162} circulation was discovered.This,
however, I have regarded as hyperaemia rather than inflammation.Bauer,[8] however, gives to these cases the title latent general
peritonitis, especially when after death an abnormal adhesion is found
here and there.In the cases that I have seen there was a peculiar
state of the surface of the abdomen.The skin there was more or less
scaly and dry, but I do not remember whether there were internal
adhesions.Bauer regards the diagnosis of this form of disease as
difficult, but refers to the constantly present meteorism as well as
serous fluid.I have met with three or four instances in which at the
time of puberty an abdominal dropsy has rather suddenly occurred,
lasting one to three months, and disappearing on the use of diuretics.I have had no reason to attribute this effusion to inflammatory action,
except in one case.A lady of extraordinary symmetry and beauty of
form, in excellent health, whom I had treated for this disorder twelve
years before, applied to know whether there was anything in that
disease that would prevent her having children.She had been married
seven or eight years, and had not been pregnant.The question then
occurred to me, At the time of the dropsy could there have been lymphy
exudation that has since confined the ovaries in an unnatural position?The treatment which Bauer prefers for
his latent peritonitis consists in "painting with iodine, the use of
diuretics, and the regulation of diaphoresis by means of Turkish
baths."[Footnote 8: _Cyclopaedia of the Practice, etc._, vol.Another form of general chronic peritonitis is, according to Bauer,
that which follows acute peritonitis.He quotes several authorities in
support of his views.I must draw on him for a description of it, for,
as I have said, practically I know nothing about it.The symptoms of acute peritonitis are all toned down, but do not all
disappear.Vomiting occurs occasionally; tenderness is diminished, but
is quite perceptible; meteorism diminishes, but fluctuates greatly;
appetite is poor or variable; constipation alternates with diarrhoea or
is followed by dysentery; now there is a febrile heat, and then the
temperature is normal--this fever is most likely to come in the
evening; the pulse is frequent and varying; ultimately extreme
emaciation and anaemia.The most striking feature of this condition
appears to be sacculation of the fluid in the abdomen, wholly or
partially; this fluid then is not freely movable, but will give dulness
on percussion, which may contrast well with intestinal resonance in its
immediate neighborhood.When the tension of the abdominal wall is
diminished these sacs can be felt by the hand as uneven tumors.Colicky
pains occur, and in a case cited it was at one time very severe, at
another only slight.The majority of the cases terminate, after a
protracted course, fatally.Recovery may occur by absorption or
external evacuation of the fluid.Bauer makes still another class of cases of chronic peritonitis--those
arising in the course of old ascites; he, however, does not make much
out of it.He thinks the cases of this kind occur with cardiac and
hepatic disease, and particularly with the nutmeg liver.The symptoms,
he admits, are neither well defined nor severe, and the anatomical
changes consist "in thickening of the serous membrane by a slight
deposit of fibrin, {1163} slight turbidity of the ascitic fluid, and a
few flakes of fibrin suspended in it."He then, strangely, gives, as if
they were illustrations of such a disease, two cases in which death by
acute peritonitis followed the last of many tappings, in one of which a
pool of pus was found encysted in front of the intestines.Probably most practitioners who are in the habit of making post-mortem
examinations have seen the flakes of lymph in the ascitic fluid, etc.,
but the German physicians have been the first, I believe, to regard
such cases as belonging to separate forms of disease.William Pepper has published[9] a case observed by himself and G. A.
Rex which shows non-malignant chronic peritonitis better than any I can
recall to mind.The report forms the sequel to the case of the young
woman on whom he successfully performed paracentesis of the
pericardium.This young woman began to have double pleuritic effusion, and this was
soon followed by ascites three and a half months after the operation.From that time the ascites was better or worse, but did not wholly
leave her, and became considerable before her death.This was sudden,
she having some convulsive movements in extremis.Lesions were found in
the thoracic cavity like those discovered in the abdominal, showing, it
was believed, a special tendency in this person to plastic exudation on
the serous membranes."The lower part of the abdomen was found occupied
by an extensive effusion.There
were few if any signs of inflammation of the intestinal peritoneum, but
marked changes were observed in the parietal peritoneum and in the
capsules of the liver and spleen.The peritonitis was most marked in
the upper segment of the abdomen, while the parietal membrane presented
large patches of irregular thickening.No tubercles were found on any
part of the peritoneum.The capsules of the liver and spleen were
greatly thickened, whitish, opaque, and densely fibrous.The liver was
enlarged and heavy, and so tightly bound by its thickened capsule that
its shape was somewhat altered."The diaphragm, especially that part of it underlying the pericardial
sacs, had undergone marked fibroid degeneration.The muscular tissue
was much atrophied; many fasciculi had evidently disappeared, while
many others were markedly narrowed, some of them shading off to a width
of less than 1/3000 of an inch, and finally disappearing altogether.They retained, however, even in their narrowest dimensions, their
transverse striae."(It may be remarked, in passing, that this substitution of fibrous for
muscular tissue follows the same law that it does in the heart when
that organ is the seat of fibrosis or fibrous degeneration.Here it was
supposed to be the consequence of a low grade of inflammatory action.In the abdomen these observers found nothing which suggested the
possibility of tubercles or any obscure form of cancer.In the
pericardium, on the heart side, were found numerous small nodular
roughnesses.Irregularities of the pericardial false membrane are so
common that nothing but the close and universal adhesions would raise
any question of these relations.But tubercles would hardly be here and
nowhere else.{1164} Delafield says that one form of the chronic disease is the
continuance of his cellular peritonitis.In this, he says, the surface
of the omentum is covered with cells which look as if they were derived
from the endothelium and connective-tissue cells, although they differ
from the normal shape of these.The new cells are for the most part
polygonal, of different size, with one or several nuclei, and
giant-cells--large granular masses filled with nuclei.Although these
new cells are produced over the entire surface of the peritoneum, yet,
as a rule, they are more numerous in little patches here and there.These little patches may be heaped together in such numbers as to form
nodules visible to the naked eye.There is never any stroma between
these cells.This form of peritonitis occurs most frequently with organic heart
disease, with cirrhosis of the liver, with chronic pulmonary phthisis,
and with acute general tuberculosis.In the two latter diseases he
thinks they have been improperly called tubercles.He describes a form of chronic adhesion of peritoneal surfaces that
occurs without the intervention of fibrin, but, as he supposes, by
coalescence of the branching cells and a production from them of a
fibrillated basement substance, the fibrils crossing in all directions.In the midst of these fibrils he finds the nuclei of these cells.He
finds also in the immediate neighborhood of these adhesions thousands
of branching cells that are attached one to another and float free in
the water, the fixed end being attached to the peritoneum.He regards
such a peritonitis with adhesions as a more advanced stage of the forms
of cellular peritonitis already described, and the new cells are
changed into membrane.Sayre has published an extraordinary case in the _Transactions of the
Pathological Society_.He calls it chronic proliferative peritonitis;
it might be called more aptly the consequence of peritonitis.A large, strong man fell from a hammock, the rope breaking, upon his
shoulders, and felt a severe pain in his stomach, and soon developed
symptoms of peritonitis.About one month after he was tapped, and
240 ounces of serum were drawn.He was tapped one hundred and
eighty-seven times, and 1203-5/16 pounds of fluid were taken from him
during the remainder of his life.The liver and spleen were covered by a
thick layer of false membrane, intestines were glued together in the
upper part of the abdomen, and the stomach was adherent to the lower
surface of the liver.The portal vein was contracted by this membranous
coating.There were numerous other lesions in the heart and pleura, but
these will account for the dropsy.This man was unusually strong and hearty until 1876, when he had an
attack of double pleuro-pneumonia, and in 1878 he slipped on the front
steps and fell, but seemed to recover from the effects of this.The
fall from the swing occurred in July, 1879.[10]

[Footnote 10: _Med.{1165} Tubercular Peritonitis.This form of disease is by no means uniform in its first symptoms or in
its progress.The only things uniformly attending it are tubercles on
the peritoneum and more or less of inflammatory effusion, chiefly lymph
and serum; tumor and hardness of the bowels, general or local; deranged
function of the stomach and intestines; emaciation; and extreme
fatality.In some cases the invasion is acute and marked--a chill followed by
fever, vomiting, early development of meteorism, and in a few days a
point or points of resistance to pressure, but not necessarily dulness
on percussion.In a few days the febrile action and the meteorism may
subside, leaving the symptoms of local peritonitis.But we have not
long to wait for a renewal of them and an evident extension of the
inflammatory action.Remission and relapse alternate at varying
intervals, until the whole extent of the peritoneal surface seems to be
involved in inflammation.With this mode of development meteorism may
not be renewed in the most common way.The lymphy product of
inflammation may so bind the intestines to the posterior walls of the
abdomen that they cannot extend forward, but are pushed upward against
the liver and diaphragm, and so encroach on the thoracic space.But
then the anterior parietes are tense and hard, and do not move in
respiration.The febrile heat may not continue more than two or three
months, but the pulse will be frequent to the end.There will be a
thinning of bowel walls, and here and there a knuckle of adherent
intestines may cause some prominence and give some resonance on
percussion.There will be also occasional vomiting, and the dejections
will be irregular--maybe only deficient or thin; there may be an
alternation of constipation and diarrhoea.Tuberculous ulcerations of the mucous layer of the bowels is not
uncommon in tubercular peritonitis, and these ulcers have in rare cases
perforated and allowed the fecal matter to accumulate in considerable
quantity in a sac limited by previous adhesions.In all forms of
tubercular peritonitis death is caused as often by grave complications
as by what appears to be the primary disease.The affection occurs in
probably every instance in those who had at the beginning, or had
acquired in its progress, what we call the tubercular diathesis.We are
not surprised, therefore, to find on inspection a wide diffusion of
tubercles in the body, particularly on other serous membranes, and in
the lungs.Death may occur, then, from phthisis pulmonalis or from
pleurisy or meningitis, as well as from the exhaustion and accidents of
the peritoneal disease.The effusion serum or turbid serum is very
common in tubercular peritonitis, and can be recognized by the dulness
it produces in part of the cavity, and sometimes by fluctuation.It is
often sacculated, but it is not constantly found after death, it having
been absorbed before, and perhaps long before, that event.In other cases the invasion of the disease is stealthy and deceiving.It comes so quietly that the patient is not conscious of any local
disorder beyond a dyspepsia and irregular action of the bowels.He has
a pulse of growing frequency, but if he knows it he ascribes it to his
dyspepsia.He is slowly losing flesh and strength; this he accounts for
in the same way.At length a perceptible swelling of the bowels
attracts his attention.At this stage the physician finds that the
swollen bowels are tympanitic everywhere or only in the upper, while
there is evidence of fluid {1166} effusion in the more depending,
parts.He discovers some, it may be little, tenderness on pressure, and
a pulse of 85, or maybe 90, increasing in frequency toward evening.The
appetite is poor, the digestion slow, and occasionally there is
vomiting; the complexion is pale and a little dingy; the skin of the
abdomen may be dry and rough or may be natural; some colicky pains have
been or soon will be felt.From this point the disease gradually
advances.The distension of the bowels slowly increases or they are
firmly retracted; the emaciation increases; the strength diminishes;
there is often cough, which is generally dry; the bowels are slow or
diarrhoea alternates with constipation; with the distended bowels there
is always more than natural resonance on percussion, except when there
is fluid effusion, though not often the full tympanitic sound observed
in acute diffuse peritonitis.This resonance is not equal, always, in
different parts of the abdomen; the respiration is embarrassed and
almost wholly thoracic.The abdomen is often as large as that of a
female at full term of pregnancy, and indeed the condition has been
mistaken for pregnancy.This is an inexcusable blunder in a case like
that which I have in mind--a young unmarried woman.She had no dulness
on percussion in the space that would be occupied by the gravid uterus,
but rather resonance.The case might have been a little less clear if
there had been fluid effusion in the abdominal cavity, but if this were
not encysted it would flow from one side of the abdomen to the other
when the patient turned correspondingly in bed; if it was encysted,
there would be small chances that it would have the shape and position
of the gravid uterus; if it had, there would be no chance of hearing in
it the foetal heart or feeling the foetal movements; and after all this
there remains the experimentum crucis--a vaginal examination.Some aid is found,
possibly, in the medical history of the family, in tuberculous
antecedents, yet I remember cases in which no phthisis could be found
in any living or dead member of the family on the paternal or maternal
side as far back as it could be traced.Some aid is found if the
patient himself has any of the physical or rational indications of
pulmonary phthisis, and yet there are recorded cases in which the
abdominal symptoms were the first to appear.The prominent German
physicians attach great importance to the pre-existence of a cheesy
mass or degeneration somewhere in the body as the real parent of
tubercles wherever they appear.The truth of this doctrine, I do not
think, has received anything like universal recognition; and if it had,
as this cheesy degeneration is often, perhaps commonly, only
discoverable after death, it could rarely give any assistance in
diagnosis, so that the early diagnosis is always difficult, and a very
early one often impossible.But as time goes on, and the symptoms are
better defined and show themselves one after another as they are above
described, it seems as if a careful observer could not confound it with
anything except perhaps one of the other forms of chronic peritonitis
or cancerous peritonitis.As to the latter, the cough which exists in
most cases of tubercular peritonitis will assist in the distinction,
but a physical examination much more; for a cough does not always
attend phthisis when this disease exists; for example, I visited a
daughter of one of the distinguished gentlemen of Vermont.She had had
the bowel symptoms that indicated tubercular peritonitis for eight or
ten months, and the diagnosis was not {1167} difficult.Remembering
Louis's opinion that if tubercles invade any other part of the body,
they are likely to be found at the same time in the lungs and in a more
advanced condition, I examined the lungs, and found in the upper part
of the right a cavity so large that it could have received a fist.I
was only surprised by the fact that she did not cough, and had not
coughed.She herself assured me of that (she was twenty-one years old);
her physician, who was present at the visit, had never heard her cough,
and had no suspicion of any pulmonary complication; but, more than all,
her mother, who had walked with her, slept with her, eaten with her,
travelled with her, and from the beginning of the illness had not been
out of her company more than twenty minutes in any twenty-four hours
since the disease began, had never heard her cough.Here, then, the
nervous deviation to the abdomen, or whatever else it may have been,
had so benumbed the sensibility of the pulmonary nerves that the
alarm-bell of phthisis had never been sounded; but the cavity, had
there been any doubt whether the bowel disease was cancerous or
tuberculous, would have almost fully settled the question.But more of
the peculiarities of cancerous peritonitis a little farther on.The lesions of this disease (or its pathological anatomy) differ
considerably, but the differences are in the amount of tuberculous
deposit and the secondary results, not in the real nature of the
disease.Lebert has published among his plates of pathological anatomy
one which shows the peritoneum thickly sprinkled over with small
tuberculous grains, and represents each particular grain surrounded by
a little zone of inflammatory injection.There is yet no exudation, but
that would soon follow.A fibrinous exudation will soon come over this
primary deposit, and undergo a kind of organization, or at least get
blood-vessels, which in their turn can furnish the material for a new
crop of tubercles.These again provoke a new layer of fibrous tissue,
which also becomes studded with tubercles, and so on, till a thick
covering is formed over the intestines.But the same material is
interposed between their folds, separating one from another and
compressing them and diminishing their calibre; at the same time this
agglomerated mass is firmly adherent to the abdominal walls everywhere.The new material may have a thickness of half an inch or even more.I
remember how surprised and confused I was when I made my first
inspection of such a case.The abdominal walls were cut through, but
they could not be lifted from the intestines, but were firmly adherent
to something.They were carefully dissected off and the bowel cavity
(?)exposed; there was apparently an immense tumor filling the whole
space: no intestines, no viscera, could be seen.A section was made
through this mass from above downward, and another parallel with it and
an inch distant from it, and this part removed.It appeared like a
large, hard tumor, through which the intestine made several
perforations.The new material appeared to be fibrous, with
grayish-white tubercles sprinkled in through it everywhere, and pretty
abundantly.In another case this fibro-tubercular material may occupy
one part of the abdomen, and a large serous cyst or serous cysts
another.The tuberculo-fibrous material may be found in markedly less
quantity than is so far described, till there will be no more than in a
case from Ziemssen's clinique, quoted by Bauer: "In the peritoneal
cavity about four liters of yellowish-brown, slightly turbid fluid.Omentum {1168} thickened, stretched, adherent to the anterior wall of
the abdomen and beset with hemorrhages; the same was true of the
parietal peritoneum; between the hemorrhages whitish-yellow and
entirely white tubercles occur, varying in size from the head of a pin
to a lentil.The
intestines intensely inflated; a number of ulcers on the mucous
membrane, one approaching perforation.Covering of the liver thickened
by fibrinous deposition."The lungs and serous membranes generally will, in all probability, show
more or less of tubercular deposit, the pericardium less frequently
than the others.The result in this affection, after it is fully established, is
believed to be uniformly fatal, and at its commencement the difficulty
of diagnosis may lead one to doubt whether his apparent success is
anything better than apparent.Still, a plan which I have relied on is,
I believe, worth announcing.As soon as the disease is recognized the
patient is put upon the use of the iodide of potassium and the iodide
of iron, in full average doses, and a solution of iodine in olive oil
is applied to the whole surface of the abdomen by such gentle friction
as will produce no pain; and after a minute or two of such friction the
oil is brushed thinly over the surface and the whole covered with oiled
silk.The quantity of iodine to
an ounce of oil will vary considerably in different persons; for some,
seven to ten grains will be enough; for others, thirty will be needed.The iron is to make the application moderately irritating, and if it
produce pinhead blisters or blisters a little larger, all the better.When the application becomes painful the oil is washed off, and the
application is not renewed for two or three days.In this manner it may
be continued for two or three months.Meantime, the patient is put upon
the diet and regimen of the consumptive, the appetite encouraged; he
takes sustaining food, with plenty of milk and cream, or cod-liver oil,
as much fresh air as possible, and friction is applied to other parts
of the body with dry flannel.Benign tumors of the abdomen are not frequently the cause of general
peritonitis, and when they are, the grade of the disease is acute
rather than chronic.They very often provoke local inflammation and
become adherent to the neighboring structures.The same is true of
malignant growths in the abdominal cavity, except that the adhesions
are earlier formed and more likely to occur.Localized cancer, of
whatever variety, is not very prone to produce general peritonitis,
even though there be multiple developments of it.But when the disease
takes the disseminated form, and is sprinkled over the whole extent of
the peritoneum, then inflammation is almost certain to occur--not of
high grade, and yet deserving the name subacute rather than chronic.A
case which illustrates this statement has come under my observation
within the last year.I will recite it with sufficient detail to make
it intelligible.A lady about forty years of age had, up to the summer of 1881, enjoyed
very good health, though she was never robust.At that time she felt
her strength abating and her stomach disordered.She sought {1169}
health in various places, and took professional advice in September.It
availed her little; the bowels were gradually swelling and fluctuation
could be felt.There was not a
cachectic countenance, but the features were growing sharp.She had
suffered but little from pain till October.At that time she was at the
family country home.Then she began to suffer from a severe pain in the
left thigh; and this, it was noticed, increased as the accumulation in
the bowels increased, and at length her physician felt compelled to tap
her--not so much on account of great distension of the bowel as in the
hope of relieving the pain.He drew off nine quarts of gluey, viscid
fluid, and her pain was wholly relieved.Twelve or fifteen days after
this she was brought to her city home, and her city physician, seeing
that her case was a grave one, sought the aid of a distinguished
gynaecologist.She was then again tapped to give him a more
satisfactory examination.He found the ovaries considerably enlarged
and hard.They could not, however, be felt by pressing the fingers into
the pelvis from above--only by the vagina.I saw her on the 10th of
November.The fluid had again made considerable tumefaction of the
bowels, and she was again suffering great pain in the region of the
right kidney and in the leg of the same side, together with cramps.The
relief given by the first tapping induced us to propose its repetition.It was, however, delayed till the 14th, that the physician who had
tapped her before might be present and assist.The quantity of water
drawn was again nine quarts, and again the pains and spasms were
quieted.It was
nearly clear, reddish, of syrupy flow and consistence, and so viscid
that while a portion of it had remained on the slide of the microscope
long enough for the examination of its constituents the thin cover
became so firmly attached to the slide that it could not be removed
without breaking or long maceration.The albumen was so abundant that
the fluid was completely consolidated on boiling.Fibrinous threads
were running through it in great numbers, and here and there was a cell
of large size, round, granular, but not plumped up with granules, with
a nucleus barely less in size than the cell itself; its outer border
within, but only just within, the boundary or wall of the cell.It was
the nucleus that was granular, for there was little room for granules
between the nucleus and the cell wall.The vial containing the fluid
had been standing three or four hours for a sediment.This in a vial
four inches high occupied the lower half, and gave nothing to the
dropping-tube till the sedimentary matter was drawn into it by suction.This matter consisted of fibrillated fibrin in large quantity; a great
number of the cells just described, some grouped, but most separate or
single.There were pus-cells in moderate quantity, each having the
amoeboid movements, and a considerable number of red blood-corpuscles,
some of natural form, some crenate.Immediately after the tapping the flaccid condition of the abdominal
walls admitted an examination.A solid, hard mass was found running
across the upper part of the bowels, a nodule of which was lying on the
stomach at the point of the ensiform cartilage.A harder mass of
irregular shape was also found just above the pelvis on the right side,
extending upward and to the right.This was in extent two by three
inches.The ovary, however, could not be detected by pressure from
above {1170} downward.The diagnosis up to this time was hardly
doubtful, but these revelations made it complete, and crushed any
lingering hope of the patient's recovery.While the pain and spasm ceased after the tapping, the oedema of the
left leg, which came on some time before the last tapping, did not
diminish.The hard spot near the right iliac fossa was tender on
pressure, but otherwise hardly painful.While the fluid did not exceed
six quarts or so, she had little pain anywhere.There were no external
glandular swellings.Her appetite was poor, and she took but little
food.She vomited very little till the end was approaching.The urine
contained a few globules of pus, some pigment matter, two or three
hyaline casts, but no trace of albumen.For sixteen days following
November 14th the patient was comfortable, but the fluid was slowly
filling the bowels again.At that time the pains already referred to
began to return.On December 5th they required another tapping, and
preparations were made for it, but vomiting, rather severe, led to its
postponement to the next day.The quantity of fluid drawn was nine and
a half quarts.It was of the same syrupy consistence as that previously
drawn, and under the microscope showed exactly the same constituents
and gave the same quantity of albumen.The next day stercoraceous
vomiting commenced, with no movement of the bowels, except what was
produced by 10 grains of calomel given on the second day of this
vomiting.She after
this took no food by the mouth, but milk and beef-tea were injected
into the rectum.Still, the fecal vomiting returned, and she died on
the 15th.The post-mortem examination was made on the 17th by William H. Welch.His report is complete as to the main features of
the case, though it does not furnish an explanation of the spasms and
the oedema of the left leg, regarding which Welch was not informed.The
pain and spasm were doubtless due to backward pressure of a diseased
part on a nerve or nerves, and the oedema to a narrowing of the iliac
vein by pressure or constriction by fibro-cancerous matter on its outer
sides."The peritoneal cavity," he says, "contained somewhat over a
gallon of clear, yellow serum.Both the visceral and parietal layers of
the peritoneum were thickened, in some places more than in others; this
was especially marked on the anterior of the stomach and on the lower
part of the ileum and in the left iliac region.The omentum was greatly
thickened and retracted into a firm mass (or roll), which extended
somewhat obliquely across the body, more to the left than to the right.The mesentery was much thickened and contracted, drawing the intestines
backward.In a few places only was the peritoneal surface coated with
fibrin, and the intestines were mostly free from adhesions.The coils
of the lower part of the ileum, however, were firmly matted together by
organized connective tissue in such a way that they were twisted, often
at a sharp angle, so as greatly to constrict the calibre of the gut.The serous and muscular layers of the intestine at this point were
greatly thickened.By these causes there appeared to be a complete
obstruction at a point about six inches above the ileo-caecal valve.By
careful dissection these coils were straightened out, so as to remove
the main cause of obstruction.The peritoneal covering of the liver was
adherent to the parietal layer.{1171} "The surface of both the visceral and parietal peritoneum was
studded over with hundreds of small, firm, whitish nodules, generally
not larger than a pea, and often not larger than a pin's head.In some
places they had coalesced and made firm patches an inch in extent.This
same material was found in the contracted omentum in considerable
quantity.In a few places, particularly on the uterus, a blackish
pigmented deposit appeared."The ovaries were not adherent, but both were enlarged to the size of a
hen's egg.The outer surface of each was rough and corrugated.The new
growth was deposited on the exterior and penetrated each a quarter to
half an inch.It was of uniform white color and of firm consistence."The stomach wall was thickened nearly throughout its extent, but
particularly in the anterior part, where it amounted to thrice the
normal thickness.This consisted wholly of hypertrophy of the muscular
coat and increase of fibrous tissue in the peritoneal layer.This new
growth was traced, in the interlacing bands, from the surface into the
muscular coat.In the outer layer of the stomach were found three small
white nodules.The mucous membrane of the organ was healthy or a little
pale."The retro-peritoneal glands along the aorta were enlarged, soft, and
of a reddish-gray color.A nodule was found in the wall of the duodenum
outside the mucous membrane, and one in the Fallopian tube."Every organ in the abdomen and chest was examined, but nothing
important found except what is here recorded.Welch concludes his
record with the following diagnosis: "Primary scirrhous carcinoma of
the ovaries.Secondary deposits in the peritoneum, in the outer layer
of the right Fallopian tube, of the stomach and duodenum, and in the
retro-peritoneal glands.This case presents to the reader so accurately the usual course of
cancerous peritonitis, and the inspection its lesions, that a treatise
on the subject is hardly called for.It often happens that cancerous
antecedents in the patient or his relatives will lend an aid to the
diagnosis, which this case did not present.To distinguish this disease
from tubercular peritonitis no question can arise except in its
dropsical form, and then the lungs in every case of the latter that I
have met with have the physical signs of tubercles, though not always
the rational indications.The pulse is much more accelerated in the
tuberculous variety.I omitted to state that the temperature of this
patient was often taken, and till the closing scene was never found
more than one or two degrees above the healthy standard, and the
morning and evening heat did not materially vary; the opposite of both,
then, would be expected in a tuberculous case.The existence of
meteorism is much more common in the tubercular disease; indeed, in the
cancerous case recited there was none of it.The duration of the two is
different--that of the cancerous kind is recorded in months, while the
tuberculous variety may continue two years.The cancerous is more
likely to be attended by alarming accidents, like the complete
obstruction of the bowels, large hemorrhages, and a sudden lighting up
of acute peritonitis.Finally, in the light of the case here recorded,
it seems probable that the examination of the abdominal fluid will
become of great importance.I have never carefully examined the fluid
of tubercular dropsy, but it does not seem probable that it will have
the syrupy {1172} appearance, the large amount of albumen, the
abundance of fibrin-fibres, and the granular large cells with nuclei
only perceptibly less in size than the cells themselves, that were
repeatedly found in this case--found by two observers, and at every
tapping after the first.TREATMENT cannot be curative; it therefore consists of such
administrations as will relieve pain, give sleep, improve the appetite,
increase the flow of urine if it be scanty, and relieve the bowels if
there is a tendency to constipation.It is as much the duty of the
physician to put off the fatal day, when he can, in incurable
affections as it is to cure those that will yield to his prescription
and advice.In the case just narrated opium or an opiate alone produced
such unpleasant after-effects that she was unwilling to take it, but
when the extract of belladonna was given with it she slept pleasantly,
and could take her food the next day.Infantile Peritonitis, or Peritonitis of Childhood.Bauer, in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaedia of Practice of Medicine_, and
Wardell, in _Reynolds's System of Medicine_, have each devoted a
chapter to this form of disease.They refer to the fact that the foetus
may have peritonitis before birth or be born with it, or may have it
when a few days old.They say that this form of the disease occurs most
frequently in lying-in asylums or foundling hospitals, and that it has
been supposed to depend on a syphilitic taint.They say, too, that it
follows erysipelas, scarlet fever, measles, etc.I do not perceive that
the description of either of these authors makes any marked distinction
between this and the same disease in adults, except what may arise from
the inability of the infant to describe its sensations, and the more
rapid course of the disease to a fatal result--in some cases
twenty-four hours.Having myself had no obstetrical practice, or next
to none, I have nothing to add to their statements, and can from my own
knowledge abate nothing.I therefore refer the reader to these
chapters, and to the references given by the first of these authors,
for a fuller knowledge of the matter.Regarding the comparative exemption of children, after the first few
weeks of life, from spontaneous peritonitis, referred to by one of
these authors, I can fully confirm his statement.Though I have
assisted in the treatment of many children suffering from peritonitis,
I have difficulty in recalling to mind a single case in which the
disease was not caused by perforation of the intestine or vermiform
appendix of the caecum, and in much the greatest frequency perforation
of the appendix.B. F. Dawson,[11] after reciting a case in which the liver had
undergone a peculiar degeneration and was attended by peritonitis
before birth, states that Sir J. Y. Simpson observed nine cases in his
own practice "and notes more than a dozen from different sources."These cases seemed to have been caused by the ill-health of the mother
during gestation, or excessive labor, injuries, venereal disease, and
were mostly attended by grave disease; the viscera often, the liver;
but sometimes the mother was perfectly healthy, and the peritonitis was
the primary disease.Death almost always occurred in utero or shortly
after birth.Record_ takes the following from _Schmidt's
Jahrbucher_ for Jan.Oscar Silbermann recognizes two
varieties of peritonitis in the new-born.The non-septic or chronic is
developed usually in the first third of foetal life, and is generally
syphilitic in origin.If the peritoneum covering the intestines be
involved, as well as that over the liver and spleen, various forms of
intestinal obstruction may result.Most frequently there is occlusion
of the anus, less often stenosis or complete stricture of the small
intestine.Of a number of cases of congenital occlusion of the
intestine collected by the author, all ended fatally, only one living
beyond twelve days."The second, acute or septic, form of peritonitis in the new-born the
author divides into two varieties, according as the peritonitis is only
a part of general infection or is the sole manifestation of the septic
poison.In either case the point of entrance of the poison is always
the navel wound.The symptoms, which need not all be present in a given
case, are vomiting, watery stools, meteorism, ascites, abdominal
tenderness, icterus, etc.The pulse and temperature may vary in degree
in different cases.A cure of the septic form is possible; therefore
the treatment should be carefully considered.The navel wound should be
cleansed, and the child is to be isolated from its mother.To control
the fever quinine may be given.Priessnitz's sheet is of value;
vomiting may be checked by chloral (one-half to one grain in water).The strength should of course be maintained by stimulants if
necessary."The accumulation of fluid indicated by this name has already been
referred to in its relations to several causes.There are, however,
conditions producing it which have not been considered or only
considered partially.The most prolific source of abdominal dropsy is obstruction of the
portal circulation on its way to or through the liver.Condensation of
the liver structure in cirrhosis, with destruction of many of the
portal capillaries and compression of many more, is prominent in this
connection.The compression of the liver caused by an adventitious
external covering, referred to under the head of Local Peritonitis,
acts similarly, whether it compresses the vein at its entrance into the
liver or not, although it is not known to produce any destruction of
the portal capillaries.Some enlargements of the organ are attended by
the same result, but they are always associated with a hardening of its
structure.The disease lately called waxy liver, now often denominated
lardaceous, belongs to this class, as does that condition in which the
organ is enlarged, hardened, and fissured, regarded as syphilitic
liver.That both these diseases may have a syphilitic and mercurial
origin is not a point now under consideration.They both harden the
hepatic structure and obstruct the portal circulation, while they may
not in equal degree hinder the progress of arterial blood.This is
explained when we remember the diminished force that propels the portal
blood.Neither of these diseases produces dropsy early in its progress,
but, as I have seen it, always before it reaches its fatal termination.Fatty liver has not, in my observation, produced dropsy, {1174}
although I have seen livers made very large by that disease, and the
absence of dropsy when the liver has been large has aided me in
distinguishing it from the waxy disease.Cancer of the liver in some
instances does, and in others does not, produce dropsy of the bowels.It is only certain to have this result when a tumor is in position to
press upon and obstruct the portal.Hypertrophy of the liver, caused by
mitral regurgitation or other disease of the heart, does not generally
produce dropsy, but, aided by anaemia or watery condition of the blood,
such a result is possible.In children, however, it is not very rare to
see the bowels distended by dropsy, and to discover that the liver is
enlarged at the same time.It is common in such cases that the dropsy
and the hypertrophy disappear after a few weeks of treatment.This may
occur in a child that is anaemic, but without any disease of the heart.Such a case was brought to me two or three months ago, and after four
weeks of treatment by tonics and diuretics the health was
re-established.There is one point in these cases of some importance.When the child lies on his back, if the abdomen is much distended, the
liver cannot be felt.It has sunk away into the fluid, and in this
position ordinary percussion cannot ascertain its dimensions.In the
July number (1840) of a quarterly journal edited by Swett and Watson, I
published an article in which I reported the conjoined labors of the
late Camman and myself on a new method of combining auscultation and
percussion, with its results, under the heading "Auscultatory
Percussion."By the method described in that article--viz.by placing a
solid stethoscope, or for that Laennec's first stethoscope, a rolled-up
pamphlet, on the chest at a point where the liver has not fallen away
from its walls, and percussing on the abdomen from below upward--a
point is reached whence the percussion sound is brought sharply to the
ear, while half an inch below the sound is dull and distant.The lower
edge of the liver is thus easily recognized, and its upper boundary is
found in a similar manner or by ordinary percussion, so the difficulty
of measurement disappears.In such case, when the dropsy disappears and the liver recovers its
natural dimensions at the same time, the inference is that the
hypertrophy caused the dropsy, and that the hypertrophy was of the kind
called simple.The nutmeg liver is thought to have an agency in
producing dropsy, but as it is for the most part associated with
diseases that have been called dropsy-producing, its bearing on this
effusion may yet be regarded as uncertain.It is common to speak of heart dropsy in such a way as to imply that
disease of the heart alone can produce abdominal effusion.I even doubt whether the heart alone can cause the anasarca that is so
often attributed to it.In following a great multitude of heart
diseases from the time they were recognized to their termination, I
have been struck with the ease with which the patients attend to their
business, sometimes even laborious business, for years--in one instance
fifty years--with almost no complaint, and how rapidly their condition
changes as soon as albumen and casts appear in the urine.I have been
compelled by these observations to ascribe the anasarca and oedema that
makes this last stage of heart disease so distressing to the kidneys,
and not to the heart.Double pleuritic effusion is not uncommon under
these circumstances, but every physician must have noticed the rareness
of troublesome abdominal {1175} dropsy, while there is
sometimes--perhaps often--a little effusion; and when in the
exceptional cases there has been much, it was almost always accounted
for by a dropsy-producing change in the abdominal organs, not, perhaps,
discovered during life; so that for me, while they produce overwhelming
effusions in other parts of the system, they are minor agents in the
production of ascites.Phthisis is occasionally attended, toward its
close, by oedematous legs and albuminous urine, but I cannot report any
important relation between these and peritoneal effusion.I can say the
same of chronic bronchitis.I record this negative testimony regarding
the two last-named diseases, because I find them enumerated among the
causes of abdominal dropsy.Cancer may invade the portal vein, tumors of adjacent parts other than
those of the liver, or an aneurism may compress it and cause dropsy.Diseases of the pelvic organs, both acute
and chronic, may produce it, but then the disease would fall into the
class of those produced by chronic or subacute peritonitis.DaCosta thinks he has lately had a case of chronic peritonitis attended
by ascites.It was in a woman thirty years of age, who had been thrown
with force upon the frame of an iron bedstead, striking the lower part
of the bowels.These were not confined to
the injured part, but extended to the whole abdomen; and there was
menorrhagia.After a time there was fluid effusion in the peritoneal
cavity, which slowly increased till her state demanded relief from
tapping.The pain and
tenderness were constant symptoms all through.She slowly improved, and
at the time the case was reported it was believed that she would soon
be discharged from the hospital.The only doubt which DaCosta finds
regarding the diagnosis is in the facts that the liver was diminished
in size and that the spleen was moderately enlarged, and he admits the
possibility that an adventitious capsule of the liver may have caused
the ascites, but believes that it was dependent on chronic peritonitis.Acute peritonitis subsiding into chronic, with increase of fluid
effusion, as I have already said, I am not familiar with.That
occurring in cancerous and tuberculous peritonitis has already been
considered.But in relation to these some facts regarding frequency of
occurrence, collected by Bristowe, are worth quoting.He says that in
48 cases of tubercular peritonitis, dropsy was found in 12, and that in
22 of peritoneal cancer, 12 had more or less ascites.He further adds,
regarding cirrhosis, that of 46 cases observed post-mortem, there was
dropsy in only 20.This is not surprising, as in all the diseased
conditions of the liver that produce dropsy the anatomical changes must
reach the point at which there is considerable portal obstruction
before the effusion will occur.The amount of fluid found in ascites varies greatly.In some it may
remain for a long time stationary at four or five quarts; in others the
suffering caused by an accumulation of nine or ten quarts will demand
its removal; and in a few cases twenty quarts have been removed in one
operation.It is in cirrhosis that the largest quantity is found, and
it is in this disease and in cancerous peritonitis that the most
frequent tappings are required.The quality of the fluid also varies
markedly: from being almost as clear and thin as spring-water it may be
almost ropy, or in color greenish or yellowish or slightly red; it is
very likely to contain {1176} albumen; and it is probable that a
further study of its microscopic elements may enable us to resolve
doubts regarding the cause of the effusion.It very often contains
blood-corpuscles.Bristowe finds from hospital records that ascites occurs in about equal
frequency in males and females, but, as everybody has noticed, that
hepatic dropsy is much more frequent in men than in women.Ascites, he
says, is most frequent between the ages of thirty and fifty, and next
between twenty and thirty and between fifty and sixty, but is not
uncommon above the latter age; and it occurs in children.SYMPTOMS.--In general, ascites is easily recognized by the swollen
state of the bowels: a well-rounded swelling when the patient stands or
sits, but spread out in the flanks when he lies on his back; the
fulness of the side on which the patient may be lying, and the
flattened condition of the opposite side,--belong to this disease, and
as a group to no other.The results of percussion are significant in
the movement it causes in the fluid, and for the resonance or flatness
it produces.When the patient lies on his back, tapping with the
finger-ends on one side of the abdomen sends a wave of the fluid across
to the other side, where it is perceived as a gentle blow by the
applied fingers of the other hand.If the abdomen is not full, this
wave will be produced at the upper level of the fluid, but not above
that.If this wave cannot be sent across the body, it may be found on
either side by percussing above and feeling for it below; percussion
also teaches where the fluid is, and where it is not, by the dull sound
it produces.It is rare in ascites that the intestines do not float on
the surface of the fluid, at least from the umbilicus upward, and there
give a loud percussion sound, while toward the back, and often toward
the pelvis, it is dull, or even flat; changing the position of the
body, the resonance will be uppermost and the dulness in the most
dependent part.Then the softness or impressibility of the abdomen till
the tension becomes great is noticeable.The changed position of the
fluid as the body is turned from side to side is important.A very
small quantity of fluid can be detected in this manner.The patient is
placed on his right side and percussion is made in the right flank:
there is dulness, while in the left flank there is resonance.The
patient turns on to the left side: dulness now changes position, and is
on the left, and on the right resonance.If it is feared that some
undetected fluid remains in the pelvic cavity, the pelvis may be raised
by pillows and the same examination repeated, or he may be placed in
the knee-and-elbow position referred to by Bristowe, and the percussion
will then be made upward in the umbilical region.In some cases the
contraction of the mesentery will not allow the intestines to rise
through a large amount of fluid and float on it; but such cases are
almost confined to the cancerous and the tuberculous varieties of the
disease; and as in these the symptoms are grave, the physician will
probably have visited his patient many times before this contraction
will embarrass him.Besides, when mesenteric contraction occurs there
is a very strong probability that the omentum will also be contracted,
be rolled up, and lumpy; as this can almost always be felt above the
level of the umbilicus, he has in it an explanation of the absence of
resonance on the fluid.It has happened that oedema of the abdominal
walls or fatty accumulations there have given a delusive though feeble
fluctuation on percussion.In such cases, if the patient make moderate
pressure with the back of a small book in {1177} the course of the
median line, that kind of wave will be broken, while a wave in the
abdominal cavity will not be prevented.When there is considerable
distension of the abdomen by fluid, weak spots in the abdominal wall
often yield and make a tumor.This is very common at the umbilicus,
where a little bladder is lifted half an inch or more above the general
curve of the abdomen.The fluid frequently follows the track of
hernias.In females it has been known to press the anterior wall of the
vagina backward and downward, so as to make it protrude at the vulva.It has, in one of my own cases, by downward pressure caused complete
prolapse of the uterus.It is very often attended by oedema of the
lower limbs.This is accounted for by the pressure of the abdominal
fluid on the veins that return the blood from these parts, or in
cirrhosis by contraction of the ring or notch through which the vena
cava passes in the liver.If there is general oedema, the cause will
probably be found in disease of the kidneys; or if in one limb, in
pressure or thrombosis of one iliac vein.As the disease advances the
accumulating fluid forces the diaphragm upward, diminishes the
breathing room, and threatens the life still more.Then the patient
cannot lie down in bed, but spends his nights as well as days in an
easy-chair, and sleeps leaning forward on a support for his forehead.The veins on the abdominal surface will fix attention.With almost any
large tumor in the cavity they become more or less enlarged.But in
cirrhotic dropsy this becomes more striking than in any other
affection.The enlargement is attended by a reversion of the
blood-current on the lower half of the abdomen.This is early shown by
emptying an inch or two of a vein with the finger, drawing it either
upward or downward, and noticing from which direction it is refilled
when the pressure is removed.The pelvic veins do not readily discharge
their blood by the natural channels, and by anastomosing branches it is
forced over the surface of the abdomen and into the thoracic veins,
these latter becoming in turn greatly enlarged.The appetite is
commonly poor, the digestion flatulent, the pulse accelerated.The urine is commonly scanty, and in
cirrhosis of a reddish hue.The skin is apt to be dry, particularly so
in simple chronic peritonitis.The tongue has no characteristic fur,
and is often, almost always toward the close, dry.The mind is not
affected till near the end; then often the patient is delirious,
commonly mildly.Diarrhoea is not uncommon, and even dysentery has been
observed.The result is almost always unfavorable, or, as has been
said, lethal.When, as in chronic peritonitis
and in tuberculous peritonitis, the fluid is confined in a sac or sacs,
each particular pool will be yielding to pressure, but elastic, and
will give the percussion wave, though it may extend but a short
distance.To distinguish ovarian dropsy--ovarian cysts, as it is now
called--from ascites may require a few words.Ovarian tumors of all
kinds are found to be more prominent on one side when they rise from
the pelvis than on the other.The
uterus and its appendages lie in front of the pelvic intestine, and
when any of them ascend above the pelvis they must occupy the same
relative position.In other words, a large ovarian cyst must lie in
front of the intestines, while intestinal resonance should be found
behind and in the sides.But if the ovarian cyst does not occupy the
whole height of the bowels, intestinal resonance {1178} may exist above
it, and the dulness may be found below, bounded by a portion of a
circle, and sometimes the cyst walls are resisting enough to allow its
boundaries to be ascertained by the fingers.This cyst can also be felt
in the vagina; and the uterus, instead of being pressed down, is
sometimes lifted upward, so that it cannot be reached in the vagina,
but can be felt through the abdominal walls just above the pelvic
bones.A condition more troublesome than this is when ovarian cyst and
ascites occur together.Then the posterior or lateral resonance is lost
when the patient lies on her back, but can be found on one side when
she lies on the other.In that concurrence, in dorsal decubitus it is
possible by pressure or a little blow to send a wave of the ascitic
fluid over the front of the cyst.Should the patient take the knee-and-elbow position, the intestinal
resonance may be restored in both flanks.TREATMENT.--In opening the chapter on the treatment of ascites it is
usually said, Give principal consideration to the diseased conditions
that have caused the dropsy; in other words, cure cirrhosis, cancerous
peritonitis, tubercular peritonitis, heart disease, and the secondary
affections of the abdominal organs, release the liver from the
dangerous compression to which it is subjected, and all will go well.But they do not inform us how these impossibilities--at least in most
cases impossibilities--are to be achieved.It is true that the
physician would not shrink hopelessly from the treatment of simple
chronic peritonitis.But this is one of the rarest causes of ascites.A
physician in a long lifetime may not have seen a case.It is true,
ascites is a symptom, always a secondary, or even a tertiary,
affection; and theoretically there can be no better advice, but
practically it cannot amount to much.Then, if the cause cannot be
removed, it remains to do our best to relieve the patient of his load
and strive to prolong his life to its utmost possible limit.In doing
this the physician will often find himself able to give gratifying
relief, and once in a great while to rejoice in a cure.The three great emunctories, the skin, the bowels, and the kidneys, are
chiefly appealed to for relief in this as in other serous
accumulations.Most physicians prefer to use the diuretics--first,
because if they will act at all, they act so quietly and produce so
little debility that whatever can be gained by them is obtained at
small cost to the system.The form of ascites that most resists
diuretics is that which originates in cirrhosis.Often a full trial of
them, with suitable changes from time to time, is of no avail, yet now
and then the kidneys yield to persuasion and act freely.The saline
diuretics and digitalis are most in favor with some.In the early part
of the present century a pill composed of squill and digitalis in
powder, and calomel, each one grain, given three times a day, was
almost universally chosen.In place of the calomel the blue mass was
often preferred.When this prescription had produced a little ptyalism
the mercurial was omitted and the squill and digitalis continued.It
has often been observed in dropsies of all kinds that diuretics act
better after a little mercurial action is set up in the system.The
diuretic that I most frequently prescribe is made of the carbonate of
potass.ounce ss and water ounce vj; to a tablespoonful of this a
tablespoonful of fresh lemon-juice is added.This is taken every two
hours, and at the same time a dessertspoonful of the infusion of
digitalis or more is taken three times a day.This is an {1179} old
prescription.Sometimes the old sal diureticus is used.It is not always kindly received by the stomach.At Bellevue Hospital the following is much used: viz.infusion of
digitalis, ounce iv; bitartrate of potash, ounce j; simple syrup, ounce
ss; and water added to make a pint.But it
would require many pages to exhaust the diuretics.I will only add that
I have more confidence in the salts of potash and soda, singly or
combined, aided by digitalis and a mercurial, than in any others.The diaphoretics that are most efficient are warm water and steam.A
foot-bath long continued and frequently repeated, the patient covered
with blankets, and the water kept at 90 degrees or warmer, are very
effectual in producing perspiration.Bricks heated or hot water in
bottles, or potatoes heated, and enveloped in damp cloths and laid
alongside of the body and limbs, form an extemporaneous vapor-bath of
considerable efficiency.A vapor-bath can be easily extemporized in the
following way: Have a kitchen vessel furnished by the tinman with a
cover which has an inch tube fitted to this and bent so as reach the
floor six feet from the fire.The pot should have a capacity of a
gallon or more, and should be kept boiling briskly.Meantime, the
patient, in his night-dress, has a double blanket brought over his
shoulders from behind, and another from before, and fastened.Now he
takes a chair (wooden), under which the steam is delivered.The blanket
from behind is kept off his body by the back of the chair, and the
front one by his knees.The steam, shut in in this way, soon brings on
a sweat, and when it is sufficiently active the front blanket is thrown
off, and the patient wrapped in the rear one and put to bed, when the
sweating can be regulated by blankets.This is better than what is
called the alcohol sweat, for in that the patient is bathed in carbonic
acid gas as well as heat.A patient is sometimes enveloped in a hot,
wet blanket with good effect.Pilocarpine has come into use lately as a
sudorific.I have witnessed its effects many times and can testify to
its certainty as a sudorific; but it is too debilitating for common
use.Digitalis has sometimes acted with extraordinary power in this
way, but there are grave risks in administering large doses.Among the cathartics that may be used in ascites, it has seemed to me
that the milder hydragogues are safest.One ounce of Epsom salts with a
drachm of the fluid extract of senna can be taken every second or third
day for months, if need be, with little reduction of strength, and
sometimes with an increase of it.I had charge of a young man in the
hospital in whom cirrhosis was unquestionable, and dropsy at one time
extreme, in whom the abdominal veins had made furrows that would
receive the little finger, who was wholly relieved by a drastic dose of
elaterium every second day.I saw him three years after his discharge,
and then his health was good.Notwithstanding this, I prefer the milder
medicines.Bristowe has seen no cures from either sudorifics, diuretics, or
purgatives.I have seen one or more from each of those agents, all
cirrhotic.He "has seen cures occasionally from mercury, iodide and
bromide of potash, copaiba, and a combination of fresh squills and
crude mercury."I agree with him in his statement that
counter-irritants are useless, making exception for chronic peritonitis
and the early stage of the tubercular variety.He thinks quinia, iron,
and cod-liver oil are useful.{1180} Paracentesis in almost every case will at length become
necessary, and the question comes whether it should be practised early
or late.If it be delayed till the oppression of the breathing makes it
imperative, the walls of the abdomen will be so stretched as to present
little resistance to the reaccumulation of the fluid, and a second
tapping will be required in fifteen to twenty-five days.A bandage is a
poor substitute for muscular contraction.If, on the other hand, the
fluid is withdrawn before the muscularity is not stretched out of the
muscles, then accumulation will be less rapid and the patient will be
spared the suffering which large accumulations cause.But tapping is
not always an innocent operation.It is sometimes followed by acute
peritonitis.By the early tapping this risk is oftener taken.Reginald
Smith suggests the use of a small canula by which only ten or twenty
ounces of the fluid can escape each hour.This mode, he thinks, removes
the danger of syncope and makes the bandage needless.Hemorrhagic Effusion

in the peritoneum is a topic on which there is little to be said.A
primary effusion of this kind probably does not occur.In
haematophilia, where the mucous membrane of the nose and wounds bleed
dangerously, there is no record of spontaneous bleeding into the
peritoneal cavity.The same thing can be said of that very rare disease
which has been called bloody sweat.An unmarried lady applied to me
fifteen years ago with this disorder.The blood would ooze out at
hundreds of points on the inner face of the arm; these would run
together and drop off the arm, or the same thing would occur on the
chest and in the bend of the knee.This would continue for two or three
minutes, and then cease of itself, but to recur in one or more, rarely
several, places.There was no
irregularity of the menses.I could find no visceral disease; there was
no nose-bleed.This kind of
bleeding continued for several years.She is now approaching fifty
years of age, and for the last two or three years has had no recurrence
of the bleeding.There was never anything in this case to lead to the
suspicion of peritoneal or other serous hemorrhage.In the few similar
cases on record there is the same absence of all evidence of internal
bleeding.It has already been said that a certain amount of blood, as shown by
its corpuscles, is to be expected in cancerous ascites, and with less
uniformity in tubercular ascites, and not unfrequently in hepatic
dropsy, as well as in acute peritonitis.This may not deserve to be
called hemorrhage, on account of the moderate quantity of blood that is
effused; but aside from that which results from rupture of
blood-vessels it is about the only kind of it with which we are
familiar.Scurvy, and conditions of the blood analogous to those produced by that
disease, make it almost certain that if pleurisy or pericarditis occurs
while these conditions exist, it will be hemorrhagic.I am not,
personally, acquainted with a single instance in which peritonitis in
this condition has occurred.Copeland, however, says that hemorrhage in
peritonitis has been noticed by Broussais and others.The blood is
mixed {1181} with the serum and stains the surface of the false
membrane, as in hemorrhagic pleurisy and pericarditis, and the disease
is of an asthenic type, "occurring in the hemorrhagic diathesis.""The
symptoms are inflammatory from the beginning, and rapidly pass into
those indicating great depression; the pulse becomes rapid, small, and
soft, death quickly supervening, with convulsions, cold and damp
extremities and surface," etc.Copeland has himself not seen a case, and regards its occurrence as
very rare.Delafield states that "Friedreich describes two cases
occurring in patients with ascites who had been frequently tapped.He
says that both the parietal and visceral peritoneum was covered with a
continuous membrane of a diffuse, yellowish-brown color, mottled with
small and large extravasations of blood.The membrane was thickest over
the anterior abdominal wall.It could be separated into a number of
layers.These layers were composed of blood-vessels, masses of pigment,
branching cells, and fibrillated basement substance.In many places the
extravasated blood was coagulated in the shape of round, hard, black
nodules.The new membrane could be readily stripped off from the
peritoneum, and there were no adhesions between the visceral and
parietal portions of the peritoneum."The erosions of abdominal cancer sometimes open vessels of considerable
size, causing large hemorrhage into this cavity and sudden death.When aneurisms of the abdominal aorta rupture, they sometimes flood the
abdominal cavity; oftener they open into the structures under the
peritoneum on the left side, and make a large flat tumor extending from
the point of rupture downward to the brim of the pelvis, and even
beyond it.A gentleman whose health was usually good, thirty-five years of age,
felt an unwonted exhaustion and feebleness creeping over him.His
countenance became pale, his pulse rapid, growing smaller and smaller.It seemed certain that there was hemorrhage somewhere, but until it was
noticed that the bowels were growing tumid and hard there was nothing
to guide us to its seat.Even then we were left to conjecture regarding
the bleeding vessel.After
death it was found that a small aneurism had been formed on one of the
vessels of the omentum, not larger than a small walnut, and had
ruptured by a very small opening, and that it was by this small opening
that life had oozed away.Bleedings from stabs and other wounds of the bowels, from lacerations
of the liver, spleen, uterus, and sometimes of the kidneys, should be
mentioned in this connection; but as they, for the most part, fall into
the hands of the surgeons, this is not the place to give the details
regarding them.{1182}

DISEASES OF THE ABDOMINAL GLANDS (TABES MESENTERICA).BY SAMUEL C. BUSEY, M.D.DEFINITION.--Tabes mesenterica may be briefly defined to be
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.This definition may seem too
limited, because it recognizes the identity of tuberculosis and
scrofulosis of the lymph-glands, and excludes those hyperplastic
conditions which do not certainly undergo the cheesy degeneration.It
is supported, however, by the absence of any essential difference in
the histological changes which take place in tuberculous and scrofulous
(Wagner) lymph-glands; by the frequent simultaneous occurrence of each
in the same subject; by the secondary development of tubercles during
the course of scrofulous affections; and by the fact that the cheesy
transformation is alike common to both these conditions of new
formations.Schuppel maintains that the presence of tubercles is
necessary to the production of the cheesy metamorphosis of
lymph-glands, and that "scrofulous glands are always tuberculous
glands."In this view Rindfleisch coincides, and expresses the belief
that the inflammatory and hyperplastic changes are secondary to the
formation of the tubercles.Birch-Hirschfeld asserts that cheesy
degeneration of the mesenteric glands is always accompanied by
tubercular formations.This definition is therefore adopted as the expression of the result of
the most recent investigations.It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
a few equally competent observers deny the identity of the tuberculous
and scrofulous new formations in lymph-glands.It must also be conceded
that occasionally hyperplastic processes in the lymph-glands undergo
the cheesy metamorphosis independent of tubercular development.SYNONYMS.--The differences of opinion, especially among the older
authors, in regard to the nature of this disease are very distinctly
indicated in the varying significance of the numerous synonyms, of
which the following list is only a part: Atrophia mesenterica; Atrophia
infantum (Hoffmann); Febris hectica infantum (Sydenham); Scrofula
mesenterica (Sauvages); Paralysma mesentericum (Good); Physconia
mesenterica (Baumes); Mesenteritis chronica (Stewart); Mesenteric
fever, Hectic fever, Marasmus (Underwood); Carreau, Entero-mesenterite
of the French; Darrsucht der Kinder and Gekroschwindsucht of the
Germans; Tubercles of the mesentery; Tuberculous disease of the
abdomen; Phthisis mesenterica; Tabes glandularis; Tabes scrofulosa;
Macies infantum; Paedatrophia; and Rachialgia mesenterica.{1183} Some of these synonyms indicate the theoretical and unsupported
opinions of their authors, and others refer merely to a symptom.The
name carreau refers to a hardness of the abdomen; physconia, to the
presence of a non-fluctuating and non-sonorous abdominal tumor; and
that of entero-mesenterite presupposes a secondary origin from a
primary enteritis.Good classes it among his numerous varieties of
mesenteric turgescence, but characterizes this special form as a
scrofulous turgescence always associated with the strumous diathesis.The terms tabes and atrophy originated when the nomenclature of disease
was derived from symptoms, and not from pathology.HISTORY AND PATHOLOGY.--The history of tabes mesenterica is coeval with
that of scrofula and pulmonary consumption.The ancient authors
recognized the existence of a chronic disease of the mesenteric glands,
characterized by enlargement and induration, followed by destruction of
the gland-parenchyma, which was associated with digestive disturbances,
emaciation, hectic fever, and usually terminated in death.At first,
the degenerative process was regarded as suppurative.But as the study
of scrofula progressed, and frequent observations were made of the
occurrence of disease of the external lymphatics and of the mesenteric
glands in the same subject, disputes arose as to the identity of the
two affections.These controversies led to the general acceptance of
the belief that the scrofulous degeneration of lymph-glands and the
process of destruction in tabes mesenterica were identical.Consentaneous with these investigations, and for a long time
subsequent, even down to a very late period, which is, perhaps, not yet
concluded, the relation of scrofulous disease of the lymph-glands to
pulmonary consumption was discussed and studied with great assiduity.As the knowledge concerning these diseases advanced, and the results of
investigations were accepted, the doctrine of the identity of the
morbid processes in scrofulous disease of the external glands and
mesenteric phthisis became firmly established.The history of
scrofulosis and tuberculosis cannot be separated.The connection and
identification of the two processes have been subjects of constant
discussion from the discovery of tubercle to the present time.Occasionally, the dividing-line seemed definitely fixed.Then would
follow the general acceptance of the doctrine of identity.With the
discovery of miliary tubercle a determined reaction took place against
this view, and for a while many regarded scrofulosis merely as a form
or stage of tuberculosis.As the conclusions in regard to these
questions changed, so did the opinions concerning the true nature of
tabes mesenterica change, until, finally, the investigations of
Rindfleisch, Schuppel, and others seem to have established the
tuberculous nature of the disease.Many authors of a comparatively
recent date have applied the term tuberculosis to this condition, not
because they knew or believed the development of true tubercle was a
constant or essential characteristic, but because they regarded the
words scrofulosis and tuberculosis as synonymous.Notwithstanding the obscurity in which, for so long a time, the
pathology of this disease was involved, certain facts well known to the
earliest writers have been confirmed by continuous observation down to
the present.Its secondary character has been so uniformly recognized
that some of the older authors based its origin upon the absorption and
conveyance along the lymphatic vessels to the glands of some peccant
material originating {1184} in a primary focus of disease.The constant
coexistence with scrofulous affections and pulmonary consumption had
long ago established the direct and primary relation of these diseases
to tabes mesenterica, and authors of recent date, though not so
generally holding the opinion that it is always an intercurrent
complication of these maladies, yet maintain its secondary development.Even Schuppel, whose investigations and conclusions lead in the
direction of an idiopathic origin, admits that the only primary element
is the tuberculosis, which finds its cause in some peripheral
irritation.In the earlier times, as now, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands has
been observed during every period of life from birth to advanced old
age, but then, as at the present time, the greater number of cases were
known to occur during infancy and childhood.But few cases have been
observed during the earlier months of life or before weaning.Between
the ages of two and eight years is the period of greatest frequency.Though rarer during the later years of childhood, the older the child
the more rapid its progress to a fatal termination.Nursing infants are
not exempt, but those nursed by healthy mothers are much less liable
than the wet-nursed.Among hand-fed infants it is not an uncommon
disease, but it is much more common among the farmed-out children.While, as has been stated, the greatest number of cases occur in those
between two and eight years of age, statistics show that the liability
to it increases from the age of two and a half years up to the eighth,
and, according to some authors, up to the tenth year.At the latter age
there is a remarkable diminution in the number of cases.This fact is
probably due to the greater prevalence of the acute diseases of the
respiratory organs and of the exanthematous diseases among children
during this period of life.Some have attributed it to the more rapid
development and increased functional activity of the mesenteric glands.This circumstance might afford a plausible explanation for the apparent
sudden increase in frequency after the completion of the second year
because of the independent subsistence of children at that age, and the
additional duties imposed upon the alimentary tract and its
dependencies; still, if this were so, the period of greatest frequency
ought to begin at an earlier age and more nearly correspond with the
time of weaning.It is, however, a fact that tubercularization of the
mesenteric glands is more frequently associated with chronic intestinal
inflammation in those over one year than in those under that age.This
fact, together with the greater liability of artificially-fed infants,
would seem to connect, at least in such cases, its secondary origin
with some primary irritation of the intestinal canal.Authors are not yet agreed in regard to the relative frequency of this
disease in boys and girls, though opinions predominate in favor of the
greater number among the males.The statistics of Rilliet and Barthez
and Schmalz show a decidedly greater prevalence among boys.The comparative frequency of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands
cannot be determined.Louis found disease of the mesenteric glands in
one-fourth of the autopsies of persons dying of phthisis; in 100 adults
dying of the same disease Lombard found tuberculosis of these glands in
10; and in the bodies of 100 tuberculous children he found the glands
tuberculous in 34 cases.In the Hopital des Enfants Maladies tubercles
were found in the mesentery of one-half of the children dying of {1185}
tuberculous affections.In the bodies of children dying of tuberculous
disease in the Children's Hospital of Washington tuberculous
degeneration of the mesenteric glands has been found in two-thirds of
the cases, and without a single exception in those dying of rickets.Authors differ also, and the statistics are equally unreliable, in
regard to the relative frequency of tubercularization of the bronchial
and mesenteric glands.The general opinion seems to be in favor of the
greater frequency in the bronchial glands.In a majority of cases both
sets of glands are found diseased.The geographical distribution of tabes mesenterica is as universal as
that of scrofula and pulmonary phthisis.No country or climate is
exempt, yet there is no locality in which it is endemic.It has been
observed among all civilized nations, in the cold regions as well as in
the tropical countries.Wherever scrofulous and phthisical diseases are
known, there also are found cases of tabes mesenterica.Livingstone has
stated that scrofula is unknown in some regions in Central Africa, and
other travellers have made similar statements in regard to some Indian
tribes.The statistics of the Children's Hospital of Washington show a
far greater frequency among the African race than among the whites.It
belongs to no class or condition of life, but occurs more frequently
among the children of the squalid than among the children of the
affluent and well-to-do.ETIOLOGY.--Predisposing Causes.--Modern as well as the older authors
have very generally accepted the conclusion that a constitutional
tendency or liability to this disease is its most frequent and
potential etiological factor.This predisposition may be either
inherited or acquired.The ancients called it the strumous, and the
more recent writers the scrofulous or tuberculous, diathesis.Lugol
maintained that this diathesis is begotten of old and syphilitic
fathers, and others state that children of parents nearly related and
of those broken down by disease and excesses may inherit it.That it is
transmitted by scrofulous and phthisical parents no one can doubt, but
as yet it cannot be defined to be anything more than a peculiarity of
the constitution which may exhibit abnormal reactions against
irritating influences.The scrofulous habit is believed to be indicated
by physical appearances which represent two extremes.The erethic form
is characterized by a feeble and delicate frame; deficient muscular
development; transparent, smooth, and florid skin; light hair and blue
eyes, large pupils; precocious intellect and sanguine temperament; the
torpid form, by a large head; large and tumid upper lip; soft and
flaccid flesh, bloated appearance; short and thick neck; muscular
incapacity, tumid abdomen, and sluggish intellect.Some of these
features are more frequently symptoms of the actual disease than of the
existence of a predisposition to it, and, except so far as they may
refer to a primary scrofulous or pulmonary disease, cannot be accepted
as indicative of the presence of a constitutional tendency to
tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.A tumid abdomen, rapid
emaciation, and anaemia are far more valuable signs of the disease of
these glands.Bad air and bad food are also important predisposing causes.They are
conditions to which the children of the poor, especially in large
cities, are constantly exposed.Insufficient protection from climatic
influences, neglect of person, and unhygienic surroundings must be
classed in the same category.It is claimed that vitiated air,
unwholesome habitation, {1186} insufficient or improper food, squalor
and filth may cause the constitutional tendency, as they will certainly
precipitate the development of the disease in those predisposed to it.Exciting Causes.--The border-line between the predisposing and exciting
causes cannot be positively fixed.The presence of tuberculosis or of
some form of scrofulous disease in some other part of the body so
constantly precedes the development of tuberculosis of the mesenteric
glands, even in those who have not exhibited the characteristic
phenomena of the scrofulous diathesis, that such affections must be
regarded as exciting as well as predisposing causes.No one can doubt
the frequent infection of the mesenteric glands in cases of pulmonary
tuberculosis.The probability of systemic infection from a single focus
is universally admitted.These facts and circumstances do not exclude
the possibility of localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands.Whether such exclusively local development of tubercles ever occurs
independent of the scrofulous diathesis cannot be determined, but that
the disease does find its exciting cause in inflammatory conditions of
the intestinal mucous membrane cannot be doubted.Schuppel, who asserts
the primary development of the tubercle-formation in lymphatic glands,
does not claim an idiopathic origin, but admits the necessity of a
primary peripheral irritation in direct connection with the affected
gland.The intimate connection between diseases of the intestinal
mucous membrane and of the mesenteric glands is established beyond a
doubt.Vogel and Steiner assert that tabes mesenterica is a common
result of enteritis folliculosa.A primary inflammatory process may not
contain any element which could be classed as tubercle, yet it may
excite secondary tuberculosis of the glands.Whether such a result only
occurs in those who may have acquired or inherited the predisposition
is yet undecided.In many of the cases of tabes mesenterica tuberculous
ulcers are found in the intestines, but it cannot be claimed that such
ulcers are always the primary foci of tuberculous development.If
primary, it is not difficult to understand how the virus may be
transmitted to the glands.It has been claimed that certain articles of food will produce the
disease.Potatoes and rye bread in large quantities and a coarse
vegetable diet have been mentioned among the exciting causes.Deficiency in the quantity of food is a much more frequent cause than
inferiority in quality, yet there can be no doubt that any and every
article of diet that will set up catarrhal inflammation of the
intestinal mucous membrane may become a cause.Irritation of the mucous
membrane of the alimentary tract, induced by coarse, stimulating, or
imperfectly-digested food, or by the improper and frequent use of
purgative medicines, may give rise to disease of the glands; and, even
though the irritation may in itself be trivial, its long continuance or
frequent renewal may prove sufficient, especially in those in whom the
predisposition is present.Malarial and exanthematous diseases have
also been considered exciting causes, and among the latter class
measles and scarlet fever, because of the inflamed condition of the
intestinal mucous membrane which they leave, are the most frequent.Difficult dentition and whooping cough must also be classed in this
category.Recently attention has been called to the probable transmission of the
disease through the milk of diseased cows, but further investigation
and {1187} more reliable data are necessary to establish this
connection.Klebs has deduced the conclusion from recent experiments
that the use of the milk of cows in advanced phthisis will always
produce tuberculosis, which begins as an intestinal catarrh and extends
to the mesenteric glands.Some of the older authors believed that the cure of some chronic
diseases of the skin and mucous membranes and the suppression of
chronic discharges might induce tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands;
but these conditions are now known to be most frequently the initial
manifestations of the scrofulous diathesis, and the mesenteric
complications are far more likely to occur when these primary foci are
neglected and the patient is left to suffer the unabated progress of
the disease.MORBID ANATOMY.--It is not usual to find all the glands of the
mesentery affected at once, nor of those affected all in the same stage
of disease.Newly-affected glands may be found alongside of others in
an advanced condition.In the first stage the glands are enlarged, but
rarely exceeding the size of a filbert; they are firm, but not
inelastic.This change consists in hyperplasia of the
gland-constituents.Microscopic examination shows abundant
cell-proliferation, but the cells are badly constructed and prone to
undergo retrogressive metamorphosis.The cells accumulate in clusters
without any intercellular substance, and compress the lymph-sinuses and
blood-vessels.The second stage is characterized by the commencement of the cheesy
degeneration.The glands enlarge and coalesce in clusters, sometimes
forming large masses of hardened and inelastic glands.On section they
exhibit in the beginning foci of cheesy material imbedded in the
gland-parenchyma.In the further progress of the change the whole gland
is transformed into a homogeneous yellowish substance.In this
condition there are found on microscopic examination globular
corpuscles, nuclei, shrivelled cells, sometimes giant-cells, and most
frequently tubercles.The tubercles are usually found in the follicular
substance.Birch-Hirschfield says the cheesy formations in secondary
tuberculous mesenteric glands are only found in discrete foci, and the
tubercles occur in the follicular substance imbedded in relatively
normal tissue.The cheesy transformation is, according to Virchow, a
necrobiosis of the hyperplastic gland-elements, but Schuppel insists
that it is the result of tubercular development.After a time the
cheesy masses soften, and the glands are converted into sacs containing
a purulent fluid mixed with debris.In this condition they are most
frequently coalesced in bunches, sometimes forming large tumors.The
intervening walls may break down and the whole bunch be transformed
into one large sac filled with purulent fluid and debris.Occasionally
these masses of agglutinated glands become adherent to the abdominal
parietes or to the intestines.Rupture of their walls may occur, and
the contents may be emptied into either the peritoneal cavity or the
intestines.When communication with the intestines takes place, it is
usually through an ulcer on the mucous surface.It is probable that the
cheesy substance may sometimes be absorbed, as Virchow thinks, by
gradual softening proceeding from the surface toward the centre.It is believed that these degenerated glands sometimes undergo the
cretaceous transformation.Such an instance has been reported by
Carswell: "The patient, who when a child had been affected with tabes
{1188} mesenterica and also with swellings of the cervical glands, some
of which ulcerated, died at the age of twenty-one years of inflammation
of the uterus seven days after delivery.Several of the mesenteric
glands contained a dry cheesy matter mixed with a chalky-looking
substance; others were composed of a cretaceous substance; and a tumor
as large as a hen's egg, included within the folds of the peritoneum,
and which appeared to be the remains of a large agglomerated mass of
glands, was filled with a substance resembling a mixture of putty and
dried mortar, moistened with a small quantity of serosity.In the neck,
and immediately behind an old cicatrix in the skin, there were two
glands containing, in several points of their substance, small masses
of hard cretaceous matter."Calcareous concretions have been observed
by Andral and others in the mesenteric glands in cases of chronic
pulmonary disease; and Soemmering records several observations of a
tartar-like substance found in devastated mesenteric glands in cases of
rickets.The morbid appearances in tabes mesenterica are not usually confined to
the changes in the glands.In very many cases the evidences of disease
of the peripheral glands are quite manifest, and in much the larger
number of cases pulmonary phthisis and disease of the bronchial glands
are present.These
consecutive morbid changes are succinctly set forth in the following
notes of an autopsy taken from the records of the Children's Hospital
of Washington, D.C.The subject was a <DW64> boy aged ten, who had been
taken sick a year previous to his death with a bad cold and cough,
followed several months afterward by enlargement and suppuration of the
cervical glands on both sides: "The body was greatly emaciated, the
lips and teeth covered with sordes.Cheesy masses were scattered
throughout the substance of both lungs.The right lung was firmly
adherent to the thoracic walls, the left adherent at apex.The liver
was enlarged and adherent to all adjacent tissues, and contained many
cheesy nodules scattered throughout its substance and over the surface.The gall-bladder was distended with bile.The spleen was normal in
size, very dark, and filled with cheesy masses.The pancreas contained
many similar masses.The peritoneal cavity contained a quantity of
muddy fluid.The peritoneum was dark in color, studded with tubercles,
and ulcerated in a few places.The stomach and intestines were
distended with gas; the walls of stomach thickened, the inner surface
covered with a shiny mucus; in its lower wall was one large ulcer,
penetrating to the peritoneal coat and measuring three-fourths of an
inch in diameter.The peritoneal coat was thickly studded with nodules
resembling tubercles.The small intestines were gangrenous in a few
places; on the inner surface were found fourteen ulcers, varying in
size from one-fourth to one and one-fourth inches in diameter, with
elevated edges and red bases; two penetrated the peritoneal coat.On the mucous surface of the large
intestines there were seven large ulcers, similar in appearance to
those found in the small intestines.Some of Peyer's patches were
ulcerated.The mesenteric glands, some as large as walnuts, were filled
with cheesy material, and the mesentery was dotted over with small
masses of similar matter."In two of the reported cases of chylous effusion into the peritoneal
cavity the rupture of the lacteals was caused by degeneration of the
{1189} mesenteric glands; and in several other cases the rupture was
produced by the presence of tumors, apparently formed by the
agglomeration of numerous degenerated glands.Several cases of fatty diarrhoea from mesenteric phthisis have been
reported.Of these the most conclusive is the case of Hall.[1] The
clinical history of the case and the detection of enlarged mesenteric
glands in the umbilical and hypogastric regions placed the diagnosis
beyond a doubt.It was, however, verified by the discovery of several
vomicae in the lungs, and of mesenteric glands "universally enlarged
and affected with strumous disease.The intestinal mucous membrane was
dotted with patches of ulceration, with here and there prominent masses
of strumous deposit on the surface."[Footnote 1: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, vol.i., 3d Series, 1855, p.SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--It is not possible to describe a definite and uniform
clinical history of this disease.As a secondary complication of
pulmonary phthisis and scrofulous affections the preliminary symptoms
are so constantly identified with the development and progress of these
maladies that, as a rule, the initial stage cannot be recognized by any
special assemblage of symptoms.In any tuberculous or scrofulous child
the possible implication of the mesenteric glands may be predicated
upon any array of symptoms that would establish the presence of these
classes of disease.And even in the absence of the rational and direct
signs of such affections, in those exhibiting the physical evidences of
the strumous diathesis, more especially when it is inherited, the
symptoms of any trivial departure from health, such as the catching of
cold, irritation of the alimentary tract, or protracted convalescence
from any of the exanthematous or intestinal diseases, may constitute
the initial history of tabes mesenterica.In such subjects debility and
anaemia, from whatsoever cause they may apparently result--and, in
fact, any manifest lowering of the standard of health, whether gradual
or precipitate, and without assignable cause--may mark the beginning of
the process of change in the parenchyma of the glands that will
terminate in tuberculosis.The later as well as the earlier history may
be completely masked by the symptomatology of other diseases belonging
to the tuberculous class; and so grave, as a rule, are such primary and
coexisting affections that definite recognition of this complication or
localized extension of the systemic infection becomes more a matter of
skilful diagnosis than of practical utility.But in those cases where disease of the respiratory organs and of the
bronchial glands can be excluded the general symptomatology becomes of
paramount importance.And in view of the value of prophylactic measures
which may be employed to arrest, limit, or delay the localized
tuberculosis of these glands, the precursory symptoms may be of special
significance.This condition may be characterized by languor and
dulness or marked debility and anaemia, with loss of color, attended
with flatulence, stomachal disturbance, frequent eructations consisting
mainly of mucus, a sense of uneasiness in the abdomen after the
ingestion of food, a variable appetite, sometimes voracious and
occasionally depraved.Sometimes a dislike for fatty foods is a
prominent symptom.The tongue may be coated, the breath is usually
foul, and some have said the body emits an acid odor.If these symptoms
occur in a child of the {1190} scrofulous diathesis, or be directly or
remotely associated with a previous gastro-intestinal disease, or occur
or persist during the convalescence of some of the acute affections of
infancy and childhood which stand in etiological relation to this
disease, they may justify a reasonable presumption of commencing change
in the mesenteric glands.This presumption will be strengthened by
emaciation, a more marked disturbance of the digestive function,
attended with fetid and occasionally whitish stools, a tumid belly, and
deep, lancinating abdominal pains of short duration, recurring at long
intervals and neither relieved nor aggravated by pressure or an
evacuation.Some have attributed special importance to a chalky
appearance and loss of consistency of the stools, indicating the
suspension of absorption by the lacteals.There may also be slight
evening fever.Later, the enlargement of the belly increases, the
emaciation becomes more marked and rapid, the appetite more variable,
sometimes very voracious, the alvine discharges more fetid or less
consistent, sometimes putty-like, and generally irregular or
constipated.The febrile exacerbations are more decided, and sometimes
chills may occur at irregular intervals.When, in addition to these
symptoms, either during the earlier or later stages, the enlargement of
the glands can be detected, the clinical picture is complete.In
consequence of the tympanitic distension of the abdomen, which usually
increases with the progress of the disease, it is impossible in a
majority of cases to detect the glandular enlargement; especially is
this true when the affected glands are separate; but, as frequently
happens during the last stage, when large tumors are formed by the
coalescence of a number of diseased glands the diagnosis may be easily
determined.In the absence of the discovery of enlarged glands the
diagnosis cannot be considered positive.They are usually most readily
found in the region of the umbilicus, and may in some cases, even when
the tension of the abdomen is very great, be detected by grasping the
abdomen with the hand and compressing it between the fingers and thumb
so that the enlarged glands will be brought in close contiguity to the
walls and be felt immediately under the fingers.If a tumor should be
present and the peritoneal cavity be free from fluid, its locality may
be recognized by a sense of resistance and circumscribed area of
diminished resonance, and then definitely outlined by palpation.Underwood says: "Indigestion, costiveness or purging, irregular
appetite, flushed cheeks or a total loss of color, impaired strength
and spirits, remitting fever, and a hard and tumid belly, with
emaciated limbs, are amongst the more common symptoms, attending at one
period or other, of this disease."When the diagnosis has been made out, it is not impossible to determine
the stage of the disease.The progressive intensity of the symptoms,
with rapid emaciation as a rule, bears a definite relation to the
progress of the morbid changes taking place in the glands.It must,
however, be borne in mind that children have died of tabes mesenterica
who had enjoyed excellent health up to the moment of death, and the
autopsy disclosed the condition of the glands, which had not been
suspected during life.In the case previously cited, in which the
autopsy exhibited such grave lesions of the stomach, liver, spleen,
pancreas, and intestinal mucous membrane, the clinical phenomena were
at no time commensurate with the gravity of the morbid changes.{1191} DIAGNOSIS.--In the absence of the proof of the presence of
enlarged glands or of a tumor the diagnosis cannot be positively
determined.The enlargement and tympanitic distension of the abdomen do
not necessarily establish the existence of glandular disease, for they
are present in a great many conditions of ill-health in children.Nor
is the coexistence of a tumid belly, emaciation, and fever sufficient,
for they are found in other tuberculous and in gastro-intestinal
diseases.The discovery of enlarged discrete glands by palpation, as
before described, in connection with such disturbances of nutrition as
have been set forth, constitute the strongest presumption in favor of
tabes mesenterica.The presence of enlarged glands unaccompanied by the
ordinary symptoms of the tuberculous or scrofulous processes is
inconclusive, because the glandular hypertrophy may be a simple
hyperplasia, entirely independent of any tendency to retrogressive
metamorphosis.There is usually some tenderness on pressure, but this
may be present in any disease of the abdominal viscera.When the glands
are of sufficient size, they may, by pressure, produce secondary
derangements.Cramps in the legs may be caused by pressure on nerves.Oedema of the legs and dilatation of the superficial abdominal veins
may result from compression of venous trunks."If," says Eustace Smith,
"these veins are seen to ramify on the abdominal surface and to join
the veins on the thoracic walls, tabes may be suspected in the absence
of chronic peritonitis and enlargement of the liver."Ascites may be
present, but is not a necessary result of disease of the glands.When a tumor has been discovered by palpation, it is necessary to
determine its glandular nature.If situated about the umbilicus, in
front of the spinal column, if irregular, hard, and feeling like a
congeries of irregularly-rounded nodules, the evidence is very decided
in favor of its glandular origin.But care must be taken to exclude
tumors formed by fecal accumulations and masses attached to the
omentum.Omental tumors are usually more movable, better defined, more
superficial, and regular in form.Cancerous masses sometimes simulate
glandular tumors.The general history of the case and the age of the
patient are usually sufficient to make a diagnosis by exclusion.Rilliet and Barthez distinguished a cancerous pancreas by the presence
of vomiting, jaundice, and abdominal pains.The writer has many times based a conjectural diagnosis--which was
verified by a post-mortem examination--upon the presence of a tumid
abdomen, increasing emaciation, with the history of a protracted
gastro-intestinal catarrh, and an irregular febrile curve characterized
by frequent subnormal temperatures.He has also observed a number of
cases of protracted diarrhoea in children, accompanied with extreme
emaciation, notwithstanding the appetite was good, sometimes even
voracious, and the food taken was ample, nutritious, and easily
digested, in which the stools, varying from two to three, or twice as
many, daily, were whitish, leaden, or slate-, sometimes
semi-fluid, at other times containing lumps or masses of putty
consistence, presenting to the naked eye a greasy appearance and to the
touch a fatty feel, and at the autopsy has found only thinness and
transparency of the coat of the small intestines and degenerated
mesenteric glands.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis is decidedly unfavorable.So far as is known
to the writer, there is but one recorded case of recovery in which the
{1192} diagnosis was indisputable and the fact of a cure was
established by an autopsy.This was the case reported by Carswell,
before referred to.The older and some of the modern authors have
claimed many recoveries, but it must be manifest to every student of
pathological anatomy that the mistaken diagnoses must have been nearly
if not quite as numerous as the cases of cure.The writer has not
witnessed a single case of recovery, but he has observed very many
cured cases of disease which exhibited all the subjective and objective
symptoms of tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, save and except
those by which its existence can alone be definitely and positively
established.The case of Carswell demonstrates a remote possibility of
cure by the cretaceous metamorphosis of the degenerated glands in a
subject exhibiting the scrofulous diathesis.In view of this isolated
observation, one cannot refuse to accept a similar possibility in cases
in which the disease may be localized and confined to a few of the
glands.In such cases, if recognized previous to the formation of
cheesy foci, the possibility of staying, limiting, and perhaps
occasionally curing, the disease should not be regarded as absolutely
hopeless; yet the opportunities of examining the glands in the first
stage of change has so rarely occurred that no one is authorized to
assert that the hyperplasia is the true picture of the condition in
which those in the advanced stage had its beginning; nor has any one
claimed to have witnessed the progressive stages of resolution taking
place in such glands.The cretaceous transformation is an accepted though remote possibility,
and absorption by means of gradual softening of the cheesy masses is
perhaps a reasonable hypothesis.But even if either of these processes
was an occasional termination of the disease, it could only lessen its
gravity and prolong life, with an incomplete recovery, in those few
cases in which the tuberculous or scrofulous changes were confined to a
less number of glands than was necessary to maintain the nutrition of
the body.For while there is no serious obstacle to the flow of chyle
through the glands in the condition of simple hyperplasia, it is
completely obstructed in those transformed into cheesy masses or
purulent collections.The channels through the glands must sooner or
later be obliterated by the presence of the abundant cell-proliferation
which characterizes the initial stage of change in this disease.For if
the compression is sufficient to cut off the supply of blood, it must
prove equally destructive to the complex system of lymph-paths.To the
impermeability of the glands must the emaciation and exhaustion which
mark the course of the disease, to a greater or less degree according
to the number of glands involved, be due.If the investigations of Schuppel should be verified, and the primary
tubercle-formations be accepted as the initial stage of change, the
prognosis will be less favorable, but a distinct line of demarcation
may be established between two classes of cases in each of which cheesy
transformation may occur, but in one the tubercle-formations may be
primary, and in the other secondary.In the latter class the prognosis
may be more favorable, because treatment may be effective if commenced
prior to the beginning of the retrogressive metamorphosis.COURSE, DURATION, AND COMPLICATIONS.--When tabes is a complication of
pulmonary or bronchial phthisis, or when either of the latter {1193}
diseases appears as an intercurrent affection during the course of a
primary localized tuberculosis of these glands, the glandular
degeneration runs a more rapid course.When it appears as an extension
of external scrofulous affections or finds its cause in
gastro-intestinal irritation, its course is usually less rapid.The
number of glands involved greatly influences its duration.The
mechanical impediment to nutrition offered by a large number of
impermeable glands promotes rapid emaciation and exhaustion.The
condition of the mucous coat of the alimentary tract offers many
considerations that affect its course and duration.Follicular
enteritis hastens, and tuberculous ulceration of the mucous membrane
speedily brings, the case to a fatal termination.Some of the older authors refer to the frequent complication of rickets
with tabes mesenterica, and the writer in numerous post-mortem
examinations of the bodies of children dying of rickets has invariably
found cheesy mesenteric glands.In view of the fact that rickets is
constantly associated with disturbance of the alimentary tract, it
should not be a surprise to find the glands in such close contiguity
to, and having vascular communication with, the diseased mucous surface
in a condition of hyperplasia.Simple hypertrophy is probably a common
complication in cases which terminate by recovery, but there must be
some element of cause, other than inflammation of the mucous membrane
of the intestines, that determines the retrogressive metamorphosis.Several of the older authors have classed rickets in the category of
strumous diseases, and it may be that in the fatal cases tuberculosis
of the mesenteric glands is a local expression of this diathesis.TREATMENT.--The treatment consists, for the most part, in methods of
prevention and palliation.The tendency to disease of the lymphatic
glands in scrofulous children is so constant that it is important to
remove all sources of irritation and to combat all influences likely to
hasten or promote the localization of the constitutional condition.All
chronic discharges and diseases of the skin and mucous membrane, the
continuance of which might produce glandular complications, should be
cured as speedily as possible, slight colds should receive prompt
attention, and catarrhal inflammations of the respiratory organs should
be arrested as quickly as the resources of science will permit.The
alimentary tract demands constant and careful observation.Trivial
disorders should not be neglected: the causes should be ascertained and
removed.Digestion and nutrition should be maintained at a healthy
standard.The hygiene of person, dwelling, and sleeping apartments
merits constant and intelligent supervision.As stated above, tabes of the mesenteric glands is so frequently
secondary to other diseases of a scrofulous nature that the danger lies
in the failure to arrest or cure such affections.It is unfortunately
too true that some of them are often beyond the resources of medical
skill, but in many cases the initial manifestations of the strumous
diathesis are either entirely neglected or inappropriately treated.In
many such cases the final and fatal complication of mesenteric phthisis
could be prevented.The treatment of these affections belongs properly
to the subjects of tuberculosis and scrofula, to be found in other
parts of this System of Medicine.Localized tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands is so often, either
{1194} directly or indirectly, connected with catarrhal inflammations
of the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane that the cure of these
affections cannot be too strongly insisted upon as an effective method
of prevention.This is especially true with children exhibiting the
physical signs of the strumous diathesis.When it is inherited from a
diseased mother, it may be necessary to resort to artificial feeding
before the proper time for weaning has been reached.In such cases no
uniform rule can be arbitrarily followed.The condition of both mother
and child must be considered, and cases will occur which will demand
the exercise of the most cautious discretion and diligent observation.When the disease has become established but little can be accomplished.In such cases the treatment refers to the palliation of symptoms and
the maintenance of nutrition.Pain, when present, must be relieved--if
necessary by anodynes, either given internally or applied in the form
of cataplasms.Most often it is due to the coexisting disease of the
intestinal mucous membrane or to the ingestion of unsuitable foods.The
diet should be regulated and limited to nutritious and easily-digested
articles.Sometimes, even in cases of advanced degeneration of the
glands, great benefit may be temporarily obtained by attention to the
diet.Diarrhoea should be controlled, but when dependent upon
tuberculous ulcerations of the intestinal mucous membrane but little
can be done toward delaying the fatal termination.When a large number
of glands are affected, it will be necessary to limit the diet to such
nutrient fluids as may be absorbed from the stomach.The medical treatment is confined to a few remedies.Faulty nutrition
is the predominant factor, and the drugs employed should be directed to
the improvement of the assimilative functions.The lacto-phosphate of
iron in the form of syrup, or the phosphates in the form of the
compound syrup, sometimes prove valuable tonics.The lacto-phosphate
may be given in combination with cod-liver oil.This latter, either
internally or by inunction, is the most valuable and universally
applicable of all remedies.The mistake is very frequently made of
giving too large quantities.Few children can digest as much as a
drachm administered three times a day.In Washington it is usually
given in the form of the phosphatic emulsion, and has proved in the
service of the Children's Hospital a valuable and effective remedy in
the nutritional disorders of children.Of the chalybeates, the syrup of
the iodide of iron is by far the most valuable; this may be given alone
or in combination with cod-liver oil.It is specially indicated when
anaemia is a marked characteristic.Some recent reports favor the
employment of pancreatized foods.The ointment of the iodide of lead
has been highly extolled as a local application to the belly.The
nature of the disease should be constantly borne in mind, and all
depressing agencies should be sedulously avoided.{1195}

its practical tests in the school-room will result in failure, unless
there shall be ready for teacher and scholar, a well-arranged, simple,
and practical book, bringing these truths down to the capacity of the
child.A few years hence, when the results of this study in our Normal Schools
shall be realized in the preparation of the teacher, we can depend upon
her adapting oral lessons from advanced works on this theme, but now,
the average primary teacher brings to this study no experience, and
limited previous study.To meet this need, this work has been prepared.Technical terms have
been avoided, and only such facts of physiology developed as are
necessary to the treatment of the effects of alcohol, tobacco, opium,
and other truths of hygiene.To the children in the Primary Schools of this country, for whom it was
prepared, this work is dedicated.[Illustration]

CHAPTER I.

JOINTS AND BONES.[Illustration: L]ITTLE girls like a jointed doll to play with, because
they can bend such a doll in eight or ten places, make it stand or sit,
or can even play that it is walking.[Illustration: _Jointed dolls._]

As you study your own bodies to-day, you will find that you each have
better joints than any dolls that can be bought at a toy shop.Some of your joints work like the hinges of a door, and these are called
hinge-joints.You can find them in your elbows, knees, fingers, and toes.How many hinge-joints can you find?Think how many hinges must be used by the boy who takes off his hat and
makes a polite bow to his teacher, when she meets him on the street.How many hinges do you use in running up-stairs, opening the door,
buttoning your coat or your boots, playing ball or digging in your
garden?You see that we use these hinges nearly all the time.All our joints are not hinge-joints.Your shoulder has a joint that lets your arm swing round and round, as
well as move up and down.Your hip has another that lets your leg move in much the same way.[Illustration: _The hip-joint._]

This kind of joint is the round end or ball of a long bone, which moves
in a hole, called a socket.Your joints do not creak or get out of order, as those of doors and
gates sometimes do.A soft, smooth fluid, much like the white of an egg,
keeps them moist and makes them work easily.What parts of our bodies are jointed together so nicely?If you should count all your bones, you would find that each of you has
about two hundred.Some are large; and some, very small.There are long-hones in your legs and arms, and many short ones in your
fingers and toes.[Illustration: _Backbone of a fish._]

If you look at the backbone of a fish, you can see that it is made up-of
many little bones.Your own spine is formed in much the same way, of
twenty-four small bones.An elastic cushion of gristle (gr[)i]s'l) fits
nicely in between each little bone and the next.When you bend, these cushions are pressed together on one side and
stretched on the other.They settle back into their first shape, as
soon as you stand straight again.If you ever rode in a wheelbarrow, or a cart without springs, you know
what a jolting it gave you.These little spring cushions keep you from
being shaken even more severely every time you move.Twenty-four ribs, twelve on each side, curve around from the spine to
the front, or breast, bone.(_See page 38._)

They are so covered with flesh that perhaps you can not feel and count
them; but they are there.Then you have two flat shoulder-blades, and two collar-bones that almost
meet in front, just where your collar fastens.Take two little bones, such as those from the legs or wings of a
chicken, put one of them into the fire, when it is not very hot, and
leave it there two or three hours.Soak the other bone in some weak
muriatic (m[=u] r[)i] [)a]t'[)i]k) acid.This acid can be bought of any
druggist.You will have to be careful in taking the bone out of the fire, for it
is all ready to break.If you strike it a quick blow, it will crumble to
dust.This dust we call lime, and it is very much like the lime from
which the mason makes mortar.[Illustration: _Bone tied to a knot._]

The acid has taken the lime from the other bone, so only the part which
is not lime is left.You will be surprised to see how easily it will
bend.You can twist it and tie it into a knot; but it will not easily
break.This soft part of the bone is gristle.Children's bones have more gristle than those of older people; so
children's bones bend easily.I know a lady who has one leg shorter than the other.This makes her
lame, and she has to wear a boot with iron supports three or four inches
high, in order to walk at all.One day she told me how she became lame."I remember," she said, "when I was between three and four years old,
sitting one day in my high chair at the table, and twisting one foot
under the little step of the chair.The next morning I felt lame; but
nobody could tell what was the matter.At last, the doctors found out
that the trouble all came from that twist.It had gone too far to be
cured.Before I had this boot, I could only walk with a crutch."Because the spine is made of little bones with cushions between them, it
bends easily, and children sometimes bend it more than they ought.If you lean over your book or your writing or any other work, the
elastic cushions may get so pressed on the inner edge that they do not
easily spring back into shape.In this way, you may grow
round-shouldered or hump-backed.This bending over, also cramps the lungs, so that they do not have all
the room they need for breathing.While you are young, your bones are
easily bent.One shoulder or one hip gets higher than the other, if you
stand unevenly.This is more serious, because you are growing, and you
may grow crooked before you know it.Now that you know how soft your bones are, and how easily they bend, you
will surely be careful to sit and stand erect.Do not twist your legs,
or arms, or shoulders; for you want to grow into straight and graceful
men and women, instead of being round-shouldered, or hump-backed, or
lame, all your lives.When people are old, their bones contain more lime, and, therefore,
break more easily.You should be kindly helpful to old people, so that they may not fall,
and possibly break their bones.Healthy children are always out-growing their shoes, and sometimes
faster than they wear them out.Tight shoes cause corns and in-growing
nails and other sore places on the feet.All of these are very hard to
get rid of.No one should wear a shoe that pinches or hurts the foot.OUGHT A BOY TO USE TOBACCO?Perhaps some boy will say: "Grown people are always telling us, 'this
will do for men, but it is not good for boys.'"Tobacco is not good for men; but there is a very good reason why it is
worse for boys.If you were going to build a house, would it be wise for you to put into
the stone-work of the cellar something that would make it less strong?Something into the brick-work or the mortar, the wood-work or the nails,
the walls or the chimneys, that would make them weak and tottering,
instead of strong and steady?It would he had enough if you should repair your house with poor
materials; but surely it must be built in the first place with the best
you can get.You will soon learn that boys and girls are building their bodies, day
after day, until at last they reach full size.Afterward, they must be repaired as fast as they wear out.It would be foolish to build any part in a way to make it weaker than
need be.Wise doctors have said that the boy who uses tobacco while he is
growing, makes every part of his body less strong than it otherwise
would be.Boys who smoke can not become such large, fine-looking men as they would
if they did not smoke.Cigarettes are small, but they are very poisonous.Chewing tobacco is a
worse and more filthy habit even than smoking.The frequent spitting it
causes is disgusting to others and hurts the health of the chewer.Tobacco in any form is a great enemy to youth.It stunts the growth,
hurts the mind, and <DW36>s in every way the boy or girl who uses it.Not that it does all this to every youth who smokes, but it is always
true that no boy of seven to fourteen can begin to smoke or chew and
have so fine a body and mind when he is twenty-one years old as he would
have had if he had never used tobacco.If you want to be strong and well
men and women, do not use tobacco in any form.Find as many of each kind as you can.How many bones are there in your whole body?Why could you not use it so well if it were all
          in one piece?What is the use of the little cushions between
          the bones of the spine?What is the difference between the bones of
          children and the bones of old people?What happens if you lean over your desk or
          work?What other bones may be injured by wrong
          positions?What is always true of its use by youth?[Illustration: W]HAT makes the limbs move?You have to take hold of the door to move it back and forth; but you
need not take hold of your arm to move that.Sometimes a door or gate is made to shut itself, if you leave it open.This can be done by means of a wide rubber strap, one end of which is
fastened to the frame of the door near the hinge, and the other end to
the door, out near its edge.When we push open the door, the rubber strap is stretched; but as soon
as we have passed through, the strap tightens, draws the door back, and
shuts it.If you stretch out your right arm, and clasp the upper part tightly with
your left hand, then work the elbow joint strongly back and forth, you
can feel something under your hand draw up, and then lengthen out again,
each time you bend the joint.What you feel, is a muscle (m[)u]s'sl), and it works your joints very
much as the rubber strap works the hinge of the door.One end of the muscle is fastened to the bone just below the elbow
joint; and the other end, higher up above the joint.When it tightens, or contracts, as we say, it bends the joint.When the
arm is straightened, the muscle returns to its first shape.There is another muscle on the outside of the arm which stretches when
this one shortens, and so helps the working of the joint.Every joint has two or more muscles of its own to work it.Think how many there must be in our fingers!If we should undertake to count all the muscles that move our whole
bodies, it would need more counting than some of you could do.You can see muscles on the dinner table; for they are only lean meat.[Illustration: _Tendons of the hand._]

They are fastened to the bones by strong cords, called tendons
(t[)e]n'd[)o]nz).These tendons can be seen in the leg of a chicken or
turkey.They sometimes hold the meat so firmly that it is hard for you
to get it off.When you next try to pick a "drum-stick," remember that
you are eating the strong muscles by which the chicken or turkey moved
his legs as he walked about the yard.The parts that have the most work
to do, need the strongest muscles.Did you ever see the swallows flying about the eaves of a barn?They have very small legs and feet,
because they do not need to walk.The muscles that move the wings are fastened to the breast.These breast
muscles of the swallow must be large and strong.People who work hard with any part of the body make the muscles of that
part very strong.The blacksmith has big, strong muscles in his arms because he uses them
so much.You are using your muscles every day, and this helps them to grow.Once I saw a little girl who had been very sick.She had to lie in bed
for many weeks.Before her sickness she had plenty of stout muscles in
her arms and legs and was running about the house from morning till
night, carrying her big doll in her arms.After her sickness, she could hardly walk ten steps, and would rather
sit and look at her playthings than try to lift them.She had to make
new muscles as fast as possible.Running, coasting, games of ball, and all brisk play and work, help to
make strong muscles.So idleness is an enemy to the muscles.There is another enemy to the muscles about which I must tell you.WHAT ALCOHOL WILL DO TO THE MUSCLES.Fat meat could not work your joints for you as
the muscles do.Alcohol often changes a part of the muscles to fat, and
so takes away a part of their strength.In this way, people often grow
very fleshy from drinking beer, because it contains alcohol, as you will
soon learn.But they can not work any better on account of having this
fat.Where are the muscles in your arms, which help
          you to move your elbows?What do we call the muscles of the lower
          animals?Why do chickens and turkeys need strong muscles
          in their legs?What makes the muscles of the blacksmith's arm
          so strong?[Illustration: H]OW do the muscles know when to move?You have all seen the telegraph wires, by which messages are sent from
one town to another, all over the country.You are too young to understand how this is done, but you each have
something inside of you, by which you are sending messages almost every
minute while you are awake.We will try to learn a little about its wonderful way of working.As you would be very badly off if you could not think, the brain is your
most precious part, and you have a strong box made of bone to keep it
in.[Illustration: _Diagram of the nervous system._]

We will call the brain the central telegraph office.Little white cords,
called nerves, connect the brain with the rest of the body.A large cord called the spinal cord, lies safely in a bony case made by
the spine, and many nerves branch off from this.If you put your finger on a hot stove, in an instant a message goes on
the nerve telegraph to the brain.It tells that wise thinking part that
your finger will burn, if it stays on the stove.In another instant, the brain sends back a message to the muscles that
move that finger, saying: "Contract quickly, bend the joint, and take
that poor finger away so that it will not be burned."John journeyed to the hallway.You can hardly believe that there was time for all this sending of
messages; for as soon as you felt the hot stove, you pulled your finger
away.But you really could not have pulled it away, unless the brain had
sent word to the muscles to do it.Now, you know what we mean when we say, "As quick as thought."You see that the brain has a great deal of work to do, for it has to
send so many orders.There are some muscles which are moving quietly and steadily all the
time, though we take no notice of the motion.You do not have to think about breathing, and yet the muscles work all
the time, moving your chest.If we had to think about it every time we breathed, we should have no
time to think of any thing else.There is one part of the brain that takes care of such work for us.It
sends the messages about breathing, and keeps the breathing muscles and
many other muscles faithfully at work.It does all this without our
needing to know or think about it at all.Do you begin to see that your body is a busy work-shop, where many kinds
of work are being done all day and all night?Although we lie still and sleep in the night, the breathing must go on,
and so must the work of those other organs that never stop until we
die.The little white nerve-threads lie smoothly side by side, making small
white cords.Each kind of message goes on its own thread, so that the
messages need never get mixed or confused.They do all the
feeling for the whole body, and by means of them we have many pains and
many pleasures.If there was no nerve in your tooth it could not ache.But if there were
no nerves in your mouth and tongue, you could not taste your food.If there were no nerves in your hands, you might cut them and feel no
pain.But you could not feel your mother's soft, warm hand, as she laid
it on yours.One of your first duties is the care of yourselves.Children may say: "My father and mother take care of me."But even while
you are young, there are some ways in which no one can take care of you
but yourselves.The older you grow, the more this care will belong to
you, and to no one else.Think of the work all the parts of the body do for us, and how they help
us to be well and happy.Certainly the least we can do is to take care
of them and keep them in good order.CARE OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.As one part of the brain has to take care of all the rest of the body,
and keep every organ at work, of course it can never go to sleep itself.If it did, the heart would stop pumping, the lungs would leave off
breathing, all other work would stop, and the body would be dead.But there is another part of the brain which does the thinking, and this
part needs rest.When you are asleep, you are not thinking, but you are breathing and
other work of the body is going on.If the thinking part of the brain does not have good quiet sleep, it
will soon wear out.A worn-out brain is not easy to repair.If well cared for, your brain will do the best of work for you for
seventy or eighty years without complaining.The nerves are easily tired out, and they need much rest.They get tired
if we do one thing too long at a time; they are rested by a change of
work.IS ALCOHOL GOOD FOR THE NERVES AND THE BRAIN?Think of the wonderful work the brain is all the time doing for you!You ought to give it the best of food to keep it in good working order.Any drink that contains alcohol is not a food to make one strong; but is
a poison to hurt, and at last to kill.It injures the brain and nerves so that they can not work well, and send
their messages properly.That is why the drunkard does not know what he
is about.Newspapers often tell us about people setting houses on fire; about men
who forgot to turn the switch, and so wrecked a railroad train; about
men who lay down on the railroad track and were run over by the cars.Often these stories end with: "The person had been drinking."When the
nerves are put to sleep by alcohol, people become careless and do not do
their work faithfully; sometimes, they can not even tell the difference
between a railroad track and a place of safety.The brain receives no
message, or the wrong one, and the person does not know what he is
doing.You may say that all men who drink liquor do not do such terrible
things.A little alcohol is not so bad as a great deal.But even a
little makes the head ache, and hurts the brain and nerves.A body kept pure and strong is of great service to its owner.There are
people who are not drunkards, but who often drink a little liquor.By
this means, they slowly poison their bodies.When sickness comes upon them, they are less able to bear it, and less
likely to get well again, than those who have never injured their bodies
with alcohol.When a sick or wounded man is brought into the hospital, one of the
first questions asked him by the doctor is: "Do you drink?"the next questions are, "What do you drink?"The answers he gives to these questions, show the doctor what chance the
man has of getting well.A man who never drinks liquor will get well, where a drinking man would
surely die.TOBACCO AND THE NERVES.Because many men say that it helps them, and makes them feel better.Shall I tell you how it makes them feel better?If a man is cold, the tobacco deadens his nerves so that he does not
feel the cold and does not take pains to make himself warmer.If a man is tired, or in trouble, tobacco will not really rest him or
help him out of his trouble.It only puts his nerves to sleep and helps him think that he is not
tired, and that he does not need to overcome his troubles.It puts his nerves to sleep very much as alcohol does, and helps him to
be contented with what ought not to content him.A boy who smokes or chews tobacco, is not so good a scholar as if he did
not use the poison.Usually, too, he is not so polite, nor so good a boy as he otherwise
would be.What message goes to the brain when you put
          your finger on a hot stove?What message comes back from the brain to the
          finger?What is meant by "As quick as thought"?Name some of the muscles which work without
          needing our thought.Why do not the nerve messages get mixed and
          confused?Why could you not feel, if you had no nerves?State some ways in which the nerves give us
          pain.State some ways in which they give us
          pleasure.What part of us has the most work to do?How must we keep the brain strong and well?What does alcohol do to the nerves and brain?Why does not a drunken man know what he is
          about?What causes most of the accidents we read of?Why could not the man who had been drinking
          tell the difference between a railroad track and a
          place of safety?How does the frequent drinking of a little
          liquor affect the body?How does sickness affect people who often
          drink these liquors?When a man is taken to the hospital, what
          questions does the doctor ask?Does it really help a person who uses it?Does tobacco help a boy to be a good scholar?[Illustration: _Bones of the human body._]




CHAPTER IV.[Illustration: R]IPE grapes are full of juice.This juice is mostly water, sweetened with a sugar of its own.It is
flavored with something which makes us know, the moment we taste it,
that it is grape-juice, and not cherry-juice or plum-juice.Apples also contain water, sugar, and apple flavor; and cherries contain
water, sugar, and cherry flavor.They
all, when ripe, have the water and the sugar; and each has a flavor of
its own.Ripe grapes are sometimes gathered and put into great tubs called vats.In some countries, this squeezing is done by bare-footed men who jump
into the vats and press the grapes with their feet.The grape-juice is then drawn off from the skins and seeds and left
standing in a warm place.Bubbles soon begin to rise and cover the top of it with froth.[Illustration: _Picking grapes and making wine._]

If the cook had wished to use this grape-juice to make jelly, she would
say: "Now, I can not make my grape-jelly, for the grape-juice is
spoiled."WHAT IS THIS CHANGE IN THE GRAPE-JUICE?The sugar in the grape-juice is changing into something else.It is
turning into alcohol and a gas[A] that moves about in little bubbles in
the liquid, and rising to the top, goes off into the air.The alcohol is
a thin liquid which, mixed with the water, remains in the grape-juice.The sugar is gone; alcohol and the bubbles of gas are left in its place.A little of it will harm any one who
drinks it; much of it would kill the drinker.Ripe grapes are good food; but grape-juice, when its sugar has turned to
alcohol, is not a safe drink for any one.This changed grape-juice is called wine.It is partly water, partly
alcohol, and it still has the grape flavor in it.Wine is also made from currants, elderberries, and other fruits, in very
much the same way as from grapes.People sometimes make it at home from the fruits that grow in their own
gardens, and think there is no alcohol in it, because they do not put
any in.But you know that the alcohol is made in the fruit-juice itself by the
change of the sugar into alcohol and the gas.[Illustration]

It is the nature of alcohol to make the person who takes a little of it,
in wine, or any other drink, want more and more alcohol.When one goes
on, thus taking more and more of the drinks that contain alcohol, he is
called a drunkard.In this way wine has made many drunkards.Alcohol hurts both the body
and mind.It will make a good and
kind person cruel and bad; and will make a bad person worse.Every one who takes wine does not become a drunkard, but you are not
sure that you will not, if you drink it.You should not drink wine, because there is alcohol in it.In a few hours after the juice is pressed out
of the apples, if it is left open to the air the sugar begins to change.Like the sugar in the grape, it changes into alcohol and bubbles of gas.At first, there is but little alcohol in cider, but a little of this
poison is dangerous.More alcohol is all the time forming until in ten cups of cider there
may be one cup of alcohol.Cider often makes its drinkers ill-tempered
and cross.Cider and wine will turn into vinegar if left in a warm place long
enough.What two things are in all fruit-juices?How can we tell the juice of grapes from that
          of plums?How can we tell the juice of apples from that
          of cherries?What happens after the grape-juice has stood a
          short time?Why would the changed grape-juice not be good
          to use in making jelly?Into what is the sugar in the juice changed?What does alcohol do to those who drink it?When is grape-juice not a safe drink?What is this changed grape-juice called?What do people sometimes think of home-made
          wines?How can alcohol be there when none has been
          put into it?What does alcohol make the person who takes it
          want?Are you sure you will not become a drunkard if
          you drink wine?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote A: This gas is called car bon'ic acid gas.][Illustration: A]LCOHOL is often made from grains as well as from fruit.If the starch in your mother's starch-box at home should be changed into
sugar, you would think it a very strange thing.Every year, in the spring-time, many thousand pounds of starch are
changed into sugar in a hidden, quiet way, so that most of us think
nothing about it.If you plant them in the ground, where they are kept moist and warm,
they begin to sprout and grow, to send little roots down into the earth,
and little stems up into the sunshine.These little roots and stems must be fed with sugar; thus, in a wise
way, which is too wonderful for you to understand, as soon as the seed
begins to sprout, its starch begins to turn into sugar.[Illustration]

If you should chew two grains of wheat, one before sprouting and one
after, you could tell by the taste that this is true.Barley is a kind of grain from which the brewer makes beer.He must first turn its starch into sugar, so he begins by sprouting his
grain.Of course he does not plant it in the ground, because it would need to
be quickly dug up again.He keeps it warm and moist in a place where he can watch it, and stop
the sprouting just in time to save the sugar, before it is used to feed
the root and stem.The brewer soaks it in plenty of water, because the grain has not water
in itself, as the grape has.He puts in some yeast to help start the work of changing the sugar into
gas[B] and alcohol.Sometimes hops are also put in, to give it a bitter taste.The brewer watches to see the bubbles of gas that tell, as plainly as
words could, that sugar is going and alcohol is coming.When the work is finished, the barley has been made into beer.It might have been ground and made into barley-cakes, or into pearl
barley to thicken our soups, and then it would have been good food.Now,
it is a drink containing alcohol, and alcohol is a poison.You should not drink beer, because there is alcohol in it.Two boys of the same age begin school together.One of them drinks
wine, cider, and beer.The other never allows these drinks to pass his
lips.These boys soon become very different from each other, because one
is poisoning his body and mind with alcohol, and the other is not.A man wants a good, steady boy to work for him.Which of these two do
you think he will select?A few years later, a young man is wanted who
can be trusted with the care of an engine or a bank.Which of these young men will be more likely to get it?What is in the grain that can be turned into
          sugar?What can you do to a seed that will make its
          starch turn into sugar?What does the brewer do to the barley to make
          its starch turn into sugar?What does the brewer put into the malt to start
          the working?How does the brewer know when sugar begins to
          go and alcohol to come?Why does he want the starch turned to sugar?Why did the two boys of the same age, at the
          same school, become so unlike?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote B: Car bon'ic acid gas.][Illustration: D]ISTILLING (d[)i]s t[)i]l[\l]'ing) may be a new word to
you, but you can easily learn its meaning.You have all seen distilling going on in the kitchen at home, many a
time.When the water in the tea-kettle is boiling, what comes out at the
nose?You can find out what it is by catching some of it on a cold plate, or
tin cover.As soon as it touches any thing cold, it turns into drops of
water.When we boil water and turn it into steam, and then turn the steam back
into water, we have distilled the water.We say vapor instead of steam,
when we talk about the boiling of alcohol.It takes less heat to turn alcohol to vapor than to turn water to
steam; so, if we put over the fire some liquid that contains alcohol,
and begin to collect the vapor as it rises, we shall get alcohol first,
and then water.But the alcohol will not be pure alcohol; it will be part water, because
it is so ready to mix with water that it has to be distilled many times
to be pure.But each time it is distilled, it will become stronger, because there is
a little more alcohol and a little less water.In this way, brandy, rum, whiskey, and gin are distilled, from wine,
cider, and the liquors which have been made from corn, rye, or barley.The cider, wine, and beer had but little alcohol in them.The brandy,
rum, whiskey, and gin are nearly one-half alcohol.A glass of strong liquor which has been made by distilling, will injure
any one more, and quicker, than a glass of cider, rum, or beer.But a cider, wine, or beer-drinker often drinks so much more of the
weaker liquor, that he gets a great deal of alcohol.People are often
made drunkards by drinking cider or beer.Where have you ever seen distilling going on?How can men separate alcohol from wine or from
          any other liquor that contains it?Which is the most harmful--the distilled
          liquor, or beer, wine, or cider?Why does the wine, cider, or beer-drinker
          often get as much alcohol?[Illustration: A]LCOHOL looks like water, but it is not at all like
water.Alcohol will take fire, and burn if a lighted match is held near it; but
you know that water will not burn.When alcohol burns, the color of the flame is blue.It does not give
much light: it makes no smoke or soot; but it does give a great deal of
heat.A little dead tree-toad was once put into a bottle of alcohol.It was
years ago, but the tree-toad is there still, looking just as it did the
first day it was put in.The tree-toad would have soon decayed if it had been
put into water.So you see that alcohol keeps dead bodies from
decaying.Pure alcohol is not often used as a drink.People who take beer, wine,
and cider get a little alcohol with each drink.Those who drink brandy,
rum, whiskey, or gin, get more alcohol, because those liquors are nearly
one half alcohol.You may wonder that people wish to use such poisonous drinks at all.It often cheats the man who takes a little, into
thinking it will be good for him to take more.Sometimes the appetite which begs so hard for the poison, is formed in
childhood.If you eat wine-jelly, or wine-sauce, you may learn to like
the taste of alcohol and thus easily begin to drink some weak liquor.The more the drinker takes, the more he often wants, and thus he goes on
from drinking cider, wine, or beer, to drinking whiskey, brandy, or rum.People who are in the habit of taking drinks which contain alcohol,
often care more for them than for any thing else, even when they know
they are being ruined by them.Why should you not eat wine-sauce or
          wine-jelly?[Illustration: A] FARMER who had been in the habit of planting his
fields with corn, wheat, and potatoes, once made up his mind to plant
tobacco instead.Let us see whether he did any good to the world by the change.The tobacco plants grew up as tall as a little boy or girl, and spread
out broad, green leaves.By and by he pulled the stalks, and dried the leaves.Some of them he
pressed into cakes of tobacco; some he rolled into cigars; and some he
ground into snuff.If you ask what tobacco is good for, the best answer will be, to tell
you what it will do to a man or boy who uses it, and then let you answer
the question for yourselves.Tobacco contains something called nicotine (n[)i]k'o t[)i]n).One drop of it is enough to kill a dog.In one cigar
there is enough, if taken pure, to kill two men.[Illustration]

Even to work upon tobacco, makes people pale and sickly.Once I went
into a snuff mill, and the man who had the care of it showed me how the
work was done.The mill stood in a pretty place, beside a little stream which turned
the mill-wheel.Tall trees bent over it, and a fresh breeze was blowing
through the open windows.Yet the smell of the tobacco was so strong
that I had to go to the door many times, for a breath of pure air.I asked the man if it did not make him sick to work there.He said: "It made me very sick for the first few weeks.Then I began to
get used to it, and now I don't mind it."He was like the boys who try to learn to smoke.It almost always makes
them sick at first; but they think it will be manly to keep on.At last,
they get used to it.The sickness is really the way in which the boy's body is trying to say
to him: "There is danger here; you are playing with poison.Let me stop
you before great harm is done."Perhaps you will say: "I have seen men smoke cigars, even four or five
in a day, and it didn't kill them."It did not kill them, because they did not swallow the nicotine.They
only drew in a little with the breath.But taking a little poison in
this way, day after day, can not be safe, or really helpful to any one.What did the farmer plant instead of corn,
          wheat, and potatoes?What is the name of the poison which is in
          tobacco?How much of it is needed to kill a dog?What harm can the nicotine in one cigar do, if
          taken pure?Tell the story of the visit to the snuff mill.Why are boys made sick by their first use of
          tobacco?Why does not smoking a cigar kill a man?[Illustration: A]LCOHOL and tobacco are called narcotics (nar
k[)o]t'iks).This means that they have the power of putting the nerves
to sleep.Opium ([=o]'p[)i] [)u]m) is another narcotic.It is a poison made from the juice of poppies, and is used in medicines.Opium is put into soothing-syrups (s[)i]r'[)u]ps), and these are
sometimes given to babies to keep them from crying.They do this by
injuring the tender nerves and poisoning the little body.How can any one give a baby opium to save taking patient care of it?Surely the mothers would not do it, if they knew that this
soothing-syrup that appears like a friend, coming to quiet and comfort
the baby, is really an enemy.[Illustration: _Don't give soothing-syrup to children._]

Sometimes, a child no older than some of you are, is left at home with
the care of a baby brother or sister; so it is best that you should know
about this dangerous enemy, and never be tempted to quiet the baby by
giving him a poison, instead of taking your best and kindest care of
him.CHAPTER X.

WHAT ARE ORGANS?[Illustration: A]N organ is a part of the body which has some special
work to do.The stomach (st[)u]m'[)a]k)
is an organ which takes care of the food we eat.[Illustration: _Different kinds of teeth._]

Your teeth do not look alike, since they must do different kinds of
work.The front ones cut, the back ones grind.They are made of a kind of bone covered with a hard smooth enamel ([)e]n
[)a]m'el).If the enamel is broken, the teeth soon decay and ache, for
each tooth is furnished with a nerve that very quickly feels pain.Cracking nuts with the teeth, or even biting thread, is apt to break the
enamel; and when once broken, you will wish in vain to have it mended.The dentist can fill a hole in the tooth; but he can not cover the tooth
with new enamel.Bits of food should be carefully picked from between the teeth with a
tooth-pick of quill or wood, never with a pin or other hard and sharp
thing which might break the enamel.Nothing but perfect cleanliness
will keep them in good order.Your
breakfast will taste all the better for it.Brush them at night before
you go to bed, lest some food should be decaying in your mouth during
the night.Take care of these cutters and grinders, that they may not decay, and so
be unable to do their work well.You have learned about the twenty-four little bones in the spine, and
the ribs that curve around from the spine to the front, or breast-bone.These bones, with the shoulder-blades and the collar-bones, form a bony
case or box.In it are some of the most useful organs of the body.This box is divided across the middle by a strong muscle, so that we may
say it is two stories high.The upper room is called the chest; the lower one, the abdomen ([)a]b
d[=o]'m[)e]n).In the chest, are the heart and the lungs.In the abdomen, are the stomach, the liver, and some other organs.The stomach is a strong bag, as wonderful a bag as could be made, you
will say, when I tell you what it can do.The outside is made of muscles; the lining prepares a juice called
gastric (g[)a]s'tr[)i]k) juice, and keeps it always ready for use.Now, what would you think if a man could put into a bag, beef, and
apples, and potatoes, and bread and milk, and sugar, and salt, tie up
the bag and lay it away on a shelf for a few hours, and then show you
that the beef had disappeared, so had the apples, so had the potatoes,
the bread and milk, sugar, and salt, and the bag was filled only with a
thin, grayish fluid?Now, your stomach and mine are just such magical bags.We put in our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers; and, after a few hours,
they are changed.The gastric juice has been mixed with them.The strong
muscles that form the outside of the stomach have been squeezing the
food, rolling it about, and mixing it together, until it has all been
changed to a thin, grayish fluid.A soldier was once shot in the side in such a way that when the wound
healed, it left an opening with a piece of loose skin over it, like a
little door leading into his stomach.A doctor who wished to learn about the stomach, hired him for a servant
and used to study him every day.He would push aside the little flap of skin and put into the stomach any
kind of food that he pleased, and then watch to see what happened to it.In this way, he learned a great deal and wrote it down, so that other
people might know, too.In other ways, also, which it would take too
long to tell you here, doctors have learned how these magical food-bags
take care of our food.WHY DOES THE FOOD NEED TO BE CHANGED?Your mamma tells you sometimes at breakfast that you must eat oat-meal
and milk to make you grow into a big man or woman.Did you ever wonder what part of you is made of oat-meal, or what part
of milk?That stout little arm does not look like oat-meal; those rosy cheeks do
not look like milk.If our food is to make stout arms and rosy cheeks, strong bodies and
busy brains, it must first be changed into a form in which it can get to
each part and feed it.When the food in the stomach is mixed and prepared, it is ready to be
sent through the body; some is carried to the bones, some to the
muscles, some to the nerves and brain, some to the skin, and some even
to the finger nails, the hair, and the eyes.Each part needs to be fed
in order to grow.WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GROWING NEED FOOD?Children need each day to make larger and larger bones, larger muscles,
and a larger skin to cover the larger body.Every day, each part is also wearing out a little, and needing to be
mended by some new food.People who have grown up, need their food for
this work of mending.One way to take care of the stomach is to give it only its own work to
do.I have seen some children who want to
make their poor stomachs work all the time.They are always eating
apples, or candy, or something, so that their stomachs have no chance to
rest.If the stomach does not rest, it will wear out the same as a
machine would.The stomach can not work well, unless it is quite warm.If a person
pours ice-water into his stomach as he eats, just as the food is
beginning to change into the gray fluid of which you have learned, the
work stops until the stomach gets warm again.ALCOHOL AND THE STOMACH.You remember about the man who had the little door to his stomach.Sometimes, the doctor put in wine, cider, brandy, or some drink that
contained alcohol, to see what it would do.It was carried away very
quickly; but during the little time it stayed, it did nothing but harm.It injured the gastric juice, so that it could not mix with the food.If the doctor had put in more alcohol, day after day, as one does who
drinks liquor, sores would perhaps have come on the delicate lining of
the stomach.Sometimes the stomach is so hurt by alcohol, that the
drinker dies.If the stomach can not do its work well, the whole body
must suffer from want of the good food it needs.[C]


TOBACCO AND THE MOUTH.The saliva in the mouth helps to prepare the food, before it goes into
the stomach.Tobacco makes the mouth very dry, and more saliva has to
flow out to moisten it.But tobacco juice is mixed with the saliva, and that must not be
swallowed.It must be spit out, and with it is sent the saliva that was
needed to help prepare the food.Tobacco discolors the teeth, makes bad sores in the mouth, and often
causes a disease of the throat.You can tell where some people have been, by the neatness and comfort
they leave after them.You can tell where the tobacco-user has been, by the dirty floor, and
street, and the air made unfit to breathe, because of the smoke and
strong, bad smell of old tobacco from his pipe and cigar and from his
breath and clothes.the back
          teeth?What is the upper room of this box called?the
          lower room?What do the stomach and the gastric juice do
          to the food we have eaten?How did anybody find out what the stomach
          could do?Why must all the food we eat be changed?Why do people who are not growing need food?What does alcohol do to the gastric juice?to
          the stomach?How does the habit of spitting injure a
          person?How does the tobacco-user annoy other people?FOOTNOTE:

[Footnote C: The food is partly prepared by the liver and some other
organs.]WHAT DOES THE BODY NEED FOR FOOD?[Illustration: N]OW that you know how the body is fed, you must next
learn what to feed it with; and what each part needs to make it grow and
to keep it strong and well.A large part of your body is made of water.So you need, of course, to
drink water, and to have it used in preparing your food.Water comes from the clouds, and is stored up in cisterns or in springs
in the ground.From these pipes are laid to lead the water to our
houses.Sometimes, men dig down until they reach a spring, and so make a well
from which they can pump the water, or dip it out with a bucket.Water that has been standing in lead pipes, may have some of the lead
mixed with it.Such water would be very likely to poison you, if you
drank it.Impurities are almost sure to soak into a well if it is near a drain or
a stable.If you drink the water from such a well, you may be made very sick by
it.It is better to go thirsty, until you can get good water.A sufficient quantity of pure water to drink is just as important for
us, as good food to eat.We could not drink all the water that our bodies need.We take a large
part of it in our food, in fruits and vegetables, and even in beefsteak
and bread.You remember the bone that was nothing but crumbling
lime after it had been in the fire.We can not eat lime; but the grass and the grains take it out of the
earth.Then the cows eat the grass and turn it into milk, and in the
milk we drink, we get some of the lime to feed our bones.[Illustration: _Lime being prepared for our use._]

In the same way, the grain growing in the field takes up lime and other
things that we need, but could not eat for ourselves.The lime that thus
becomes a part of the grain, we get in our bread, oat-meal porridge, and
other foods.Animals need salt, as children who live in the country know very well.They have seen how eagerly the cows and the sheep lick up the salt that
the farmer gives them.Even wild cattle and buffaloes seek out places where there are salt
springs, and go in great herds to get the salt.We, too, need some salt mixed with our food.If we did not put it in,
either when cooking, or afterward, we should still get a little in the
food itself.Muscles are lean meat, that is flesh; so muscles need flesh-making
foods.These are milk, and grains like wheat, corn and oats; also, meat
and eggs.Most of these foods really come to us out of the ground.Meat
and eggs are made from the grain, grass, and other vegetables that the
cattle and hens eat.We need cushions and wrappings of fat, here and there in our bodies, to
keep us warm and make us comfortable.So we must have certain kinds of
food that will make fat.[Illustration: _Esquimaux catching walrus._]

There are right places and wrong places for fat, as well as for other
things in this world.When alcohol puts fat into the muscles, that is
fat badly made, and in the wrong place.The good fat made for the parts of the body which need it, comes from
fat-making foods.In cold weather, we need more fatty food than we do in summer, just as
in cold countries people need such food all the time.The Esquimaux, who live in the lands of snow and ice, catch a great many
walrus and seal, and eat a great deal of fat meat.You would not be well
unless you ate some fat or butter or oil.Sugar will make fat, and so will starch, cream, rice, butter, and fat
meat.As milk will make muscle and fat and bones, it is the best kind of
food.Here, again, it is the earth that sends us our food.Fat meat
comes from animals well fed on grain and grass; sugar, from sugar-cane,
maple-trees, or beets; oil, from olive-trees; butter, from cream; and
starch, from potatoes, and from corn, rice, and other grains.Green apples and other unripe fruits are not yet ready to be eaten.The
starch which we take for food has to be changed into sugar, before it
can mix with the blood and help feed the body.As the sun ripens fruit,
it changes its starch to sugar.You can tell this by the difference in
the taste of ripe and unripe apples.Most children like candy so well, that they are in danger of eating more
sugar than is good for them.We would not need to be quite so much afraid of a little candy if it
were not for the poison with which it is often.Even what is called pure, white candy is sometimes not really such.There is a simple way by which you can find this out for yourselves.If you put a spoonful of sugar into a tumbler of water, it will all
dissolve and disappear.Put a piece of white candy into a tumbler of
water; and, if it is made of pure sugar only, it will dissolve and
disappear.If it is not, you will find at the bottom of the tumbler some white
earth.Candy-makers often put it
into candy in place of sugar, because it is cheaper than sugar.Why is it not safe to drink water that has been
          standing in lead pipes?Why is the water of a well that is near a drain
          or a stable, not fit to drink?What is said of the fat made by alcohol?How does the sun change unripe fruits?HOW FOOD BECOMES PART OF THE BODY.[Illustration: H]ERE, at last, is the bill of fare for our dinner:

          Roast beef,
          Potatoes,
          Tomatoes,
          Squash,
          Bread,
          Butter,
          Salt,
          Water,
          Peaches,
          Bananas,
          Oranges,
          Grapes.What must be done first, with the different kinds of food that are to
make up this dinner?The meat, vegetables, and bread must be cooked.Cooking prepares them to
be easily worked upon by the mouth and stomach.If they were not cooked,
this work would be very hard.Instead of going on quietly and without
letting us know any thing about it, there would be pains and aches in
the overworked stomach.The fruit is not cooked by a fire; but we might almost say the sun had
cooked it, for the sun has ripened and sweetened it.When you are older, some of you may have charge of the cooking in your
homes.You must then remember that food well cooked is worth twice as
much as food poorly cooked."A good cook has more to do with the health of the family, than a good
doctor."As soon as we begin to chew our food, a juice in the mouth, called
saliva (sa l[=i]'va), moistens and mixes with it.Saliva has the wonderful power of turning starch into sugar; and the
starch in our food needs to be turned into sugar, before it can be taken
into the blood.You can prove for yourselves that saliva can turn starch into sugar.Chew slowly a piece of dry cracker.The cracker is made mostly of
starch, because wheat is full of starch.At first, the cracker is dry
and tasteless.Soon, however, you find it tastes sweet; the saliva is
changing the starch into sugar.All your food should be eaten slowly and chewed well, so that the saliva
may be able to mix with it.Otherwise, the starch may not be changed;
and if one part of your body neglects its work, another part will have
more than its share to do.If you swallow your food in a hurry and do not let the saliva do its
work, the stomach will have extra work.But it will find it hard to do
more than its own part, and, perhaps, will complain.It can not speak in words; but will by aching, and that is almost as
plain as words.One is to the lungs, for
breathing; the other, to the stomach, for swallowing.Do you wonder why the food does not sometimes go down the wrong way?The windpipe leading to the lungs is in front of the other tube.It has
at its top a little trap-door.This opens when we breathe and shuts when
we swallow, so that the food slips over it safely into the passage
behind, which leads to the stomach.If you try to speak while you have food in your mouth, this little door
has to open, and some bit of food may slip in.The windpipe will not
pass it to the lungs, but tries to force it back.Then we say the food
chokes us.If the windpipe can not succeed in forcing back the food, the
person will die.HOW THE FOOD IS CARRIED THROUGH THE BODY.But we will suppose that the food of our dinner has gone safely down
into the stomach.There the stomach works it over, and mixes in gastric
juice, until it is all a gray fluid.Now it is ready to go into the intestines,--a long, coiled tube which
leads out of the stomach,--from which the prepared food is taken into
the blood.The heart pumps it out with the blood
into the lungs, and then all through the body, to make bone, and muscle,
and skin, and hair, and eyes, and brain.Besides feeding all these parts, this dinner can help to mend any parts
that may be broken.Suppose a boy should break one of the bones of his arm, how could it be
mended?If you should bind together the two parts of a broken stick and leave
them a while, do you think they would grow together?But the doctor could carefully bind together the ends of the broken bone
in the boy's arm and leave it for awhile, and the blood would bring it
bone food every day, until it had grown together again.So a dinner can both make and mend the different parts of the body.What is the first thing to do to our food?What is the first thing to do after taking the
          food into your mouth?How can you prove that saliva turns starch into
          sugar?What happens if the food is not chewed and
          mixed with the saliva?What must you be careful about, when you are
          swallowing?What happens to the food after it is
          swallowed?What carries the food to every part of the
          body?[Illustration: H]ERE are the names of some of the different kinds of
food.If you write them on the blackboard or on your slates, it will

Perhaps some of you noticed that we had no wine, beer, nor any drink
that had alcohol in it, on our bill of fare for dinner.We had no
cigars, either, to be smoked after dinner.If these are good things, we
ought to have had them._We should eat in order to grow strong and keep
          strong._


STRENGTH OF BODY.If you wanted to measure your strength, one way of doing so would be to
fasten a heavy weight to one end of a rope and pass the rope over a
pulley.Then you might take hold at the other end of the rope and pull
as hard and steadily as you could, marking the place to which you raised
the weight.By trying this once a week, or once a month, you could tell
by the marks, whether you were gaining strength.We must exercise in the open air, and take pure air into our lungs to
help purify our blood, and plenty of exercise to make our muscles grow.We must eat good and simple food, that the blood may have supplies to
take to every part of the body.People used to think that alcohol made them strong.Can alcohol make good muscles, or bone, or nerve, or brain?If it can not make muscles, nor bone nor nerve, nor brain, it can not
give you any strength.Some people may tell you that drinking beer will make you strong.The grain from which the beer is made, would have given you strength.If
you should measure your strength before and after drinking beer, you
would find that you had not gained any.Most of the food part of the
grain has been turned into alcohol.The juice of crushed apples, you know, is called cider.As soon as the
cider begins to turn sour, or "hard," as people say, alcohol begins to
form in it.Pure water is good, and apples are good.But the apple-juice begins to
be a poison as soon as there is the least drop of alcohol in it.In
cider-making, the alcohol forms in the juice, you know, in a few hours
after it is pressed out of the apples.None of the drinks in which there is alcohol, can give you real
strength.Because alcohol puts the nerves to sleep, they can not, truly, tell the
brain how hard the work is, or how heavy the weight to be lifted.The alcohol has in this way cheated men into thinking they can do more
than they really can.This false feeling of strength lasts only a little
while.When it has passed, men feel weaker than before.A story which shows that alcohol does not give strength, was told me by
the captain of a ship, who sailed to China and other distant places.Many years ago, when people thought a little alcohol was good, it was
the custom to carry in every ship, a great deal of rum.This liquor is
distilled from molasses and contains about one half alcohol.This rum
was given to the sailors every day to drink; and, if there was a great
storm, and they had very hard work to do, it was the custom to give
them twice as much rum as usual.[Illustration]

The captain watched his men and saw that they were really made no
stronger by drinking the rum; but that, after a little while, they felt
weaker.So he determined to go to sea with no rum in his ship.Once out
on the ocean, of course the men could not get any.At first, they did not like it; but the captain was very careful to have
their food good and plentiful; and, when a storm came, and they were wet
and cold and tired, he gave them hot coffee to drink.By the time they
had crossed the ocean, the men said: "The captain is right.We have
worked better, and we feel stronger, for going without the rum."We have been talking about the strength of muscles; but the very best
kind of strength we have is brain strength, or strength of mind.Alcohol makes the head ache and deadens the nerves, so that they can
not carry their messages correctly.Some people have little or no money, and no houses or lands; but every
person ought to own a body and a mind that can work for him, and make
him useful and happy.Suppose you have a strong, healthy body, hands that are well-trained to
work, and a clear, thinking brain to be master of the whole.Would you
be willing to change places with a man whose body and mind had been
poisoned by alcohol, tobacco, and opium, even though he lived in a
palace, and had a million of dollars?If you want a mind that can study, understand, and think well, do not
let alcohol and tobacco have a chance to reach it.What things were left out of our bill of fare?Show why drinking wine or any other alcoholic
          drink will not make you strong.Why do people imagine that they feel strong
          after taking these drinks?Tell the story which shows that alcohol does
          not help sailors do their work.What is the best kind of strength to have?How does alcohol affect the strength of the
          mind?[Illustration: T]HE heart is in the chest, the upper part of the strong
box which the ribs, spine, shoulder-blades, and collar-bones make for
each of us.It is made of very thick, strong muscles, as you can see by looking at a
beef's heart, which is much like a man's, but larger.Probably some of you have seen a fire-engine throwing a stream of water
through a hose upon a burning building.As the engine forces the water through the hose, so the heart, by the
working of its strong muscles, pumps the blood through tubes, shaped
like hose, which lead by thousands of little branches all through the
body.These tubes are called arteries (aer't[)e]r iz).Those tubes which bring the blood back again to the heart, are called
veins (v[=a]nz).You can see some of the smaller veins in your wrist.If you press your finger upon an artery in your wrist, you can feel the
steady beating of the pulse.This tells just how fast the heart is
pumping and the blood flowing.The doctor feels your pulse when you are sick, to find out whether the
heart is working too fast, or too slowly, or just right.Some way is needed to send the gray fluid that is made from the food we
eat and drink, to every part of the body.To send the food with the blood is a sure way of making it reach every
part.So, when the stomach has prepared the food, the blood takes it up and
carries it to every part of the body.It then leaves with each part,
just what it needs.As the brain has so much work to attend to, it must have very pure, good
blood sent to it, to keep it strong.It can not be good if it has been poisoned with alcohol or tobacco.We must also remember that the brain needs a great deal of blood.If we
take alcohol into our blood, much of it goes to the brain.There it
affects the nerves, and makes a man lose control over his actions.When you run, you can feel your heart beating.It gets an instant of
rest between the beats.Good exercise in the fresh air makes the heart work well and warms the
body better than a fire could do.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE HEART?You know what harm alcohol does to the
muscles.Could a fatty heart work as well as a muscular heart?No more than a
fatty arm could do the work of a muscular arm.Besides, alcohol makes
the heart beat too fast, and so it gets too tired.How does the food we eat reach all parts of the
          body?How does alcohol in the blood affect the brain?How does exercise in the fresh air help the
          heart?[Illustration: T]HE blood flows all through the body, carrying good food
to every part.It also gathers up from every part the worn-out matter
that can no longer be used.By the time it is ready to be sent back by
the veins, the blood is no longer pure and red.It is dull and bluish in
color, because it is full of impurities.If you look at the veins in your wrist, you will see that they look
blue.If all this bad blood goes back to the heart, will the heart have to
pump out bad blood next time?No, for the heart has neighbors very near
at hand, ready to change the bad blood to pure, red blood again.They are in the chest on each side of
the heart.When you breathe, their little air-cells swell out, or
expand, to take in the air.Then they contract again, and the air passes
out through your mouth or nose.The lungs must have plenty of fresh air,
and plenty of room to work in.[Illustration: _The lungs, heart, and air-passages._]

If your clothes are too tight and the lungs do not have room to expand,
they can not take in so much air as they should.Then the blood can not
be made pure, and the whole body will suffer.For every good breath of fresh air, the lungs take in, they send out one
of impure air.In this way, by taking out what is bad, they prepare the blood to go
back to the heart pure and red, and to be pumped out through the body
again.How the lungs can use the fresh air for doing this good work, you can
not yet understand.By and by, when you are older, you will learn more
about it.You never stop breathing, not even in the night.But if you watch your
own breathing you will notice a little pause between the breaths.But the lungs are very steady workers, both by night
and by day.The least we can do for them, is to give them fresh air and
plenty of room to work in.You may say: "We can't give them more room than they have.I have seen people who wore such tight clothes that their lungs did not
have room to take a full breath.If any part of the lungs can not
expand, it will become useless.If your lungs can not take in air enough
to purify the blood, you can not be so well and strong as God intended,
and your life will be shortened.If some one was sewing for you, you would not think of shutting her up
in a little place where she could not move her hands freely.The lungs
are breathing for you, and need room enough to do their work.The lungs breathe out the waste matter that they have taken from the
blood.If we should close all the
doors and windows, and the fireplace or opening into the chimney, and
leave not even a crack by which the fresh air could come in, we would
die simply from staying in such a room.The lungs could not do their
work for the blood, and the blood could not do its work for the body.If your head
aches, and you feel dull and sleepy from being in a close room, a run in
the fresh air will make you feel better.The good, pure air makes your blood pure; and the blood then flows
quickly through your whole body and refreshes every part.We must be careful not to stay in close rooms in the day-time, nor sleep
in close rooms at night.We must not keep out the fresh air that our
bodies so much need.It is better to breathe through the nose than through the mouth.You can
soon learn to do so, if you try to keep your mouth shut when walking or
running.If you keep the mouth shut and breathe through the nose, the little
hairs on the inside of the nose will catch the dust or other impurities
that are floating in the air, and so save their going to the lungs.You
will get out of breath less quickly when running if you keep your mouth
shut.DOES ALCOHOL DO ANY HARM TO THE LUNGS?The little air-cells of the lungs have very delicate muscular (m[)u]s'ku
lar) walls.Every time we breathe, these walls have to move.The muscles
of the chest must also move, as you can all notice in yourselves, as you
breathe.All this muscular work, as well as that of the stomach and heart, is
directed by the nerves.You have learned already what alcohol will do to muscles and nerves, so
you are ready to answer for stomach, for heart, and for lungs.Besides carrying food all over the body, what
          other work does the blood do?Why does the blood in the veins look blue?Where is the blood made pure and red again?What must the lungs have in order to do this
          work?How does the air in a room become spoiled?Why is it better to breathe through the nose
          than through the mouth?[Illustration: T]HERE is another part of your body carrying away waste
matter all the time--it is the skin.It is also lined with a more delicate
kind of skin.You can see where the outside skin and the lining skin
meet at your lips.There is a thin outside layer of skin which we can pull off without
hurting ourselves; but I advise you not to do so.Because under the
outside skin is the true skin, which is so full of little nerves that it
will feel the least touch as pain.When the outer skin, which protects
it, is torn away, we must cover the true skin to keep it from harm.In hot weather, or when any one has been working or playing hard, the
face, and sometimes the whole body, is covered with little drops of
water.We call these drops perspiration (p[~e]r sp[)i] r[=a]'sh[)u]n).[Illustration: _Perspiratory tube._]

Where does it come from?It comes through many tiny holes in the skin,
called pores (p[=o]rz).Every pore is the mouth of a tiny tube which is
carrying off waste matter and water from your body.If you could piece
together all these little perspiration tubes that are in the skin of one
person, they would make a line more than three miles long.Sometimes, you can not see the perspiration, because there is not enough
of it to form drops.But it is always coming out through your skin, both
in winter and summer.Your body is kept healthy by having its worn-out
matter carried off in this way, as well as in other ways.The finger nails are little shields to protect the ends of your fingers
from getting hurt.These finger ends are full of tiny nerves, and would
be badly off without such shields.No one likes to see nails that have
been bitten.Waste matter is all the time passing out through the perspiration tubes
in the skin.This waste matter must not be left to clog up the little
openings of the tubes.It should be washed off with soap and water.When children have been playing out-of-doors, they often have very dirty
hands and faces.Any one can see, then, that they need to be washed.But
even if they had been in the cleanest place all day and had not touched
any thing dirty, they would still need the washing; for the waste matter
that comes from the inside of the body is just as hurtful as the mud or
dust of the street.You do not see it so plainly, because it comes out
very little at a time.Wash it off well, and your skin will be fresh and
healthy, and able to do its work.If the skin could not do its work, you
would die.Do not keep on your rubber boots or shoes all through school-time.Rubber will not let the perspiration pass off, so the little pores get
clogged and your feet begin to feel uncomfortable, or your head may
ache.No part can fail to do its work without causing trouble to the
rest of the body.But you should always wear rubbers out-of-doors when
the ground is wet.When you are out in the fresh air, you are giving the other parts of
your body such a good chance to perspire, that your feet can bear a
little shutting up.But as soon as you come into the house, take the
rubbers off.Now that you know what the skin is doing all the time, you will
understand that the clothes worn next to your skin are full of little
worn-out particles, brought out by the perspiration.When these clothes
are taken off at night, they should be so spread out, that they will
air well before morning.Never wear any of the clothes through the
night, that you have worn during the day.Do not roll up your night-dress in the morning and put it under your
pillow.Give it first a good airing at the window and then hang it where
the air can reach it all day.By so doing, you will have sweeter sleep
at night.You are old enough to throw the bed-clothes off from the bed, before
leaving your rooms in the morning.In this way, the bed and bed-clothes
may have a good airing.Be sure to give them time enough for this.You have now learned about four important kinds of work:--

1st.The stomach prepares the food for the blood to take.The blood is pumped out of the heart to carry food to every part of
the body, and to take away worn-out matter.The lungs use fresh air in making the dark, impure blood, bright and
pure again.The skin carries away waste matter through the little perspiration
tubes.All this work goes on, day and night, without our needing to think about
it at all; for messages are sent to the muscles by the nerves which keep
them faithfully at work, whether we know it or not.What is the common name
          for it?How does the perspiration help to keep you
          well?Why should you not wear rubber boots or
          overshoes in the house?Why should you change under-clothing night and
          morning?Where should the night-dress be placed in the
          morning?What should be done with the bed-clothes?Name the four kinds of work about which you
          have learned.How are the organs of the body kept at work?[Illustration: W]E have five ways of learning about all things around
us.We can see them, touch them, taste them, smell them, or hear them.Sight, touch, taste, smell, and hearing, are called the five senses.You already know something about them, for you are using them all the
time.In this lesson, you will learn a little more about seeing and hearing.In the middle of your eye is a round, black spot, called the pupil.This
pupil is only a hole with a muscle around it.When you are in the light,
the muscle draws up, and makes the pupil small, because you can get all
the light you need through a small opening.When you are in the dark,
the muscle stretches, and opens the pupil wide to let in more light.The pupils of the cat's eyes are very large in the dark.They want all
the light they can get, to see if there are any mice about.[Illustration: _The eyelashes and the tear-glands._]

The pupil of the eye opens into a little, round room where the nerve of
sight is.This is a safe place for this delicate nerve, which can not
bear too much light.It carries to the brain an account of every thing
we see.We might say the eye is taking pictures for us all day long, and that
the nerve of sight is describing these pictures to the brain.The nerves of sight need great care, for they are very delicate.Do not face a bright light when you are reading or studying.While
writing, you should sit so that the light will come from the left side;
then the shadow of your hand will not fall upon your work.One or two true stories may help you to remember that you must take good
care of your eyes.The nerve of sight can not bear too bright a light.It asks to have the
pupil made small, and even the eyelid curtains put down, when the light
is too strong.Once, there was a boy who said boastfully to his playmates: "Let us see
which of us can look straight at the sun for the longest time."Then they foolishly began to look at the sun.The delicate nerves of
sight felt a sharp pain, and begged to have the pupils made as small as
possible and the eyelid curtains put down.They were trying to see which would bear
it the longest.Great harm was done to the brains as well as eyes of
both these boys.The one who looked longest at the sun died in
consequence of his foolish act.The second story is about a little boy who tried to turn his eyes to
imitate a schoolmate who was cross-eyed.He turned them; but he could
not turn them back again.Although he is now a gentleman more than fifty
years old and has had much painful work done upon his eyes, the doctors
have never been able to set them quite right.You see from the first story, that you must be careful not to give your
eyes too much light.But you must also be sure to give them light
enough.When one tries to read in the twilight, the little nerve of sight says:
"Give me more light; I am hurt, by trying to see in the dark."If you should kill these delicate nerves, no others would ever grow in
place of them, and you would never be able to see again.What you call your ears are only pieces of gristle, so curved as to
catch the sounds and pass them along to the true ears.These are deeper
in the head, where the nerve of hearing is waiting to send an account
of each sound to the brain.The ear nerve is in less danger than that of the eye.Careless children
sometimes put pins into their ears and so break the "drum."That is a
very bad thing to do.Use only a soft towel in washing your ears.You
should never put any thing hard or sharp into them.I must tell you a short ear story, about my father, when he was a small
boy.One day, when playing on the floor, he laid his ear to the crack of the
door, to feel the wind blow into it.He was so young that he did not
know it was wrong; but the next day he had the earache severely.Although he lived to be an old man, he often had the earache.He thought
it began from the time when the wind blew into his ear from under that
door.ALCOHOL AND THE SENSES.All this fine work of touching, tasting, seeing, smelling, and hearing,
is nerve work.The man who is in the habit of using alcoholic drinks can not touch,
taste, see, smell, or hear so well as he ought.His hands tremble, his
speech is sometimes thick, and often he can not walk straight.Sometimes, he thinks he sees things when he does not, because his poor
nerves are so confused by alcohol that they can not do their work.Answer now for your taste, smell, and touch, and also for your sight and
hearing; should their beautiful work be spoiled by alcohol?Where should the light be for reading or
          studying?Tell the story of the boys who looked at the
          sun.Tell the story of the boy who made himself
          cross-eyed.What would be the result, if you should kill
          the nerves of sight?Tell the story of the boy who injured his ear.How is the work of the senses affected by
          drinking liquor?"[Illustration: M]Y thick, warm clothes make me warm," says some child.Take a brisk run, and your blood will flow faster and you will be warm
very quickly.On a cold day, the teamster claps his hands and swings his arms to make
his blood flow quickly and warm him.Every child knows that he is warm inside; for if his fingers are cold,
he puts them into his mouth to warm them.If you should put a little thermometer into your mouth, or under your
tongue, the mercury (m[~e]r'ku r[)y]) would rise as high as it does out
of doors on a hot, summer day.This would be the same in summer or winter, in a warm country or a cold
one, if you were well and the work of your body was going on steadily.Some of the work which is all the time going on inside your body, makes
this heat.The blood is thus warmed, and then it carries the heat to every part of
the body.The faster the blood flows, the more heat it brings, and the
warmer we feel.In children, the heart pumps from eighty to ninety times a minute.This is faster than it works in old people, and this is one reason why
children are generally much warmer than old people.You may breathe in cold air; but that which you breathe out is warm.A
great deal of heat from your warm body is all the time passing off
through your skin, into the cooler air about you.For this reason, a
room full of people is much warmer than the same room when empty.We put on clothes to keep in the heat which we already have, and to
prevent the cold air from reaching our skins and carrying off too much
heat in that way.Most of you children are too young to choose what clothes you will wear.You know, however, that woolen under-garments
keep you warm in winter, and that thick boots and stockings should be
worn in cold weather.Thin dresses or boots may look pretty; but they
are not safe for winter wear, even at a party.A healthy, happy child, dressed in clothes which are suitable for the
season, is pleasanter to look at than one whose dress, though rich and
handsome, is not warm enough for health or comfort.When you feel cold, take exercise, if possible.This will make the hot
blood flow all through your body and warm it.If you can not, you should
put on more clothes, go to a warm room, in some way get warm and keep
warm, or the cold will make you sick.If your skin is chilled, the tiny mouths of the perspiration tubes are
sometimes closed and can not throw out the waste matter.Then, if one
part fails to do its work, other parts must suffer.Perhaps the inside
skin becomes inflamed, or the throat and lungs, and you have a cold, or
a cough.People used to think that nothing would warm one so well on a cold day,
as a glass of whiskey, or other alcoholic drink.It is true that, if a person drinks a little alcohol, he will feel a
burning in the throat, and presently a glowing heat on the skin.The alcohol has made the hot blood rush into the tiny tubes near the
skin, and he thinks it has warmed him.But if all this heat comes to the skin, the cold air has a chance to
carry away more than usual.In a very little time, the drinker will be
colder than before.Perhaps he will not know it; for the cheating
alcohol will have deadened his nerves so that they send no message to
the brain.Then he may not have sense enough to put on more clothing and
may freeze.He may even, if it is very cold, freeze to death.People, who have not been drinking alcohol are sometimes frozen; but
they would have frozen much quicker if they had drunk it.Horse-car drivers and omnibus drivers have a hard time on a cold winter
day.They are often cheated into thinking that alcohol will keep them
warm; but doctors have learned that it is the water-drinkers who hold
out best against the cold.Alcohol can not really keep a person warm.All children are interested in stories about Arctic explorers, whose
ships get frozen into great ice-fields, who travel on sledges drawn by
dogs, and sometimes live in Esquimau huts, and drink oil, and eat walrus
meat.These men tell us that alcohol will not keep them warm, and you know
why.The hunters and trappers in the snowy regions of the Rocky Mountains say
the same thing.Alcohol not only can not keep them warm; but it lessens
their power to resist cold.[Illustration: _Scene in the Arctic regions._]

Many of you have heard about the Greely party who were brought home from
the Arctic seas, after they had been starving and freezing for many
months.Seven were
found alive by their rescuers; one of these died soon afterward.The
first man who died, was the only one of the party who had ever been a
drunkard.Of the nineteen who died, all but one used tobacco.Of the six now
living,--four never used tobacco at all; and the other two, very seldom.The tobacco was no real help to them in time of trouble.It had probably
weakened their stomachs, so that they could not make the best use of
such poor food as they had.Why do you wear thick clothes in cold weather?How can you prove that you are warm inside?How can you warm yourself without going to the
          fire?How does it cheat you into thinking that you
          will be warmer for drinking it?What do the people who travel in very cold
          countries, tell us about the use of alcohol?How did tobacco affect the men who went to the
          Arctic seas with Lieutenant Greely?[Illustration: N]OW that you have learned about your bodies, and what
alcohol will do to them, you ought also to know that alcohol costs a
great deal of money.Money spent for that which will do no good, but
only harm, is certainly wasted, and worse than wasted.If a boy or a girl save ten cents a week, it will take ten weeks to save
a dollar.You can all think of many good and pleasant ways to spend a dollar.What
would the beer-drinker do with it?If he takes two mugs of beer a day,
the dollar will be used up in ten days.But we ought not to say used,
because that word will make us think it was spent usefully.We will say,
instead, the dollar will be wasted, in ten days.If he spends it for wine or whiskey, it will go sooner, as these cost
more.If no money was spent for liquor in this country, people would not
so often be sick, or poor, or bad, or wretched.We should not need so
many policemen, and jails, and prisons, as we have now.If no liquor was
drunk, men, women, and children would be better and happier.Most of you have a little money of your own.Perhaps you earned a part,
or the whole of it, yourselves.You are planning what to do with it, and
that is a very pleasant kind of planning.Do you think it would be wise to make a dollar bill into a tight little
roll, light one end of it with a match, and then let it slowly burn up?(_See Frontispiece._)

Yes!It would be worse than wasted,
if, while burning, it should also hurt the person who held it.If you
should buy cigars or tobacco with your dollar, and smoke them, you could
soon burn up the dollar and hurt yourselves besides.Then, when you begin to have some idea how much six
hundred millions is, remember that six hundred million dollars are spent
in this country every year for tobacco--burned up--wasted--worse than
wasted.Do you think the farmer who planted tobacco instead of corn, did any
good to the world by the change?How does the liquor-drinker spend his money?What could we do, if no money was spent for
          liquor?Tell two ways in which you could burn up a
          dollar bill.How much money is spent for tobacco, yearly, in
          this country?*       *       *       *       *

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *

QUEER QUERIES.--"SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED."--What is this talk at the

connection--as a shareholder--with one of our leading gas companies,
enables me to state authoritatively that no new gas is required by the
public.I am surprised that a nobleman like Lord RAYLEIGH should even
attempt to make such a thoroughly useless, and, indeed, revolutionary
discovery.It is enough to turn anyone into a democrat at once.And what
was Lord SALISBURY, as a Conservative, doing, in allowing such a subject
to be mooted at Oxford?Why did he not at once turn the new gas off at
the meter?*       *       *       *       *

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.[Illustration]

From HENRY SOTHERAN & CO.(so a worthy Baronite reports) comes a second
edition of _Game Birds and Shooting Sketches_, by JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS.Every sportsman who is something more than a mere bird-killer ought to
buy this beautiful book.MILLAIS' drawings are wonderfully delicate,
and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate.He has a fine touch for
plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and resolute
bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own peculiar
haunts.I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr.MILLAIS in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr.Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him.MILLAIS will consider the matter in his third edition.*       *       *       *       *

WET-WILLOW.A SONG OF A SLOPPY SEASON.(_By a Washed-Out Willow-Wielder._)

AIR--"_Titwillow._"

  In the dull, damp pavilion a popular "Bat"
    Sang "Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"great slogger, pray what are you at,
    Singing 'Willow, wet-willow, wet-willow'?Is it lowness of average, batsman," I cried;
  "Or a bad 'brace of ducks' that has lowered your pride?"With a low-muttered swear-word or two he replied,
    "Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"He said "In the mud one can't score, anyhow,
    Singing willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!The people are raising a deuce of a row,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!I've been waiting all day in these flannels--they're damp!--
  The spectators impatiently shout, shriek, and stamp,
  But a batsman, you see, cannot play with a Gamp,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!"Now I feel just as sure as I am that my name
    Isn't willow, wet-willow, wet-willow,
  The people will swear that I don't play the game,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!My spirits are low and my scores are not high,
  But day after day we've soaked turf and grey sky,
  And I shan't have a chance till the wickets get dry,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!!!"*       *       *       *       *

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the

    You absolutely did not know the way,
  Though when you did, it seemed much to your mind

  Enough to answer, "Why, _of course_, you may."I kissed your pretty face with hay entwined,
  We made sweet hay.But what will Mother say
    If in a dozen years we're still inclined
                  To make sweet hay?*       *       *       *       *

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.It is simple enough; it is plain enough.You know I
love you, Ellen, and you only, and that is all there is to it, and all
that there is of any consequence in the world to me.The matter stops
there; that is all there is for you to consider.Answer me, Ellen, speak
to me.He stopped and moved a step toward her, but as he did so, the girl,
still without looking up, drew herself nearer to her father and shrank
more closely into his arms; but the father's face was troubled and
doubtful, and he regarded the younger man with a look of the most
anxious scrutiny.Their hands were raised
against him as far as he could understand, and he broke forth again
proudly, and with a defiant indignation:

"What right have you to judge me?"he began; "what do you know of what
I have suffered, and endured, and overcome?How can you know what I have
had to give up and put away from me?It's easy enough for you to draw
your skirts around you, but what can a woman bred as you have been bred
know of what I've had to fight against and keep under and cut away?It
was an easy, beautiful idyl to you; your love came to you only when it
should have come, and for a man who was good and worthy, and distinctly
eligible--I don't mean that; forgive me, Ellen, but you drive me beside
myself.But he is good and he believes himself worthy, and I say that
myself before you both.But I am only worthy and only good because of
that other love that I put away when it became a crime, when it became
impossible.Do you know what it meant to
me, and what I went through, and how I suffered?Do you know who this
other woman is whom you are insulting with your doubts and guesses in
the dark?Perhaps it was easy
for her, too; perhaps her silence cost her nothing; perhaps she did not
suffer and has nothing but happiness and content to look forward to for
the rest of her life; and I tell you that it is because we did put
it away, and kill it, and not give way to it that I am whatever I am
to-day; whatever good there is in me is due to that temptation and
to the fact that I beat it and overcame it and kept myself honest and
clean.And when I met you and learned to know you I believed in my heart
that God had sent you to me that I might know what it was to love a
woman whom I could marry and who could be my wife; that you were the
reward for my having overcome temptation and the sign that I had done
well.And now you throw me over and put me aside as though I were
something low and unworthy, because of this temptation, because of this
very thing that has made me know myself and my own strength and that has
kept me up for you."As the young man had been speaking, the bishop's eyes had never left
his face, and as he finished, the face of the priest grew clearer and
decided, and calmly exultant.And as Latimer ceased he bent his head
above his daughter's, and said in a voice that seemed to speak with more
than human inspiration."My child," he said, "if God had given me a son
I should have been proud if he could have spoken as this young man has
done."But the woman only said, "Let him go to her."He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and
feelingly at her lover."How could you, Ellen," he said, "how could
you?"He was watching the young man's face with eyes full of sympathy
and concern."How little you know him," he said, "how little you
understand.He will not do that," he added quickly, but looking
questioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command."He
will not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that."But
Latimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each
other and questioning each other with their eyes.Then Latimer turned,
and without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the
door and left the room.He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into
the night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street.Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off
in two long perspectives.The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages
flashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the
turnings of the cross-streets, and from either side came the ceaseless
rush and murmur, and over all hung the strange mystery that covers a
great city at night.Latimer's rooms lay to the south, but he stood
looking toward a spot to the north with a reckless, harassed look in his
face that had not been there for many months.He stood so for a minute,
and then gave a short shrug of disgust at his momentary doubt and ran
quickly down the steps."No," he said, "if it were for a month, yes; but
it is to be for many years, many more long years."And turning his back
resolutely to the north he went slowly home.8


The "trailer" for the green-goods men who rented room No.8 in Case's
tenement had had no work to do for the last few days, and was cursing
his luck in consequence.He was entirely too young to curse, but he had never been told so, and,
indeed, so imperfect had his training been that he had never been told
not to do anything as long as it pleased him to do it and made existence
any more bearable.He had been told when he was very young, before the man and woman who
had brought him into the world had separated, not to crawl out on the
fire-escape, because he might break his neck, and later, after his
father had walked off Hegelman's Slip into the East River while very
drunk, and his mother had been sent to the penitentiary for grand
larceny, he had been told not to let the police catch him sleeping under
the bridge.With these two exceptions he had been told to do as he pleased, which
was the very mockery of advice, as he was just about as well able to do
as he pleased as is any one who has to beg or steal what he eats and has
to sleep in hall-ways or over the iron gratings of warm cellars and has
the officers of the children's societies always after him to put him in
a "Home" and make him be "good.""Snipes," as the trailer was called, was determined no one should ever
force him to be good if he could possibly prevent it.And he certainly
did do a great deal to prevent it.Some of the boys who had escaped from the Home had told him all about
that.It meant wearing shoes and a blue and white checkered apron, and
making cane-bottomed chairs all day, and having to wash yourself in a
big iron tub twice a week, not to speak of having to move about like
machines whenever the lady teacher hit a bell.So when the green-goods
men, of whom the genial Mr.Alf Wolfe was the chief, asked Snipes to
act as "trailer" for them at a quarter of a dollar for every victim he
shadowed, he jumped at the offer and was proud of the position.If you should happen to keep a grocery store in the country, or to
run the village post-office, it is not unlikely that you know what a
green-goods man is; but in case you don't, and have only a vague idea
as to how he lives, a paragraph of explanation must be inserted here
for your particular benefit.Green goods is the technical name for
counterfeit bills, and the green-goods men send out circulars to
countrymen all over the United States, offering to sell them $5,000
worth of counterfeit money for $500, and ease their conscience by
explaining to them that by purchasing these green goods they are hurting
no one but the Government, which is quite able, with its big surplus, to
stand the loss.They enclose a letter which is to serve their victim as
a mark of identification or credential when he comes on to purchase.The address they give him is in one of the many drug-store and
cigar-store post-offices which are scattered all over New York, and
which contribute to make vice and crime so easy that the evil they do
cannot be reckoned in souls lost or dollars stolen.If the letter from
the countryman strikes the dealers in green goods as sincere, they
appoint an interview with him by mail in rooms they rent for the
purpose, and if they, on meeting him there, think he is still in earnest
and not a detective or officer in disguise, they appoint still another
interview, to be held later in the day in the back room of some saloon.Then the countryman is watched throughout the day from the moment
he leaves the first meeting-place until he arrives at the saloon.If
anything in his conduct during that time leads the man whose duty it is
to follow him, or the "trailer," as the profession call it, to believe
he is a detective, he finds when he arrives at the saloon that there
is no one to receive him.But if the trailer regards his conduct as
unsuspicious, he is taken to another saloon, not the one just appointed,
which is, perhaps, a most respectable place, but to the thieves' own
private little rendezvous, where he is robbed in any of the several
different ways best suited to their purpose.He was so little that no one ever
noticed him, and he could keep a man in sight no matter how big the
crowd was, or how rapidly it changed and shifted.And he was as patient
as he was quick, and would wait for hours if needful, with his eye on
a door, until his man reissued into the street again.And if the one he
shadowed looked behind him to see if he was followed, or dodged up and
down different streets, as if he were trying to throw off pursuit, or
despatched a note or telegram, or stopped to speak to a policeman or any
special officer, as a detective might, who thought he had his men safely
in hand, off Snipes would go on a run, to where Alf Wolfe was waiting,
and tell what he had seen.Then Wolfe would give him a quarter or more, and the trailer would go
back to his post opposite Case's tenement, and wait for another victim
to issue forth, and for the signal from No.It was not
much fun, and "customers," as Mr.Wolfe always called them, had been
scarce, and Mr.Wolfe, in consequence, had been cross and nasty in his
temper, and had batted Snipe out of the way on more than one occasion.So the trailer was feeling blue and disconsolate, and wondered how it
was that "Naseby" Raegen, "Rags" Raegen's younger brother, had had the
luck to get a two weeks' visit to the country with the Fresh Air Fund
children, while he had not.He supposed it was because Naseby had sold papers, and wore shoes, and
went to night school, and did many other things equally objectionable.Still, what Naseby had said about the country, and riding horseback,
and the fishing, and the shooting crows with no cops to stop you, and
watermelons for nothing, had sounded wonderfully attractive and quite
improbable, except that it was one of Naseby's peculiarly sneaking ways
to tell the truth.Anyway, Naseby had left Cherry Street for good, and
had gone back to the country to work there.This all helped to make
Snipes morose, and it was with a cynical smile of satisfaction that he
watched an old countryman coming slowly up the street, and asking his
way timidly of the Italians to Case's tenement.The countryman looked up and about him in evident bewilderment and
anxiety.He glanced hesitatingly across at the boy leaning against the
wall of a saloon, but the boy was watching two sparrows fighting in the
dirt of the street, and did not see him.At least, it did not look as if
he saw him.Then the old man knocked on the door of Case's tenement.No one came, for the people in the house had learned to leave inquiring
countrymen to the gentleman who rented room No.8, and as that gentleman
was occupied at that moment with a younger countryman, he allowed the
old man, whom he had first cautiously observed from the top of the
stairs, to remain where he was.The old man stood uncertainly on the stoop, and then removed his heavy
black felt hat and rubbed his bald head and the white shining locks of
hair around it with a red bandanna handkerchief.Then he walked very
slowly across the street toward Snipes, for the rest of the street was
empty, and there was no one else at hand.The old man was dressed in
heavy black broadcloth, quaintly cut, with boot legs showing up under
the trousers, and with faultlessly clean linen of home-made manufacture."I can't make the people in that house over there hear me," complained
the old man, with the simple confidence that old age has in very young
boys."Do you happen to know if they're at home?""I'm looking for a man named Perceval," said the stranger; "he lives in
that house, and I wanter see him on most particular business.It isn't
a very pleasing place he lives in, is it--at least," he hurriedly added,
as if fearful of giving offence, "it isn't much on the outside?Do you
happen to know him?"Perceval was Alf Wolfe's business name."Well, I'm not looking for him," explained the stranger, slowly, "as
much as I'm looking for a young man that I kind of suspect is been
to see him to-day: a young man that looks like me, only younger.Has
lightish hair and pretty tall and lanky, and carrying a shiny black bag
with him.Did you happen to hev noticed him going into that place across
the way?"The old man sighed and nodded his head thoughtfully at Snipes, and
puckered up the corners of his mouth, as though he were thinking deeply.He had wonderfully honest blue eyes, and with the white hair hanging
around his sun-burned face, he looked like an old saint.But the trailer
didn't know that: he did know, though, that this man was a different
sort from the rest."What is't you want to see him about?"he asked sullenly, while he
looked up and down the street and everywhere but at the old man, and
rubbed one bare foot slowly over the other.The old man looked pained, and much to Snipe's surprise, the question
brought the tears to his eyes, and his lips trembled.Then he swerved
slightly, so that he might have fallen if Snipes had not caught him and
helped him across the pavement to a seat on a stoop."Thankey, son,"
said the stranger; "I'm not as strong as I was, an' the sun's mighty
hot, an' these streets of yours smell mighty bad, and I've had a
powerful lot of trouble these last few days.But if I could see this
man Perceval before my boy does, I know I could fix it, and it would all
come out right.""What do you want to see him about?"repeated the trailer, suspiciously,
while he fanned the old man with his hat.Snipes could not have told you
why he did this or why this particular old countryman was any different
from the many others who came to buy counterfeit money and who were
thieves at heart as well as in deed."I want to see him about my son," said the old man to the little boy."He's a bad man whoever he is.This 'ere Perceval is a bad man.He sends
down his wickedness to the country and tempts weak folks to sin.He
teaches 'em ways of evil-doing they never heard of, and he's ruined my
son with the others--ruined him.I've had nothing to do with the city
and its ways; we're strict living, simple folks, and perhaps we've been
too strict, or Abraham wouldn't have run away to the city.But I thought
it was best, and I doubted nothing when the fresh-air children came to
the farm.I didn't like city children, but I let 'em come.I took
'em in, and did what I could to make it pleasant for 'em.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.Poor little
fellers, all as thin as corn-stalks and pale as ghosts, and as dirty as
you."I took 'em in and let 'em ride the horses, and swim in the river, and
shoot crows in the cornfield, and eat all the cherries they could
pull, and what did the city send me in return for that?It sent me this
thieving, rascally scheme of this man Perceval's, and it turned my boy's
head, and lost him to me.I saw him poring over the note and reading it
as if it were Gospel, and I suspected nothing.And when he asked me if
he could keep it, I said yes he could, for I thought he wanted it for a
curiosity, and then off he put with the black bag and the $200 he's been
saving up to start housekeeping with when the old Deacon says he can
marry his daughter Kate."The old man placed both hands on his knees and
went on excitedly."The old Deacon says he'll not let 'em marry till Abe has $2,000, and
that is what the boy's come after.He wants to buy $2,000 worth of bad
money with his $200 worth of good money, to show the Deacon, just as
though it were likely a marriage after such a crime as that would ever
be a happy one."Snipes had stopped fanning the old man, as he ran on, and was listening
intently, with an uncomfortable feeling of sympathy and sorrow,
uncomfortable because he was not used to it.He could not see why the old man should think the city should have
treated his boy better because he had taken care of the city's children,
and he was puzzled between his allegiance to the gang and his desire
to help the gang's innocent victim, and then because he was an innocent
victim and not a "customer," he let his sympathy get the better of his
discretion."Saay," he began, abruptly, "I'm not sayin' nothin' to nobody, and
nobody's sayin' nothin' to me--see?but I guess your son'll be around
here to-day, sure.He's got to come before one, for this office closes
sharp at one, and we goes home.Now, I've got the call whether he gets
his stuff taken off him or whether the boys leave him alone.If I say
the word, they'd no more come near him than if he had the cholera--see?An' I'll say it for this oncet, just for you.Hold on," he commanded, as
the old man raised his voice in surprised interrogation, "don't ask no
questions, 'cause you won't get no answers 'except lies.You find your
way back to the Grand Central Depot and wait there, and I'll steer your
son down to you, sure, as soon as I can find him--see?Now get along, or
you'll get me inter trouble.""You've been lying to me, then," cried the old man, "and you're as bad
as any of them, and my boy's over in that house now."He scrambled up from the stoop, and before the trailer could understand
what he proposed to do, had dashed across the street and up the stoop,
and up the stairs, and had burst into room No.come back out of that, you old fool!"Snipes was afraid to enter room
No.8, but he could hear from the outside the old man challenging Alf
Wolfe in a resonant angry voice that rang through the building.said Snipes, crouching on the stairs, "there's goin' to be a
muss this time, sure!"He ran across the room and pulled open a door that led into another
room, but it was empty.He had fully expected to see his boy murdered
and quartered, and with his pockets inside out.He turned on Wolfe,
shaking his white hair like a mane."Give me up my son, you rascal you!"he cried, "or I'll get the police, and I'll tell them how you decoy
honest boys to your den and murder them.""Are you drunk or crazy, or just a little of both?""For a cent I'd throw you out of that window.You're too old to get excited like that; it's not good for you."But this only exasperated the old man the more, and he made a lunge
at the confidence man's throat.Wolfe stepped aside and caught him
around the waist and twisted his leg around the old man's rheumatic one,
and held him."Now," said Wolfe, as quietly as though he were giving a
lesson in wrestling, "if I wanted to, I could break your back."The old man glared up at him, panting."Your son's not here," said
Wolfe, "and this is a private gentleman's private room.I could turn
you over to the police for assault if I wanted to; but," he added,
magnanimously, "I won't.Now get out of here and go home to your wife,
and when you come to see the sights again don't drink so much raw
whiskey."He half carried the old farmer to the top of the stairs and
dropped him, and went back and closed the door.Snipes came up and
helped him down and out, and the old man and the boy walked slowly and
in silence out to the Bowery.Snipes helped his companion into a car and
put him off at the Grand Central Depot.The heat and the excitement had
told heavily on the old man, and he seemed dazed and beaten.He was leaning on the trailer's shoulder and waiting for his turn in
the line in front of the ticket window, when a tall, gawky, good-looking
country lad sprang out of it and at him with an expression of surprise
and anxiety."Father," he said, "father, what's wrong?"Abraham," said the old man, simply, and dropped heavily on the younger
man's shoulder.Then he raised his head sternly and said: "I thought you
were murdered, but better that than a thief, Abraham.What did you do with that rascal's letter?The trailer drew cautiously away; the conversation was becoming
unpleasantly personal."I don't know what you're talking about," said Abraham, calmly."The
Deacon gave his consent the other night without the $2,000, and I took
the $200 I'd saved and came right on in the fust train to buy the ring.he said, flushing, as he pulled out a little
velvet box and opened it.The old man was so happy at this that he laughed and cried alternately,
and then he made a grab for the trailer and pulled him down beside him
on one of the benches."You've got to come with me," he said, with kind severity."You're a
good boy, but your folks have let you run wrong.You've been good to
me, and you said you would get me back my boy and save him from those
thieves, and I believe now that you meant it.Now you're just coming
back with us to the farm and the cows and the river, and you can eat
all you want and live with us, and never, never see this unclean, wicked
city again."Snipes looked up keenly from under the rim of his hat and rubbed one of
his muddy feet over the other as was his habit.The young countryman,
greatly puzzled, and the older man smiling kindly, waited expectantly in
silence.From outside came the sound of the car-bells jangling, and the
rattle of cabs, and the cries of drivers, and all the varying rush and
turmoil of a great metropolis.Green fields, and running rivers, and
fruit that did not grow in wooden boxes or brown paper cones, were myths
and idle words to Snipes, but this "unclean, wicked city" he knew."I guess you're too good for me," he said, with an uneasy laugh."I
guess little old New York's good enough for me."cried the old man, in the tones of greatest concern."You would
go back to that den of iniquity, surely not,--to that thief Perceval?""Well," said the trailer, slowly, "and he's not such a bad lot, neither.You see he could hev broke your neck that time when you was choking him,
but he didn't.There's your train," he added hurriedly and jumping away.I'm much 'bliged to you jus' for asking me."Two hours later the farmer and his son were making the family weep and
laugh over their adventures, as they all sat together on the porch with
the vines about it; and the trailer was leaning against the wall of a
saloon and apparently counting his ten toes, but in reality watching for
Mr.Wolfe to give the signal from the window of room No."THERE WERE NINETY AND NINE"


Young Harringford, or the "Goodwood Plunger," as he was perhaps better
known at that time, had come to Monte Carlo in a very different spirit
and in a very different state of mind from any in which he had ever
visited the place before.He had come there for the same reason that
a wounded lion, or a poisoned rat, for that matter, crawls away into a
corner, that it may be alone when it dies.He stood leaning against one
of the pillars of the Casino with his back to the moonlight, and with
his eyes blinking painfully at the flaming lamps above the green tables
inside.He knew they would be put out very soon; and as he had something
to do then, he regarded them fixedly with painful earnestness, as a man
who is condemned to die at sunrise watches through his barred windows
for the first gray light of the morning.That queer, numb feeling in his head and the sharp line of pain between
his eyebrows which had been growing worse for the last three weeks, was
troubling him more terribly than ever before, and his nerves had thrown
off all control and rioted at the base of his head and at his wrists,
and jerked and twitched as though, so it seemed to him, they were
striving to pull the tired body into pieces and to set themselves free.He was wondering whether if he should take his hand from his pocket and
touch his head he would find that it had grown longer, and had turned
into a soft, spongy mass which would give beneath his fingers.He
considered this for some time, and even went so far as to half withdraw
one hand, but thought better of it and shoved it back again as he
considered how much less terrible it was to remain in doubt than to find
that this phenomenon had actually taken place.The pity of the whole situation was, that the boy was only a boy with
all his man's miserable knowledge of the world, and the reason of it all
was, that he had entirely too much heart and not enough money to make
an unsuccessful gambler.If he had only been able to lose his conscience
instead of his money, or even if he had kept his conscience and won, it
is not likely that he would have been waiting for the lights to go
out at Monte Carlo.But he had not only lost all of his money and more
besides, which he could never make up, but he had lost other things
which meant much more to him now than money, and which could not be
made up or paid back at even usurious interest.He had not only lost the
right to sit at his father's table, but the right to think of the girl
whose place in Surrey ran next to that of his own people, and whose
lighted window in the north wing he had watched on those many dreary
nights when she had been ill, from his own terrace across the trees
in the park.And all he had gained was the notoriety that made him a
by-word with decent people, and the hero of the race-tracks and the
music-halls.He was no longer "Young Harringford, the eldest son of the
Harringfords of Surrey," but the "Goodwood Plunger," to whom Fortune had
made desperate love and had then jilted, and mocked, and overthrown.As he looked back at it now and remembered himself as he was then, it
seemed as though he was considering an entirely distinct and separate
personage--a boy of whom he liked to think, who had had strong, healthy
ambitions and gentle tastes.He reviewed it passionlessly as he stood
staring at the lights inside the Casino, as clearly as he was capable
of doing in his present state and with miserable interest.How he had
laughed when young Norton told him in boyish confidence that there was
a horse named Siren in his father's stables which would win the Goodwood
Cup; how, having gone down to see Norton's people when the long vacation
began, he had seen Siren daily, and had talked of her until two every
morning in the smoking-room, and had then staid up two hours later to
watch her take her trial spin over the downs.He remembered how they
used to stamp back over the long grass wet with dew, comparing watches
and talking of the time in whispers, and said good night as the sun
broke over the trees in the park.And then just at this time of all
others, when the horse was the only interest of those around him, from
Lord Norton and his whole household down to the youngest stable-boy and
oldest gaffer in the village, he had come into his money.And then began the then and still inexplicable plunge into gambling,
and the wagering of greater sums than the owner of Siren dared to risk
himself, the secret backing of the horse through commissioners all
over England, until the boy by his single fortune had brought the odds
against her from 60 to 0 down to 6 to 0.He recalled, with a thrill that
seemed to settle his nerves for the moment, the little black specks at
the starting-post and the larger specks as the horses turned the first
corner.The rest of the people on the coach were making a great deal of
noise, he remembered, but he, who had more to lose than any one or all
of them together, had stood quite still with his feet on the wheel and
his back against the box-seat, and with his hands sunk into his pockets
and the nails cutting through his gloves.The specks grew into horses
with bits of color on them, and then the deep muttering roar of the
crowd merged into one great shout, and swelled and grew into sharper,
quicker, impatient cries, as the horses turned into the stretch with
only their heads showing toward the goal.Some of the people were
shouting "Firefly!"and others were calling on "Vixen!"and others, who
had their glasses up, cried "Trouble leads!"but he only waited until
he could distinguish the Norton colors, with his lips pressed tightly
together.Then they came so close that their hoofs echoed as loudly as
when horses gallop over a bridge, and from among the leaders Siren's
beautiful head and shoulders showed like sealskin in the sun, and the
boy on her back leaned forward and touched her gently with his hand, as
they had so often seen him do on the downs, and Siren, as though he had
touched a spring, leaped forward with her head shooting back and out,
like a piston-rod that has broken loose from its fastening and beats the
air, while the jockey sat motionless, with his right arm hanging at
his side as limply as though it were broken, and with his left moving
forward and back in time with the desperate strokes of the horse's head.cried Lord Norton, with a grim smile, and "Siren!"the
mob shouted back with wonder and angry disappointment, and "Siren!"the
hills echoed from far across the course.Young Harringford felt as if
he had suddenly been lifted into heaven after three months of purgatory,
and smiled uncertainly at the excited people on the coach about him.It
made him smile even now when he recalled young Norton's flushed face
and the awe and reproach in his voice when he climbed up and whispered,
"Why, Cecil, they say in the ring you've won a fortune, and you never
told us."And how Griffith, the biggest of the book-makers, with
the rest of them at his back, came up to him and touched his hat
resentfully, and said, "You'll have to give us time, sir; I'm very hard
hit"; and how the crowd stood about him and looked at him curiously,
and the Certain Royal Personage turned and said, "Who--not that boy,
surely?"Then how, on the day following, the papers told of the young
gentleman who of all others had won a fortune, thousands and thousands
of pounds they said, getting back sixty for every one he had ventured;
and pictured him in baby clothes with the cup in his arms, or in an Eton
jacket; and how all of them spoke of him slightingly, or admiringly, as
the "Goodwood Plunger."He did not care to go on after that; to recall the mortification of his
father, whose pride was hurt and whose hopes were dashed by this sudden,
mad freak of fortune, nor how he railed at it and provoked him until the
boy rebelled and went back to the courses, where he was a celebrity and
a king.Fortune and greater fortune at first;
days in which he could not lose, days in which he drove back to the
crowded inns choked with dust, sunburnt and fagged with excitement, to
a riotous supper and baccarat, and afterward went to sleep only to see
cards and horses and moving crowds and clouds of dust; days spent in
a short covert coat, with a field-glass over his shoulder and with a
pasteboard ticket dangling from his buttonhole; and then came the change
that brought conscience up again, and the visits to the Jews, and the
slights of the men who had never been his friends, but whom he had
thought had at least liked him for himself, even if he did not like
them; and then debts, and more debts, and the borrowing of money to pay
here and there, and threats of executions; and, with it all, the longing
for the fields and trout springs of Surrey and the walk across the park
to where she lived.This grew so strong that he wrote to his father, and was told briefly
that he who was to have kept up the family name had dragged it into the
dust of the race-courses, and had changed it at his own wish to that of
the Boy Plunger--and that the breach was irreconcilable.Then this queer feeling came on, and he wondered why he could not eat,
and why he shivered even when the room was warm or the sun shining, and
the fear came upon him that with all this trouble and disgrace his head
might give way, and then that it had given way.This came to him at all
times, and lately more frequently and with a fresher, more cruel thrill
of terror, and he began to watch himself and note how he spoke, and to
repeat over what he had said to see if it were sensible, and to question
himself as to why he laughed, and at what.It was not a question of
whether it would or would not be cowardly; It was simply a necessity.He had to have rest and sleep and peace
again.He had boasted in those reckless, prosperous days that if by any
possible chance he should lose his money he would drive a hansom, or
emigrate to the colonies, or take the shilling.He had no patience in
those days with men who could not live on in adversity, and who were
found in the gun-room with a hole in their heads, and whose family asked
their polite friends to believe that a man used to firearms from his
school-days had tried to load a hair-trigger revolver with the muzzle
pointed at his forehead.He had expressed a fine contempt for those men
then, but now he had forgotten all that, and thought only of the
relief it would bring, and not how others might suffer by it.If he did
consider this, it was only to conclude that they would quite understand,
and be glad that his pain and fear were over.Then he planned a grand _coup_ which was to pay off all his debts and
give him a second chance to present himself a supplicant at his father's
house.If it failed, he would have to stop this queer feeling in his
head at once.The Grand Prix and the English horse was the final
_coup_.On this depended everything--the return of his fortunes, the
reconciliation with his father, and the possibility of meeting her
again.It was a very hot day he remembered, and very bright; but the
tall poplars on the road to the races seemed to stop growing just at
a level with his eyes.Below that it was clear enough, but all above
seemed black--as though a cloud had fallen and was hanging just over the
people's heads.He thought of speaking of this to his man Walters, who
had followed his fortunes from the first, but decided not to do so, for,
as it was, he had noticed that Walters had observed him closely of late,
and had seemed to spy upon him.The race began, and he looked through
his glass for the English horse in the front and could not find her,
and the Frenchman beside him cried, "Frou Frou!"as Frou Frou passed the
goal.He lowered his glasses slowly and unscrewed them very carefully
before dropping them back into the case; then he buckled the strap, and
turned and looked about him.Two Frenchmen who had won a hundred
francs between them were jumping and dancing at his side.He remembered
wondering why they did not speak in English.Then the sunlight changed
to a yellow, nasty glare, as though a calcium light had been turned
on the glass and colors, and he pushed his way back to his carriage,
leaning heavily on the servant's arm, and drove slowly back to Paris,
with the driver flecking his horses fretfully with his whip, for he had
wished to wait and see the end of the races.He had selected Monte Carlo as the place for it, because it was more
unlike his home than any other spot, and because one summer night, when
he had crossed the lawn from the Casino to the hotel with a gay party of
young men and women, they had come across something under a bush which
they took to be a dog or a man asleep, and one of the men had stepped
forward and touched it with his foot, and had then turned sharply and
said, "Take those girls away"; and while some hurried the women back,
frightened and curious, he and the others had picked up the body and
found it to be that of a young Russian whom they had just seen losing,
with a very bad grace, at the tables.There was no passion in his face
now, and his evening dress was quite unruffled, and only a black spot on
the shirt front showed where the powder had burnt the linen.It had
made a great impression on him then, for he was at the height of his
fortunes, with crowds of sycophantic friends and a retinue of dependents
at his heels.And now that he was quite alone and disinherited by even
these sorry companions there seemed no other escape from the pain in his
brain but to end it, and he sought this place of all others as the most
fitting place in which to die.So, after Walters had given the proper papers and checks to the
commissioner who handled his debts for him, he left Paris and took the
first train for Monte Carlo, sitting at the window of the carriage,
and beating a nervous tattoo on the pane with his ring until the old
gentleman at the other end of the compartment scowled at him.But
Harringford did not see him, nor the trees and fields as they swept by,
and it was not until Walters came and said, "You get out here, sir,"
that he recognized the yellow station and the great hotels on the hill
above.It was half-past eleven, and the lights in the Casino were still
burning brightly.He wondered whether he would have time to go over to
the hotel and write a letter to his father and to her.He decided, after
some difficult consideration, that he would not.There was nothing
to say that they did not know already, or that they would fail to
understand.But this suggested to him that what they had written to him
must be destroyed at once, before any stranger could claim the right
to read it.He took his letters from his pocket and looked them over
carefully.They all seemed to be
about money; some begged to remind him of this or that debt, of which he
had thought continuously for the last month, while others were abusive
and insolent.One was the last letter
he had received from his father just before leaving Paris, and though he
knew it by heart, he read it over again for the last time.That it came
too late, that it asked what he knew now to be impossible, made it none
the less grateful to him, but that it offered peace and a welcome home
made it all the more terrible."I came to take this step through young Hargraves, the new curate,"
his father wrote, "though he was but the instrument in the hands of
Providence.He showed me the error of my conduct toward you, and proved
to me that my duty and the inclination of my heart were toward the
same end.He read this morning for the second lesson the story of the
Prodigal Son, and I heard it without recognition and with no present
application until he came to the verse which tells how the father came
to his son 'when he was yet a great way off.'He saw him, it says, 'when
he was yet a great way off,' and ran to meet him.He did not wait for
the boy to knock at his gate and beg to be let in, but went out to meet
him, and took him in his arms and led him back to his home.Now, my boy,
my son, it seems to me as if you had never been so far off from me
as you are at this present time, as if you had never been so greatly
separated from me in every thought and interest; we are even worse than
strangers, for you think that my hand is against you, that I have closed
the door of your home to you and driven you away.But what I have done
I beg of you to forgive: to forget what I may have said in the past, and
only to think of what I say now.Your brothers are good boys and have
been good sons to me, and God knows I am thankful for such sons, and
thankful to them for bearing themselves as they have done."But, my boy, my first-born, my little Cecil, they can never be to me
what you have been.I can never feel for them as I feel for you; they
are the ninety and nine who have never wandered away upon the mountains,
and who have never been tempted, and have never left their home for
either good or evil.But you, Cecil, though you have made my heart ache
until I thought and even hoped it would stop beating, and though you
have given me many, many nights that I could not sleep, are still dearer
to me than anything else in the world.You are the flesh of my flesh and
the bone of my bone, and I cannot bear living on without you.I cannot
be at rest here, or look forward contentedly to a rest hereafter, unless
you are by me and hear me, unless I can see your face and touch you and
hear your laugh in the halls.Come back to me, Cecil; to Harringford and
the people that know you best, and know what is best in you and love you
for it.I can have only a few more years here now when you will take
my place and keep up my name.I will not be here to trouble you much
longer; but, my boy, while I am here, come to me and make me happy for
the rest of my life.I saw her only yesterday, and she asked me of you with such
splendid disregard for what the others standing by might think, and as
though she dared me or them to say or even imagine anything against you.You cannot keep away from us both much longer.Surely not; you will come
back and make us happy for the rest of our lives."The Goodwood Plunger turned his back to the lights so that the people
passing could not see his face, and tore the letter up slowly and
dropped it piece by piece over the balcony."If I could," he whispered;
"if I could."The pain was a little worse than usual just then, but it
was no longer a question of inclination.He felt only this desire to
stop these thoughts and doubts and the physical tremor that shook him.To rest and sleep, that was what he must have, and peace.There was no
peace at home or anywhere else while this thing lasted.He could not see
why they worried him in this way.He felt much
more sorry for them than for himself, but only because they could not
understand.He was quite sure that if they could feel what he suffered
they would help him, even to end it.He had been standing for some time with his back to the light, but now
he turned to face it and to take up his watch again.He felt quite
sure the lights would not burn much longer.As he turned, a woman came
forward from out the lighted hall, hovered uncertainly before him, and
then made a silent salutation, which
