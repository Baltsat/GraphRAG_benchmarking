Gerhardt's children were not the only
ones who preyed upon the railroad in this way.Other families in
Columbus--many of them--were constantly doing the same thing,
but Sebastian happened to be seized upon as the Columbus example."You come off that car now," said the detective, suddenly appearing
out of the shadow.Jennie and the other children dropped their baskets
and buckets and fled for their lives.Sebastian's first impulse was to
jump and run, but when he tried it the detective grabbed him by the
coat."Aw, let go," said Sebastian savagely, for he was no weakling.There was nerve and determination in him, as well as a keen sense of
his awkward predicament."Let go, I tell you," he reiterated, and giving a jerk, he almost
upset his captor."Come here now," said the detective, pulling him viciously in an
effort to establish his authority.Sebastian came, but it was with a blow which staggered his
adversary.There was more struggling, and then a passing railroad hand came to
the detective's assistance.Together they hurried him toward the
depot, and there discovering the local officer, turned him over.It
was with a torn coat, scarred hands and face, and a black eye that
Sebastian was locked up for the night.When the children came home they could not say what had happened to
their brother, but as nine o'clock struck, and then ten and eleven,
and Sebastian did not return, Mrs.He had
stayed out many a night as late as twelve and one, but his mother had
a foreboding of something terrible tonight.When half-past one
arrived, and no Sebastian, she began to cry."Some one ought to go up and tell your father," she said.Jennie volunteered, but George, who was soundly sleeping, was
awakened to go along with her.said Gerhardt, astonished to see his two children."Bass hasn't come yet," said Jennie, and then told the story of the
evening's adventure in explanation.Gerhardt left his work at once, walking back with his two children
to a point where he could turn off to go to the jail.He guessed what
had happened, and his heart was troubled.he repeated nervously, rubbing his clumsy hands
across his wet forehead.Arrived at the station-house, the sergeant in charge told him
curtly that Bass was under arrest.he said, looking over his blotter; "yes, here
he is.He actually wrung his
hands in distress."Take him back, Fred," said the other to the old watchman in
charge, "and let him see the boy."When Gerhardt stood in the back room, and Sebastian was brought out
all marked and tousled, he broke down and began to cry.No word could
cross his lips because of his emotion."Don't cry, pop," said Sebastian bravely."Don't cry," continued Sebastian, doing his very best to restrain
his own tears."I know, I know," said the gray-headed parent brokenly, "but I
can't help it.It is my fault that I should let you do that.""No, no, it isn't," said Sebastian."Jennie and George just came up
where I was and told me.I didn't know anything about it until just
now," and he began to cry again."Well, don't you feel badly," went on Bass, the finest part of his
nature coming to the surface.Just you go back to
work now, and don't worry.asked the father, looking at him with
red eyes."Oh, I had a little wrestling match with the man who nabbed me,"
said the boy, smiling bravely."You shouldn't do that, Sebastian," said the father."It may go
harder with you on that account."In the morning, they told me," said Bass.Gerhardt stayed with his son for some time, and discussed the
question of bail, fine, and the dire possibility of a jail sentence
without arriving at any definite conclusion.Finally he was persuaded
by Bass to go away, but the departure was the occasion for another
outburst of feeling; he was led away shaking and broken with
emotion."It's pretty tough," said Bass to himself as he was led back to his
cell."I wish I'd knocked the
dub over the first crack," he said."What a fool I was not to get
away."CHAPTER VII


Gerhardt was in despair; he did not know any one to whom he could
appeal between the hours of two and nine o'clock in the morning.He
went back to talk with his wife, and then to his post of duty.He could think of only one friend who was able, or
possibly willing to do anything.This was the glass manufacturer,
Hammond; but he was not in the city.Gerhardt did not know this,
however.When nine o'clock came, he went alone to the court, for it was
thought advisable that the others should stay away.Gerhardt was
to hear immediately what happened.When Sebastian was lined up inside the dock he had to wait a long
time, for there were several prisoners ahead of him.Finally his name
was called, and the boy was pushed forward to the bar."Stealing coal,
Your Honor, and resisting arrest," explained the officer who had
arrested him.The magistrate looked at Sebastian closely; he was unfavorably
impressed by the lad's scratched and wounded face."Well, young man," he said, "what have you to say for yourself?Sebastian looked at the judge, but did not answer."He was on one of the
company's cars.He tried to break away from me, and when I held him he
assaulted me.This man here was a witness," he added, turning to the
railroad hand who had helped him.asked the Court, observing the
detective's swollen jaw."Yes, sir," he returned, glad of an opportunity to be further
revenged."If you please," put in Gerhardt, leaning forward, "he is my boy.He--"

"We don't mind what they pick up around the yard," interrupted the
detective, "but he was throwing it off the cars to half a dozen
others.""Can't you earn enough to keep from taking coal off the coal cars?"asked the Court; but before either father or son had time to answer he
added, "What is your business?""I am watchman at Miller's furniture factory.""Um," said the court, feeling that Sebastian's attitude remained
sullen and contentious."Well, this young man might be let off on the
coal-stealing charge, but he seems to be somewhat too free with his
fists.Columbus is altogether too rich in that sort of thing."If you please," began Gerhardt, but the court officer was already
pushing him away."I don't want to hear any more about it," said the judge."He's
stubborn, anyhow.Gerhardt made his way over to his boy, abashed and yet very glad it
was no worse.Somehow, he thought, he could raise the money.Sebastian
looked at him solicitously as he came forward."It's all right," said Bass soothingly."He didn't give me half a
chance to say anything.""I'm only glad it wasn't more," said Gerhardt nervously."We will
try and get the money."Going home to his wife, Gerhardt informed the troubled household of
the result.Gerhardt stood white and yet relieved, for ten
dollars seemed something that might be had.Jennie heard the whole
story with open mouth and wide eyes.He was always so lively and good-natured.It seemed awful
that he should be in jail.Gerhardt went hurriedly to Hammond's fine residence, but he was not
in the city.He thought then of a lawyer by the name of Jenkins, whom
he knew in a casual way, but Jenkins was not at his office.There were
several grocers and coal merchants whom he knew well enough, but he
owed them money.Pastor Wundt might let him have it, but the agony
such a disclosure to that worthy would entail held him back.He did
call on one or two acquaintances, but these, surprised at the unusual
and peculiar request, excused themselves.At four o'clock he returned
home, weary and exhausted."I don't know what to do," he said despairingly.Jennie thought of Brander, but the situation had not accentuated
her desperation to the point where she could brave her father's
opposition and his terrible insult to the Senator, so keenly
remembered, to go and ask.Her watch had been pawned a second time,
and she had no other means of obtaining money.The family council lasted until half-past ten, but still there was
nothing decided.Gerhardt persistently and monotonously turned
one hand over in the other and stared at the floor.Gerhardt ran his
hand through his reddish brown hair distractedly."It's no use," he
said at last."Go to bed, Jennie," said her mother solicitously; "get the others
to go.There's no use their sitting up I may think of something.Jennie went to her room, but the very thought of repose was
insupportable.She had read in the paper, shortly after her father's
quarrel with the Senator, that the latter had departed for Washington.She stood before a short, narrow mirror that surmounted a shabby
bureau, thinking.Her sister Veronica, with whom she slept, was
already composing herself to dreams.Finally a grim resolution fixed
itself in her consciousness.If
he were in town he would help Bass.Why shouldn't she--he
loved her.He had asked over and over to marry her.Why should she not
go and ask him for help?She hesitated a little while, then hearing Veronica breathing
regularly, she put on her hat and jacket, and noiselessly opened the
door into the sitting-room to see if any one were stirring.There was no sound save that of Gerhardt rocking nervously to and
fro in the kitchen.There was no light save that of her own small
room-lamp and a gleam from under the kitchen door.She turned and blew
the former out--then slipped quietly to the front door, opened it
and stepped out into the night.A waning moon was shining, and a hushed sense of growing life
filled the air, for it was nearing spring again.As Jennie hurried
along the shadowy streets--the arc light had not yet been
invented--she had a sinking sense of fear; what was this rash
thing she was about to do?She stood stock-still, wavering and doubtful; then the
recollection of Bass in his night cell came over her again, and she
hurried on.The character of the Capitol Hotel was such that it was not
difficult for a woman to find ingress through the ladies' entrance to
the various floors of the hotel at any hour of the night.The hotel,
not unlike many others of the time, was in no sense loosely conducted,
but its method of supervision in places was lax.Any person could
enter, and, by applying at a rear entrance to the lobby, gain the
attention of the clerk.Otherwise not much notice was taken of those
who came and went.When she came to the door it was dark save for a low light burning
in the entry-way.The distance to the Senator's room was only a short
way along the hall of the second floor.She hurried up the steps,
nervous and pale, but giving no other outward sign of the storm that
was surging within her.When she came to his familiar door she paused;
she feared that she might not find him in his room; she trembled again
to think that he might be there.A light shone through the transom,
and, summoning all her courage, she knocked.A man coughed and
bestirred himself.His surprise as he opened the door knew no bounds."I was coming out to see you, believe me, I was.I was thinking all
along how I could straighten this matter out.He held her at arm's length and studied her distressed face.The
fresh beauty of her seemed to him like cut lilies wet with dew."I have something to ask you," she at last brought herself to say.We need ten dollars to get him out, and I
didn't know where else to go."Haven't I told you always to come to me?Don't you know, Jennie, I
would do anything in the world for you?""Well, then, don't worry about that any more.But won't fate ever
cease striking at you, poor child?How did your brother come to get in
jail?""They caught him throwing coal down from the cars," she
replied.he replied, his sympathies touched and awakened.Here was
this boy arrested and fined for what fate was practically driving him
to do.Here was this girl pleading with him at night, in his room, for
what to her was a great necessity--ten dollars; to him, a mere
nothing."I will arrange about your brother," he said quickly.I can get him out in half an hour.You sit here now and be
comfortable until I return."He waved her to his easy-chair beside a large lamp, and hurried out
of the room.Brander knew the sheriff who had personal supervision of the county
jail.He knew the judge who had administered the fine.It was but a
five minutes' task to write a note to the judge asking him to revoke
the fine, for the sake of the boy's character, and send it by a
messenger to his home.Another ten minutes' task to go personally to
the jail and ask his friend, the sheriff, to release the boy then and
there."If the fine is revoked you can
return it to me.He hastened below to
personally supervise the task, and Bass, a very much astonished boy,
was set free."That's all right now," said the turnkey.Run
along home and don't let them catch you at anything like that
again."Bass went his way wondering, and the ex-Senator returned to his
hotel trying to decide just how this delicate situation should be
handled.Obviously Jennie had not told her father of her mission.She was now waiting for him in his
room.There are crises in all men's lives when they waver between the
strict fulfilment of justice and duty and the great possibilities for
personal happiness which another line of conduct seems to assure.And
the dividing line is not always marked and clear.He knew that the
issue of taking her, even as his wife, was made difficult by the
senseless opposition of her father.The opinion of the world brought
up still another complication.Supposing he should take her openly,
what would the world say?She was a significant type emotionally, that
he knew.There was something there--artistically,
temperamentally, which was far and beyond the keenest suspicion of the
herd.He did not know himself quite what it was, but he felt a
largeness of feeling not altogether squared with intellect, or perhaps
better yet, experience, which was worthy of any man's desire."This
remarkable girl," he thought, seeing her clearly in his mind's
eye.Meditating as to what he should do, he returned to his hotel, and
the room.As he entered he was struck anew with her beauty, and with
the irresistible appeal of her personality.In the glow of the shaded
lamp she seemed a figure of marvelous potentiality."Well," he said, endeavoring to appear calm, "I have looked after
your brother."Oh," she exclaimed, clasping her hands and stretching her arms out
toward him.There were tears of gratefulness in her eyes."Jennie, for heaven's sake
don't cry," he entreated.To think
you should have to add tears to your other sacrifices."He drew her to him, and then all the caution of years deserted him.There was a sense both of need and of fulfilment in his mood.At last,
in spite of other losses, fate had brought him what he most
desired--love, a woman whom he could love.He took her in his
arms, and kissed her again and again.The English Jefferies has told us that it requires a hundred and
fifty years to make a perfect maiden."From all enchanted things of
earth and air, this preciousness has been drawn.From the south wind
that breathed a century and a half over the green wheat; from the
perfume of the growing grasses waving over heavy-laden clover and
laughing veronica, hiding the green finches, baffling the bee; from
rose-lined hedge, woodbine, and cornflower, azure blue, where
yellowing wheat stalks crowd up under the shadow of green firs.All
the devious brooklets' sweetness where the iris stays the sunlight;
all the wild woods hold of beauty; all the broad hills of thyme and
freedom thrice a hundred years repeated."A hundred years of cowslips, bluebells, violets; purple spring and
golden autumn; sunshine, shower, and dewy mornings; the night
immortal; all the rhythm of time unrolling.A chronicle unwritten and
past all power of writing; who shall preserve a record of the petals
that fell from the roses a century ago?The swallows to the house-tops
three hundred--times think of that!Thence she sprang, and the
world yearns toward her beauty as to flowers that are past.The
loveliness of seventeen is centuries old.If you have understood and appreciated the beauty of harebells
three hundred times repeated; if the quality of the roses, of the
music, of the ruddy mornings and evenings of the world has ever
touched your heart; if all beauty were passing, and you were given
these things to hold in your arms before the world slipped away, would
you give them up?CHAPTER VIII


The significance of the material and spiritual changes which
sometimes overtake us are not very clear at the time.A sense of
shock, a sense of danger, and then apparently we subside to old ways,
but the change has come.Never again, here or elsewhere, will we be
the same.Jennie pondering after the subtle emotional turn which her
evening's sympathetic expedition had taken, was lost in a vague
confusion of emotions.She had no definite realization of what social
and physical changes this new relationship to the Senator might
entail.She was not conscious as yet of that shock which the
possibility of maternity, even under the most favorable conditions,
must bring to the average woman.Her present attitude was one of
surprise, wonder, uncertainty; and at the same time she experienced a
genuine feeling of quiet happiness.Brander was a good man; now he was
closer to her than ever.Because of this new
relationship a change in her social condition was to inevitably
follow.Life was to be radically different from now on--was
different at this moment.Brander assured her over and over of his
enduring affection."I tell you, Jennie," he repeated, as she was leaving, "I don't
want you to worry.This emotion of mine got the best of me, but I'll
marry you.I've been carried off my feet, but I'll make it up to you.Caution your brother, if it isn't too
late.Keep your own counsel, and I will marry you and take you away.But I'm going to
Washington, and I'll send for you.And here"--he reached for his
purse and took from it a hundred dollars, practically all he had with
him, "take that.You're my girl
now--remember that.No doubt he would do as he
said.She dwelt, in imagination, upon the possibilities of a new and
fascinating existence.She
would go to Washington--that far-off place.And her father and
mother--they would not need to work so hard any more.And Bass,
and Martha--she fairly glowed as she recounted to herself the
many ways in which she could help them all.A block away she waited for Brander, who accompanied her to her own
gate, and waited while she made a cautious reconnaissance.She slipped
up the steps and tried the door.She paused a moment to
indicate to her lover that she was safe, and entered.She slipped to her own room and heard Veronica breathing.She
went quietly to where Bass slept with George.He was in bed, stretched
out as if asleep.When she entered he asked, "Is that you,
Jennie?""Have you seen papa and mamma?""I went to see Senator Brander for you."They didn't say why they let me out.""Don't tell any one," she pleaded."I don't want any one to know.But he was curious as to what the
ex-Senator thought, what he had done, and how she had appealed to him.She explained briefly, then she heard her mother come to the door."I couldn't help it, ma," she replied."He wanted to talk to me," she answered evasively.Her mother looked at her nervously, wanly."I have been so afraid, oh, so afraid.Your father went to your
room, but I said you were asleep.He locked the front door, but I
opened it again.When Bass came in he wanted to call you, but I
persuaded him to wait until morning."Again she looked wistfully at her daughter."I'm all right, mamma," said Jennie encouragingly."I'll tell you
all about it to-morrow.He thought maybe they just let him go because he
couldn't pay the fine."Jennie laid her hand lovingly on her mother's shoulder.She was already years older in thought and act.She felt as though
she must help her mother now as well as herself.The days which followed were ones of dreamy uncertainty to Jennie.She went over in her mind these dramatic events time and time and time
and again.It was not such a difficult matter to tell her mother that
the Senator had talked again of marriage, that he proposed to come and
get her after his next trip to Washington, that he had given her a
hundred dollars and intended to give her more, but of that other
matter--the one all-important thing, she could not bring herself
to speak.The balance of the money that he had
promised her arrived by messenger the following day, four hundred
dollars in bills, with the admonition that she should put it in a
local bank.The ex-Senator explained that he was already on his way to
Washington, but that he would come back or send for her."Keep a stout
heart," he wrote."There are better days in store for you."Brander was gone, and Jennie's fate was really in the balance.But
her mind still retained all of the heart-innocence, and
unsophistication of her youth; a certain gentle wistfulness was the
only outward change in her demeanor.There was the mirage of a distant country and wondrous scenes looming
up in her mind.She had a little fortune in the bank, more than she
had ever dreamed of, with which to help her mother.There were
natural, girlish anticipations of good still holding over, which made
her less apprehensive than she could otherwise possibly have been.All
nature, life, possibility was in the balance.It might turn good, or
ill, but with so inexperienced a soul it would not be entirely evil
until it was so.How a mind under such uncertain circumstances could retain so
comparatively placid a vein is one of those marvels which find their
explanation in the inherent trustfulness of the spirit of youth.It is
not often that the minds of men retain the perceptions of their
younger days.The marvel is not that one should thus retain, but that
any should ever lose them Go the world over, and after you have put
away the wonder and tenderness of youth what is there left?The few
sprigs of green that sometimes invade the barrenness of your
materialism, the few glimpses of summer which flash past the eye of
the wintry soul, the half hours off during the long tedium of
burrowing, these reveal to the hardened earth-seeker the universe
which the youthful mind has with it always.No fear and no favor; the
open fields and the light upon the hills; morning, noon, night; stars,
the bird-calls, the water's purl--these are the natural
inheritance of the mind of the child.Men call it poetic, those who
are hardened fanciful.In the days of their youth it was natural, but
the receptiveness of youth has departed, and they cannot see.How this worked out in her personal actions was to be seen only in
a slightly accentuated wistfulness, a touch of which was in every
task.Sometimes she would wonder that no letter came, but at the same
time she would recall the fact that he had specified a few weeks, and
hence the six that actually elapsed did not seem so long.In the meanwhile the distinguished ex-Senator had gone
light-heartedly to his conference with the President, he had joined in
a pleasant round of social calls, and he was about to pay a short
country visit to some friends in Maryland, when he was seized with a
slight attack of fever, which confined him to his room for a few days.He felt a little irritated that he should be laid up just at this
time, but never suspected that there was anything serious in his
indisposition.Then the doctor discovered that he was suffering from a
virulent form of typhoid, the ravages of which took away his senses
for a time and left him very weak.He was thought to be convalescing,
however, when just six weeks after he had last parted with Jennie, he
was seized with a sudden attack of heart failure and never regained
consciousness.Jennie remained blissfully ignorant of his illness and
did not even see the heavy-typed headlines of the announcement of his
death until Bass came home that evening."Look here, Jennie," he said excitedly, "Brander's dead!"He held up the newspaper, on the first column of Which was printed
in heavy block type:

DEATH OF EX-SENATOR BRANDER

Sudden Passing of Ohio's Distinguished Son.Succumbs to Heart Failure
at the Arlington, in Washington.Recent attack of typhoid, from which he was thought to be recovering,
proves fatal.Jennie looked at it in blank amazement."There it is in the paper," returned Bass, his tone being that of
one who is imparting a very interesting piece of news."He died at ten
o'clock this morning."CHAPTER IX


Jennie took the paper with but ill-concealed trembling and went
into the adjoining room.There she stood by the front window and
looked at it again, a sickening sensation of dread holding her as
though in a trance."He is dead," was all that her mind could formulate for the time,
and as she stood there the voice of Bass recounting the fact to
Gerhardt in the adjoining room sounded in her ears."Yes, he is dead,"
she heard him say; and once again she tried to get some conception of
what it meant to her.She had heard Bass's
announcement and had seen Jennie leave the room, but her trouble with
Gerhardt over the Senator had caused her to be careful of any display
of emotion.No conception of the real state of affairs ever having
crossed her mind, she was only interested in seeing how Jennie would
take this sudden annihilation of her hopes."To think that he
should have to die just when he was going to do so much for
you--for us all."She paused, expecting some word of agreement, but Jennie remained
unwontedly dumb."I wouldn't feel badly," continued Mrs.He meant to do a good deal, but you mustn't think of that now.It's all over, and it can't be helped, you know."She paused again, and still Jennie remained motionless and mute.Gerhardt, seeing how useless her words were, concluded that
Jennie wished to be alone, and she went away.Still Jennie stood there, and now, as the real significance of the
news began to formulate itself into consecutive thought, she began to
realize the wretchedness of her position, its helplessness.She went
into her bedroom and sat down upon the side of the bed, from which
position she saw a very pale, distraught face staring at her from out
of the small mirror.She looked at it uncertainly; could that really
be her own countenance?"I'll have to go away," she thought, and
began, with the courage of despair, to wonder what refuge would be
open to her.In the mean time the evening meal was announced, and, to maintain
appearances, she went out and joined the family; the naturalness of
her part was very difficult to sustain.Gerhardt observed her subdued
condition without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered.Bass
was too much interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention
to anybody.During the days that followed Jennie pondered over the difficulties
of her position and wondered what she should do.Money she had, it was
true; but no friends, no experience, no place to go.She began to feel unaccountable sinkings of
spirit, nameless and formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her.Once when she arose in the morning she felt an uncontrollable desire
to cry, and frequently thereafter this feeling would seize upon her at
the most inopportune times.Gerhardt began to note her moods, and
one afternoon she resolved to question her daughter."Now you must tell me what's the matter with you," she said
quietly."Jennie, you must tell your mother everything."Jennie, to whom confession had seemed impossible, under the
sympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and made the
fatal confession.Gerhardt stood there, too dumb with misery to
give vent to a word.she said at last, a great wave of self-accusation sweeping
over her, "it is all my fault.After a time she went back to the washing she had to do, and stood
over her tub rubbing and crying.The tears ran down her cheeks and
dropped into the suds.Once in a while she stopped and tried to dry
her eyes with her apron, but they soon filled again.Now that the first shock had passed, there came the vivid
consciousness of ever-present danger.What would Gerhardt do if he
learned the truth?He had often said that if ever one of his daughters
should act like some of those he knew he would turn her out of doors."I'm so afraid of your father," Mrs.Gerhardt often said to Jennie
in this intermediate period."I don't know what he'll say.""Perhaps I'd better go away," suggested her daughter."No," she said; "he needn't know just yet.But in her
heart of hearts she knew that the evil day could not be long
postponed.One day, when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it
could no longer be endured, Mrs.Gerhardt sent Jennie away with the
children, hoping to be able to tell her husband before they returned.All the morning she fidgeted about, dreading the opportune moment and
letting him retire to his slumber without speaking.When afternoon
came she did not go out to work, because she could not leave with her
painful duty unfulfilled.Gerhardt arose at four, and still she
hesitated, knowing full well that Jennie would soon return and that
the specially prepared occasion would then be lost.It is almost
certain that she would not have had the courage to say anything if he
himself had not brought up the subject of Jennie's appearance."She doesn't look well," he said."There seems to be something the
matter with her."Gerhardt, visibly struggling with her fears, and
moved to make an end of it at any cost, "Jennie is in trouble.She--"

Gerhardt, who had unscrewed a door-lock and was trying to mend it,
looked up sharply from his work.Gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time, her nervous
tendency to roll it coming upon her.She tried to summon sufficient
courage to explain, but fear mastered her completely; she lifted the
apron to her eyes and began to cry.He was a man with the Calvin type
of face, rather spare, with skin sallow and discolored as the result
of age and work in the wind and rain.When he was surprised or angry
sparks of light glittered in his eyes.He frequently pushed his hair
back when he was troubled, and almost invariably walked the floor;
just now he looked alert and dangerous.he inquired in German, his voice straining
to a hard note."In trouble--has some one--" He paused and
flung his hand upward.Gerhardt, frightened, and yet
following her own train of thought, "that anything like that would
happen to her.she concluded, "to think
he should ruin Jennie."shouted Gerhardt, giving way to a fury of feeling, "I
thought so!That comes of letting her go
running around at nights, buggy-riding, walking the streets.God in heaven!--"

He broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce
stride across the narrow chamber, turning like a caged animal.So he has ruined her, has
he?"Suddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string.He was
directly in front of Mrs.Gerhardt, who had retired to the table at
the side of the wall, and was standing there pale with fear.he shouted, as if this fact had now first
occurred to him.He put both hands to his temples, as if he feared his brain would
give way, and stood looking at her, the mocking irony of the situation
seeming to burn in his brain like fire.Gerhardt, fearing for the reason of
the man, shrank still farther away, her wits taken up rather with the
tragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of
his woe."He intended to marry her," she pleaded nervously."He would have
married her if he had not died."shouted Gerhardt, coming out of his trance at the
sound of her voice.That's a fine thing to talk about
now.May his soul burn in hell--the dog!Ah, God, I hope--I hope--If I were not a Christian--" He clenched
his hands, the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf.Gerhardt burst into tears, and her husband turned away, his
own feelings far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her.He
walked to and fro, his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor.After a
time he came back, a new phase of the dread calamity having offered
itself to his mind.he demanded

"I don't know," returned Mrs.Gerhardt, too terror-stricken to tell
the truth."I only found it out the other day."It is your fault that she is where she is.If you had
let me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble
to-night."A fine ending," he went on to himself.My boy gets
into jail; my daughter walks the streets and gets herself talked
about; the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my children;
and now this scoundrel ruins her.By the God in heaven, I don't know
what has got into my children!"I don't know how it is," he went on, unconsciously commiserating
himself.Every night I pray that the Lord will let me
do right, but it is no use.My hands--look
at them--are rough with work.All my life I have tried to be an
honest man.Now--now--" His voice broke, and it seemed for a
moment as if he would give way to tears.Suddenly he turned on his
wife, the major passion of anger possessing him."You are the cause of this," he exclaimed.If you had done as I told you to do this would not have happened.She has become a
street-walker, that's what she has become.She has set herself right
to go to hell.He made as if to go off to his little bedroom, but he had no sooner
reached the door than he came back."She shall not stay
under my roof!I will not let her enter my door
again.I will show her whether she will disgrace me or not!""You mustn't turn her out on the streets to-night," pleaded Mrs.We will see how the
world treats her."He walked out of the room, inflexible resolution
fixed upon his rugged features.Gerhardt was tearfully going about the
duty of getting supper, Jennie returned.Her mother started when she
heard the door open, for now she knew the storm would burst afresh."You shall not stay
another hour in my house.I don't want to see you any more.Jennie stood before him, pale, trembling a little, and silent.The
children she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened
amazement.Veronica and Martha, who loved her dearly, began to
cry."She shall get out," reiterated Gerhardt."I don't want her under
my roof.If she wants to be a street-walker, let her be one, but she
shall not stay here.Pack your things," he added, staring at her.Jennie had no word to say, but the children cried loudly.He drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself.She gathered up her few little
belongings and began, with tears, to put them into a valise her mother
brought her.The little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from
time to time she did not take.She saw them, but thought of her
younger sisters, and let them stay.Martha and Veronica would have
assisted her, but their father forbade them to go.At six o'clock Bass came in, and seeing the nervous assembly in the
kitchen, inquired what the trouble was.Gerhardt looked at him grimly, but did not answer."What are you all sitting
around for?""He is driving Jennie away," whispered Mrs.asked Bass, opening his eyes in astonishment."I shall tell you what for," broke in Gerhardt, still speaking in
German."Because she's a street-walker, that's what for.She goes and
gets herself ruined by a man thirty years older than she is, a man old
enough to be her father.Bass looked about him, and the children opened their eyes.All felt
clearly that something terrible had happened, even the little ones."What do you want to send her out to-night for?""This
is no time to send a girl out on the streets."He oughtn't to do that," put in the mother.Bass looked around, but did nothing until Mrs.Gerhardt motioned
him toward the front door when her husband was not looking.Gerhardt dared to leave her work and
follow.The children stayed awhile, but, one by one, even they slipped
away, leaving Gerhardt alone.When he thought that time enough had
elapsed he arose.In the interval Jennie had been hastily coached by her mother.Jennie should go to a private boarding-house somewhere, and send
back her address.Bass should not accompany her, but she should wait a
little way up the street, and he would follow.When her father was
away the mother might get to see her, or Jennie could come home.All
else must be postponed until they could meet again.While the discussion was still going on, Gerhardt came in.Gerhardt, with her first and only note of
defiance.Bass said, "What's the hurry?"But Gerhardt frowned too mightily
for him to venture on any further remonstrance.Jennie entered, wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise.There was fear in her eyes, for she was passing through a fiery
ordeal, but she had become a woman.The strength of love was with her,
the support of patience and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice.Silently she kissed her mother, while tears fell fast.Then she
turned, and the door closed upon her as she went forth to a new
life.CHAPTER X


The world into which Jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that
in which virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial; for
virtue is the wishing well and the doing well unto others.Virtue is
that quality of generosity which offers itself willingly for another's
service, and, being this, it is held by society to be nearly
worthless.Sell yourself cheaply and you shall be used lightly and
trampled under foot.Hold yourself dearly, however unworthily, and you
will be respected.Society, in the mass, lacks woefully in the matter
of discrimination.Its one
test that of self-preservation.Only in rare instances and with rare individuals
does there seem to be any guiding light from within.Jennie had not sought to hold herself dear.Innate feeling in her
made for self-sacrifice.She could not be readily corrupted by the
world's selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to
come.It is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest.It comes as
with a vast surge, this feeling of strength and sufficiency.We may
still tremble, the fear of doing wretchedly may linger, but we grow.Flashes of inspiration come to guide the soul.When we are cast from a group or a condition we have still
the companionship of all that is.Its winds
and stars are fellows with you.Let the soul be but gentle and
receptive, and this vast truth will come home--not in set
phrases, perhaps, but as a feeling, a comfort, which, after all, is
the last essence of knowledge.Jennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by
Bass."Give me your grip," he said; and then seeing that she was dumb
with unutterable feeling, he added, "I think I know where I can get
you a room."He led the way to the southern part of the city, where they were
not known, and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had
been recently purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now
employed.She was not well off, he knew, and had a room to rent."Yes," she said, looking at Jennie."I wish you'd let my sister have it.We're moving away, and she
can't go yet."The old lady expressed her willingness, and Jennie was soon
temporarily installed."Don't worry now," said Bass, who felt rather sorry for her.Ma said I should tell you not to worry.Come up
to-morrow when he's gone."Jennie said she would, and, after giving her further oral
encouragement, he arranged with the old lady about board, and took his
leave."It's all right now," he said encouragingly as he went out.I've got to go back, but I'll come
around in the morning."He went away, and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his
head, for he was thinking that Jennie had made a mistake.This was
shown by the manner in which he had asked her questions as they had
walked together, and that in the face of her sad and doubtful
mood."What'd you want to do that for?"and "Didn't you ever think what
you were doing?""Please don't ask me to-night," Jennie had said, which put an end
to the sharpest form of his queries.She had no excuse to offer and no
complaint to make.If any blame attached, very likely it was hers.His
own misfortune and the family's and her sacrifice were alike
forgotten.Left alone in her strange abode, Jennie gave way to her saddened
feelings.The shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame
her, and she wept.Although of a naturally long-suffering and
uncomplaining disposition, the catastrophic wind-up of all her hopes
was too much for her.What was this element in life that could seize
and overwhelm one as does a great wind?Why this sudden intrusion of
death to shatter all that had seemed most promising in life?As she thought over the past, a very clear recollection of the
details of her long relationship with Brander came back to her, and
for all her suffering she could only feel a loving affection for him.After all, he had not deliberately willed her any harm.His kindness,
his generosity--these things had been real.He had been
essentially a good man, and she was sorry--more for his sake than
for her own that his end had been so untimely.These cogitations, while not at all reassuring, at least served to
pass the night away, and the next morning Bass stopped on his way to
work to say that Mrs.Gerhardt wished her to come home that same
evening.Gerhardt would not be present, and they could talk it over.She spent the day lonesomely enough, but when night fell her spirits
brightened, and at a quarter of eight she set out.There was not much of comforting news to tell her.Gerhardt was
still in a direfully angry and outraged mood.He had already decided
to throw up his place on the following Saturday and go to Youngstown.Any place was better than Columbus after this; he could never expect
to hold up his head here again.He would go
away now, and if he succeeded in finding work the family should
follow, a decision which meant the abandoning of the little home.He
was not going to try to meet the mortgage on the house--he could
not hope to.At the end of the week Gerhardt took his leave, Jennie returned
home, and for a time at least there was a restoration of the old
order, a condition which, of course, could not endure.Jennie's trouble and its possible consequences weighed
upon him disagreeably.If they should all move away to some larger city it
would be much better.He pondered over the situation, and hearing that a manufacturing
boom was on in Cleveland, he thought it might be wise to try his luck
there.If Gerhardt still
worked on in Youngstown, as he was now doing, and the family came to
Cleveland, it would save Jennie from being turned out in the
streets.Bass waited a little while before making up his mind, but finally
announced his purpose."I believe I'll go up to Cleveland," he said to his mother one
evening as she was getting supper.She was rather afraid
that Bass would desert her."I think I can get work there," he returned."We oughtn't to stay
in this darned old town.""Don't swear," she returned reprovingly."Oh, I know," he said, "but it's enough to make any one swear.We've never had anything but rotten luck here.I'm going to go, and
maybe if I get anything we can all move.We'd be better off if we'd
get some place where people don't know us.Gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their
miserable life creeping into her heart.If
he would go and get work, and come to her rescue, as a strong bright
young son might, what a thing it would be!They were in the rapids of
a life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity."Do you think you could get something to do?""I've never looked for a place yet that I
didn't get it.Other fellows have gone up there and done all right.He shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window."Do you think you could get along until I try my hand up there?""Papa's at work now and we have
some money that, that--" she hesitated, to name the source, so
ashamed was she of their predicament."Yes, I know," said Bass, grimly."We won't have to pay any rent here before fall and then we'll have
to give it up anyhow," she added.She was referring to the mortgage on the house, which fell due the
next September and which unquestionably could not be met."If we could
move away from here before then, I guess we could get along.""I'll do it," said Bass determinedly.Accordingly, he threw up his place at the end of the month, and the
day after he left for Cleveland.CHAPTER XI


The incidents of the days that followed, relating as they did
peculiarly to Jennie, were of an order which the morality of our day
has agreed to taboo.Certain processes of the all-mother, the great artificing wisdom of
the power that works and weaves in silence and in darkness, when
viewed in the light of the established opinion of some of the little
individuals created by it, are considered very vile.We turn our faces
away from the creation of life as if that were the last thing that man
should dare to interest himself in, openly.It is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a
world whose very essence is generative, the vast process dual, and
where wind, water, soil, and light alike minister to the fruition of
that which is all that we are.Although the whole earth, not we alone,
is moved by passions hymeneal, and everything terrestrial has come
into being by the one common road, yet there is that ridiculous
tendency to close the eyes and turn away the head as if there were
something unclean in nature itself."Conceived in iniquity and born in
sin," is the unnatural interpretation put upon the process by the
extreme religionist, and the world, by its silence, gives assent to a
judgment so marvelously warped.Surely there is something radically wrong in this attitude.The
teachings of philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more
practical application in the daily reasoning of man.No process is
vile, no condition is unnatural.The accidental variation from a given
social practice does not necessarily entail sin.No poor little
earthling, caught in the enormous grip of chance, and so swerved from
the established customs of men, could possibly be guilty of that depth
of vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predicate so
inevitably.Jennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder
of nature, which, but for Brander's death, might have been consecrated
and hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life.Although herself
unable to distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal
process of life, yet was she made to feel, by the actions of all about
her, that degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well
as the condition of her state.Almost, not quite, it was sought to
extinguish the affection, the consideration, the care which,
afterward, the world would demand of her, for her child.Almost, not
quite, was the budding and essential love looked upon as evil.Although her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of a few
hundred years before, yet the ignorance and immobility of the human
beings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her
present condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social
code, the punishment of which was ostracism.All she could do now was
to shun the scornful gaze of men, and to bear in silence the great
change that was coming upon her.Strangely enough, she felt no useless
remorse, no vain regrets.Her heart was pure, and she was conscious
that it was filled with peace.Sorrow there was, it is true, but only
a mellow phase of it, a vague uncertainty and wonder, which would
sometimes cause her eyes to fill with tears.You have heard the wood-dove calling in the lone stillness of the
summertime; you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling
where no ear comes to hear.Under dead leaves and snow-banks the
delicate arbutus unfolds its simple blossom, answering some heavenly
call for color.So, too, this other flower of womanhood.Jennie was left alone, but, like the wood-dove, she was a voice of
sweetness in the summer-time.Going about her household duties, she
was content to wait, without a murmur, the fulfilment of that process
for which, after all, she was but the sacrificial implement.When her
duties were lightest she was content to sit in quiet meditation, the
marvel of life holding her as in a trance.When she was hardest
pressed to aid her mother, she would sometimes find herself quietly
singing, the pleasure of work lifting her out of herself.Always she
was content to face the future with a serene and unfaltering courage.Nature is unkind in permitting the minor
type to bear a child at all.The larger natures in their maturity
welcome motherhood, see in it the immense possibilities of racial
fulfilment, and find joy and satisfaction in being the hand-maiden of
so immense a purpose.Jennie, a child in years, was potentially a woman physically and
mentally, but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her
place in it.The great situation which had forced her into this
anomalous position was from one point of view a tribute to her
individual capacity.It proved her courage, the largeness of her
sympathy, her willingness to sacrifice for what she considered a
worthy cause.That it resulted in an unexpected consequence, which
placed upon her a larger and more complicated burden, was due to the
fact that her sense of self-protection had not been commensurate with
her emotions.There were times when the prospective coming of the
child gave her a sense of fear and confusion, because she did not know
but that the child might eventually reproach her; but there was always
that saving sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit
her to be utterly crushed.To her way of thinking, people were not
intentionally cruel.Vague thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness
permeated her soul.Life at worst or best was beautiful--had
always been so.These thoughts did not come to her all at once, but through the
months during which she watched and waited.It was a wonderful thing
to be a mother, even under these untoward conditions.She felt that
she would love this child, would be a good mother to it if life
permitted.That was the problem--what would life permit?There were many things to be done--clothes to be made; certain
provisions of hygiene and diet to be observed.One of her fears was
that Gerhardt might unexpectedly return, but he did not.The old
family doctor who had nursed the various members of the Gerhardt
family through their multitudinous ailments--Doctor
Ellwanger--was taken into consultation, and he gave sound and
practical advice.Despite his Lutheran upbringing, the practice of
medicine in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that
there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our
philosophies and in our small neighborhood relationships."So it is,"
he observed to Mrs.Gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what
the trouble was.These things happen in more
places than you think.If you knew as much about life as I do, and
about your neighbors, you would not cry.She can go away somewhere afterward, and people
will never know.Why should you worry about what your neighbors think.As for Jennie, she listened to his advice with
interest and without fear.She wanted things not so much for herself
as for her child, and she was anxious to do whatever she was told.The
doctor was curious to know who the father was; when informed he lifted
his eyes."That ought to be a bright
baby."There came the final hour when the child was ushered into the
world.It was Doctor Ellwanger who presided, assisted by the mother,
who, having brought forth six herself, knew exactly what to do.There
was no difficulty, and at the first cry of the new-born infant there
awakened in Jennie a tremendous yearning toward it.It was weak and feeble--a little girl, and it
needed her care.She took it to her breast, when it had been bathed
and swaddled, with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and joy.This
was her child, her little girl.She wanted to live to be able to work
for it, and rejoiced, even in her weakness, that she was so strong.He thought two weeks
would be the outside limit of her need to stay in bed.As a matter of
fact, in ten days she was up and about, as vigorous and healthy as
ever.She had been born with strength and with that nurturing quality
which makes the ideal mother.The great crisis had passed, and now life went on much as before.The children, outside of Bass, were too young to understand fully, and
had been deceived by the story that Jennie was married to Senator
Brander, who had died.They did not know that a child was coming until
it was there.Gerhardt, for they
were ever watchful and really knew all.Jennie would never have braved
this local atmosphere except for the advice of Bass, who, having
secured a place in Cleveland some time before, had written that he
thought when she was well enough it would be advisable for the whole
family to seek a new start in Cleveland.Once away they would never hear of their present neighbors and
Jennie could find something to do.CHAPTER XII


Bass was no sooner in Cleveland than the marvel of that growing
city was sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and
to stir up new illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for
himself and his family."If only they could come here," he thought."If only they could all get work and do right."Here was no evidence
of any of their recent troubles, no acquaintances who could suggest by
their mere presence the troubles of the past.The very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old
times and crimes.It was as if a new world existed in every block.He soon found a place in a cigar store, and, after working a few
weeks, he began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind.Jennie ought to come as soon as she was able, and then, if she found
something to do, the others might follow.There was plenty of work for
girls of her age.She could live in the same house with him
temporarily; or maybe they could take one of the
fifteen-dollar-a-month cottages that were for rent.There were big
general furnishing houses, where one could buy everything needful for
a small house on very easy monthly terms.His mother could come and
keep house for them.They would be in a clean, new atmosphere, unknown
and untalked about.They could start life all over again; they could
be decent, honorable, prosperous.Filled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new
environment invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind, he wrote a
final letter, in which he suggested that Jennie should come at once.This was when the baby was six months old.There were theaters here,
he said, and beautiful streets.Vessels from the lakes came into the
heart of the city.It was a wonderful city, and growing very fast.It
was thus that the new life appealed to him.Gerhardt, Jennie, and the
rest of the family was phenomenal.Gerhardt, long weighed upon by
the misery which Jennie's error had entailed, was for taking measures
for carrying out this plan at once.So buoyant was her natural
temperament that she was completely carried away by the glory of
Cleveland, and already saw fulfilled therein not only her own desires
for a nice home, but the prosperous advancement of her children."Of
course they could get work," she said.She had always
wanted Gerhardt to go to some large city, but he would not.Now it was
necessary, and they would go and become better off than they ever had
been.And Gerhardt did take this view of the situation.In answer to his
wife's letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave his
place, but if Bass saw a way for them, it might be a good thing to go.He was the more ready to acquiesce in the plan for the simple reason
that he was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family
and of paying the debts already outstanding.Every week he laid by
five dollars out of his salary, which he sent in the form of a postal
order to Mrs.Three dollars he paid for board, and fifty
cents he kept for spending money, church dues, a little tobacco and
occasionally a glass of beer.Every week he put a dollar and a half in
a little iron bank against a rainy day.His room was a bare corner in
the topmost loft of the mill.To this he would ascend after sitting
alone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely, foresaken
neighborhood, until nine o'clock of an evening; and here, amid the
odor of machinery wafted up from the floor below, by the light of a
single tallow candle, he would conclude his solitary day, reading his
German paper, folding his hands and thinking, kneeling by an open
window in the shadow of the night to say his prayers, and silently
stretching himself to rest.Long were the days, dreary the prospect.Still he lifted his hands in utmost faith to God, praying that his
sins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more
years of comfort and of happy family life.There was the
greatest longing and impatience among the children, and Mrs.Gerhardt
shared their emotions in a suppressed way.Jennie was to go first, as
Bass had suggested; later on they would all follow.When the hour came for Jennie's departure there was great
excitement in the household."How long you going to be 'fore you send for us?"was Martha's
inquiry, several times repeated."Tell Bass to hurry up," said the eager George."I want to go to Cleveland, I want to go to Cleveland," Veronica
was caught singing to herself."Listen to her," exclaimed George, sarcastically."Aw, you hush up," was her displeased rejoinder.When the final hour came, however, it required all of Jennie's
strength to go through with the farewells.Though everything was being
done in order to bring them together again under better conditions,
she could not help feeling depressed.Her little one, now six months
old, was being left behind.The great world was to her one
undiscovered bourne."You mustn't worry, Ma," she found courage enough to say.I'll write you just as soon as I get there.But when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her
courage went out like a blown lamp.Stooping over the cradle in which
the little one was resting, she looked into its face with passionate,
motherly yearning."Is it going to be a good little girl?"Then she caught it up into her arms, and hugging it closely to her
neck and bosom, she buried her face against its little body."Come now," she said, coaxingly, "you mustn't carry on so.If you're going to act
this way, you'd better not try to go at all."Jennie lifted her head, her blue eyes wet with tears, and handed
the little one to her mother."I can't help it," she said, half crying, half smiling.Quickly she kissed her mother and the children; then she hurried
out.As she went down the street with George she looked back and bravely
waved her hand.Gerhardt responded, noticing how much more like a
woman she looked.It had been necessary to invest some of her money in
new clothes to wear on the train.She had selected a neat, ready-made
suit of brown, which fitted her nicely.She wore the skirt of this
with a white shirt-waist, and a sailor hat with a white veil wound
around it in such fashion that it could be easily drawn over her face.Gerhardt followed her
lovingly with her glance; and when she disappeared from view she said
tenderly, through her own tears:

"I'm glad she looked so nice, anyhow."CHAPTER XIII


Bass met Jennie at the depot in Cleveland and talked hopefully of
the prospects."The first thing is to get work," he began, while the
jingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon her
were confusing and almost benumbing her senses.It doesn't matter what, so long as you get something.If you don't get
more than three or four dollars a week, it will pay the rent.Then,
with what George can earn, when he comes, and what Pop sends, we can
get along all right.It'll be better than being down in that hole," he
concluded."Yes," said Jennie, vaguely, her mind so hypnotized by the new
display of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear
upon the topic under discussion.She was much older now, in understanding if not in years.The
ordeal through which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a
clearer conception of the responsibilities of life.Her mother was
always in her mind, her mother and the children.In particular Martha
and Veronica must have a better opportunity to do for themselves than
she had had.They should be dressed better; they ought to be kept
longer in school; they must have more companionship, more opportunity
to broaden their lives.Cleveland, like every other growing city at this time, was crowded
with those who were seeking employment.New enterprises were
constantly springing up, but those who were seeking to fulfil the
duties they provided were invariably in excess of the demand.A
stranger coming to the city might walk into a small position of almost
any kind on the very day he arrived; and he might as readily wander in
search of employment for weeks and even months.Bass suggested the
shops and department stores as a first field in which to inquire.The
factories and other avenues of employment were to be her second
choice."Don't pass a place, though," he had cautioned her, "if you think
there's any chance of getting anything to do.You don't care what you do to begin
with."In compliance with this advice, Jennie set out the very first day,
and was rewarded by some very chilly experiences.Wherever she went,
no one seemed to want any help.She applied at the stores, the
factories, the little shops that lined the outlying thoroughfares, but
was always met by a rebuff.As a last resource she turned to
housework, although she had hoped to avoid that; and, studying the
want columns, she selected four which seemed more promising than the
others.One had already been filled
when she arrived, but the lady who came to the door was so taken by
her appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her
ability."I wish you had come a little earlier," she said."I like you
better than I do the girl I have taken.Jennie went away, smiling at her reception.She was not quite so
youthful looking as she had been before her recent trouble, but the
thinner cheeks and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness
and delicacy of her countenance.Her
clothes, all newly cleaned and ironed before leaving home, gave her a
fresh and inviting appearance.There was growth coming to her in the
matter of height, but already in appearance and intelligence she
looked to be a young woman of twenty.Best of all, she was of that
naturally sunny disposition, which, in spite of toil and privation,
kept her always cheerful.Any one in need of a servant-girl or house
companion would have been delighted to have had her.The second place at which she applied was a large residence in
Euclid Avenue; it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have
to offer in the way of services, but having come so far she decided to
make the attempt.The servant who met her at the door directed her to
wait a few moments, and finally ushered her into the boudoir of the
mistress of the house on the second floor.Bracebridge, a prepossessing brunette of the conventionally
fashionable type, had a keen eye for feminine values and was impressed
rather favorably with Jennie.She talked with her a little while, and
finally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid."I will give you four dollars a week, and you can sleep here if you
wish," said Mrs.Jennie explained that she was living with her brother, and would
soon have her family with her."Oh, very well," replied her mistress.She wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at
once, and Jennie agreed.Bracebridge provided her a dainty cap
and apron, and then spent some little time in instructing her in her
duties.Her principal work would be to wait on her mistress, to brush
her hair and to help her dress.She was also to answer the bell, wait
on the table if need be, and do any other errand which her mistress
might indicate.Bracebridge seemed a little hard and formal to
her prospective servant, but for all that Jennie admired the dash and
go and the obvious executive capacity of her employer.At eight o'clock that evening Jennie was dismissed for the day.She
wondered if she could be of any use in such a household, and marveled
that she had got along as well as she had.Her mistress had set her to
cleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments as an opening task, and
though she had worked steadily and diligently, she had not finished by
the time she left.She hurried away to her brother's apartment,
delighted to be able to report that she had found a situation.Now they could really begin that new life which was to be so much
better and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had
before.At Bass's suggestion Jennie wrote her mother to come at once, and a
week or so later a suitable house was found and rented.Gerhardt,
with the aid of the children, packed up the simple belongings of the
family, including a single vanload of furniture, and at the end of a
fortnight they were on their way to the new home.Gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable
home.Solid furniture, upholstered and trimmed, a thick, soft carpet
of some warm, pleasing color, plenty of chairs, settees, pictures, a
lounge, and a piano she had wanted these nice things all her life, but
her circumstances had never been good enough for her hopes to be
realized.Some day, maybe, before she died
these things would be added to her, and she would be happy.Arrived at Cleveland, this feeling of optimism was encouraged by
the sight of Jennie's cheerful face.Bass assured her that they would
get along all right.He took them out to the house, and George was
shown the way to go back to the depot and have the freight looked
after.Gerhardt had still fifty dollars left out of the money
which Senator Brander had sent to Jennie, and with this a way of
getting a little extra furniture on the instalment plan was provided.Bass had already paid the first month's rent, and Jennie had spent her
evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of
this new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness.Now, when the first night fell, they had two new mattresses and
comfortables spread upon a clean floor; a new lamp, purchased from one
of the nearby stores, a single box, borrowed by Jennie from a grocery
store, for cleaning purposes, upon which Mrs.Gerhardt could sit, and
some sausages and bread to stay them until morning.They talked and
planned for the future until nine o'clock came, when all but Jennie
and her mother retired.These two talked on, the burden of
responsibilities resting on the daughter.Gerhardt had come to
feel in a way dependent upon her.In the course of a week the entire cottage was in order, with a
half-dozen pieces of new furniture, a new carpet, and some necessary
kitchen utensils.The most disturbing thing was the need of a new
cooking-stove, the cost of which added greatly to the bill.The
younger children were entered at the public school, but it was decided
that George must find some employment.Both Jennie and her mother felt
the injustice of this keenly, but knew no way of preventing the
sacrifice."We will let him go to school next year if we can," said
Jennie.Auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness
with which their expenses were matching their income was an
ever-present menace.Bass, originally very generous in his
propositions, soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his
room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself.Jennie
gave everything she earned, and protested that she did not stand in
need of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care of.George secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two
dollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly
contributed.Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as
being meet and just.Gerhardt, from his lonely post of labor,
contributed five dollars by mail, always arguing that a little money
ought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in Columbus
might be paid.Out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all
of these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid, coal
purchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on
the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.How it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently
discuss the social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform
themselves.Rent, coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of
twenty dollars a month; food, another unfortunately necessary item,
used up twenty-five more; clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items
of medicine and the like, were met out of the remaining eleven
dollars--how, the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader
can guess.It was done, however, and for a time the hopeful members
considered that they were doing fairly well.During this period the little family presented a picture of
honorable and patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate.Gerhardt, who worked like a servant and who received
absolutely no compensation either in clothes, amusements, or anything
else, arose in the morning while the others slept, and built the fire.Then she took up the task of getting the breakfast.Often as she moved
about noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers, cushioned with pieces of
newspaper to make them fit, she looked in on Jennie, Bass, and George,
wrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that divine sympathy which
is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early
or to work so hard.Sometimes she would pause before touching her
beloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament
that life had not dealt more kindly with her.Then she would lay her
hand gently upon her shoulder and whisper, "Jennie, Jennie," until the
weary sleeper would wake.When they returned at
night supper was waiting.Each of the children received a due share of
Mrs.The little baby was closely looked after by
her.She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long
as one of the children would run errands for her.Jennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone
strove, with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her
burden."Now, ma, I'll 'tend to that."These were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that
existed between them.Always there was perfect understanding between
Jennie and her mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened
and deepened.Jennie could not bear to think of her as being always
confined to the house.Daily she thought as she worked of that humble
home where her mother was watching and waiting.How she longed to give
her those comforts which she had always craved!CHAPTER XIV


The days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a
broadening character.This great house was a school to Jennie, not
only in the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory
of existence.Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in
the matter of self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments,
care in the matter of dress, good form in the matter of reception,
entertainment, and the various usages of social life.Now and then,
apropos of nothing save her own mood, Mrs.Bracebridge would indicate
her philosophy of life in an epigram.If you gain anything you will have to
fight for it.""In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which
will help you to be what you want to be."(This while applying a faint
suggestion of rouge.)They are exactly what they are capable
of being.I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime."Most of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to
Jennie.She overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they
had their import.Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root
and grew.She began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and
powers.They were not for her, perhaps, but they were in the world,
and if fortune were kind one might better one's state.She worked on,
wondering, however, just how better fortune might come to her.Who
would have her to wife knowing her history?How could she ever explain
the existence of her child?Her child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy
and fear.If she could only do something for it--sometime,
somehow!By the closest
economy the children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid,
and the instalments met.Once it looked as though there might be some
difficulty about the continuance of the home life, and that was when
Gerhardt wrote that he would be home for Christmas.The mill was to
close down for a short period at that time.He was naturally anxious
to see what the new life of his family at Cleveland was like.Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed
pleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating
a scene.Jennie talked it over with her mother, and Mrs.Gerhardt in
turn spoke of it to Bass, whose advice was to brave it out."Don't worry," he said; "he won't do anything about it.I'll talk
to him if he says anything."The scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs.Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass,
Jennie, and George were at work.Two of the younger children went to
the train to meet him.Gerhardt greeted him
affectionately, but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to
come.Gerhardt opened the front bedroom
door only a few minutes after he arrived.On the white counterpane of
the bed was a pretty child, sleeping.He could not but know on the
instant whose it was, but he pretended ignorance."It's Jennie's," said Mrs."Not so very long ago," answered the mother, nervously."I guess she is here, too," he declared, contemptuously, refusing
to pronounce her name, a fact which he had already anticipated."She's working in a family," returned his wife in a pleading tone.Gerhardt had received a light since he had been away.Certain
inexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious
meditations.In his prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he
might have done differently by his daughter.Yet he could not make up
his mind how to treat her for the future.She had committed a great
sin; it was impossible to get away from that.When Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable.Gerhardt saw her coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a
newspaper.Gerhardt, who had begged him not to ignore Jennie
entirely, trembled for fear he would say or do something which would
hurt her feelings."She is coming now," she said, crossing to the door of the front
room, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up."Speak to
her, anyhow," was her last appeal before the door opened; but he made
no reply.When Jennie came in her mother whispered, "He is in the front
room."Jennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not
knowing how to meet the situation.Jennie paused as she realized from her mother's face and nod that
Gerhardt knew of the child's existence.Jennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow
wrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but
made her way forward."Papa," she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.Gerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their
heavy sandy lashes.At the sight of his daughter he weakened
internally; but with the self-adjusted armor of resolve about him he
showed no sign of pleasure at seeing her.All the forces of his
conventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic
and fatherly disposition were battling within him, but, as in so many
cases where the average mind is concerned, convention was temporarily
the victor."Won't you forgive me, Papa?"She hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose
he well understood."There," he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips barely
touched his grizzled cheek.When Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal
she lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as
though all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better
of her.her mother was about to ask; but the words
were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one
of the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her
arm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.It was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to
answer."I wouldn't feel bad," she said.CHAPTER XV


The return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all
its bearings.He could not help considering it from the standpoint of
a grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a
soul."No, not yet," said his wife, who had not forgotten this duty, but
had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the
faith."No, of course not," sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his wife's
religious devotion was not any too great.He thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be
corrected at once."Why don't she take it and have
it baptized?"Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand
godfather to the child, and there was no way to have the ceremony
performed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate
father.Gerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments,
but his religion was something which he could not see put in the
background by any such difficulty.How would the Lord look upon
quibbling like this?It was not Christian, and it was his duty to
attend to the matter.It must be taken, forthwith, to the church,
Jennie, himself, and his wife accompanying it as sponsors; or, if he
did not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter, he must see
that it was baptized when she was not present.He brooded over this
difficulty, and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on
one of these week-days between Christmas and New Year's, when Jennie
would be at her work.This proposal he broached to his wife, and,
receiving her approval, he made his next announcement."It has no
name," he said.Jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie
had expressed a preference for Vesta.Now her mother made bold to
suggest it as her own choice.Secretly he had settled the
question in his own mind.He had a name in store, left over from the
halcyon period of his youth, and never opportunely available in the
case of his own children--Wilhelmina.Of course he had no idea of
unbending in the least toward his small granddaughter.He merely liked
the name, and the child ought to be grateful to get it.With a
far-off, gingery air he brought forward this first offering upon the
altar of natural affection, for offering it was, after all."That is nice," he said, forgetting his indifference."But how
would Wilhelmina do?"Gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously
weakening."We might give her both names," she compromised."It makes no difference to me," he replied, drawing back into the
shell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn.Jennie heard of this with pleasure, for she was anxious that the
child should have every advantage, religious or otherwise, that it was
possible to obtain.She took great pains to starch and iron the
clothes it was to wear on the appointed day.Gerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest Lutheran church, a
round-headed, thick-set theologian of the most formal type, to whom he
stated his errand."Yes," said Gerhardt, "her father is not here.""So," replied the minister, looking at him curiously.Gerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose.He explained that
he and his wife would bring her.The minister, realizing the probable
difficulty, did not question him further."The church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you, as
grandparent, are willing to stand sponsor for her," he said.Gerhardt came away, hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt
himself involved, but satisfied that he had done his duty.Now he
would take the child and have it baptized, and when that was over his
present responsibility would cease.When it came to the hour of the baptism, however, he found that
another influence was working to guide him into greater interest and
responsibility.The stern religion with which he was enraptured, its
insistence upon a higher law, was there, and he heard again the
precepts which had helped to bind him to his own children."Is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and
love of the gospel?"asked the black-gowned minister, as they stood
before him in the silent little church whither they had brought the
infant; he was reading from the form provided for such occasions."Do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence, by
prayerful instruction, admonition, example, and discipline that this
child may renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may
keep God's will and commandments as declared in His sacred word?"A thought flashed through Gerhardt's mind as the words were uttered
of how it had fared with his own children.They, too, had been thus
sponsored.They too, had heard his solemn pledge to care for their
spiritual welfare."We do," repeated Gerhardt and his wife weakly."Do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the
Lord, who brought it?""And, finally, if you can conscientiously declare before God that
the faith to which you have assented is your faith, and that the
solemn promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your
heart, please to announce the same in the presence of God, by saying
'Yes.'""I baptize thee, Wilhelmina Vesta," concluded the minister,
stretching out his hand over her, "in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost.Gerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the
beautiful invocation which followed:

"Almighty and everlasting God!we adore Thee as the great Parent of
the children of men, as the Father of our spirits and the Former of
our bodies.We praise Thee for giving existence to this infant and for
preserving her until this day.We bless Thee that she is called to
virtue and glory, that she has now been dedicated to Thee, and brought
within-the pale of the Christian Church.We thank Thee that by the
Gospel of the Son she is furnished with everything necessary to her
spiritual happiness; that it supplies light for her mind and comfort
for her heart, encouragement and power to discharge her duty, and the
precious hope of mercy and immortality to sustain and make her
faithful.And we beseech Thee, O most merciful God, that this child
may be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by the Holy
Spirit, and be everlastingly saved by Thy mercy.Direct and bless Thy
servants who are intrusted with the care of her in the momentous work
of her education.Inspire them with just conception of the absolute
necessity of religious instruction and principles.Forbid that they
should ever forget that this offspring belongs to Thee, and that, if
through their criminal neglect or bad example Thy reasonable creature
be lost, Thou wilt require it at their hands.Give them a deep sense
of the divinity of her nature, of the worth of her soul, of the
dangers to which she will be exposed, of the honor and felicity to
which she is capable of ascending with Thy blessing, and of the ruin
in this world and the misery in the world to come which springs from
wicked passion and conduct.Give them grace to check the first risings
of forbidden inclinations in her breast, to be her defense against the
temptations incident to childhood and youth, and, as she grows up, to
enlarge her understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with Thee
and with Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.Give them grace to
cultivate in her heart a supreme reverence and love for Thee, a
grateful attachment to the Gospel of Thy Son, her Saviour, a due
regard for all its ordinances and institutions, a temper of kindness
and goodwill to all mankind, and an invincible love of sincerity and
truth.Help them to watch continually over her with tender solicitude,
to be studious, that by their conversation and deportment her heart
may not be corrupted, and at all times to set before her such an
example that she may safely tread in their footsteps.If it please
Thee to prolong her days on earth, grant that she may prove an honor
and a comfort to her parents and friends, be useful in the world, and
find in Thy Providence an unfailing defense and support.Whether she
live, let her live to Thee; or whether she die, let her die to Thee.And, at the great day of account, may she and her parents meet each
other with rapture and rejoice together in Thy redeeming love, through
Jesus Christ, forever and ever, Amen."As this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation
descended upon the grandfather of this little outcast; a feeling that
he was bound to give the tiny creature lying on his wife's arm the
care and attention which God in His sacrament had commanded.He bowed
his head in utmost reverence, and when the service was concluded and
they left the silent church he was without words to express his
feelings.God was a person, a
dominant reality.Religion was not a thing of mere words or of
interesting ideas to be listened to on Sunday, but a strong, vital
expression of the Divine Will handed down from a time when men were in
personal contact with God.Its fulfilment was a matter of joy and
salvation with him, the one consolation of a creature sent to wander
in a vale whose explanation was not here but in heaven.Slowly
Gerhardt walked on, and as he brooded on the words and the duties
which the sacrament involved the shade of lingering disgust that had
possessed him when he had taken the child to church disappeared and a
feeling of natural affection took its place.However much the daughter
had sinned, the infant was not to blame.It was a helpless, puling,
tender thing, demanding his sympathy and his love.Gerhardt felt his
heart go out to the little child, and yet he could not yield his
position all in a moment."That is a nice man," he said of the minister to his wife as they
walked along, rapidly softening in his conception of his duty."It's a good-sized little church," he continued.Gerhardt looked around him, at the street, the houses, the show of
brisk life on this sunshiny, winter's day, and then finally at the
child that his wife was carrying."She must be heavy," he said, in his characteristic German.Gerhardt, who was rather weary, did not refuse.he said, as he looked at her and then fixed her
comfortably upon his shoulder."Let us hope she proves worthy of all
that has been done to-day."Gerhardt listened, and the meaning in his voice interpreted
itself plainly enough.The presence of the child in the house might be
the cause of recurring spells of depression and unkind words, but
there would be another and greater influence restraining him.There
would always be her soul to consider.He would never again be utterly
unconscious of her soul.CHAPTER XVI


During the remainder of Gerhardt's stay he was shy in Jennie's
presence and endeavored to act as though he were unconscious of her
existence.When the time came for parting he even went away without
bidding her good-by, telling his wife she might do that for him; but
after he was actually on his way back to Youngstown he regretted the
omission."I might have bade her good-by," he thought to himself as
the train rumbled heavily along.For the time being the affairs of the Gerhardt family drifted.Sebastian fixed
himself firmly in his clerkship in the cigar store.George was
promoted to the noble sum of three dollars, and then three-fifty.It
was a narrow, humdrum life the family led.Coal, groceries, shoes, and
clothing were the uppermost topics of their conversation; every one
felt the stress and strain of trying to make ends meet.That which worried Jennie most, and there were many things which
weighed upon her sensitive soul, was the outcome of her own
life--not so much for herself as for her baby and the family.She
could not really see where she fitted in."How was she to dispose of Vesta in the
event of a new love affair?"She was young, good-looking, and men were inclined to flirt with her,
or rather to attempt it.The Bracebridges entertained many masculine
guests, and some of them had made unpleasant overtures to her."My dear, you're a very pretty girl," said one old rake of
fifty-odd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a
message from his hostess."I beg your pardon," she said, confusedly, and colored.I'd
like to talk to you some time."He attempted to chuck her under the chin, but Jennie hurried away.She would have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame
deterred her.Could
it be because there was something innately bad about her, an inward
corruption that attracted its like?It is a curious characteristic of the non-defensive disposition
that it is like a honey-jar to flies.Nothing is brought to it and
much is taken away.Around a soft, yielding, unselfish disposition men
swarm naturally.They sense this generosity, this non-protective
attitude from afar.A girl like Jennie is like a comfortable fire to
the average masculine mind; they gravitate to it, seek its sympathy,
yearn to possess it.Hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome
attentions.One day there arrived from Cincinnati a certain Lester Kane, the
son of a wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that
city and elsewhere throughout the country, who was wont to visit this
house frequently in a social way.Bracebridge
more than of her husband, for the former had been raised in Cincinnati
and as a girl had visited at his father's house.She knew his mother,
his brother and sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had
always been considered one of the family."Lester's coming to-morrow, Henry," Jennie heard Mrs."I had a wire from him this noon.I'm going to give him the big east front room up-stairs.Be sociable
and pay him some attention."I know it," said her husband calmly.He's the
biggest one in that family."I know; but he's so nice.I do think he's one of the nicest men I
ever knew."Don't I always do pretty well by your
people?""Oh, I don't know about that," he replied, dryly.When this notable person arrived Jennie was prepared to see some
one of more than ordinary importance, and she was not disappointed.There came into the reception-hall to greet her mistress a man of
perhaps thirty-six years of age, above the medium in height,
clear-eyed, firm-jawed, athletic, direct, and vigorous.He had a deep,
resonant voice that carried clearly everywhere; people somehow used to
stop and listen whether they knew him or not.He was simple and abrupt
in his speech."Oh, there you are," he began.He asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess
answered with an equal warmth."I'm glad to see you, Lester," she
said."George will take your things up-stairs.He followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at
the head of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his
personality.It seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real
personage had arrived.The attitude of her
mistress was much more complaisant.Everybody seemed to feel that
something must be done for this man.Jennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name
ran in her mind.She looked
at him now and then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her
life, an interest in a man on his own account.He was so big, so
handsome, so forceful.At the same
time she felt a little dread of him.Once she caught him looking at
her with a steady, incisive stare.She quailed inwardly, and took the
first opportunity to get out of his presence.Another time he tried to
address a few remarks to her, but she pretended that her duties called
her away.She knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was
turned, and it made her nervous.She wanted to run away from him,
although there was no very definite reason why she should do so.As a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,
education, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her
unusual personality.Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar
softness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity.There was
that about her which suggested the luxury of love.He felt as if
somehow she could be reached why, he could not have said.She did not
bear any outward marks of her previous experience.There were no
evidences of coquetry about her, but still he "felt that he might."He
was inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business
called him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland
for three weeks.Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she
experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret.He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to
Mrs.Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence
in Cleveland.As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as
if somehow his presence might also concern her a little.On this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,
at breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could
see the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at
odd times when he came to Mrs.Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things
over."Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?"Jennie heard
her say to him the second day he was there."I know," he replied, "but I'm in no mood for that.I want to
browse around a little while yet."You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.He has
got all he can attend to to look after the business."She scarcely understood what she
was thinking, but this man drew her.If she had realized in what way
she would have fled his presence then and there.Now he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed
an occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic
conversations.She could not help answering him--he was pleasing
to her.Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor
searching in a locker for some linen.Bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other
servants being below stairs.On this occasion he made short work of
the business.He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and
thoroughly determined way."I want to talk to you," he said."I--I--" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly."I live
out on Lorrie Street."he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell
him."Thirteen fourteen," she replied
mechanically.He looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous
brown ones.A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed
between them."Oh, you mustn't," she said, her fingers going nervously to her
lips."I can't see you--I--I--"

"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I?Look here"--he took her arm and
drew her slightly closer--"you and I might as well understand
each other right now.She looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,
with a growing terror."I don't know," she gasped, her lips dry.He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes."I'll talk to you later," he said,
and put his lips masterfully to hers.She was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but
through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking
to her."We won't do any more of
this here, but, remember, you belong to me," he said, as he turned and
walked nonchalantly down the hall.Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her
mistress's room and locked the door behind her.CHAPTER XVII


The shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she
was hours in recovering herself.At first she did not understand
clearly just what had happened.Out of clear sky, as it were, this
astonishing thing had taken place.she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness
there was an answer.Though she could not explain her own emotions,
she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.There is a fate in love and a fate in fight.This strong,
intellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,
so far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely
superior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,
instinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor
serving-maid.She was his natural affinity, though he did not know
it--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his
nature.Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the
highly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the
proletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for
him the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of
judgment, youth, and beauty.Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in
the back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended
to take her.He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he
ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane.For purposes of
temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,
of course, out of the question.He had no idea of making anything like
a serious proposal to a servant-girl.He had
never seen a servant quite like her.And she was lady-like and lovely
without appearing to know it.Why
shouldn't he try to seize her?Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us
try to understand him and his position.Not every mind is to be
estimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to
be judged by the drag of a single passion.We live in an age in which
the impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the
spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock.The tremendous and
complicated development of our material civilization, the
multiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,
and sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,
and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the
post-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in
short, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements
of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic
glitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies
and stultifies the mental and moral nature.It induces a sort of
intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of
insomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited.Our modern
brain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and
storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present
themselves daily.We are
weighed upon by too many things.It is as if the wisdom of the
infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big
minds.Lester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.His was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and
tendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness
of the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial
nature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification.Born a
Catholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of
Catholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to
accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate
superiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and
expected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he
wanted marriage on any terms.Of course the conjugal state was an
institution.True, but other nations believed in
polygamy.There were other questions that bothered him--such
questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,
and whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of
government were best.In short, the whole body of things material,
social, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery
and been left but half dissected.Not a
single idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was
finally settled.In all other things he wavered, questioned,
procrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe
the solution of the problems that vexed him.Yes, Lester Kane was the
natural product of a combination of elements--religious,
commercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of
liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted
freedom of thought and action.Thirty-six years of age, and apparently
a man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,
nevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by
education and environment.Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen
who in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the
mines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and
mortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,
axiomatic, and witty."Do you want me to come back here next year?"he had asked of
Brother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical
member was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor."Your father will have to
look after that," he replied."Well, my father won't look after it," Lester returned."If you
touch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands.I'm not
committing any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked
around any more."Words, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,
vigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and
the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to
take his clothes and leave.After that he looked his father in the eye
and told him that he was not going to school any more."I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work," he explained."There's
nothing in a classical education for me.Let me go into the office,
and I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through."Old Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial
honor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce
him."Come down to the office," he said; "perhaps there is something you
can do."Entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had
worked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had
come to be, in a way, his personal representative.Whenever there was
a contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a
representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a
deal, Lester was the agent selected.His father trusted him
implicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of
his duties that this trust had never been impaired."Business is business," was a favorite axiom with him and the very
tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character
and personality.There were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and
then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under
control.One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was
perfectly sure he had the upper hand.He drank but very little, he
thought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.Another weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed
that he was the master.If he chose to have irregular relations with
women, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay.If men
were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such
relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences
growing out of them.Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp
upon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a
quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a
little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual
conduct.Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to
be mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality
intact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it
was a good one.As to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been
purely selfish.But now that he had asserted his masculine
prerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to
realize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.There is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin
to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal
of happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by
which they are environed.they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the
possibility of taking a maiden to wife, "that I shall be compelled to
swallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a
pledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my
affairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a
variable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become
insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty
and interest?"These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold
contingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the
advantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship.They
seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their
indulgence.Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional
relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of
radical readjustment.Lester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it.The
innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone.He wanted
the comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more
disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it.He
would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the
needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered.Of
course he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he
had discovered her.She appealed to him on every side; he had never
known anybody quite like her.Marriage was not only impossible but
unnecessary.He had only to say "Come" and she must obey; it was her
destiny.Lester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately.He strolled
out to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof
that sheltered her.Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment
touched his heart.Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,
honorably?Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him
and changed his mood.No, he must possess her if he
could--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible.It was in that frame
of mind that he returned to Mrs.Bracebridge's home from his visit to
Lorrie Street.CHAPTER XVIII


Jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and
complicated problem to confront.Her baby, her father, her brothers,
and sisters all rose up to confront her.What was this thing that she
was doing?Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,
unsanctified relationship?How was she to explain to her family about
this man?He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about
her.He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and
position.Yet here she was parleying with him.She pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it
was best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him
where she lived.Then she resolved that she would summon up her
courage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have
anything to do with him.This last solution of the difficulty seemed
simple enough--in his absence.And she would find work where he
could not follow her up so easily.It all seemed simple enough as she
put on her things in the evening to go home.Her aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion
in this matter.Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to
the point.He came to the decision that he must act at once.She might
tell her family, she might tell Mrs.Bracebridge, she might leave the
city.He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,
and there was only one way to do that--talk to her.He must
persuade her to come and live with him.That soft, yielding note in her character
which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win
her without much difficulty, if he wished to try.He decided to do so,
anyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.At half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she
were still there.At six he had an opportunity to say to her,
unobserved, "I am going to walk home with you.Wait for me at the next
corner, will you?""Yes," she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing
her.She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,
that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,
and this was as good an opportunity as any.At half-past six he left
the house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little
after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the
appointed spot.He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,
and curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior.It was as
if he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.A few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along.The flare of
the gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes
to make her out.A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a
great appeal in her personality.He stepped out as she neared the
corner and confronted her."Come," he said, "and get in this carriage
with me.Once more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of
compulsion.She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he
called out to the cabman, "Anywhere for a little while."When she was
seated beside him he began at once."Listen to me, Jennie, I want you."I have to talk to you," she replied, trying to stick to her
original line of defense.he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the
half light."I can't go on this way," she murmured nervously.I shouldn't have done what I did
this morning."You didn't do what you did this morning," he remarked,
paradoxically, seizing on that one particular expression.And as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.""You don't know me, but I like you.I'm crazy about you, that's
all.she replied in an agonized voice, "I can't do
anything like that, Mr.I couldn't, even if I wanted to.But I don't want to do anything wrong.He listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with
even a little pity."What do you mean by you can't?""Oh, I can't tell you," she replied.But I mustn't see you any more."But you like me," he retorted.But you mustn't come near me
any more.He turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a
judge.He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief
as their contact had been.And he was drawn to her, perhaps not
irrevocably, but with exceeding strength.What prevented her from
yielding, especially since she wanted to?"See here, Jennie," he replied.I don't know
what you mean by 'can't' if you want to.I'd like to have you
with me.Oh,
please don't ask me any more.The man had a keen sense of justice and fair play.Above all things
he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people.In this case he
intended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her."Listen to me," he said finally, still holding her hand."I may not
want you to do anything immediately.I
like you, and I can do a lot of things for you.Why not let us be good
friends now?Then we can talk the rest of this over later.""But I mustn't do anything wrong," she insisted."Oh no, no, no," she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her
control."Well, then, why stand out against me?I love you, I tell
you--I'm crazy about you.And I would have come again and again if necessary.I
tell you I'm crazy about you.Now tell me you'll
come with me.""No, no, no," she pleaded.I
don't want to do anything wrong."Tell me, Jennie," he said, changing the subject."Don't say'sir' to me, sweet!"I'm not'mister'
to you any more.You belong to me, little girl, me.""Listen to me, Jennie," he repeated, using his favorite expression.I
haven't had a chance to know you.You've
got to come to me eventually.And I'm not going to have you working as
a lady's maid.You can't stay in that place except for a little while.And I'm going to leave you some
money, do you hear?At the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand."The families of the poor," he thought."Well, you take this from me," he insisted, drawing a purse from
his coat."And I'll see you very soon again.No, you mustn't
ask me."He insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money
away."One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me," he said
soberly."You'll have to come to me eventually.I'm not going to leave you
alone.""Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.""I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?"he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of
this prize escaping him heightening his passion.And he drew her close in spite of all her protests."There," he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something
between them spoke again, and she relaxed.Tears were in her eyes, but
he did not see them."I can't," she repeated, with a sob."You're not crying, little girl,
are you?""I'll not say anything more to-night.I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you
again.I'll do anything
in reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?""Here's where you get out," he said, as the carriage drew up near
the corner.He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt
cottage curtains."Good-by," he said as she stepped out."Remember," he said, "this is just the beginning."Jennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed.There was no denying that she had compromised herself
irretrievably.CHAPTER XIX


The inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did
not leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;
certainly this was not the end of the affair.Kane knew that he was
deeply fascinated.She was sweeter than he had
had any idea of.Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle "no,
no, no" moved him as music might.Depend upon it, this girl was for
him, and he would get her.What did he
care about what his family or the world might think?It was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time
Jennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done
spiritually.Something about her--a
warm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated
a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,
brutal immorality.She was the kind of a woman who was made for a
man--one man.All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,
tenderness, service.When the one man arrived she would love him and
she would go to him.She would yield to him because he was the one man.On Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of
possible disaster.If he followed her of course he would learn all.She had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the
vague illusion that, in the end, she might escape.When she left him
she knew that he would come back.She knew, in spite of herself that
she wanted him to do so.Yet she felt that she must not yield, she
must go on leading her straitened, humdrum life.This was her
punishment for having made a mistake.She had made her bed, and she
must lie on it.The Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned
after leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted
strangely with the Gerhardt home.It was a great, rambling, two-story
affair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick
and brownstone.It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost
park-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity
and of a refined luxury.Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a
tremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair
methods, but by seeing a big need and filling it.Early in life he had
realized that America was a growing country.There was going to be a
big demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he
knew that some one would have to supply them.Having founded a small
wagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good
wagons, and he sold them at a good profit.It was his theory that most
men were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,
and if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and
buy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man.He
believed in the measure "heaped full and running over."All through
his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of
every one who knew him."Archibald Kane," you would hear his
competitors say, "Ah, there is a fine man.This man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all
healthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but
none of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and
big-hearted sire.Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was
his father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain
hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of
business life.He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with
a high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue
eyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips.He was a man of few
words, rather slow to action and of deep thought.He sat close to his
father as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole
blocks in an outlying section of the city.He was a strong man--a
coming man, as his father well knew.Lester, the second boy, was his father's favorite.He was not by
any means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of
the subtleties that underlie life.He was softer, more human, more
good-natured about everything.And, strangely enough, old Archibald
admired and trusted him.Perhaps he
turned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial
problem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.Then there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the
mother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,
but as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the
best-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical.She
was the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of
all in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane
family should outshine every other.She was proud to think that the
family was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air
and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to
Lester!He liked her--in a way she was his favorite
sister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less
seriousness and not do the family standing any harm.Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of
age, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,
cared but little for social life.But she loved her children and her
husband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments.It
was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory.A good
woman, a good wife, and a good mother.Lester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at
once to his home.An old Irish servitor met him at the door.Lester," he began, joyously, "sure I'm glad to see you
back.Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're
having.Yes, yes, the family's all well.Sure your sister Amy is just
after leavin' the house with the boy.Your mother's up-stairs in her
room.Lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room.In this,
which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the
south and east, sat Mrs.Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with
smoothly laid gray hair.She looked up when the door opened, laid down
the volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him."There you are, Mother," he said, putting his arms around her and
kissing her."Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester.I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again.I had
to stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons.She doesn't change any that I can see.She's just
as interested in entertaining as she ever was.""She's a bright girl," remarked his mother, recalling Mrs."She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you," replied Lester
significantly.Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family
happenings.Old Zwingle, the yard
watchman at the factory, who had been with Mr.Kane for over forty
years, had died.Lester listened
dutifully, albeit a trifle absently.Lester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise."Smart" was
the word for her.She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,
fitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which
contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair."Oh, there you are, Lester," she exclaimed.I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to
the powder on my nose.Lester had gripped her firmly
and kissed her soundly."I didn't brush much of it off," he said."You can always dust more
on with that puff of yours."He passed on to his own room to dress for
dinner.Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the
Kane family in the last few years.Guests had become so common that in
a way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of
it.To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr.Burnett, old
friends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be
a formal one.Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he
did not trouble to look him up now.He was thinking of his last two
days in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.CHAPTER XX


As Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his
father in the library reading."Hello, Lester," he said, looking up from his paper over the top of
his glasses and extending his hand."Cleveland," replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and
smiling."Robert tells me you've been to New York.""How did you find my old friend Arnold?""I suppose not," said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report
were a compliment to his own hardy condition."He's been a temperate
man.He led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over
business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned
the guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.Lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great
Louis Quinze dining-room.He liked this homey home
atmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old
family friends.Louise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on
Tuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go."You know I don't dance," he returned dryly.If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you
might.""Robert's got it on me in lightness," Lester replied, airily."Be that as it may," said Lester."Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise," observed Robert,
sagely.After dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with
his brother a little on business.There were some contracts coming up
for revision.He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.Louise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced."Letty Pace asked about you the other night," Louise called back
from the door."She's a nice girl, Lester," put in his father, who was standing
near the open fire."I only wish you would marry her and settle down.asked Lester jocularly--"a conspiracy?You
know I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.""And I well know it," replied his mother semi-seriously.He really could not stand for this sort
of thing any more, he told himself.And as he thought his mind
wandered back to Jennie and her peculiar "Oh no, no!"That was a type of womanhood worth
while.Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set
like a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little
girl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to
watch over her.That night in his room he composed a letter, which he
dated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and
because he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two
weeks."MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said
nothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me.Was the impression
I gave of myself very bad?I will make it better from now on, for I
love you, little girl--I really do.There is a flower on my table
which reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.Your personality, lingering with me, is just that.You are the essence
of everything beautiful to me.It is in your power to strew flowers in
my path if you will."But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the
18th, and I shall expect to see you.I arrive Thursday night, and I
want you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon
Friday."You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call.These separations are dangerous to good
friendship.But I can't take "no" for an answer, not now."She's a remarkable girl in
her way," he thought.CHAPTER XXI


The arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and
after she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply.How did she truly feel about this
man?If she did so, what
should she say?Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which
she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,
had not seemed to involve any one but herself.Now, there seemed to be
others to consider--her family, above all, her child.The little
Vesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;
her large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness
which would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential
traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind.Gerhardt had
become very fond of her.Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his
interest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct
feeling of kindliness toward her.And this readjustment of her
father's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct
herself that no pain should ever come to him again.Any new folly on
her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would
tend to injure the prospects of her little one.Her life was a
failure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do
nothing to spoil it.She wondered whether it would not be better to
write Lester and explain everything.She had told him that she did not
wish to do wrong.Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a
child, and beg him to leave her in peace.Did she really want him to take her at her word?The need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.It caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to
explain, and then to tear it up.Finally, fate intervened in the
sudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an
accident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.It was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when
a letter came from Gerhardt.But instead of the customary fatherly
communication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly
remittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by
another hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received
a severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a
dipper of molten glass.The letter added that he would be home the
next morning.exclaimed William, his mouth wide
open.said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at
the floor.The possibility
that Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties
which she had not the courage to contemplate.Bass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight.The former
heard the news with an astonished face."Did the letter say
how bad he was hurt?""Well, I wouldn't worry about it," said Bass easily.I wouldn't worry like that if I
were you."The truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly
different.His brain was
not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of
things."I
can't help it, though.To think that just when we were getting along
fairly well this new calamity should be added.It seems sometimes as
if we were under a curse.When Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was
her one stay.asked Jennie as she opened the door and
observed her mother's face.Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away."Pa's had his hands burned," put in Bass solemnly."He'll be home
to-morrow."Jennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.Instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her."Now, don't you cry, ma," she said, barely able to control herself.I know how you feel, but we'll get along.Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long
before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.And now without volition upon her part there leaped into her
consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought.What about Lester's
offer of assistance now?Somehow
it came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire
to help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when
Bass was in jail.She thought
this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,
haggard, and distraught."What a pity," she thought, "that her mother
must always suffer!Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any
real happiness?""I wouldn't feel so badly," she said, after a time."Maybe pa isn't
burned so badly as we think.Did the letter say he'd be home in the
morning?"They talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details
were exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the
household."One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,"
said Jennie to Bass."No," said Bass gloomily, "you mustn't.He was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;
he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in.Jennie and
her mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen
talking."I don't see what's to become of us now," said Mrs.Gerhardt at
last, completely overcome by the financial complications which this
new calamity had brought about.She looked so weak and helpless that
Jennie could hardly contain herself."Don't worry, mamma dear," she said, softly, a peculiar resolve
coming into her heart.There was comfort and ease
in it scattered by others with a lavish hand.Surely, surely
misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!She sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future
seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps."What do you suppose will become of us now?"repeated her mother,
who saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had
crumbled before her eyes."Why," said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,
"it will be all right.She realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of
the situation to her.She must sacrifice herself; there was no other
way.Bass met his father at the railway station in the morning.He
looked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal.His cheeks
were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt.His
hands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a
picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home
from the station."By chops," he said to Bass, "that was a burn I got.I thought once
I couldn't stand the pain any longer.He related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did
not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again.The
thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been
burned to the bone.The latter had been amputated at the first
joint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger
of being stiff.he added, "just at the time when I needed the money
most.Gerhardt opened the door, the
old mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.Even Bass lost control of himself for a
moment or two, but quickly recovered.The other children wept, until
Bass called a halt on all of them."Don't cry now," he said cheeringly.It
isn't so bad as all that.Bass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her
husband was home, Mrs.Though his
hands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not
otherwise injured was some consolation.He might recover the use of
his hands and be able to undertake light work again.Anyway, they
would hope for the best.When Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father
and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but
she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.Never had he completely recovered from
the shame which his daughter had brought upon him.Although he wanted
to be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to
say or do."Papa," said Jennie, approaching him timidly.Gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it
was unavailing.The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her
sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all
too much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly."Forgive me, papa," she pleaded, "I'm so sorry.He did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that
their meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he
did."I have prayed," he said brokenly.When he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new
relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.From that time, although there was always a great reserve between
them, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored
to show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old
days.But while the household was again at peace, there were other cares
and burdens to be faced.How were they to get along now with five
dollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's
presence added?Bass might have contributed more of his weekly
earnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it.And so the small
sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current
expenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which
now began to press very heavily.Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to
have his hands dressed daily.Either more money must come from some source or the family must beg
for credit and suffer the old tortures of want.The situation
crystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.Had he not tried to force money
on her?She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of
this proffered assistance.She sat down and wrote him a brief note.She would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come
to the house.She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled
feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the
fateful day.CHAPTER XXII


The fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new
and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence.There
was really no alternative, she thought.If she could make her family happy, if she could
give Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of
this older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,
perhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and
Lester was very kind, he certainly liked her.At seven o'clock she
went to Mrs.Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext
of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.Lester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had
failed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out
of tune with the world.He had a lingering hope that a letter from
Jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from
her.He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt
depressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.After supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of
billiards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had
taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant.The
next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole
affair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew
near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last
chance.Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of
an hour of the time, he went down into the parlor.Great was his
delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the
outcome of her acquiescence.He walked briskly up, a satisfied,
gratified smile on his face."So you did come after all," he said, gazing at her with the look
of one who has lost and recovered a prize."What do you mean by not
writing me?I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made
up your mind not to come at all."What's the
trouble, Jennie?Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?"Yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say."He burned his hands at the glass-works.It looks as though he would not be able to use them any
more."She paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that
she was facing a crisis.I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family
affairs ever since I left."He led the way into the dining-room and
selected a secluded table.He tried to divert her mind by asking her
to order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so
and he had to make out the menu by himself.Then he turned to her with
a cheering air."Now, Jennie," he said, "I want you to tell me all
about your family.I got a little something of it last time, but I
want to get it straight.Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by
trade.Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.""He's a clerk in a cigar store.""I think it's twelve dollars," she replied thoughtfully."Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet.He gets three
dollars and a half."He stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.He turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking
earnestly."To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like
that, Jennie," he said."I've been thinking about you a lot.There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad
one, if you'll only believe me."He paused for an inquiry, but she
made none."I thought I wouldn't," she said simply."I knew what you thought," he replied.I'm
going to 'tend to that family of yours.And I'll do it right now while
I think of it."He drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar
bills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all."I want you to take
this," he said.I will see that your family
is provided for from now on.She put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut
her fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time."I
want you to have it, sweet.I'm not going to
see you suffer, nor any one belonging to you."Her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips."I don't know how to thank you," she said."You don't need to," he replied."The thanks are all the other
way--believe me."He paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.She looked at the table, wondering what would come next."How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?""That would give you your freedom day times.""I couldn't do that," she replied."But there's so little in what
you're doing.I would be glad to
give you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which
you could use it."He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.From the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of
sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence
such as this.He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched
him."There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see," he went
on very gently."You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.Give it up and come with me down
to New York; I'll take good care of you.As
far as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them
any more.You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any
style you please.He paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,
her dear mother.Gerhardt had been talking of
this very thing--a nice home.If they could just have a larger
house, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she
would be.In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the
discomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would
be so happy.She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in
spirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion.It had been a
happy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the
family.He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:

"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?""It would be very nice," she said, "but it can't be done now.Papa would want to know all about where I was
going."Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with
Mrs."There couldn't be any objection to
that, could there?""Not if they didn't find out," she said, her eyes opening in
amazement.Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long
trips.Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to
go--and then go?"She thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible.Then she
looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant
possible motherhood for her again.The tragedy of giving birth to a
child--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least
under the same conditions.She could not bring herself to tell him
about Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection."I--" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,
and then stopping.He loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.He reached over and laid his strong
brown one on top of it."I couldn't have a baby," she said, finally, and looked down.He gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency
under conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of
the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she
had not occupied until that moment."You're a great girl, Jennie," he said.You don't need to have a
child unless you want to, and I don't want you to."He saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.You think I know,
don't you?"But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.There wouldn't
be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time.But there won't be--don't worry."Not for worlds could she have met his
eyes."Look here, Jennie," he said, after a time."You care for me, don't
you?You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care
for you?I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth.I want you to do it
quickly.I know how difficult this family business is, but you can
arrange it.We'll pretend a courtship, anything you
like--only come now.""You don't mean right away, do you?"Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would
think anything about it."It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood," she replied
thoughtfully."I know it, but you can come."Won't you wait a little while?""Not a day, sweet, that I can help."Yes," she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of
affection.CHAPTER XXIII


The business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not
so difficult as it first appeared.Jennie proposed to tell her mother
the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except
that she was going with Mrs.He
might question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home
that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she
was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and
hat."When we get to New York I am
going to get you some real things," he told her."I am going to show
you what you can be made to look like."He had all the purchased
articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel.Then he arranged
to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in
the afternoon.Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received
her with her usual affectionate greeting."No," she said, "I'm not tired."Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma.She
paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.So many things had
happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new
calamity."You haven't lost your place, have you?""No," replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,
"but I'm going to leave it.""Why, when did you decide to do
that?""Yes, I do, mamma.I've got something I want to tell you.There isn't any way we can make things come
out right.I have found some one who wants to help us.He says he
loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday.You wouldn't do
anything like that after all that's happened."I've thought it all out," went on Jennie, firmly.He
wants me to go with him, and I'd better go.He will take a new house
for us when we come back and help us to get along.No one will ever
have me as a wife--you know that."I thought I'd better not tell him
about her.She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.""I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie," said
her mother."Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?""I thought maybe that she could be kept here," suggested Jennie,
"until she's old enough to go to school.Then maybe I could send her
somewhere.""She might," assented her mother; "but don't you think it would be
better to tell him now?He won't think any the worse of you.""I don't want
her to be brought into it.""Oh, it's been almost two months now.""And you never said anything about him," protested Mrs."I didn't know that he cared for me this way," said Jennie
defensively."Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?"You can't go and not have
your father find out.""I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs.Papa can't
object to my going with her."Gerhardt, with her
imaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new
and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life.He was
wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home."And he gave me this," put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive
psychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood.She opened her
dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she
placed the money in her mother's hands.Here was the relief for all her
woes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small
package of green and yellow bills.If there were plenty of money in
the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and
Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for
Vesta."Do you think he might ever want to marry you?""I don't know," replied Jennie "he might."Well," said her mother after a long pause, "if you're going to
tell your father you'd better do it right away.He'll think it's
strange as it is."Her mother had acquiesced from
sheer force of circumstances.She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to
be for the best."I'll help you out with it," her mother had
concluded, with a little sigh.The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming
nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions.The children were
also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the
falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough."How long do you think you'll be gone?""About two or three weeks," she replied."That's a nice trip," he said."I came through New York in 1844.It
was a small place then compared to what it is now."Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,
going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her."So you came," he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the
ladies' parlor."You are my niece," he went on."I have engaged H room for you near
mine.I'll call for the key, and you go dress.When you're ready I'll
have the trunk sent to the depot.The train leaves at one
o'clock."She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,
smoked, and finally knocked at her door.She replied by opening to him, fully clad."You look charming," he said with a smile.She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught.The whole
process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had
been hard on her.He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down
the hall.He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these
simple clothes--the best she had ever had.They reached the depot after a short carriage ride.The
accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed
just enough time to make the train.When they settled themselves in a
Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his
part.He had succeeded in
what he had started out to do.As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the
fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully.There were the
forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains
of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,
their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and
yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain.Jennie noted
one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where
they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes
and began silently to cry."I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?"said

Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading."Come, come," he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her.You'll never get along if
you act that way."She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him
with strange sympathies."Don't cry," he continued soothingly; "everything will be all
right.Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her
eyes."You don't want to give way like that," he continued."It doesn't
do you any good.I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears
won't help it any.It isn't as if you were going away for good, you
know.You care for me, don't
you, sweet?"Yes," she said, and managed to smile back at him.Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking
of Vesta.It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret
from one who was already very dear to her.She knew that she ought to
tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful
necessity.Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it."I'll have to tell him something," she thought with a sudden
upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty."If I
don't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find
it out he would never forgive me.He might turn me out, and then where
would I go?She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror
sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving
soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and
comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an
avenging Nemesis.She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked
up."Well, have you washed all your sins away?"The touch of fact in it made it
slightly piquant.He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,
the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing
dwelling in her mind."I'll have to do it shortly," she thought, and
consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage
before long.Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important
question in Lester's mind as to where he should stop.New York was a
very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people
who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take
chances.Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more
exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and
they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,
so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same
world that she had inhabited before.Kane was no lover of vulgar
display.The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always
simple and elegant.He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought
for her with discrimination and care.And Jennie, a woman, took a keen
pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished
upon her.Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's
daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure
of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat
and upon her arms?Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes
at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?And Lester had promised
that her mother would share in it.Tears sprang to her eyes at the
thought.It was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to
make her look like some one truly worthy of im.He exercised his most
careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself.People turned
in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at
Jennie."A stunning woman that man has with him," was a frequent
comment.Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life
or her sense of perspective or proportion.She felt as though life
were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after
a time.There was no pretty vanity in her bosom.Lester realized this
as he watched her."You're a big woman, in your way," he said.Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to
now."He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his
family, should they chance to hear about it.If he should decide to
take a home in Chicago or St.Louis (there was such a thought running
in his mind) could he maintain it secretly?He was
half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as
to her future course of action."You ought to find some way of
introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father," he said.Then if you tell him you're going
to marry me he'll think nothing of it."Jennie thought of Vesta, and
trembled inwardly.But perhaps her father could be induced to remain
silent.Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the
clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them
home when she reached there."There won't be any trouble about this
other stuff," he said."I'll have it cared for until we make some
other arrangement."It was all very simple and easy; he was a master
strategist.Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.She had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs.In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her
mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some
one who liked her.She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and
her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his
peace.Jennie must be given an opportunity
to better herself.Of
course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs.Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order
that she might look for something better, something at which he could
make more money.CHAPTER XXIV


The problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself
comparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his
business duties.He was heartily interested in the immense plant,
which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its
conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as
to either his father or his brother.He liked to feel that he was a
vital part of this great and growing industry.When he saw freight
cars going by on the railroads labelled "The Kane Manufacturing
Company--Cincinnati" or chanced to notice displays of the
company's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the
different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction.It
was something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so
distinguished, so honestly worth while.This was all very well, but
now Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal
existence--in a word, there was Jennie.He was conscious as he
rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which
might involve disagreeable consequences.He was a little afraid of his
father's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.Robert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent
business man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private
life.Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,
he was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn
any trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,
recommended to his conscience.How he reasoned Lester did not
know--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which
could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow
his brother managed to do it."He's got a Scotch Presbyterian
conscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance."Lester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately
measured.Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his
positions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him.He
was in line with convention practically, and perhaps
sophisticatedly.The two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far
apart.Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not
trust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree
as to how life and its affairs should be conducted.Lester had a
secret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the
almighty dollar.Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were
reprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later.In the
business they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance
with the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain
minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the
wind blew.Lester was for building up trade through friendly
relationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors.Robert was
for pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and
offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.The old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these
troubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash.One or the other
would have to get out or perhaps both."If only you two boys could
agree!"Another thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on
the subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.Archibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to
get married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.All the other children, save Louise, were safely married.It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,
that he was sure of."The world expects it of a man in your position," his father had
argued from time to time."It makes for social solidity and prestige.You ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family.Where will you
be when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any
home?""Well, if the right woman came along," said Lester, "I suppose I'd
marry her."No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women.You
can surely find some one if you try.I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;
it can't come to any good.""There, father, let it go now.I'll come
around some time, no doubt.I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to
water."The old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore
point with him.He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of
affairs.The fact that such a situation as this might militate against any
permanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this
time.Of course he
would not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences.But he
must be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks.What a scandal if it were ever found out!Could he
install her in a nice home somewhere near the city?Could he take her along on his
numerous business journeys?This first one to New York had been
successful.He turned the question over in his
mind.Louis, or Pittsburg,
or Chicago would be best after all.He went to these places
frequently, and particularly to Chicago.He decided finally that it
should be Chicago if he could arrange it.He could always make excuses
to run up there, and it was only a night's ride.The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.After two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was
coming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would
be all right for him to call and see her.She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had
secured a position in a store at four dollars a week.He smiled as he
thought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed
to him."She's the best I've come across
yet."He ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her
place of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening.He
was anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over
with as quickly as possible.When he did call the shabbiness of the
house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but
somehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever.Gerhardt came in the
front-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands
with him, as did also Mrs.Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention
to them.The old German appeared to him to be merely
commonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common
capacities in his father's factory.After some desultory conversation
Lester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive.Jennie put
on her hat, and together they departed.As a matter of fact, they went
to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.When she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it
nothing amiss.CHAPTER XXV


A month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to
marry her.His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it
seemed natural enough.He did
not know just how this might be.Lester
seemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,
why not?If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,
why not a business man?"Has
she told him about Vesta?"Do you think he
wants her if he knows?That's what comes of such conduct in the first
place.Now she has to slip around like a thief.The child cannot even
have an honest name."Gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding.His life
seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well
enough to hunt up another job as watchman.He wanted to get out of
this mess of deception and dishonesty.A week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had
written her to join him in Chicago.He was not feeling well, and could
not come to Cleveland.The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie
was going away to be married to Mr.Gerhardt flared up at this,
and his suspicions were again aroused.But he could do nothing but
grumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he
was sure.When the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without
saying farewell to her father.He was out looking for work until late
in the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to
leave for the station."I will write a note to him when I get there,"
she said."Lester will take a
better house for us soon," she went on hopefully.The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and
the new one had begun.The curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's
generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the
children and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser.Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities
and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an
enlarged purse permitted.But, after Jennie had
been in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that
Lester wanted them to take a new home.This letter was shown to
Gerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene.He
frowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity.If he had
not married her why should he want to help them?Perhaps Jennie was
well married after all.Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high
station in life, and was now able to help the family.Gerhardt almost
concluded to forgive her everything once and for all.The end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie
returned to Cleveland to help her mother move.Together they searched
the streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one.A
house of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was
secured and suitably furnished.There were comfortable fittings for
the dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom
sets complete for each room.The kitchen was supplied with every
convenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts
had never enjoyed before.Altogether the house was attractive, though
plain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be
comfortable in it.When the time came for the actual moving Mrs.Gerhardt was fairly
beside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her
dreams?All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,
and now it had come.A new house, new furniture, plenty of
room--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of
it!Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and
bureaus and whatnots."Dear, dear, isn't this nice!"Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction
without emotion, but there were tears in her eyes.She was so glad for
her mother's sake.She could have kissed Lester's feet for his
goodness to her family.Gerhardt, Martha, and
Veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things.At the sight of the
large rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise
of a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture
standing about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of
delight.George rubbed his feet over
the new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture
critically.Gerhardt roved to and fro
like a person in a dream.She could not believe that these bright
bedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were
actually hers.Although he tried hard not to show it,
he, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment.The sight
of an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the
finishing touch.He looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new
carpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a
white cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the
bright, clean kitchen.We want to be careful now
not to break anything.It's so easy to scratch things up, and then
it's all over."CHAPTER XXVI


It would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that
followed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an
abject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,
based, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the
generosity (through her) of her distant husband.Lester was seen now
and then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes
coming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best
rooms of the second floor.There were hurried trips on her
part--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.One of his favorite pastimes was to engage
quarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt.Clemens,
Saratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy
the luxury of living with Jennie as his wife.There were other times
when he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing
her for a day.All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her
the real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see
how he could remedy it at this time.He was not sure as yet that he
really wanted to.The attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of
affairs was peculiar.At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it
seemed natural enough.No one had seen
her marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry
herself with the air of one who holds that relationship.Still, she
never went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his
relatives ever came near her.Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the
money which had first blinded them, was peculiar.He really did not
carry himself like a married man.There were
weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes.There
were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.Then there were the long periods in which she absented
herself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real
relationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.Bass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some
business judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was
suspicious.He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and
intuitively he felt that things were not right.George, nineteen, who
had gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking
forward to a career in that field, was also restless.Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were
William and Veronica.Each was offered an opportunity to study
indefinitely; but there was unrest with life.The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for
themselves.Gerhardt himself finally concluded
that there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this
situation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.He wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if
he could--but the worst had already been done.It depended on the
man now, he knew that.Things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval
would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its
fortuitous solutions.Although stout
and formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years
become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,
coupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it
had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to
culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning.She
became decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the
few tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it
was very hard for her to climb stairs."I'm not feeling well," she
said."I think I'm going to be sick."Jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by
watering-place, but Mrs."I don't think it would
do any good," she said.She sat about or went driving with her
daughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her."I don't like
to get sick in the fall," she said."The leaves coming down make me
think I am never going to get well."said Jennie; but she felt frightened,
nevertheless.How much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it
was feared the end was near.Bass, who had thought of getting married
and getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.Gerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant
of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster.Jennie, too
inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her
mother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her.Hoping in spite
of all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of
patience, waiting and serving.The end came one morning after a month of illness and several days
of unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all
the family went about on tiptoe.Gerhardt passed away with her
dying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of
consciousness that life vouchsafed her.Jennie stared into her eyes
with a yearning horror.Gerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down
by the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish.Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the
family.Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in
town for some time.Martha, whose views of life had broadened and
hardened, was anxious to get out also.She felt that a sort of stigma
attached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she
remained there.Martha looked to the public schools as a source of
income; she was going to be a teacher.Gerhardt alone scarcely knew
which way to turn.He was again at work as a night watchman.Jennie
found him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst
into tears herself.she pleaded, "it isn't as bad as
that.You will always have a home--you know that--as long as
I have anything.He really did not want to go with her."It
isn't that," he continued.It was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally
left, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,
Veronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child.Of course
Lester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had
never seen the little girl.During the short periods in which he
deigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.Gerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background.There
was a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and
concealment was easy.Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his
meals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of
the suite.He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of
the other members of the family.He was perfectly willing to shake
hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but
perfunctory words only.It was generally understood that the child
must not appear, and so it did not.There is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an
affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic.During that first year
in Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried
Vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks.When
she got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened
securely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she
was able to take a few steps of her own accord.When she actually
reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her
to the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly.By some strange
leading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on
conventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the
tendons of his heart.He loved this little outcast ardently,
hopefully.She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and
Gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education
in religious matters.Was it not he who had insisted that the infant
should be baptized?"Say 'Our Father,'" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he
had her alone with him."Ow Fowvaw," was her vowel-like interpretation of his words."'Ooh ah in aven,'" repeated the child.Gerhardt, overhearing
the little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels."Because I want she should learn the Christian faith," returned
Gerhardt determinedly.If she don't
begin now she never will know them."Many of her husband's religious
idiosyncrasies were amusing to her.At the same time she liked to see
this sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing.If
he were only not so hard, so narrow at times.He made himself a
torment to himself and to every one else.On the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to
take her for her first little journeys in the world."Come, now," he
would say, "we will go for a little walk."Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these
days Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete.Taking her by
the hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot
and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling
steps.One beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started
on one of their walks.Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;
the birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making
the best of their brief span of life.Sparrows chirped in the road;
robins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the
cottages.Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of
nature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond.exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,
flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby.Her hand
was up, and her eyes were wide open."Yes," said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly
discovered this marvelous creature."It is going to look for a worm now.We
will see if we cannot find its nest.I think I saw a nest in one of
these trees."He plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned
nest that he had observed on a former walk."Here it is," he said at
last, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten
remnant of a home was still clinging."Here, come now, see," and he
lifted the baby up at arm's length."See," said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his
free hand, "nest.repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of
her own."Yes," said Gerhardt, putting her down again."That was a wren's
nest.Still further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,
she wondering with the wide wonder of a child.When they had gone a
block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had
been reached.And so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,
intelligence, and vivacity.Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions
she asked, the puzzles she pronounced."What is it she doesn't want to know?From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her
down at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief
solace and comfort of his days.Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have
found his life hard indeed to bear.CHAPTER XXVII


For three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of
Jennie.Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church
and of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was
perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment.His interest
in the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he
had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which
had himself as the object.He looked on his father's business
organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get
control of it; but he saw no way of doing so.Robert's interests were
always in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther
apart than ever in their ideas and aims.Lester had thought once or
twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself
with another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could
conscientiously do this.Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand
a year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was
vice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside
investments.He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as
Robert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five
thousand, he had nothing.Robert, on the other hand, was
unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,
in addition to his future interest in the business, which both
brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.Robert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters
a sixth.It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,
seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.The old gentleman might do anything or
nothing.The probabilities were that he would be very fair and
liberal.At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the
game of life.There comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and
"takes stock" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with
his individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material.This
time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when
the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins
to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches
itself to everything.There is a deadening thought of uselessness
which creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been
best expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.he used to say to himself, "whether I live at the White House,
or here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?"But in the very question
was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had
failed to realize in his own career.The White House represented the
rise and success of a great public character.His home and the Grand
Pacific were what had come to him without effort.He decided for the time being--it was about the period of the
death of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to
rehabilitate himself.He would cut out idling--these numerous
trips with Jennie had cost him considerable time.If his brother could find avenues of financial
profit, so could he.He would endeavor to assert his
authority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the
business, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything.Should
he forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him.Somehow he did not see how it
could be done.It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked
to admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself.He liked
her--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way.He didn't see how he
could desert her very well.Just at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.His brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established
paint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially
for the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was
growing and had a promising future.Lester, knowing the members of the
Eastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations
with the house, was in opposition.His father at first seemed to agree
with Lester.But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical
way, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face."We
can't go on forever," he said, "standing by old friends, just because
father here has dealt with them, or you like them.The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more
and stronger competition.""It's just as father feels about it," said Lester at last."I have
no deep feeling in the matter.It won't hurt me one way or the other.You say the house is going to profit eventually.I've stated the
arguments on the other side.""I'm inclined to think Robert is right," said Archibald Kane
calmly."Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked
out.""Well, we won't have any more discussion about it
then," he said.He rose and strolled out of the office.The shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering
pulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably.It wasn't
much but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's
business acumen was even more irritating.He was beginning to wonder
whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution
of the property.Had he heard anything about his entanglement with
Jennie?Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?It did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with
either incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was
concerned.He was still the investigator of
propositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the
trusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being
worsted.He thought about this, but could reach no
conclusion.Later in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for
reorganization in the executive department of the business.He
proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage
warehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of
their completed stock there.Buyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily
reached and dealt with there.It would be a big advertisement for the
house, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity.Kane
senior and Lester immediately approved of this.Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the
construction of the new buildings.It would probably be advisable for
him to reside in Chicago a part of the time.The idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from
Cincinnati, largely if not entirely.It was dignified and not
unrepresentative of his standing in the company.He could live in
Chicago and he could have Jennie with him.The scheme he had for
taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty."I'm sure we'll get good results from this all
around," he said.As construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to
Chicago immediately.He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together
they selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite
of rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to
suit his taste.He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a
bachelor.He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.There were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and
the hotels.To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically
ideal.Of course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of
the Gerhardt family to a climax.Probably the home would be broken up,
but Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically.He was an old
man, and it did not matter much where he lived.Bass, Martha, and
George were already taking care of themselves.Veronica and William
were still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding
them with a neighbor.The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was
Vesta.It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the
child with her.he asked her, when the day of her
contemplated departure had been set."No; but I'm going to soon," she assured him."It's too bad," he went on.God will punish you,
I'm afraid.I'm getting old--otherwise
I would keep her.There is no one here all day now to look after her
right, as she should be.""I know," said Jennie weakly.I'm going
to have her live with me soon.I won't neglect her--you know
that.""But the child's name," he insisted.Soon
in another year she goes to school.People will want to know who she
is.Jennie understood well enough that it couldn't.The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant
separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's
very existence.It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did
not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise.Vesta had good
clothes, everything she needed.Jennie
hoped to give her a good education.If only she had told the truth to
Lester in the first place.Now it was almost too late, and yet she
felt that she had acted for the best.Finally she decided to find some
good woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a
consideration.In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she
came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she
required--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty.She was a widow,
doing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by
which she should give her whole time to Vesta.The latter was to go to
kindergarten when a suitable one should be found.She was to have toys
and kindly attention, and Mrs.Olsen was to inform Jennie of any
change in the child's health.Jennie proposed to call every day, and
she thought that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might
be brought to the apartment.She had had her with her at Cleveland,
and he had never found out anything.The arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first
opportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away.Gerhardt, who had been
brooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her
future."She should grow up to be a fine girl," he said."You should
give her a good education--she is so smart."He spoke of the
advisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but
Jennie was not so sure of that.Time and association with Lester had
led her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any
private institution.She had no particular objection to the church,
but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the
affairs of life.The next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.Vesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey.Gerhardt had
been wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of
dressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was
doing his best to control his feelings.He could see that the
five-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him.She was
happy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the
train."Be a good little girl," he said, lifting her up and kissing her."See that you study your catechism and say your prayers.And you won't
forget the grandpa--what?--" He tried to go on, but his
voice failed him.Jennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion."There," she said, "if I'd thought you were going to act like
that--" She stopped."Go," said Gerhardt, manfully, "go.And he
stood solemnly by as they went out of the door.Then he turned back to
his favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.One by one they were leaving him--Mrs.Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,
Jennie, Vesta.He clasped his hands together, after his old-time
fashion, and shook his head again and again.CHAPTER XXVIII


During the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been
associated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual
sympathy and understanding.Lester truly loved her in his own way.It
was a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly
on a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine
spiritual affinity.The yielding sweetness of her character both
attracted and held him.She was true, and good, and womanly to the
very center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon
her, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the
years.On her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love
this man.At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her
soul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,
she was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had
always liked him.Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him
better, by watching his moods, she had come to love him.He was so
big, so vocal, so handsome.His point of view and opinions of anything
and everything were so positive.His pet motto, "Hew to the line, let
the chips fall where they may," had clung in her brain as something
immensely characteristic.Apparently he was not afraid of
anything--God, man, or devil.He used to look at her, holding her
chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:
"You're sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance.And her eyes would meet his in dumb
appeal."Never mind," he would add, "you have other things."One of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in
which she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and
educational shortcomings.She could not write very well, and once he
found a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with
the meanings opposite.He smiled, but he liked her better for it.Louis he watched her
pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of
table manners was being observed by nearby diners.She could not
always be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking
dishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?"You're
hungry, aren't you?"I wouldn't bring you here if
they weren't.I'd tell
you quick enough when there was anything wrong."His brown eyes held a
friendly gleam."I do feel a little nervous at times," she
admitted.By degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and
customs of comfortable existence.All that the Gerhardt family had
ever had were the bare necessities of life.Now she was surrounded
with whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the
whole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it
did not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of
things.There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in
privilege and opportunity.She was grateful to Lester for all that he
had done and was doing for her.If only she could hold
him--always!The details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie
settled down into the routine of home life.Lester, busy about his
multitudinous affairs, was in and out.He had a suite of rooms
reserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the
exclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence.His
luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club.An
early patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,
so that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time.He was home two
or three nights a week, sometimes oftener.He insisted at first on
Jennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more
sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one
come in to do the cleaning.Her
natural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.Lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning.He
wanted dinner served nicely at seven.Silverware, cut glass, imported
china--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him.He kept
his trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.He was in the
habit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced
to run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss
Gerhardt.When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an
assumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind
using his own signature.Thus far there had been no difficulty or
unpleasantness of any kind.The trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with
the danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta
had entailed, as well as with Jennie's natural anxiety about her
father and the disorganized home.Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,
that she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed
in a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left
alone.He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands
and his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was
hurt to think of his being left alone.She knew
that he would not--feeling as he did at present.Would Lester
have him--she was not sure of that.If he came Vesta would have
to be accounted for.The situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated.Owing to
the feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie
was particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand
things to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.She daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs.Olsen, always taking with
her toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to
interest and please the child.She liked to sit with Vesta and tell
her stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.At last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester
was away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during
his several absences, to do this regularly.After that, as time went
on and she began to know his habits, she became more
bold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection
with Jennie.She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would
risk Vesta's presence on the assurance of even short
absences--two or three days.She even got into the habit of
keeping a few of Vesta's toys at the apartment, so that she could have
something to play with when she came.During these several visits from her child Jennie could not but
realize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife
and a happy mother.Vesta was a most observant little girl.She could
by her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger
of self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie's
heart.was one of her simplest and most
frequently repeated questions.Jennie would reply that mamma could not
have her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she
possibly could, Vesta should come to stay always."No, dearest, not just when.You won't mind waiting
a little while."Yes," replied Vesta; "but then she ain't got any nice things now.And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would
take Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of
playthings.Of course Lester was not in the least suspicious.His observation
of things relating to the home were rather casual.He went about his
work and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity
and good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was
anything underhanded in her actions.Once he did come home sick in the
afternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two
o'clock to five.He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,
but his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when
she found him there.She blanched at the thought of his suspecting
something, and explained as best she could.She had gone to see her
washerwoman.She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an
opportunity to serve him.It showed her what a mess she was likely to
make of it all.It happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence
Lester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during
this time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there
was the happiest goings on between the mother and child.Nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for
an oversight on Jennie's part, the far-reaching effects of which she
could only afterward regret.This was the leaving of a little toy lamb
under the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont
to lie and smoke.A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was
fastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was
shaken.Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had
deliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did
not notice at the time.When she gathered up the various playthings
after Vesta's departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it
rested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of
toyland, when Lester returned.That same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying
his cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully
lighted.Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he
leaned over and looked under the divan.The cigar was not in sight, so
he rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the
little lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it.He picked it
up, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.It must belong to some neighbor's child in whom Jennie had
taken an interest, he thought.He would have to go and tease her about
this.Accordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out
into the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he
exclaimed in a mock solemn voice, "Where did this come from?"Jennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this
evidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with
the idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just
wrath upon her.Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as
quickly left them.she stuttered, "it's a little toy I bought.""I see it is," he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping
his observation, but having at the same time no explicable
significance to him."It's frisking around a mighty lone
sheepfold."He touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,
unable to speak.It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.His manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.However, it was almost impossible for her to recover her
self-possession."You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.""I forgot to take it out from there, that was all," she went on
blindly."It looks as though it has been played with enough," he added more
seriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful
to her, he dropped it.The lamb had not furnished him the amusement
that he had expected.Lester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and
thought it over.What was there about a toy to
make her grow pale?Surely there was no harm in her harboring some
youngster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come
in and play.He thought it over, but
could come to no conclusion.Nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb.Time
might have wholly effaced the impression from Lester's memory had
nothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any
kind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon
its heels.One evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat
later than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the
kitchen, Lester went himself to open the door.He was greeted by a
middle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in
broken Swedish accents for Jennie."Wait a moment," said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he
called her.Jennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously
out in the hall and closed the door after her.The action instantly
struck Lester as suspicious.He frowned and determined to inquire
thoroughly into the matter.Her face
was white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to
seize upon.he inquired, the irritation he had felt the
moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness."I've got to go out for a little while," she at last managed to
reply."Very well," he assented unwillingly."But you can tell me what's
the trouble with you, can't you?"I--I," began Jennie, stammering."I--have--"

"Yes," he said grimly."I have to go on an errand," she stumbled on.I'll tell you when I come back, Lester.She looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by
preoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen
this look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and
irritated by it."That's all right," he said, "but what's the use of all this
secrecy?Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?What's the use of this whispering behind doors?He paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was
intensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as
the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an
emotional state never reached by her before."I will, Lester, I will," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I come back.She hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,
who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed
her stubbornly to the door."See here," he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, "you're not
acting right.He stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity
and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed.Jennie,
troubled and driven to bay, turned at last."It's my child, Lester," she exclaimed.I'll tell you everything when I
come back.""What the hell are you talking
about?""I couldn't help it," she returned."I was afraid--I should
have told you long ago.I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go
now, and I'll tell you all when I come back!"He stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to
force her any further for the present."Well, go ahead," he said
quietly."Don't you want some one to go along with you?"She hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.Could this be the woman he had thought he knew?Why, she had been
deceiving him for years.He choked a little as he muttered:

"Well, I'll be damned!"CHAPTER XXIX


The reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of
those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can
predict two hours beforehand.Vesta had been seriously taken with
membranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since
had been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened
to death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta
was very ill and Mrs.This message,
delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object
was to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie
and caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner
described.Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach
her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from
her, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears.What if it should
already be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should
be no more.Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street
lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of
Lester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her
alone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered
only the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that
she was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps
but for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well
to-night."If I can only get there," she kept saying to herself; and then,
with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the
instinct-driven mother: "I might have known that God would punish me
for my unnatural conduct.I might have known--I might have
known."When she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and
into the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but
considerably better.Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged
physician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as
she dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.She had sinned, and sinned
grievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far
as possible.Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer
attempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt
an agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the
one right thing.Vesta must not be an outcast any longer.Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.Sitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie
realized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it
had created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with
Lester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what
end?She sat there and
meditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted
down, and then went soundly to sleep.Lester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this
discovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions."Who was
the father of the child?How did it chance to be in
Chicago, and who was taking care of it?"He could ask, but he could
not answer; he knew absolutely nothing.Curiously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at
Mrs.What was it about her then that
had attracted him?What made him think, after a few hours'
observation, that he could seduce her to do his will?What was
it--moral looseness, or weakness, or what?There must have been
art in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in
deceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than
practise deception--she had been ungrateful.Now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to
Lester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,
and to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very
disturbing.It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way
before--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw
strong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling
toward her.How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?Had he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended
her?He moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace
slowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the
full his power of decision.She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt
able to condemn.The original concealment was evil; the continued
deception more.Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all
had been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which
no man in his position could contemplate with serenity.He moved
irritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and
walked to and fro across the floor.That a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged
by Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was
due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the
yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable
perversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of
keeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed.Lester,
aside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in
the balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal
herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the
fact that she had not done so was a grief to him.He had asked her
once tentatively about her past.That
was the time she should have spoken of any child.His first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk
out and leave her.At the same time he was curious to hear the end of
this business.He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,
stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink.He took a car
and went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and
chatting with several people whom he encountered.He was restless and
irritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab
and returned to his apartment.The distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last
made to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.There was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims
of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the
promise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the
very end.It was just
probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before
breaking with her entirely.Although anguished and frightened by the
certainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless
felt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for
all her misdoings.When Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall
light was already out.She first tried the door, and then inserted her
key.No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in
the expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her.The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his
part.She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she
came instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken
her--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.At this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs.He came in with
his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy
eyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck.He
took off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.Then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also.When he
was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide
eyes."I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end," he
began.Jennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap
in the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:

"It's Senator Brander's."echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but
still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in
his ears."We used to do his washing for him," she rejoined simply--"my
mother and I."Lester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her
sobering even his rancorous mood."Senator Brander's child," he
thought to himself.So that great representative of the interests of
the common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed
washerwoman's daughter.A fine tragedy of low life all this was.he demanded, his face the picture of a
darkling mood."It's been nearly six years now," she returned.He calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and
then continued:

"How old is the child?"The need for serious thought made his tone
more peremptory but less bitter."Where have you been keeping her all this time?""She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring."Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?""Yes," said Jennie; "but I didn't let her come out anywhere where
you could see her.""I thought you said you told your people that you were married," he
exclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family
could have been adjusted."I did," she replied, "but I didn't want to tell you about her."I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,
Lester.I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it.I was
ashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was
afraid."He stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the
suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.After all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of
circumstance and cowardice of morals.What queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a
combination of affairs!"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?""Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her
that way.Why didn't you tell me in the first place?I wouldn't have
thought anything of it then."She stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of
his attitude puzzling even herself.She did try to explain them after
a time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along
without any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest
that, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might
have pitied her.As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was
hanging over him, and he finally returned to that."You say your mother used to do washing for him.How did you come
to get in with him?"Jennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,
winced at this.He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far
the most distressing memory of her life.What he had just asked seemed
to be a demand upon her to make everything clear."I was so young, Lester," she pleaded.I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get
his laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again."She paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to
hear the whole story, she continued: "We were so poor.He used to give
me money to give to my mother.She paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it
would be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his
questioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.He had written to her, but before
he could come to her he died.It was followed by a period of five
minutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the
mantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what
would follow--not wishing to make a single plea.Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.He was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.Jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar.He, the righteous,
the moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat.Now to
sentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should
pursue.It was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of
his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.This child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon
the whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak.He
turned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the
mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,
uncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while."Better go to bed," he said at last, and fell again to pondering
this difficult problem.But Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to
hear at any moment his decision as to her fate.After a long time of musing he turned and went to the
clothes-rack near the door."Better go to bed," he said, indifferently.She turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there
was some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.He went out, vouchsafing no further speech.She looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she
felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell.She stood there a dissonance of
despair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the
agony of her suppressed hopelessness.In the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,
her state far too urgent for idle tears.CHAPTER XXX


The sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his
future course of action as he appeared to be.Stern as was his mood,
he did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.And yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably.He did
not like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking
about in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he
admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story
out of her if he had gone about it in earnest.She would not have
lied, he knew that.At the very outset he might have demanded the
history of her past.He had not done so; well, now it was too late.The one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to
ever think of marrying her.It couldn't be done, not by a man in his
position.The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable
provision for Jennie and then leave her.He went to his hotel with his
mind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do
it at once.It is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this
kind, quite another to act.Our comforts, appetites and passions grow
with usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with
him.Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much
about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or
quickly.He could think of it bustling
about the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when
night came it was a different matter.He could be lonely, too, he
discovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.One of the things that interested him in this situation was
Jennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her
in this new relationship would injure the child.Just how did she come
by that feeling, he wanted to know?His place in the world was better
than hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have
been something in her point of view.She did not know who he was or
what he would do with her.Being
uncertain, she wished to protect her baby.Then
again, he was curious to know what the child was like.The daughter of
a man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant.He was a
brilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman.He thought of this,
and, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity.He ought to go
back and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of
it--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the
beginning.It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he
was parleying with himself.These years of living with Jennie
had made him curiously dependent upon her.Who had ever been so close
to him before?His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had
not so much to do with real love as with ambition.His
father--well, his father was a man, like himself.All of his
sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he
were temperamentally uncongenial.With Jennie he had really been
happy, he had truly lived.She was necessary to him; the longer he
stayed away from her the more he wanted her.He finally decided to
have a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of
understanding.She ought to get the child and take care of it.She
must understand that he might eventually want to quit.She ought to be
made to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no
immediate break might occur.That same evening he went out to the
apartment.Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.Then she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him."There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,"
began Lester, with characteristic directness."Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.There's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.""I will, Lester," said Jennie submissively."Very well, then, you'd better do it at once."He took an evening
newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front
windows; then he turned to her."You and I might as well understand
each other, Jennie," he went on."I can see how this thing came about.It was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,
and made you tell me.It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you
didn't want the child's life mixed with mine.You might have known
that it couldn't be done.That's neither here nor there, though, now.The thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a
relationship such as ours without confidence.You and I had that, I
thought.I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative
relationship with you on this basis."Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty.For my part I don't see
why things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the
present--but I want you to look the facts in the face.""I know, Lester," she said, "I know."There were some trees in the
yard, where the darkness was settling.He wondered how this would
really come out, for he liked a home atmosphere.Should he leave the
apartment and go to his club?"You'd better get the dinner," he suggested, after a time, turning
toward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked.It
was a shame that life could not be more decently organized.He
strolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties.She was
thinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his
final decision never to marry her.So that was how one dream had been
wrecked by folly.She spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his
favorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and
washed some lettuce-leaves for a salad.She had been a diligent
student of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal
from her mother.All the time she was wondering how the situation
would work out.He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.He would go away and marry some one else."Oh, well," she thought finally, "he is not going to leave me right
away--that is something.She sighed
as she carried the things to the table.If life would only give her
Lester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.CHAPTER XXXI


There was peace and quiet for some time after this storm.Jennie
went the next day and brought Vesta away with her.The joy of the
reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries."Now
I can do by her as I ought," she thought; and three or four times
during the day she found herself humming a little song.He was trying to make
himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his
life--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had
suggested.He did not like the idea of a child being in this
apartment--particularly that particular child.He fought his way
through a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to
the apartment more regularly.In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a
place of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.During the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for
Jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost
uncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,
commercial-minded man.Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first
night Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a
very bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't
go near him."You mustn't talk," she said.Let mamma ask you what you want.Vesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the
full significance of the warning.Jennie, who had taken great pains to array
Vesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give
her own toilet a last touch.As a
matter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the
sitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen.Lester hung up his
hat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse.The child
looked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance.She was arrayed
in a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and
cuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes.Her
corn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face.Blue eyes, rosy lips,
rosy cheeks completed the picture.Lester stared, almost inclined to
say something, but restrained himself.When Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had
arrived."Rather sweet-looking child," he said."Do you have much
trouble in making her mind?"Jennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of
their conversation.Didn't I tell you you mustn't
talk?"What might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,
peevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured.Had Jennie been
less tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a
disagreeable impression.As it was, the natural beauty of the child,
combined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the
background, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and
youth which is always pleasant.The thought struck him that Jennie had
been the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated
from it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its
existence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great."It's
queer," he said.One morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when
he thought he heard something stir.He turned, and was surprised to
see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring
door--the effect was most disconcerting.It was not like the
ordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have
been immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate
boldness.He turned his paper solemnly and looked again.He crossed his
legs and looked again.This little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with
the saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially
responsive.Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude
of aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by
the mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a
desire to turn up.He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by
his paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind.The
young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon
him.Not long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,
calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused
by another visitation--this time not quite so simple.Jennie had
given Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until
Lester should leave the house.Jennie was seated at the table, pouring
out the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in
manner, and marched through the room.Lester looked up, and Jennie
colored and arose.By this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a
little broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her
face."I want my little broom," she exclaimed and marched sedately past,
at which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,
this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across
his mouth.The final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down
the feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in
its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a
human being.The developments of the next six months were of a kind to further
relax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.Although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in
which he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could
not persuade himself to give it up.It was too much like a bed of
down.The condition of unquestioned
liberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,
coupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the
home was too inviting.He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps
it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.During this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta
insensibly strengthened.He discovered that there was a real flavor of
humor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.She was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie
watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,
nevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and
came straight home with her remarks.Once, for example, she was sawing
away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,
when Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a
little breakfast set.Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,
reached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained
a desire to laugh.Another morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the
lumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, "I want two
lumps in mine, mamma.""No, dearest," replied Jennie, "you don't need any in yours."Uncle Lester has two," she protested."Yes," returned Jennie; "but you're only a little girl.Besides you
mustn't say anything like that at the table."Uncle Lester eats too much sugar," was her immediate rejoinder, at
which that fine gourmet smiled broadly."I don't know about that," he put in, for the first time deigning
to answer her directly."That sounds like the fox and grapes to me."Vesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she
chattered on unrestrainedly.One thing led to another, and at last
Lester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he
was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his
position and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,
that he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement
which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which
was back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.CHAPTER XXXII


The following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,
and Lester removed his office to the new building.Heretofore, he had
been transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the
club.From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in
Chicago--as if that was to be his future home.A large number of
details were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable
office force, and the handling of various important transactions.It
took away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's
husband, under the direction of Robert.The latter was doing his best
to push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was
bringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of
the factory.Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in
danger of elimination.But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane
senior was inclined to give Robert a free hand.He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take
charge.Apparently he and Robert were on
better terms than ever before.Matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact
that Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be
permanently kept under cover.At times he was seen driving with her by
people who knew him in a social and commercial way.He was for
brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at
liberty to associate with anybody he pleased.Jennie might be any
young woman of good family in whom he was interested.He did not
propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always
made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others
might not attempt to detain and talk to him.At the theater, as has
been said, she was simply "Miss Gerhardt."The trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers
of life.They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct.Only he
had been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.She must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly.Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling.Rumors came
to Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel.If Lester wanted to do
this sort of thing, well and good.But there must come a time when
there would be a show-down.This came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester
and Jennie had been living in the north side apartment.It so happened
that, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was
seized with a mild form of grip.When he felt the first symptoms he
thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,
and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of
quinine.But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning
he was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting
headache.His long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.Policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel
and endure his sickness alone.As a matter of fact, he was very glad
to be in the house with her.He had to call up the office to say that
he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he
yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.Jennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or
well.She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe.She
brought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in
cold water over and over.Later, when he was recovering, she made him
appetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.It was during this illness that the first real contretemps
occurred.Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.Paul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on
her way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally
planned.While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in
Chicago.Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and
would not be down for several days, she asked where he could be
reached."I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific," said an
incautious secretary.Louise, a little
disturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr.Kane
had not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of
fact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week.Piqued by
this, she telephoned his club.It so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had
called up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself.He had
not been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,
it had never been asked for by any one else.When Louise stated that
she was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,
"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.""Whose address is that you're giving?""Well, don't be giving out addresses.The boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was
gone.About an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her
brother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place.Ascending the
steps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of
Kane on the door leading to the second floor.Ringing the bell, she
was opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably
attired a young woman.Kane's apartment, I believe," began Louise,
condescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie.She
was a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were
as yet only vaguely aroused.Jennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried
to make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and
station, swept past before Jennie could say a word.Once inside Louise
looked about her inquiringly.She found herself in the sitting-room,
which gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying.Vesta happened to
be playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the
new-comer.The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,
a window to the left of him, his eyes closed."Oh, there you are, old fellow!"Lester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized
in an instant how things were.He pulled himself up on one elbow, but
words failed him."Why, hello, Louise," he finally forced himself to say.I came back sooner than I thought," she answered lamely,
a sense of something wrong irritating her."I had a hard time finding
you, too.Who's your--" she was about to say "pretty
housekeeper," but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain
articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.His sister swept the place with an observing eye.It took in the
home atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive.There was a
dress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which
caused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily.She looked at her brother,
who had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed
slightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant."You shouldn't have come out here," said Lester finally, before
Louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind."You're my brother, aren't you?Why should you have any place that I
couldn't come.Well, I like that--and from you to me.""Listen, Louise," went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one
elbow."You know as much about life as I do.There is no need of our
getting into an argument.I didn't know you were coming, or I would
have made other arrangements.""Other arrangements, indeed," she sneered.She was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this
trap; it was really disgraceful of Lester."I wouldn't be so haughty about it," he declared, his color rising."I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct.I'm saying I would have
made other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging
your pardon.If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.""I thought
better of you, honestly I did.John went back to the bathroom.I should think you would be ashamed of
yourself living here in open--" she paused without using the
word--"and our friends scattered all over the city.I thought you had more sense of decency and
consideration.""I tell you I'm not apologizing to
you.If you don't like this you know what you can do."she demanded, savagely and yet
curiously.If it were it wouldn't make any
difference.I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs."Jennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the
sitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself.I won't any more," retorted Louise."I
should think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything
like this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you.Why, I
thought she was--" she was again going to add "your housekeeper,"
but she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of
brutality."Never mind what you thought she was," he growled."She's better
than some who do the so-called superior thinking.It's neither here nor there, I tell you.I'm doing this, and I
don't care what you think."Well, I won't, I assure you," she flung back."It's quite plain
that your family means nothing to you.But if you had any sense of
decency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into
coming into a place like this.I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will
the others be when they hear of it."She turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look
being reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door
of the dining-room.Jennie came in a little
while later and closed the door.Lester,
his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily
on his pillow."What a devilish trick of fortune," he thought.Now she
would go home and tell it to the family.His father would know, and
his mother.Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear.He would have no
explanation to make--she had seen.Meanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for
reflection.So this was her real position in another woman's eyes.Now
she could see what the world thought.This family was as aloof from
her as if it lived on another planet.To his sisters and brothers, his
father and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him
socially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the
streets.And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes
of the world.It cut her as nothing before had ever done.The thought
tore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities.She was really low
and vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,
basically so in Lester's eyes.She went
about numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it
all.Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the
world, to live honorably, to be decent.How could that possibly be
brought about?CHAPTER XXXIII


Outraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to
Cincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished
with many details.According to her, she was met at the door by a
"silly-looking, white-faced woman," who did not even offer to invite
her in when she announced her name, but stood there "looking just as
guilty as a person possibly could."Lester also had acted shamefully,
having outbrazened the matter to her face.When she had demanded to
know whose the child was he had refused to tell her."It isn't mine,"
was all he would say.Kane, who was the first to hear
the story.exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the
words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality."I went there solely because I thought I could help him," continued
Louise."I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be
seriously ill."To think he would come to
anything like that!"Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having
no previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old
Archibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the
discussion with a solemn countenance.So Lester was living openly with
a woman of whom they had never heard.He would probably be as defiant
and indifferent as his nature was strong.The standpoint of parental
authority was impossible.Lester was a centralized authority in
himself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,
they would have to be very diplomatically executed.Archibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but
determined that something ought to be done.He held a consultation
with Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from
time to time, but had not wanted to say anything.Kane suggested
that Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester."He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him
irreparable damage," said Mr."He cannot hope to carry it off
successfully.He ought to marry her or he ought to quit.I
want you to tell him that for me.""All well and good," said Robert, "but who's going to convince him?I'm sure I don't want the job.""I hope to," said old Archibald, "eventually; but you'd better go
up and try, anyhow."I don't believe it," replied Robert.You see
how much good talk does down here.Still, I'll go if it will relieve
your feelings any."Yes, yes," said his father distractedly, "better go."Without allowing himself to anticipate any
particular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly
into Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of
morality and justice on his side.Upon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,
he called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there.He then
telephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment.Lester was
still indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he
did.He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they
talked business for a time."Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here," began Robert
tentatively."I think I could make a guess at it," Lester replied."They were all very much worried over the fact that you were
sick--mother particularly.You're not in any danger of having a
relapse, are you?""Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage
she ran into up here."The young woman Louise saw is just--" Robert waved his hand
expressively."I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester.I'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come.Mother
was so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for
her sake"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and
respect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some
explanation due."I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much," he
replied thoughtfully.I have the
woman and the family has its objections.The chief difficulty about
the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out."He stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly
reasoning in his mind.He seemed, as
usual, to be most convincingly sane."You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?""I hadn't come to that," answered Lester coolly.They looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert
turned his glance to the distant scene of the city."It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I
suppose," ventured Robert."I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus
with you or not," returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor."I have
never experienced the sensation myself.All I know is that the lady is
very pleasing to me.""Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,
Lester," went on Robert, after another pause."Morality doesn't seem
to figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that
together.Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.But the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be
substantial enough ground to base a plea on.The family's feelings and
pride are also fairly important.Father's the kind of a man who sets
more store by the honor of his family than most men.You know that as
well as I do, of course.""I know how father feels about it," returned Lester."The whole
business is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I
don't see just what's to be done about it.These matters aren't always
of a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day.To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here.While I'm
not willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs
than appears on the court calendar.""Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,"
returned Robert, "and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a
bit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend
to marry her?"This last was put forth as a feeler."I might be willing to agree to that, too," was Lester's baffling
reply, "if anything were to be gained by it.The point is, the woman
is here, and the family is in possession of the fact.Now if there is
anything to be done I have to do it.There isn't anybody else who can
act for me in this matter."Lester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,
coming back after a time to say: "You say you haven't any idea of
marrying her--or rather you haven't come to it.It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,
from every point of view.I don't want to orate, but a man of your
position has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it.Aside from
family considerations, you have too much at stake.You'd be simply
throwing your life away--"

He paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was
customary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor
and simplicity of this appeal.He
was making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.The appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began
on a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester
and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some
well-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at
least worthy of his station.Kane felt the same way; surely
Lester must realize that."I know just how all of them feel about it," Lester interrupted at
last, "but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.""You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give
her up just at present?""I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm
morally under obligations to do the best I can by her.What that may
be, I can't tell.""Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been
accustomed to live with me," replied Lester.Robert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal
futile."Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable
arrangements with her and let her go?""Not without due consideration of the matter; no.""You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will
end quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for
softening down the pain of it to the family?""I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away
the edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and
I can't see any room for equivocation between you and me.As I've said
before, these relationships are involved with things which make it
impossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman.No
one can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in
them, and even they can't always see.I'd be a damned dog to stand up
here and give you my word to do anything except the best I can."Lester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only
to come back after a time and say, "You don't think there's anything
to be done just at present?""Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going.I don't know
that there's anything else we can talk about.""Won't you stay and take lunch with me?I think I might manage to
get down to the hotel if you'll stay.""I believe I can make that one
o'clock train for Cincinnati.They stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,
Robert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the
difference time had already made.Robert was the clean, decisive man,
Lester the man of doubts.Robert was the spirit of business energy and
integrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,
looking at life with an uncertain eye.Together they made a striking
picture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were
now running through their minds."Well," said the older brother, after a time, "I don't suppose
there is anything more I can say.I had hoped to make you feel just as
we do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of
this.If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you.It
strikes me as a very bad move on your part though."He said nothing, but his face expressed an
unchanged purpose.Robert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door
together."I'll put the best face I can on it," said Robert, and walked
out.CHAPTER XXXIV


In this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be
limited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to
the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about
the sun.A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the
seas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of
the fishes without paying for it dearly.From the parasites of the
flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the
circumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in
which life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note
the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on
their part to depart from their environment.In the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of
limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed.The laws
governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit
of a clear generalization.Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments
of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being
intangible.When men or women err--that is, pass out from the
sphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the
bird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the
haunts of man.People may do
no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh
sarcastically, lift up their hands in protest.And yet so well defined
is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is
doomed.Born and bred in this environment, the individual is
practically unfitted for any other state.He is like a bird accustomed
to a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably
at either higher or lower level.Lester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother
had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city.Yonder
was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,
hope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a
wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his
prospects and purposes dissipated.Could he continue as cheerily in
the paths he had hitherto pursued?Would not his relations with Jennie
be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition?Was not his
own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going
relationship was concerned?All the atmosphere of unstained affection
would be gone out of it now.That hearty look of approval which used
to dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?Robert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part
of his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of
Louise."It's unfortunate," was all that he thought to himself, and
therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the
consideration of what, if anything, was to be done."I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt.Clemens to-morrow, or
Thursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough," he said to Jennie after he
had returned."I'm not feeling as well as I might.He wanted to get off by himself and think.Jennie packed his
bag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a
sullen, meditative mood.During the week that followed he had ample time to think it all
over, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of
making a decisive move at present.A few weeks more, one way or the
other, could not make any practical difference.Neither Robert nor any
other member of the family was at all likely to seek another
conference with him.His business relations would necessarily go on as
usual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;
certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted.But the
consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed
upon him."Bad business," he meditated--"bad business."For the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs
continued.Lester did not go home for six months; then an important
business conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it
off quite as though nothing important had happened.His mother kissed
him affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his
customary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
concertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore
the one real issue.But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it
persisted.Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far
between as he could possibly make them.CHAPTER XXXV


In the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her
own.For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,
which had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought
of her.She had yielded on two
occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought
out differently.If she did not
always have this haunting sense of fear!If she could only make up her
mind to do the right thing!She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for
him.Probably her father would live with her if she went back to
Cleveland.He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand.Yet
the thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had
been so good.As for her father, she was not sure whether he would
receive her or not.After the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a
little money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.Lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly
fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they
had lived on before, without any help from the outside.She spent
twenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of
everything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not.The
rent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.Lester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone.She
thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.Better go without taking anything, if she were going, was the
thought that came to her.She thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,
trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.Lester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that
he himself might wish it.Since the
scene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little
different.If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied
with the way she was living, and then leave.But he himself had
plainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on
that score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the
presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever
marrying her.It was her presence he wanted on another basis.And he
was so forceful, she could not argue with him very well.She decided
if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why.Then
maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing
more about it.The condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving.Since
Jennie had left Martha had married.After several years of teaching in
the public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and
they were united after a short engagement.Martha had been always a
little ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she
was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible.She barely
notified the members of the family of the approaching
marriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she
invited only Bass and George.Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented
the slight.She hoped that life would give her an
opportunity to pay her sister off.William, of course, did not mind
particularly.He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an
electrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had
pointed out to him as being attractive and promising.Jennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note
from Veronica giving her the main details.She was glad from one point
of view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away
from her.A little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to
reside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of
Gerhardt himself.Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the
other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from
which he was not easily aroused.Life, it seemed, was drawing to a
close for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age.The
earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever.He saw
Sebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring
him, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have
taken a dollar from Jennie.They
objected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to
live on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being
come by honestly.He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true
relations of Jennie and Lester.At first he had believed them to be
married, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the
humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of
telling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same
thing.Gerhardt had never had sight
of her marriage certificate.Since she was away she might have been
married, but he did not believe it.The real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and
crotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live
with him.They resented the way in which
he took charge of the expenditures after Martha left.He accused them
of spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a
smaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of
the money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.As a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order
to repay Jennie eventually.He thought it was sinful to go on in this
way, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to
redeem himself.If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt
that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity
from one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not
leading a righteous life.It ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his
complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get
something to do.Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited
them to take the furniture and go their way.His generosity shamed
them for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and
live with them, but this he would not do.He would ask the foreman of
the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some
out-of-the-way garret.And this would
save him a little money.So in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle
of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely
trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.He had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from
the tear and grind of the factory proper.In the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the
business center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.As a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.He would even talk to himself a little--an occasional "By chops!"or "So it is" being indicative of his dreary mood.At dusk he would
return, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of
duty.His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,
such as he felt he must have.The nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a
peculiarly subtle and somber character.What did it all come to after the struggle, and the
worry, and the grieving?People die; you hear
nothing more from them.Yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions.He
believed there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.He believed that both had
sinned woefully.He believed that the just would be rewarded in
heaven.Sebastian
was a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his
father.Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.Somehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered.Bass
walked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.Martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on.George had
contributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.Veronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so
long as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right.His
very existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his
children?Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain.Still he
did not want to go and live with any of his children.Actually they
were not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good.This woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for
some time.She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her
leaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt.After
Veronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no
need of sending any more money.Veronica and William were going to
live with George.He himself had a good place in a factory, and would
live there a little while.He returned her a moderate sum that he had
saved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that
he would not need it.Jennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was
not sure but what it might be all right--her father was so
determined.But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must
mean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,
hesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,
whether she left him or not.Yet if she did not get some work which paid well
they would have a difficult time.If she could get five
or six dollars a week they could live.This hundred and fifteen
dollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst
difficulties perhaps.CHAPTER XXXVI


The trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take
into consideration Lester's attitude.He did care for her in an
elemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the
conventional world in which he had been reared.To say that he loved
her well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her
anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he
had chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too
far, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this
particular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.Lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of
womanhood were fixed and not subject to change.Thus far, on his own
plane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one
who appealed to him as did Jennie.She was gentle, intelligent,
gracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the
little customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a
companion as he cared to have.He was comfortable, he was
satisfied--why seek further?But Jennie's restlessness increased day by day.She tried writing
out her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally
worded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.It was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:

"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you
not to think harshly of me until you have read it all.I am taking
Vesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.You know when you met me we were very poor,
and my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever
want me.When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly
able to think just what I ought to do.You made me love you, Lester,
in spite of myself."You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more
and that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't
think just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from
you.Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in
the house to eat.My brother George
didn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried.I have often
thought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she
might be alive to-day.I thought if you liked me and I really liked
you--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much
difference about me.You know you told me right away you would like to
help my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to
do."Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,
but if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive
me.Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do.But for months past--ever
since your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I
oughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is.It
was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but
I was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing.It was
wrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I
thought I was doing right when I did it.It was terribly wrong of me
to keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of
you then--afraid of what you would say and do.When your sister
Louise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never
been able to think right about it since.It can't be right, Lester,
but I don't blame you."I don't ask you to marry me, Lester.I know how you feel about me
and how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be
right.They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I
should ask you.At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living
this way.Vesta is getting along where she understands everything.She
thinks you are her really truly uncle.I have thought of it all so
much.I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you
about it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem
to be able to say what I want to.So I thought if I could just write
you this and then go you would understand.I know it's for the best for you and for
me.Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't
think of me any more.But I love you--oh yes, I
do--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for
me.I wish you all the luck that can come to you."P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa.It's best that you
shouldn't."She put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in
her bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could
conveniently take her departure.It was several days before she could bring herself to the actual
execution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned
that he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary
garments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an
expressman.She thought of telegraphing her father that she was
coming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as
well to go and find him.George and Veronica had not taken all the
furniture.The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t
had written.She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.She was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door
opened and in walked Lester.For some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind.He was not in
the least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings
had served him a peculiar turn.He had thought of going for a day's
duck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of
Chicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out
to the house early.As he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home
so early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle
of the room he stood dumfounded.What did it mean--Jennie dressed
and ready to depart?He stared in
amazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry."Why--why--" she began, falling back."I thought I would go to Cleveland," she replied."Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't
think I ought to stay here any longer this way.I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't."What the deuce are you talking about?"There," she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table
where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book."And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a
letter?"said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke."I
swear to heaven you are beyond me.He tore open the
envelope and looked at the beginning."Better send Vesta from the
room," he suggested.Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,
looking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him.He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the
paper on the floor."Well, I'll tell you, Jennie," he said finally, looking at her
curiously and wondering just what he was going to say.Here again was
his chance to end this relationship if he wished.He couldn't feel
that he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running.They
had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now.He truly
loved her--there was no doubt of that.Still he did not want to
marry her--could not very well."You have this thing wrong," he went on slowly."I don't know
what comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.I've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.There are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know
anything about.But my family has to be
taken into consideration, and the business.You can't see the
difficulties raised on these scores, but I can.Now I don't want you
to leave me.I can't prevent you, of
course.But I don't think you ought to want
to.Jennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,
was now thoroughly nonplussed.To have him begin a quiet
argument--a plea as it were.He, Lester, pleading
with her, and she loved him so.She went over to him, and he took her hand."There's really nothing to be gained by
your leaving me at present."Well, how did you expect to get along?""I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone
now--and get something to do, maybe.""Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have
done?You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you?"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper," she suggested.She had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most
promising idea that had occurred to her."No, no," he grumbled, shaking his head.There's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion.Why, you
won't be any better off morally than you are right now.It doesn't make any difference, anyhow.I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and
I don't want to promise anything.You're not going to leave me though
with my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping
back into any such thing as you're contemplating.I'll make some
provision for you.You don't really want to leave me, do you,
Jennie?"Against Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's
own conclusions and decisions went to pieces.Just the pressure of his
hand was enough to upset her."Don't cry, Jennie," he said."This thing may work out better than
you think.You're not
going to leave me any more, are you?""Let things rest as they are," he went on.I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily
wouldn't stand for."He finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly
through her tears."Now you put those things away," he said genially, pointing to the
trunks."Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.""No more concealment of anything, do you hear?No more thinking
things out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about
it.If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.I'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any
concealment between us.""I know, Lester," she said earnestly, looking him straight in the
eyes."I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I
won't.I've been afraid, but I won't be now."That sounds like what you ought to be," he replied.A few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future
of Gerhardt came up for discussion.Jennie had been worrying about him
for several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to
talk over with Lester.Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner
what had happened in Cleveland."I know he is very unhappy there all
alone," she said, "and I hate to think of it.I was going to get him
if I went back to Cleveland.Now I don't know what to do about
it.""Why don't you send him some money?""He won't take any more money from me, Lester," she explained."He
thinks I'm not good--not acting right."He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?""I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory.He's so old and
lonely.""What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland?Won't
they do anything for him?"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross," she said
simply."I hardly know what to suggest in that case," smiled Lester."The
old gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.""I know," she said, "but he's old now, and he has had so much
trouble."Lester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork."I'll tell you
what I've been thinking, Jennie," he said finally."There's no use
living this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out.I've been
thinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park.It's something
of a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.You and Vesta would be better off for a yard.In that case you might
bring your father on to live with us.He couldn't do any harm
pottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.""Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come," she replied."He
loves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the
furnace.But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.""I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the
old gentleman a marriage certificate.He seems to want something that
can't be produced very well.A steady job he'd have running the
furnace of a country house," he added meditatively.Jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest.She was too busy
thinking what a tangle she had made of her life.Gerhardt would not
come now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him.And yet he
ought to be with Vesta again.She remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the
drift of her thoughts, said: "I don't see how it can be arranged.Marriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable.It's bad
business--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe.I wouldn't
want to be mixed up in that sort of thing.""Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester.I'm just
sorry papa is so stubborn.When he gets a notion you can't change
him.""Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving," he suggested."Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally.It was
so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her
scheme.While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to
Lester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big
place, why not?CHAPTER XXXVII


The plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.After several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,
Lester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a
house.On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit
admirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn
fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been
planted when the city was young.It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.Jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although
depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home
under the right auspices.She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go
away she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have
come after her and married her.She had
promised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it.She
suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but
he waved that aside."We will very likely have people in now and
then," he said."We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks."He had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for
renewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment
in order.The house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and
everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.There was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big
dining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,
serving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a
comfortable home.On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the
maid's room.It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie
took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.Immediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,
wrote to her father asking him to come to her.She did not say that
she was married, but left it to be inferred.She descanted on the
beauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold
conveniences of the establishment."It is so very nice," she added,
"you would like it, papa.Vesta is here and goes to school every day.Won't you come and stay with us?It's so much better than living in a
factory.Gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really
true?Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently
united?Well, it was high time--but should he go?He had lived
alone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with
Jennie?Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.That would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there
had been fault on his side as well as on hers.Jennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal.She talked it over
with Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see
him.Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great
rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,
and inquired at the office for her father.The clerk directed her to a
distant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see
him.He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who
it could be.When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair
gray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense
of the pathetic moved her again.He came
toward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his
consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit."I want you to come home with me, papa," she pleaded yearningly."I
don't want you to stay here any more.I can't think of you living
alone any longer.""So," he said, nonplussed, "that brings you?""Yes," she replied; "Won't you?"I have a good bed," he explained by way of apology for his
state."I know," she replied, "but we have a good home now and Vesta is
there."Yes," she replied, lying hopelessly."I have been married a long
time.She could scarcely look him
in the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her."Well," he said, "it is time.""Won't you come, papa?"He threw out his hands after his characteristic manner.The urgency
of her appeal touched him to the quick."Yes, I come," he said, and
turned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening.For answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his
things.CHAPTER XXXVIII


Gerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once
bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively
concerned him.He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at
the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had
nothing to do.The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful
condition.If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would
attend to them in the spring.In Germany they knew how to care for
such things, but these Americans were so shiftless.Then he wanted
tools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in
order.He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared
that it was better than the one in Cleveland.The pastor, of course,
was a heaven-sent son of divinity.And nothing would do but that Vesta
must go to church with him regularly.Jennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with
some misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise.On the North
Side it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.Now they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate
neighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to
play the part of an experienced hostess.She and Lester had talked
this situation over.It might as well be understood here, he said,
that they were husband and wife.Vesta was to be introduced as
Jennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr.Stover
(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's
birth.Lester, of course, was the stepfather.This particular
neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that
Lester did not expect to run into many of his friends.He explained to
Jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when
the first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.Within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.Jacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular
section.She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the
neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her
carriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.she asked of Jeannette, the new maid."I think so, mam," answered the girl."Won't you let me have your
card?"The card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it
curiously.When Jennie came into the parlor Mrs.Stendahl, a tall dark,
inquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially."I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you," she said
most winningly.I live on the other side
of the street, some few doors up.Perhaps you have seen the
house--the one with the white stone gate-posts.""Oh, yes indeed," replied Jennie.Kane and I
were admiring it the first day we came out here.""I know of your husband, of course, by reputation.My husband is
connected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company."She knew that the latter concern must be
something important and profitable from the way in which Mrs."We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you
must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city.I
hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon."Indeed I shall," answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the
ordeal was a trying one.Kane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would
be most pleased to meet you and your husband.""You must both come over some evening," replied Mrs.Jennie smiled her assurances of good-will.Stendahl to the door, and shook hands with her."I'm so glad to find
you so charming," observed Mrs."Oh, thank you," said Jennie flushing a little."I'm sure I don't
deserve so much praise.""Well, now I will expect you some afternoon.Good-by," and she
waved a gracious farewell."That wasn't so bad," thought Jennie as she watched Mrs.Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left
cards, or stayed to chat a few minutes.Jennie found herself taken
quite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to
support the dignity of her position.And, indeed, she did
exceptionally well.She had a
kindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a
most favorable impression.She explained to her guests that she had
been living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,
Mr.Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father
and daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's
stepfather.She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and
to be a good neighbor.Lester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care
to meet these people.Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way.She liked
making new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could
be worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good
wife and an ideal companion.Perhaps, some day, he might really want
to marry her.First impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to
discover.The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too
hastily, and now rumors began to fly about.Sommerville,
calling on Mrs.Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that
she knew who Lester was--"oh, yes, indeed.You know, my dear,"
she went on, "his reputation is just a little--" she raised her
eyebrows and her hand at the same time."He looks like
such a staid, conservative person.""Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is," went on Mrs."His
family is of the very best.There was some young woman he went
with--so my husband tells me.I don't know whether this is the
one or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such
name as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on
the North Side."Craig with her tongue at this
astonishing news.Come to think of it, it must be
the same woman.It
seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with
her--at least there was a child.Whether he married her afterward
or not, I don't know.Anyhow, I understand his family will not have
anything to do with her.""And to think he
should have married her afterward, if he really did.I'm sure you
can't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can
you?""Well, it may be," went on her guest, "that this isn't the same
woman after all.She told me they had been living
on the North Side.""Then I'm sure it's the same person.How curious that you should
speak of her!""It is, indeed," went on Mrs.Craig, who was speculating as to what
her attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.There were people who had
seen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been
introduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family
thought.Of course her present position, the handsome house, the
wealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to
soften the situation.She was apparently too circumspect, too much the
good wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a
past, and that had to be taken into consideration.An opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when
Vesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: "Mamma, who was my
papa?""His name was Stover, dear," replied her mother, struck at once by
the thought that there might have been some criticism--that some
one must have been saying something.continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and
interested in clearing up her own identity."Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't
ever married when you had me.She said I wasn't a really, truly girl
at all--just a nobody.Ballinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious
and helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter
had said this to Vesta."You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie," said Jennie at
last.Stover, and you were born
in Columbus.Of course they say
nasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really
mean.Just let her alone and don't go near her any more.Then she
won't say anything to you."It was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time
being."I'll slap her if she tries to slap me," she persisted."You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear?Then she can't try to
slap you," returned her mother."Just go about your studies, and don't
mind her.She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her."Vesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words.It is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound
opened from time to time by additional stabs.One day Jennie, having
gone to call on Mrs.Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met
a Mrs.Williston Baker, who was there taking tea.Baker knew of
the Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude
of the Kane family.She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,
somewhat on the order of Mrs.Bracebridge, and very careful of her
social connections.Field a woman of
the same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie
calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated.Field, introducing her guests with a
smiling countenance."Indeed," she went on freezingly."I've heard a great deal about
Mrs.--" accenting the word "Mrs.--Lester Kane."Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started
an intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.Jennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would
be suitable to so trying a situation.Baker soon announced her
departure, although she had intended to stay longer."I can't remain
another minute," she said; "I promised Mrs.Neil that I would stop in
to see her to-day.I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it
is."She walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she
was nearly out of the room.Then she looked in her direction, and gave
her a frigid nod."We meet such curious people now and again," she observed finally
to her hostess as she swept away.Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was
in no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other
middle-class woman of means, to get along.Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than
Jennie.She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling
apologetically, but she was a little bit flustered.Jennie was out of
countenance, of course.Presently she excused herself and went home.She had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that
Mrs.Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.There would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she
knew.The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a
failure.It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.Lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.Time went on and matters remained very much as they were.To look
at this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its
vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing
themselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering
about the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the
morning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace
and plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming
home.And as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run
smoothly.It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only
a very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the
deprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to
please and interest.Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play
quite well.Jennie was a charming figure
in blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her
affairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that
things generally were put to rights.Gerhardt busied himself about his
multitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands
into all the domestic economies of the household.One of his
self-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the
servants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might
accidentally have been left burning.Again, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside
after a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old
German.Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of
a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.Gerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old
man's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong "with them shoes" by
saying that they weren't comfortable any more.No
good can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these
days.""He can't help it, papa," Jennie excused."That's the way he was
raised."These Americans, they know nothing of
economy.Then they would know
what a dollar can do."Lester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.Another grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches.He had
the habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of
lighting his cigar, and then throwing it away.Sometimes he would
begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually
do so, tossing aside match after match.There was a place out in one
corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer
evening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches.Jennie would
sit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out
on the lawn.At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt
found, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of
half-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the
fallen blades.He gathered up
this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the
sitting-room where Jennie was sewing.That man,
he has no more sense of economy than a--than a--" the right
term failed him."He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses
matches.Five cents a box they cost--five cents.How can a man
hope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know."Lester is extravagant," she
said.At least they should be
burned in the furnace.He would have used them as lighters for his own
pipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers
were better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his
lord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition.It was a sad
world to work in.Still he fought
as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance.He would wear the same suit of
black--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of
years before--every Sunday for a couple of years.Lester's shoes,
by a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,
and these he wore.His old ties also--the black ones--they
were fine.If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have
done so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the
cook's needle.Lester's socks, of course, were just right.There was
never any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.The remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,
shirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away
for weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he
would call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose
of the lot at the best price he could.He learned that all second-hand
clothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least
faith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man.They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they
were actually rolling in wealth.Gerhardt had investigated these
stories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing
with the things he sold them."They offer me ten cents for a pair of
shoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked
two dollars.They could afford to give me a
dollar."It was only to her that he complained, for he could
expect no sympathy from' Lester.So far as his own meager store of
money was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,
where he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,
faith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.And so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,
Jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence.Lester, in
spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of
his career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to
enjoy his home life.she would ask when he came in of an
evening.he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.She would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take
his coat and hat.In the winter-time they would sit in the library
before the big grate-fire.In the spring, summer, or fall Lester
preferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a
sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his
before-dinner cigar.Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and
stroke his head."Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;
aren't you glad?"she would say; or, "Oh, see how your brow is
wrinkled now.You didn't change your tie, mister,
this morning."Oh, I forgot," he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to
disappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if
he wasn't so now.In the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was
not less loving, though a little more circumspect.She loved odd
puzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and
the like.He would work by
the hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right.Jennie
was clever at solving these mechanical problems.Sometimes she would
have to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely
pleased with herself.At other times she would stand behind him
watching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck.He seemed
not to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she
bestowed.Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an
atmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and
beauty appealed to him.It made him feel young, and if there was one
thing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an
aimless old age."I want to keep young, or die young," was one of his
pet remarks; and Jennie came to understand.She was glad that she was
so much younger now for his sake.Another pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily
increasing affection for Vesta.The child would sit at the big table
in the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would
sew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran
papers.It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go
to a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to
nothing of the sort."We'll not have any thick-headed German training
in this," he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had
complained."The public schools are good enough for any child.There were really some delightful hours among the four.Lester
liked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees
and tease her.He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to
propound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took
them.he would ask; and being informed that it was
"what we drink," he would stare and say, "That's so, but what is it?Don't they teach you any better than that?""Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?""The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is," he would
retort."You ask your teacher what water is"; and then he would leave
her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.Food, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its
chemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these
dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance
of things until she was actually in awe of him.She had a way of
showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the
morning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her
appearance.He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of
blue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from
low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'
and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her
complexion and disposition."That child's light and gay by disposition.Don't put anything
somber on her," he once remarked.Jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and
would say, "Run to your papa and show him how you look."Vesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,
"See."He grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when
they drove he would always have her in between them.He insisted that
Jennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself
with rage and grief."Such
devil's fol-de-rol.To make a no-good
out of her--a creature to be ashamed of?""Oh no, papa," replied Jennie.A fine lot he knows about what is good
for a child.A card-player, a whisky-drinker!""Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that," Jennie would
reply warmly."He's a good man, and you know it."When Lester was near he said nothing, and
Vesta could wind him around her finger."Oh you," she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled
cheek.There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this.He
lost control of himself--something welled up and choked his
throat."Yes, I know how you do," he would exclaim.It was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless
she herself willed it.Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do
anything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.CHAPTER XXXIX


During this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with
Lester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger.That it could
not help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was
sufficiently obvious to them.People
seemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said
directly.Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to
fly in the face of conventions in this manner.If the woman had been
some one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the
world of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not
commendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as
Louise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not
possibly understand it.Lester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had
not settled down in the ordinary way.Look at the women in Cincinnati
who knew him and liked him.Why in the
name of common sense had he not married her?She was good looking,
sympathetic, talented.The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by
degrees, he began to harden.It seemed a shame that Lester should
treat him so.It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent.Archibald
Kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be
enforced, but just what it should be he could not say.Lester was his
own boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.Certain changes helped along an approaching denouement.Louise
married not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,
and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting
grandchildren.Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was
invited.Kane died, making a readjustment of
the family will necessary.Lester came home on this occasion, grieved
to think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had
caused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make.His
father thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because
of his obvious gloom.He went back to Chicago, and there were more
months of silence.Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to
live with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his
greatest pleasure in his old age.The business, except for the final
adjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.The latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their
husbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped
to obtain.He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a
shrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him
credit for.He was already richer than any two of the other children
put together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty
of fortune.He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan
form of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very
ready and very hard cash.While Lester was drifting Robert was
working--working all the time.Robert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in
the control of the business was really not very essential, for his
father, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,
had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his
property ought not to go to Lester.Obviously, Lester was not so
strong a man as he had thought him to be.Of the two brothers, Lester
might be the bigger intellectually or
sympathetically--artistically and socially there was no
comparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,
effective way.If Lester was not going to pull himself together at
this stage of the game, when would he?Better leave his property to
those who would take care of it.Archibald Kane thought seriously of
having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester
should reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income.But he
decided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,
that he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a
sound basis before the world.Old
Archibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at
his convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was
in Cincinnati."I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject
that's rather difficult for me to bring up," began the elder Kane."Yes, I know," replied Lester, calmly."I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial
ventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score
when I got a little farther along.I began to see through my business
connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and
then I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well.I used to
worry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet.This recent connection
you've made has caused me no end of trouble.It worried your mother up
to the very last.Don't you think you
have gone far enough with it?What
it is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret.That can't
help the house in business there.The
whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects
all around, and yet you continue."I suppose because I love her," Lester replied."You can't be serious in that," said his father."If you had loved
her, you'd have married her in the first place.Surely you wouldn't
take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,
disgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her.You
may have a passion for her, but it isn't love.""How do you know I haven't married her?"He
wanted to see how his father would take to that idea.The old gentleman propped himself up on his
arms and looked at him."No, I'm not," replied Lester, "but I might be.I can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,
Lester.Why, you've lived in open adultery
with her for years, and now you talk of marrying her.Why, in heaven's
name, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in
the first place?Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,
injure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause
of it?"Don't get excited, father," said Lester quickly."We won't get
anywhere that way.She's not a bad woman, and
I wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do."I know enough," insisted old Archibald, determinedly."I know that
no good woman would act as she has done.Why, man, she's after your
money.It's as plain as the nose on your
face.""Father," said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, "why do you
talk like that?You wouldn't know her from
Adam's off ox.Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and
you people swallow it whole.She isn't as bad as you think she is, and
I wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.You're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some
reason, be fair."Is it
fair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the
streets and live with her?Is it--"

"Stop now, father," exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand.You're talking about the woman
that I'm living with--that I may marry.I love you, but I won't
have you saying things that aren't so.She isn't a woman of the
streets.You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take
up with a woman of that kind.We'll have to discuss this in a calmer
mood, or I won't stay here.But I won't
listen to any such language as that."In spite of his opposition, he
respected his son's point of view.He sat back in his chair and stared
at the floor."No, we've moved out to Hyde Park."Well, that's a God's blessing.""I didn't say that," replied his son.exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.How do you
suppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune
to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as
right and proper?Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,
your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you.I
can't understand what has happened to your pride.It seems like some
wild, impossible fancy.""It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.I simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it
through.I'm not prepared now to say what I'll do.Old Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly."You've made a bad mess of this, Lester," he said finally.But I suppose you are determined to go your way.Nothing
that I have said appears to move you.""Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration
for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will
make a difference in my will.I can't go on countenancing this thing,
and not be a party to it morally and every other way.You can leave her, or you can marry her.You certainly ought to do one
or the other.If you leave her, everything will be all right.You can
make any provision for her you like.I'll
gladly pay whatever you agree to.You will share with the rest of the
children, just as I had planned.If you marry her it will make a
difference.I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty.Now you think
that over and let me know."He felt that
his father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,
and justify himself to himself?The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see
it.Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion
irritated him.The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a
thing to throw Jennie down.Old Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet."Well," said Lester finally, "there's no use of our discussing it
any further now--that's certain, isn't it?I can't say what I'll
do.Lester was sorry for the world's
attitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair.Kane
senior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing
through.He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he
was hopeful."Good-by, father," said Lester, holding out his hand."I think I'll
try and make that two-ten train.There isn't anything else you wanted
to see me about?"The old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply.What a foolhardy
persistence in evil and error!He
was the one to control a business.It was a long time
before he stirred.And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring
son continued to appeal to him.CHAPTER XL


Lester returned to Chicago.He realized that he had offended his
father seriously, how seriously he could not say.In all his personal
relations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up.But
even now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he
hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he
hoped to retain his father's affection and confidence.As for the
world at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they
said.People turn so
quickly from weakness or the shadow of it.To get away from
failure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a
subconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid
non-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious.Lester was
soon to feel the force of this prejudice.One day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire
head of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the
dry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.Dodge had been one of Lester's best friends.He knew him as intimately
as he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of
Cincinnati.He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,
and they met constantly in a business and social way.But since Lester
had moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed.Now they came
face to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building."Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again," said Dodge.He extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool."I hear
you've gone and married since I saw you.""No, nothing like that," replied Lester, easily, with the air of
one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense."Why so secret about it, if you have?"asked Dodge, attempting to
smile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth.He was trying
to be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully."We
fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing."Well," said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was
being driven into him, "I thought I'd do it in a new way.I'm not much
for excitement in that direction, anyhow.""It is a matter of taste, isn't it?""You're living in the city, of course?"And he
deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory
farewell.Lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would
have made if he had really believed that he was married.Under
ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great
deal about the new Mrs.There would have been all those little
familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane.Dodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,
would have definitely promised to call.Nothing of the sort happened,
and Lester noticed the significant omission.It was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a
score of other people whom he knew equally well.Apparently they all
thought that he had married and settled down.They were interested to
know where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him
about being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not
willing to discuss the supposed Mrs.He was beginning to see
that this move of his was going to tell against him notably.One of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,
it was the most unintentional--he received from an old
acquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club.Lester was dining there
one evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was
crossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand.The latter was a
typical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,
a little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor.he called out, "what's this talk about a menage
of yours out in Hyde Park?How are you going
to explain all this to your wife when you get married?""I don't have to explain it," replied Lester irritably."Why should
you be so interested in my affairs?You're not living in a stone
house, are you?"that's pretty good now, isn't it?You didn't marry
that little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,
did you?You didn't, now,
did you?""Cut it out, Whitney," said Lester roughly."Pardon, Lester," said the other aimlessly, but sobering.Eight whisky-sours
straight in the other room there.I'll talk to you some time
when I'm all right.I'm a little loose,
that's right.Lester could not get over that cacophonous "ha!It cut him,
even though it came from a drunken man's mouth."That little beauty
you used to travel with on the North Side.You didn't marry her, did
you?"He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully.He had never endured anything like this
before--he, Lester Kane.Certainly he was
paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.CHAPTER XLI


But worse was to follow.The American public likes gossip about
well-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.The report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a
servant girl.What a
piquant morsel for the newspapers!Very soon the paragraphs began to
appear.A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,
referred to him anonymously as "the son of a famous and wealthy
carriage manufacturer of Cincinnati," and outlined briefly what it
knew of the story.----" it went on, sagely, "not
so much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known
Cleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a
working-girl in Columbus, Ohio.After such a picturesque love-affair
in high society, who shall say that romance is dead?"He did not take the paper, but some kind soul
took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him.It
irritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme
to blackmail him.But he did not know exactly what to do about it.He
preferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also
thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make
matters worse.Naturally, the paragraph in the
Budget attracted the attention of other newspapers.It sounded
like a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the
others, conceived the notion of having this romance written up.A
full-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as "Sacrifices Millions
for His Servant Girl Love," pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at
Hyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on
Michigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a
sensation.The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or
Sunday paper.If Lester had been
forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting
an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher.He did
not know, however, and so was without power to prevent the
publication.The editor made a thorough job of the business.Local
newspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed
to report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in
their city.The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether
Jennie had ever worked there.A garbled history of the Gerhardts was
obtained from Columbus.Jennie's residence on the North Side, for
several years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so
the whole story was nicely pieced together.It was not the idea of the
newspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.All the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the
suspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man
and wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family
to the match, were ignored.The idea was to frame up a Romeo and
Juliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,
self-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,
lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her
millionaire lover.An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make
scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing
was handled in the most approved yellow-journal style.There was a
picture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a
consideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously "snapped" by a staff
artist while she was out walking.And so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story
appeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,
but with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background.Jennie
did not see it at first.Lester came across the page accidentally, and
tore it out.He was stunned and chagrined beyond words."To think the
damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly
minding his own business!"He went out of the house, the
better to conceal his deep inward mortification.He avoided the more
populous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and
rode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie.He wondered,
as the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were
thinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the
others.The best he could do was to put a
brave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an
indifferent motion of the hand.One thing was sure--he would
prevent further comment.He returned to the house calmer, his
self-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that
he might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr.Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be
foolish to take any legal action.It was the part of wisdom to let the
matter drop."But I won't stand for anything more," concluded
Lester."I'll attend to that," said the lawyer, consolingly."It's amazing--this damned country of ours!""A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a
public monument.""A man with a little money," said Mr.Watson, "is just like a cat
with a bell around its neck.Every rat knows exactly where it is and
what it is doing.""That's an apt simile," assented Lester, bitterly.Jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.Lester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read
the wicked Sunday newspapers.Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood
friends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the
fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it."Why, I hadn't seen it," she said."Are you
sure it was about us?"I'll send Marie over with it when
I get back."I wish you would," she said, weakly.She was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the
article said.Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon
Lester.Why had he not spoken to her about
it?The neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart
stood still as she glanced at the title-page.There it all
was--uncompromising and direct.How dreadfully conspicuous the
headline--"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,"
which ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the
right.There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son
of the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great
social opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire.Below
were scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing
Jennie in the mansion of Mrs.Bracebridge, Lester standing with her
before an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving
with her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of
an imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by
most sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest
working-man's cottage pictured in the distance.Jennie felt as though
she must die for very shame.She did not so much mind what it meant to
her, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel?Now they
would have another club with which to strike him and her.She tried to
keep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears
would rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.She did not want to be hounded this way.Why couldn't the world help her,
instead of seeking to push her down?CHAPTER XLII


The fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to
Jennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,
after mature deliberation, that he ought to.He had told her once that
there was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so
brutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point.He
had decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did
not make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in
the world.The effect of this chill history could never be undone.The
wise--and they included all his social world and many who were
not of it--could see just how he had been living.The article
which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from
Cleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had
to court her a long time to win her consent.This was to explain their
living together on the North Side.Lester realized that this was an
asinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.Still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal
vein.He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the
house, spreading it on the library table.Jennie, who was close by,
watched him, for she knew what was coming."Here's something that will interest you, Jennie," he said dryly,
pointing to the array of text and pictures."I've already seen it, Lester," she said wearily.Stendahl
showed it to me this afternoon."Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it?I didn't
know I was such an ardent Romeo.""I'm awfully sorry, Lester," said Jennie, reading behind the dry
face of humor the serious import of this affair to him.She had long
since learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big
ills in words.He was inclined to jest and make light of the
inevitable, the inexorable.This light comment merely meant "this
matter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.""Oh, don't feel badly about it," he went on."It isn't anything
which can be adjusted now.We just
happen to be in the limelight.""I understand," said Jennie, coming over to him."I'm sorry,
though, anyway."Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident
was closed.But Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting
in a bad way.His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at
the last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the
climax.He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his
old world.It would have none of him, or at least the more
conservative part of it would not.There were a few bachelors, a few
gay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw
through it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make
society.He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but
to reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and
for all.The thought was painful to
him--objectionable in every way.Jennie was growing in mental
acumen.She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.She was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature.She was a big woman
and a good one.It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she
was good-looking.He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she
looked twenty-four or five.It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,
youth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of
view--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another.He
had made his bed, as his father had said.It was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper
incident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and
failing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any
moment.Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news
came that his father was dead.Lester, of course, was greatly shocked
and grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and
sorrowful mood.His father had been a great character to him--a
fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his
relationship to him as his son.He remembered him now dandling him
upon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in
Ireland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a
little older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his
commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood.Old Archibald had been
radically honest.It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for
plain speech and direct statement of fact."Never lie," was
Archibald's constant, reiterated statement."Never try to make a thing
look different from what it is to you.It's the breath of
life--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial
success--it will make a notable character of any one who will
stick to it."He admired his father intensely
for his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he
felt sorry.He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to
him.He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he
had known her.He did not imagine that he would ever have had the
opportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that
Archibald would have liked her.When he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.The traffic of the city
had a muffled sound.When he stepped down from the train he was met by
Amy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.Of all the girls she was the most tolerant.Lester put his arms about
her, and kissed her."It seems like old times to see you, Amy," he said, "your coming to
meet me this way.Well,
poor father, his time had to come.Still, he lived to see everything
that he wanted to see.I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the
outcome of his efforts.""Yes," replied Amy, "and since mother died he was very lonely."They rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old
times and places.All the members of the immediate family, and the
various relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion.Lester
exchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the
while that his father had lived long enough.He had had a successful
life, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree.Lester looked at
him where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a
feeling of the old-time affection swept over him.He smiled at the
clean-cut, determined, conscientious face."The old gentleman was a big man all the way through," he said to
Robert, who was present."We won't find a better figure of a man
soon.""We will not," said his brother, solemnly.After the funeral it was decided to read the will at once.Louise's
husband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be
in Chicago.A conference of the various members of the family was
called for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices
of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late
manufacturer.As Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father
had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests.It had not been
so very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been
taking his time to think about things, and his father had given him
time.He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,
except for his alliance with Jennie.His business judgment had been
valuable to the company.Why should there be any discrimination
against him?When they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr.O'Brien, a
short, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all
the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a
hearty handshake.He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for
twenty years.He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered
himself very much in the light of a father confessor.He liked all the
children, Lester especially."Now I believe we are all here," he said, finally, extracting a
pair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking
sagely about.I will
just read the will without any preliminary remarks."He turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his
throat, and began.It was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all
the minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and
friends.It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally
came to the immediate family, beginning with the girls.Imogene, as a
faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the
carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the
deceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)
about eight hundred thousand dollars.Amy and Louise were provided for
in exactly the same proportion.The grandchildren were given certain
little bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age.Then it
took up the cases of Robert and Lester."Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of
my son Lester," it began, "I deem it my duty to make certain
conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my
property, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing
Company and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,
real, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son
Robert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and
one-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the
remaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,
stocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his
brother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter
be set forth shall have been complied with.And it is my wish and
desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to
him, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,
or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better."His cheeks changed color, but he did
not move.It appeared that he was
not even mentioned separately.The conditions "hereinafter set forth" dealt very fully with his
case, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the
time, Mr.O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their
father's wish.Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to
have ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the
choice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave
Jennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into
moral conformity with the wishes of his father.In this event Lester's
share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.Secondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done
so, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to
him for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his
life only.Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death.The
ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two
hundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in
trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition
effected.If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was
to have nothing at all after the three years were up.At Lester's
death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro
rata among the surviving members of the family.If any heir or assign
contested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited
entirely.It was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had
taken his case into consideration.He half suspected, on reading these
conditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the
framing of them, but of course he could not be sure.Robert had not
given any direct evidence of enmity.he demanded of O'Brien, a little later."Well, we all had a hand in it," replied O'Brien, a little
shamefacedly."It was a very difficult document to draw up.Kane, there was no budging your father.He has
come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses.Of
course, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit.I hated very much to have to do it."During the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an
ox.He got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of
nonchalance.Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not
exactly, not unqualifiedly regretful."I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this," said
Robert, who had been sitting next him."I certainly did not expect him
to go as far as that.So far as I am concerned some other arrangement
would have been satisfactory."Imogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they
did not know what to say."I
don't think papa acted quite right, Lester," ventured Amy, but Lester
waved her away almost gruffly.He figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case
he refused to comply with his father's wishes.Two hundred shares of
L. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand
each.They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,
sometimes less.At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not
more.Sandra went to the bathroom.The family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester
returned to his sister's house.He wanted to get out of the city
quickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,
and caught the earliest train back to Chicago.So this was how much his father really cared for him!He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three
years, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie!"Ten
thousand a year," he thought, "and that for three years!To think he should have done that to
me!"CHAPTER XLIII


This attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely
set Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.He had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;
first in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the
second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when
she wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made
a mess of this business.He could not afford to lose his fortune
entirely.He did not have enough money of his own.Jennie was unhappy,
he could see that.Did he want
to accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to
marry her?Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of
his life once and for all?He could not make up his mind; the problem
was too complicated.When Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at
once that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's
natural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.She tried to draw near to him
sympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.When hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have
struck any man who irritated him.She watched him interestedly,
wishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his
confidence.He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.Days passed, and now the financial situation which had been created
by his father's death came up for careful consideration.The factory
management had to be reorganized.Robert would have to be made
president, as his father wished.Lester's own relationship to the
business would have to come up for adjudication.Unless he changed his
mind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder.As a matter of fact, he
was not anything.To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was
necessary that he should own at least one share of the company's
stock.Would the other members of the family care to do
anything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?They were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized
that he was facing a ticklish situation.The solution was--to get
rid of Jennie.If he did that he would not need to be begging for
stock.If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last
will and testament.He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and
deliberately.He could quite see how things were coming out.He must
abandon either Jennie or his prospects in life.Despite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another
arrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well
pleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.Robert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough
reorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the
business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies.If
he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and
West to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production
would be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled
down.Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock
in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to
act.In the first place he would have himself elected president of the
Kane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select
Amy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than
Lester as secretary and treasurer.Under the conditions of the will,
the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in
the hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and
voted by Robert.His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,
should help him coerce his brother.He did not want to appear mean,
but this was such an easy way.It gave him a righteous duty to
perform.Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the
business to suit himself.Lester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the
drift of things.He realized now that he was permanently out of the
company, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought
irritated him greatly.Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate
that such a change had taken place--things went on very much as
before--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law.Lester
was really his brother's employee at so much a year.There came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could
not stand this any longer.Hitherto he had been a free and independent
agent.The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had
been a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the
voting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,
his sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not
there at all.It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had
not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which
would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position
in the company, he decided to write and resign.That would bring
matters to a crisis.It would show his brother that he felt no desire
to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which
was not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the
desire of those with whom he was associated.If he wanted to move back
into the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different
capacity from that of branch manager.He dictated a simple,
straight-forward business letter, saying:

"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company
must be reorganized under your direction.Not having any stock, I am
not entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of
secretary and treasurer.I want you to accept this letter as formal
notice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your
directors consider what disposition should be made of this position
and my services.I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as
a branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do
anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future.You
see by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in
father's will--at least, not at present.I would like a definite
understanding of how you feel in this matter."Yours,

"LESTER."Robert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter
gravely.It was like his brother to come down to "brass tacks."If
Lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,
what a man he would be!But there was no guile in the man--no
subtlety.He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in
his own soul, that to succeed greatly one must."You have to be
ruthless at times--you have to be subtle," Robert would say to
himself."Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for
big stakes?"He would, for one, and he did.Robert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow
and his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs.He was
too outspoken, too inclined to take issue.If Lester yielded to his
father's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he
would become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the
company.Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path.He much preferred that Lester should hold
fast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by
his own act.After long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter.He
hadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do.He did not know
what his sisters' husbands would like.For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as
secretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged.Perhaps it would be
better to let the matter rest for the present.What did Robert mean by beating around the bush?He
knew well enough how it could be arranged.One share of stock would be
enough for Lester to qualify.Robert was afraid of him--that was
the basic fact.Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,
depend on that.Lester accordingly wrote
back, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look
after some interests of his own, for the time being.If Robert could
arrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take
over the branch agency.In a few
days came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but
that if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any
plans he might have in view.Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had
long thought he would like to reside in Chicago.He could undertake
the work for the time being.Evidently Robert was making the best of a very
subtle situation.Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie
things up, and also that he would be very loath to do so.The
newspapers would get hold of the whole story.This matter of his
relationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow.He could best solve the
problem by leaving her.CHAPTER XLIV


For a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be
tossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he
did have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen
thousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing.He realized
now that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable
arrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.That would give him the ten thousand
for the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting
his legitimate share of the Kane estate.Again, he might sell out the
seventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing
stocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical
investment of some kind--say a rival carriage company.But did he
want to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight
on his father's old organization?Moreover, it would be a hard row to
hoe.There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the
Kane Company very much in the lead.Lester's only available capital
was his seventy-five thousand dollars.Did he want to begin in a
picayune, obscure way?It took money to get a foothold in the carriage
business as things were now.The trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine
imagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,
narrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a
necessary element in almost every great business success.To be a
forceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must
be an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that
life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field
you have chosen.It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new
can-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your
imagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make
itself the be-all and end-all of your existence.As a rule, a man
needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth.The thing he
has discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be
the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys.Happiness
must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it
might--the urge will not be great enough to make a great
success.Lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.Life had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys.He
saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled
pleasure.Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had
money--enough to keep him comfortably.Certainly he could not
comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other
people work for the rest of his days.In the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into
things.He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going
to make a mistake.He would first give the trade, the people who were
identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to
realize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,
anyhow, and open to other connections.So he announced that he was
leaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.He had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it.Vesta could
be left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would
travel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show.He wanted to
visit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had
been recommended to him.Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always
appealed to his imagination.After he had had his outing he could come
back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.The spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.He had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant
deliberation had studied out a tour.He made Jennie his confidante,
and now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a
steamer from New York to Liverpool.After a few weeks in the British
Isles they went to Egypt.From there they came back, through Greece
and Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through
France and Paris, to Germany and Berlin.Lester was diverted by the
novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that
he was wasting his time.Great business enterprises were not built by
travelers, and he was not looking for health.Jennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and
enjoyed the new life to the full.Before Luxor and Karnak--places
which Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older
civilization, powerful, complex, complete.Millions of people had
lived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of
government, other conditions of existence.For the first time in her
life Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is.Now from
this point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of
forgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our
minor beliefs.Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so
significant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,
Ohio--rather pointless, perhaps.Her mother had worried so of
what people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead
worlds of people, some bad, some good.Lester explained that their
differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,
sometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar
personalities like Mohammed.Lester liked to point out how small
conventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to
see.Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,
perhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,
what did it all amount to?They would be dead after a little while,
she and Lester and all these people.Did anything matter except
goodness--goodness of heart?CHAPTER XLV


It was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the
Carlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,
before Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly
admired--Letty Pace.He had not seen her for a long time, and she
had been Mrs.Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming
widow for nearly two years more.Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy
man, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in
Cincinnati, and he had left Mrs.She was
the mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a
nurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque
center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the
civilized world.Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,
graceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student
of art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.In her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise
observer of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as
a real man.He was so sane, she thought, so calm.He was always
intolerant of sham, and she liked him for it.He was inclined to wave
aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and
to talk of simple and homely things.Many and many a time, in years
past, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and
talk while Lester smoked.He had argued philosophy with her, discussed
books, described political and social conditions in other
cities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human
being, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to
her.More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its
short growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.It was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at
that time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that
her chance of winning him was gone.Then Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for
something like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him.She did not
love him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one.He
was forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four
years--just long enough to realize that he had married a
charming, tolerant, broad-minded woman.Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in
her knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and
to spend her money.She was not inclined to do either indifferently.She had long since
had her ideal of a man established by Lester.These whipper-snappers
of counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and
another (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with
the years), did not interest her a particle.She was terribly weary of
the superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met
abroad.A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a
natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw
through them and through the civilization which they represented."I
could have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in
Cincinnati," she told one of her titled women friends who had been an
American before her marriage."He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest
fellow.If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had
to work for a living myself."He was comfortably rich, but that did not make
any difference to me."It would have made a difference in the long run," said the
other."You misjudge me," replied Mrs."I waited for him for a
number of years, and I know."Lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories
of Letty Pace, or Mrs.He had been fond of her
in a way, very fond.He had asked himself
that question time and again.She would have made him an ideal wife,
his father would have been pleased, everybody would have been
delighted.Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met
Jennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more.Now
after six years of separation he met her again.She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an
affair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman
and was living on the South Side.She did not know of the loss of his
fortune.She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening.The
windows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous
with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world
when spring comes back.For the moment she was a little beside
herself.Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and
extended a graceful arm and hand.It seems truly like a breath
of spring to see you again.Kane, but
I'm delighted to see your husband.I'm ashamed to say how many years
it is, Lester, since I saw you last!I feel quite old when I think of
it.Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years!And I've
been married and had a child, and poor Mr.Gerald has died, and oh,
dear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.""You don't look it," commented Lester, smiling.He was pleased to
see her again, for they had been good friends.She liked him
still--that was evident, and he truly liked her.She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.This woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,
mother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,
her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed
to her the ideal of what a woman should be.She liked looking at
lovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his
attention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their
charms."Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of
to me?"she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful
woman chanced to attract her attention.Lester would examine her
choice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine
charms was excellent."Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am," he would
retort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, "I'm not as young as I
used to be, or I'd get in tow of that.""What would you do if I really should?""Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything.You'd come back to me,
maybe."But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't
try to stop you.I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless
he wanted me to be.""Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?"he asked her once, curious
to test the breadth of her philosophy."Oh, I don't know, why?""They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable.They're not
common, that's sure.""Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester.Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought
to want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?It doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little
while--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come
back at all."Lester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point
of view--he had to.To-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she
realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk
over; whereupon she did a characteristic thing."Won't you excuse me
for a little while?""I left some things uncared
for in our rooms.She went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably
could, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.He recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty
brought the history of her life up to date."Now that you're safely
married, Lester," she said daringly, "I'll confess to you that you
were the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you
never did.""Maybe I never dared," he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,
and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married.He
felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way.She seemed to him
now to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,
natural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting
each new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her."Anyhow, I allow you some credit."Jennie has her good points," he replied simply.Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one
can be who sees life as it is.You know I'm not troubled with many
illusions.""Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.""Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few.Really, I look on my life as a kind of
failure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as
Croesus--not quite.I think he had some more than I have.""What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and
money--good heavens!"Travel, talk, shoo away silly
fortune-hunters.Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!"In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came
back.They were as
comfortable together as old married people, or young lovers.She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke."We'll have to brace up and talk of
other things."Yes, I know," she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant
smile.Jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving.She thought vaguely that
this might be one of Lester's old flames.This was the kind of woman
he should have chosen--not her.She was suited to his station in
life, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier.Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;
pretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be
contemptible.Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward
the Kanes.She invited them the next day to join her on a drive
through Rotten Row.There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then
she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to
Paris.She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that
they would soon meet again.She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's
good fortune.Lester had lost none of his charm for her.If anything,
he seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome.She wished
sincerely that he were free.And Lester--subconsciously
perhaps--was thinking the same thing.No doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had
been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if
he had married her.They were so congenial now, philosophically,
artistically, practically.There was a natural flow of conversation
between them all the time, like two old comrades among men.She knew
everybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did
not.They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a
way which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did
not have the vocabulary.Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of
Mrs.Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,
sympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show
it in light conversation.Actually she was living the thing she was,
and that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her.Just now, and
often in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and
she was.It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs.Gerald
would perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as
good, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his
future.In the
gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather
Lester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking."Well, this is good luck," he exclaimed.I didn't know I was coming until last
Thursday.You know I
wondered where you might be.Then I remembered that you said you were
going to Egypt."In her bath, I fancy, at this moment.This warm weather makes
Jennie take to water.Letty was in light blue silk, with
a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked
very pretty.she suddenly ejaculated, "I wonder sometimes
what I am to do with myself.I think
I'll go back to the States to live."I haven't
any one to marry now--that I want."She glanced at Lester
significantly, then looked away."Oh, you'll find some one eventually," he said, somewhat awkwardly."You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money."she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball
which was to be given at the hotel that evening.He had danced so well
a few years before."Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and
abandoned that last charming art.Come to
think of it, I suppose that is my fault.I haven't thought of dancing
in some time."It occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any
kind much for some time.The opposition his entanglement had generated
had put a stop to that."Come and dance with me to-night."I'll have to think about that," replied Lester.Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of
life.""Oh, hush, Lester," replied Mrs.Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old
man!""Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive," replied his old
flame.CHAPTER XLVI


That night after dinner the music was already sounding in the
ball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.Gerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his
side.The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying
a heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears.Lester was
brooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of
rather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either
side of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population
sustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with
its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,
soul-weary, almost despairing conditions.He and Jennie had looked
this morning on the pyramids.They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!They had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men
and boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes
and alleys."It all seems such a mess to me," Jennie had said at one place.I like it, but somehow they seem tangled
up, like a lot of worms."Lester chuckled, "You're almost right.Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.To-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the
grounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster."Well, at last I've found you!""I couldn't
get down to dinner, after all.I've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs.Kane," she went on
smilingly.She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous
influence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight.There were rich
odors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote
distance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, "Ayah!"as though a drove of strange animals were
being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets."You're welcome to him," replied Jennie pleasantly."You ought to take lessons right away then," replied Lester
genially."I'll do my best to keep you company.I'm not as light on my
feet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.""Oh, I don't want to dance that badly," smiled Jennie."But you two
go on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.""Why don't you come sit in the ball-room?I can't do more than a
few rounds.Then we can watch the others," said Lester rising.Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with
glistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing
diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.Her lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row
of white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips.Lester's strong,
vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked
distinguished."That is the woman he should have married," said Jennie to herself
as he disappeared.She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of
her past life.Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been
living in a dream.At other times she felt as though she were in that
dream yet.Life sounded in her ears much as this night did.But back of it were
subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the
shifting of dreams.Why had
Lester been so eager to follow her?She
thought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she
was in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,
surrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her.He had
endured so many things for her!Still she felt humble, out of place,
holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her.Again she
experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first
time she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy
existence could not endure.She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor
cottage, to old clothes.And then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of
his friends, she knew it must be so.She would never be received, even
if he married her.She could look into
the charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and
see that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's
class.She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with
Lester that he needed some one like her.He needed some one who had
been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been
accustomed.He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the
familiarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had
always been accustomed.Her mind had
awakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,
decorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the
manner born.If she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of
the attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm.The
tears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she
might die.Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old
times, old places, and old friends.As he looked at Letty he marveled
at her youth and beauty.She was more developed than formerly, but
still as slender and shapely as Diana.She had strength, too, in this
smooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful."I swear, Letty," he said impulsively, "you're really more
beautiful than ever."You know I do, or I wouldn't say so."Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little
coyness?Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be
compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?"You're such a big, determined,
straightforward boy.They strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed
her arm softly.He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned
her.She said to herself, as they sat
looking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and
would come to her, she would take him.She was almost ready to take
him anyhow--only he probably wouldn't.He was so straight-laced,
so considerate.He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a
mean thing.He
and Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward
Karnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae.They
would have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to
bed."Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the
Fulda.""I may be going back in the fall," laughed Letty."Don't be
surprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you.I'm very unsettled
in my mind.""Come along, for goodness sake," replied Lester."I hope you do....
I'll see you to-morrow before we leave."He paused, and she looked at
him wistfully."Cheer up," he said, taking her hand."You never can tell what life
will do.We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all
wrong."He was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry
that she was not in a position to have what she wanted.As for
himself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he
would never accept; yet it was a solution.Why had he not seen this
years before?"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,
nor as wealthy."But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie
nor wish her any bad luck.She had had enough without his willing, and
had borne it bravely.CHAPTER XLVII


The trip home did bring another week with Mrs.Gerald, for after
mature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a
while.Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to
see more of Lester.Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to
Jennie, and it started her thinking again.Gerald would marry Lester;
that was certain.As it was--well, the question was a complicated
one.Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and
position went.And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large
human side, Lester preferred her.Perhaps time would solve the
problem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to
remain excellent friends.Gerald went
her way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their
existence.On his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a
business opening.None of the big companies made him any overtures,
principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for
a control in anything he touched.The nature of his altered fortunes
had not been made public.All the little companies that he
investigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a
product which was not satisfactory to him.He did find one company in
a small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have
a future.It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and
carriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,
however, was not a good business man.He was making some small money
on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,
twenty-five thousand.Lester felt that something could be done here if
proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised.There would never be a great fortune in it.He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer
when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.Robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the
carriage trade.He showed his competitors how much greater profits
could be made through consolidation than through a mutually
destructive rivalry.So convincing were his arguments that one by one
the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line.Within a few
months the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself
president of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,
with a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets
aggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale.While all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.His trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor
notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made
to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories.He returned to
Chicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still
in full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of
his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news
direct.Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather
irritatingly.The individual who conveyed this information was none other than
Mr.Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union
Club one evening after he had been in the city a month."I hear you're out of the old company," Bracebridge remarked,
smiling blandly."Yes," said Lester, "I'm out.""Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking
something of handling an independent concern.""Surely you won't run counter to your brother?He has a pretty good
thing in that combination of his."I hadn't heard of it," said Lester."I've just got
back from Europe.""Well, you want to wake up, Lester," replied Bracebridge."He's got
the biggest thing in your line.The
Lyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods
Company--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.Your brother was elected president of the new concern.I dare say he
cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal."Bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab."Well, so long, old man," he exclaimed."When you're in Cleveland
look us up.You know how fond my wife is of you."He strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the
zest out of his private venture.Where would he be with a shabby
little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?Robert could put him out of business in a year.Why, he
himself had dreamed of such a combination as this.It is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to
meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented.It is
quite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune
possibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to
you on various sides.Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the
quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,
his father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss
of his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this
trust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him.He
tried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he
thought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a
little too much.He went home, the same evening that he heard the
news, sorely disheartened.She realized it, as a matter
of fact, all during the evening that he was away.She felt blue and
despondent herself.When he came home she saw what it
was--something had happened to him.Her first impulse was to say,
"What is the matter, Lester?"but her next and sounder one was to
ignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever.She tried not to let
him see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately
without disturbing him."Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day," she volunteered by way
of diversion."That's good," he replied solemnly.She showed me some of her
new dances to-night.You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.""I'm glad of it," he grumbled."I always wanted her to be perfect
in that.It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I
think.""And papa gets in such a rage.She teases him
about it--the little imp.She offered to teach him to dance
to-night.If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.""I can see that," said Lester, smiling."She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either."He was very fond of Vesta, who was now
quite a girl.So Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then
some inkling of what had happened came out.It was when they were
retiring for the night."Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a
financial way since we've been away," he volunteered."Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust.It's something which will
take in every manufactory of any importance in the country.Bracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that
they have nearly eight millions in capital.""Well, then you won't want to do
much with your new company, will you?""No; there's nothing in that, just now," he said."Later on I fancy
it may be all right.I'll wait and see how this thing comes out.You
never can tell what a trust like that will do."She wished sincerely that she might do
something to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless."Oh, well," she said, "there are so many interesting things in this
world.If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.She didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it
was useless to worry.After all, he had an ample income
that was absolutely secure for two years yet.He could have more if he
wanted it.Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he
was standing still--perhaps "drifting" would be the better word.It did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little
uncertain of himself.CHAPTER XLVIII


Lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had
been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into
active life.The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade
trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of
taking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory.He could
not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a
petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously
his financial superior.He had looked up the details of the
combination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how
wonderfully complete it was.It
would have every little manufacturer by the throat.Should he begin
now in a small way and "pike along" in the shadow of his giant
brother?He would be
running around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own
brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed
against him.If not--well, he had his
independent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if
he wished.It was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a
visit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden
signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about
the city.Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where
he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate
speculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La
Salle and Washington streets.Ross was a magnetic-looking person of
about fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,
wide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost
electrically.Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,
and his long, thin, impressive white hands.Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr.Ross admitted fully that he
knew all about Mr.Norman
Yale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he
had developed "Yalewood."Only within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of
"Yalewood" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per
cent.He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had
put through, all well-known properties.He admitted frankly that there
were failures in the business; he had had one or two himself.But the
successes far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew.Now
Lester was no longer connected with the Kane Company.He was probably
looking for a good investment, and Mr.Ross had a proposition to lay
before him.Lester consented to listen, and Mr.Ross blinked his
cat-like eyes and started in.The idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal
partnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre
tract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead
streets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side.There were
indications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,
natural, and permanent.The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.There was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its
present terminus.The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near
there, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property.The
initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they
would share equally.Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,
surveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.There would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the
total investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of
nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars.All told,
they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or
possibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would
be fifty thousand.The character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a
rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that
had been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead.Take,
for instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,
on the south-east corner.Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was
held at forty-five dollars an acre.In 1886 it had risen to five
hundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr.John L.
Slosson at that time.In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to
Mr.Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which
this tract was now offered.It could be parceled out into lots fifty
by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot.Ross went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate
profits were made.It was useless for any outsider to rush into the
game, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what
trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a
quarter of a century.There was something in prestige, something in
taste, something in psychic apprehension.Supposing that they went
into the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius.He had a
trained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the
tax office, in the water office, and in the various other city
departments which made or marred city improvements.If Lester would
come in with him he would make him some money--how much he would
not say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood.Would
Lester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could
be worked out?After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to
accede to Mr.Ross's request; he would look into this thing.CHAPTER XLIX


The peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the
basic elements of success.Ross had the experience and the
judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost
anything he undertook.He was in a field which was entirely familiar.He could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear
sufficiently long to lay his facts before him.Lester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he
was interested in real estate propositions.He
considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of
it.He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he
had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.As it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.It was easy
to verify his statements, and he did verify them in several
particulars.There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and
here were his ads in the daily papers.It seemed not a bad way at all
in his idleness to start and make some money.The trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he
was not as keen for details as he had formerly been.All his work in
recent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been
with large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of
supplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which
were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details
which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the
world.In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and
nickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were
shut off.Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had
consistently done so.When it came to this particular proposition his
interest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of
selling.He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and
that land values must rise.What was now far-out prairie property
would soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban
residence territory.Scarcely any land that could be purchased now
would fall in value.It might drag in sales or increase, but it
couldn't fall.He knew it of his own
judgment to be true.The several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were
the life or health of Mr.Ross; the chance that some obnoxious
neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as
residence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might
reduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real
estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the
failure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.For several months he studied the situation as presented by his new
guide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was
reasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were
netting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new
proposition.The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the
land, which was taken over under an operative agreement between
himself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was
any of this land left to sell.The next thing was to raise twelve
thousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then
to furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and
unconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the
improvement work which had been planned.It seemed that hard and soft
earth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always
flourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas
departments had to be "seen" and "fixed" before certain other
improvements could be effected.Ross attended to all this, but the
cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and
Lester heard it all.After the land was put in shape, about a year after the original
conversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper
advertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began
to call at once for the third payment.Lester disposed of an
additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to
follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.Up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture.Ross had
certainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the
various details.It was given a
rather attractive title--"Inwood," although, as Lester noted,
there was precious little wood anywhere around there.But Ross assured
him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by
the name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been
made to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for
the deed.The first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the
form of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big
constituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and
Thirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay
out a new packing area for itself.The papers explained that the
company intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth
Street and west of Ashland Avenue.This was the territory that was
located due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the
packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight
the prospects of any budding real estate deal.He decided, after quick
deliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property
heavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be
disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.He laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be
advisable.They had already expended six thousand dollars in
advertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was
spent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal
residence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the
home-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful
suburbs of the city.A few lots were sold, but the
rumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent
and deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population
neighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.To say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put
it mildly.Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his
earthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied
up here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual
depreciation in value to face.He suggested to Ross that the area
might be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole
enterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not
so sanguine.He had had one or two failures of this kind before.He
was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the
beginning.If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black
shadow--and he wanted no more to do with it.Other real estate
men, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.Some three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's
hammer.Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,
recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise
friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.CHAPTER L


While the real estate deal was in progress Mrs.She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,
and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's
irregular mode of life.The question whether or not he was really
married to Jennie remained an open one.The garbled details of
Jennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up
as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of
her, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any
voice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears.She hated to think
that Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself.He had let nearly
a year slip by without doing anything.In two more years his chance
would be gone.He had said to her in London that he was without many
illusions.Did he really love her, or was he just
sorry for her?Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing
one on Drexel Boulevard."I'm going to take a house in your town this
winter, and I hope to see a lot of you," she wrote to Lester."I'm
awfully bored with life here in Cincinnati.After Europe it's
so--well, you know.You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her.Her
daughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring."Lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and
uncertainty.Would she
foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie?That meant that Jennie would have to
be eliminated.He would have to make a clean breast of the whole
affair to Letty.Then she could do as she pleased about their future
intimacy.Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing
a vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as
well have it out with her.Just at this time he
was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and
consequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a
little confidential.He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his
troubles."You know, Lester," said Letty, by way of helping him to his
confession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and
soda for him, and departed--"that I have been hearing a lot of
things about you since I've been back in this country.Aren't you
going to tell me all about yourself?You know I have your real
interests at heart.""What have you been hearing, Letty?""Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that
you're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs.Kane which
doesn't interest me very much.Aren't you going
to straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs
to you?It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of
course, you are very much in love.Lester paused and deliberated before replying."I really don't know
how to answer that last question, Letty," he said."Sometimes I think
that I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not.I'm going to
be perfectly frank with you.I was never in such a curious position in
my life before.You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say
what I think of you," he smiled."But anyhow, I can talk to you
frankly."I thought as much," she said, as he paused."And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my
mind just what to do about it.When I first met Jennie I thought her
the most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.""That speaks volumes for my charms at that time," interrupted his
vis-a-vis."Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this," he smiled."Tell me one thing," she questioned, "and then I won't."There was something about her so--"

"Love at first sight," again interpolated Letty foolishly."Are you going to let me tell this?"I can't help a twinge or two.""Well, anyhow, I lost my head.I thought she was the most perfect
thing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world.I thought that I could just take her, and
then--well, you know.I didn't
think that would prove as serious as it did.I never cared for any
other woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know
whether I wanted to marry you.I thought I didn't want to marry any
woman.I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after
a while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate."Yes, I understand," replied his confessor."Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way.She's a woman
of a curious temperament.She possesses a world of feeling and
emotion.She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that
word, but she has natural refinement and tact.She's the most affectionate
creature under the sun.Her devotion to her mother and father was
beyond words.Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not
mine--is perfect.She hasn't any of the graces of the smart
society woman.She can't join in any
rapid-fire conversation.Some of
her big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel
that she is thinking and that she is feeling.""You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester," said Letty."She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all
that I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's
holding me.""Don't be too sure," she said warningly."Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal.The thing for me to
have done was to have married her in the first place.There have been
so many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've
rather lost my bearings.I
stand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a
great deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.If I don't marry her, I lose
everything outright in about two more years.Of course, I might
pretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie.I
can't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's
been the soul of devotion.Right down in my heart, at this minute, I
don't know whether I want to give her up.Honestly, I don't know what
the devil to do."Lester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and
looked out of the window.questioned Letty, staring at the
floor.She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on
his round, solid head.Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,
touched his shoulders."You certainly have
tied yourself up in a knot.But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it
will have to be cut.Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,
just as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?""It seems such an unkind thing to do," he replied."You must take some action, Lester dear," she insisted.Frankly, I
can't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in
that, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the
first place.I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to
me or not--I love you, and always shall love you.""I know it," said Lester, getting up.He took her hands in his, and
studied her face curiously."But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a
year," she continued."You're too much of a social figure to drift.You ought to get back into the social and financial world where you
belong.All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your
interest in the company.And if you
tell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure.If she cares for you,
as you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice.You can provide for her handsomely, of course.""It isn't the money that Jennie wants," said Lester, gloomily."Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live
better for having an ample income.""She will never want if I can help it," he said solemnly."You must leave her," she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.Why don't you make
up your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter?To tell
you the truth, I hate to do it.I'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.I've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,
my mother, any one.But somehow you have always seemed closer to me
than any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as
though I ought to explain--I have really wanted to.I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the
circumstances.You're nearer to me intellectually and
emotionally than I thought you were.You want the truth,
don't you?Now explain me to myself, if you
can.""I don't want to argue with you, Lester," she said softly, laying
her hand on his arm.I understand quite
well how it has all come about.I'm sorry--" she hesitated--"for Mrs.But she isn't the woman for
you, Lester; she really isn't.It seems so
unfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't.We
all have to stand on our merits.And I'm satisfied, if the facts in
this case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she
would see just how it all is, and agree.Why, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go.It would
hurt me, but I'd do it.It will hurt her, but she'll do it.Now, mark
you my words, she will.I think I understand her as well as you
do--better--for I am a woman.Oh," she said, pausing, "I
wish I were in a position to talk to her.Lester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness.She was
beautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.She paused, a little crestfallen but determined."This is the time to act," she repeated, her whole soul in her
eyes.She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that
she wanted him."Well, I'll think of it," he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,
he bade her good-by and went away.CHAPTER LI


Lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he
would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of
those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs
entered into his Hyde Park domicile.Gerhardt's health began rapidly
to fail.Little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties
about the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed.He lay in
his room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by
Vesta, and occasionally by Lester.There was a window not far from his
bed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the
surrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,
wondering how the world was getting on without him.He suspected that
Woods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as
well as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in
his delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or
was not giving them enough heat.A score of little petty worries,
which were nevertheless real enough to him.He knew how a house should
be kept.He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed
duties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right.Jennie
made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted
wool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,
thick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often.He
preferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and
ask Jennie how things were getting along."I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller
is doing.He's not giving us any heat," he would complain."I bet I
know what he does.He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets
what the fire is doing until it is almost out.The beer is right there
where he can take it.You don't know what kind
of a man he is.Jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that
the man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if
he did drink a little beer it would not matter.Gerhardt would
immediately become incensed."That is always the way," he declared vigorously.You are always so ready to let things go if I am not
there.How do you know he is a nice man?If you don't watch
him he will be just like the others, no good.You should go around and
see how things are for yourself.""All right, papa," she would reply in a genial effort to soothe
him, "I will.Don't you
want a cup of coffee now and some toast?""No," Gerhardt would sigh immediately, "my stomach it don't do
right.I don't know how I am going to come out of this."Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of
considerable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and
suggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but
he told Jennie that she must not expect too much."You know he is
quite well along in years now.If he were twenty
years younger we might do a great deal for him.As it is he is quite
well off where he is.He may get up and be
around again, and then he may not.I
have never any care as to what may happen to me.Jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was
pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such
comfortable circumstances.It soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and
Jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and
sisters.She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter
from him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the
danger was an immediate one.He went on to say that George was in
Rochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the
Sheff-Jefferson Company, he thought.Martha and her husband had gone
to Boston.Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside
the city.William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.Veronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected
with a wholesale drug company in Cleveland."She never comes to see
me," complained Bass, "but I'll let her know."They
were very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.George wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his
father was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from
time to time how he was getting along.William, as he told Jennie some
time afterward, did not get her letter.The progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution
preyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they
had been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close
together.Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast
daughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was
concerned.She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.Now that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in
an evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was "all right," asking
how he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner.As he grew
weaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.One day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and
kissed it.He was feeling very weak--and despondent.She looked
up in astonishment, a lump in her throat."You're a good girl, Jennie," he said brokenly.I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man."Oh, papa, please don't," she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.I'm the one who has been all
wrong.""No, no," he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and
cried.He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair."There, there," he
said brokenly, "I understand a lot of things I didn't.She left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried
her eyes out.She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible.But
after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and
they spent a number of happy hours together, just talking.Once he
said to her, "You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy.If it
wasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass."Jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath."You'll get
stronger, papa," she said.She was so glad she had been able to make him
comfortable these last few years.As for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate."Well, how is it to-night?"he would ask the moment he entered the
house, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to
see how the old man was getting along."He looks pretty well," he
would tell Jennie."He's apt to live some time yet.Vesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come
to love him dearly.She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb
him too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his
door open, and play for him on the piano.Lester had bought her a
handsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room
and play for him.At times he wearied of everything and everybody save
Jennie; he wanted to be alone with her.She would sit beside him quite
still and sew.She could see plainly that the end was only a little
way off.Gerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the
various arrangements contingent upon his death.He wished to be buried
in the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out
on the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to
officiate."Just my black suit and those
Sunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie.Jennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would.One day at four
o'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead.Jennie
held his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he
opened his eyes to smile at her."I don't mind going," he said, in
this final hour."Don't talk of dying, papa," she pleaded.The finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected
Jennie deeply.Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt
had appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and
counselor.She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,
honest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a
troublesome family and lead an honest life.Truly she had been his one
great burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to
the end.She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had
lied.Telegrams were sent to all the children.Bass wired that he was
coming, and arrived the next day.The others wired that they could not
come, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote.The Lutheran minister
was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service.A
fat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details.Some
few neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most
faithful--and on the second morning following his death the
services were held.Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to
the little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the
rather dry services.He listened wearily to the long discourse on the
beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when
reference was made to a hell.Bass was rather bored, but considerate.He looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man.Only
Jennie wept sympathetically.She saw her father in perspective, the
long years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw
wood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,
the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in
Thirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in
Lorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.Gerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days."Oh, he was a good man," she thought.They sang
a hymn, "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God," and then she sobbed.He was moved to the danger-line himself
by her grief."You'll have to do better than this," he whispered."My
God, I can't stand it.I'll have to get up and get out."Jennie
quieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being
broken between her and her father was almost too much.At the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had
immediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin
lowered and the earth shoveled in.Lester looked curiously at the bare
trees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned
up at this simple graveside.There was no distinction to this burial
plot.It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,
but so long as he wanted it, it was all right.He studied Bass's keen,
lean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for
himself.Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store
successfully.He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said
to himself again, "Well, there is something to her."The woman's
emotion was so deep, so real."There's no explaining a good woman," he
said to himself.On the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked
of life in general, Bass and Vesta being present."Jennie takes things
too seriously," he said.Life isn't as
bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings.We all have our
troubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less.We
can't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one
else."I can't help it," said Jennie."I feel so sorry for some
people.""Jennie always was a little gloomy," put in Bass.He was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how
beautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world.He was
thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally
thought.At one time he thought Jennie
was a hopeless failure and no good."You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come
without going to pieces this way," said Lester finally.Jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window.There was
the old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt.Just think, she
would never see him any more.They finally turned into the drive and
entered the library.Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.She wondered curiously
where she would be when she died.CHAPTER LII


The fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to
Lester, except as it affected Jennie.He had liked the old German for
his many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him
one way or the other.He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days
to help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he
decided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the
problem plainly before her.It would be easier now, for Jennie had
been informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal.She
was also aware of his continued interest in Mrs.Lester did
not hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms
with her.Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring
Jennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie
understood quite clearly that it was not to be.Now that her father
was dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;
she was afraid that Lester might not marry her.Certainly he showed no
signs of intending to do so.By one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had
reached the conclusion that something should be done.He did not, for
one moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he
did not care to try--but he did think that some influence might
be brought to bear on Jennie.If
Lester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he
did not intend to do so.Suppose that some responsible third person
were to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of
course, the offer of an independent income?Might she not be willing
to leave Lester, and end all this trouble?After all, Lester was his
brother, and he ought not to lose his fortune.Robert had things very
much in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be
the proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and
well-meaning, even if he was a lawyer.He might explain to Jennie very
delicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose
if he continued to maintain his connection with her.If Lester had
married Jennie, O'Brien would find it out.A liberal provision would
be made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars.O'Brien and gave
him his instructions.As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's
estate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of
Lester's ultimate decision.On reaching the city, he called
up Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town
for the day.He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his
card to Jennie.She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite
unconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most
blandly.he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his
head."I am, as you see by my card, Mr.O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &
O'Brien," he began."We are the attorneys and executors of the late
Mr.You'll think it's
rather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's
will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.These provisions are so important that I think
you ought to know about them--that is if Mr.I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them
makes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't."He paused, a
very question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an
interrogation."I don't quite understand," said Jennie."I don't know anything
about the will.If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose
Mr.Now, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly.Then you
can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.Jennie seated
herself, and Mr.O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers."I need not say to you, of course, that
there was considerable opposition on the part of Mr.Kane's father, to
this--ah--union between yourself and his son.""I know--" Jennie started to say, but checked herself.She was
puzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.Kane senior died," he went on, "he indicated to
your--ah--to Mr.Lester Kane, that he felt this way.In his
will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his
property which made it rather hard for his son,
your--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.Ordinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane
Manufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million
dollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which
now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars.Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit
this property.But owing to the conditions which
your--ah--which Mr.Lester Kane
cannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with
a--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed."O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in
their sockets.In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he
was considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance.He could
see quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all
opposition.He continued to study her furtively as he sat there
waiting for her to speak.she finally asked, her nerves becoming
just a little tense under the strain of the silence."I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that," he went on."The
subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very
difficult.I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of
the executors under the will of Mr.I know how keenly
your--ah--how keenly Mr.I know how
keenly you will probably feel about it.But it is one of those very
difficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over
somehow.And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you
that Mr.Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,
unless"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--"he
saw fit to separate from--ah--you" he paused to get
breath--"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,
only a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on
condition that he should marry you.""I should add,"
he went on, "that under the will he was given three years in which to
indicate his intentions.He paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but
she only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,
distress, unhappiness.Lester was sacrificing his
fortune for her.His recent commercial venture was an effort to
rehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position.The
recent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of
dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained.He was
unhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never
told her.So his father had really disinherited him!O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself.He was very sorry for
her, now that he saw the expression of her face."I'm sorry," he said, when he saw that she was not going to make
any immediate reply, "that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate
news.It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this
moment, I assure you.I bear you no ill will personally--of
course you understand that.The family really bears you no ill will
now--I hope you believe that.As I told your--ah--as I
told Mr.Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most
unfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for
his father, I could do nothing.I really think it best that you should
know how things stand, in order that you may help your--your
husband"--he paused, significantly--"if possible, to some
solution.It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other
members of his family, that he should lose all this money."Jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor."He mustn't lose it," she said; "it isn't fair
that he should.""I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs.Kane,"
he went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's
wife, without hesitation."I may as well be very frank with you, and
say that I feared you might take this information in quite another
spirit.Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very
clannish.Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a
very proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are
rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family
connections.They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,
and--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not
generally satisfactory.As you know, there had been so much talk in
the last few years that Mr.Kane senior did not believe that the
situation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was
concerned.He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the
first place.One of the conditions of his will was that if your
husband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the
proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his
rightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at
all--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he
must--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not
intentionally so--marry you."It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.This whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at
every step.There was only one solution to the unfortunate
business--she could see that plainly.She must leave him, or he
must leave her.Lester living on ten
thousand dollars a year!He was thinking that Lester
both had and had not made a mistake.Why had he not married her in the
first place?"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this
connection, Mrs.Kane," he went on softly and easily."I see now that
it will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a
way constrained to make it.I hope you will take it in the manner in
which it is given.I don't know whether you are familiar with your
husband's commercial interests or not?""Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,
should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very
difficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide
to leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of
your own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,
say--ah--"

Jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her
hands as she went.In the event of your deciding to end the
connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might
name, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars"--Mr.O'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--"would be gladly
set aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you
would have it whenever you needed it."Please don't," said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express
herself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.But please don't talk to
me any more, will you?"O'Brien, coming
to a keen realization of her sufferings.It has been very hard for me to do
this--very hard.I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.I hope you will see fit
to say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable
that you should keep your own counsel in the matter.I value his
friendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry."O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat.Jennie touched
the electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came.Jennie
went back into the library, and Mr.O'Brien paced briskly down the
front walk.When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her
chin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish
rug resolving itself into some curious picture.She saw herself in a
small cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in
another world, and beside him Mrs.She saw this house vacant,
and then a long stretch of time, and then--

"Oh," she sighed, choking back a desire to cry.With her hands she
brushed away a hot tear from each eye."It must be," she said to herself in thought.And then--"Oh, thank God that papa
is dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this."CHAPTER LIII


The explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,
whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal
condition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr.O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small
manufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness
the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a
view to possible investment.When he came out to the house, interested
to tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he
was thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,
for Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had
reached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily.She was
brooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to
leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her
talk to him about it.She could not go without telling him what she
thought.She was absolutely convinced
that this one course of action--separation--was necessary
and advisable.She could not think of him as daring to make a
sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to.It was astonishing to her that he had let things go
along as dangerously and silently as he had.When he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her
accustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.she asked, using her customary phrase of
inquiry.She walked with him to the library, and he
poked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around
to survey the room generally.It was five o'clock of a January
afternoon.Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.As she came back he looked at her critically."You're not quite your
usual self, are you?"he asked, sensing something out of the common in
her attitude."Why, yes, I feel all right," she replied, but there was a peculiar
uneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor
which was unmistakable to him."I think I know better than that," he said, still gazing at her
steadily.She turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her
senses."There is something," she managed to
say."I know you have," he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that
there was much of grave import back of this.She was silent for a moment, biting her lips.She did not quite
know how to begin.Finally she broke the spell with: "There was a man
here yesterday--a Mr."He came to talk to me about you and your father's will."She paused, for his face clouded immediately."Why the devil should
he be talking to you about my father's will!""Please don't get angry, Lester," said Jennie calmly, for she
realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything
were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem."He
wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making," she went on."He
wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you
would lose your inheritance."What the devil does he mean by
putting his nose in my private affairs?"This is some
of Robert's work.Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling
in my affairs?This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!"He
was in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin
and sulphurous eyes.He came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:

"Well."He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a
year.That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing
at all.If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all
of a million and a half.Don't you think you had better leave me
now?"She had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,
but it came out as a natural climax to the situation.She realized
instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with
an emphatic "no."If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would
delay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning."I don't see that," he retorted irritably."I don't see that
there's any need for either interference or hasty action.What I
object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs."Jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead
of affection.To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or
his leaving her.To him this recent interference was obviously the
chief matter for discussion and consideration.The meddling of others
before he was ready to act was the terrible thing.She had hoped, in
spite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time
they had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had
endured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that
she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real
separation, though some seeming separation might be necessary.He had
not married her, of course, but then there had been so many things
against them.Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown
that he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her
go.She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with
him so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this
feeling, she knew also that she did.He could
not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively.He could
care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he
could not care enough to keep her if something more important
appeared.She was in a quandary, hurt,
bleeding, but for once in her life, determined.Whether he wanted to
or not, she must not let him make this sacrifice.She must leave
him--if he would not leave her.It was not important enough that
she should stay."Don't you think you had better act soon?"she continued, hoping
that some word of feeling would come from him."There is only a little
time left, isn't there?"Jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear
that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her
greatly.It was hard for her to know what to do or say.Lester was so
terrible when he became angry.Still it ought not to be so hard for
him to go, now that he had Mrs.Gerald, if he only wished to do
so--and he ought to.His fortune was so much more important to
him than anything she could be."Don't worry about that," he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his
brother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him.I don't know what I want to do yet.I like the effrontery of
these people!But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly
ready?"He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the
trouble to be civil.He was forgetting all about her and what she was
feeling.He hated his brother Robert for this affront.He would have
enjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,
singly and collectively.The question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up
again at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her
thoughts and quiet her nerves.They could not talk very freely because
of Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two."I could take a little cottage somewhere," she suggested softly,
hoping to find him in a modified mood.I would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.""I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie," he
persisted.I don't know that I'm going to do
anything of the sort.I don't know what I'm going to do."He was so
sour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.Vesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in
so grim a mood.Jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,
for he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish.It was not fair to herself, or kind, or
decent."Oh yes, Lester, you must," she pleaded, at a later time."I won't
talk about it any more, but you must.I won't let you do anything
else."There were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in
fact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at
breakfast, but not always in words.She was sure that he should be made to
act.Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was
all the more certain that he should act soon.Just how to go about it
she did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him
make up his mind.She would be happy, she assured herself--she
would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.He was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his
gift of love.He really did not love her--could not perhaps,
after all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.But his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had
affected his attitude.She could see
now how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle.He was too
decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too
really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he
should, or hers--but he ought to."You must decide, Lester," she kept saying to him, from time to
time.Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back
to me."I'm not ready to come to a decision," was his invariable reply."I
don't know that I want to leave you.This money is important, of
course, but money isn't everything.I can live on ten thousand a year
if necessary."Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester," she
argued.Look how much it costs to run this house
alone.And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let
you think of losing that."Where would you think of going if it came to that?"Do you remember that little town of
Sandwood, this side of Kenosha?I have often thought it would be a
pleasant place to live.""I don't like to think of this," he said finally in an outburst of
frankness.The conditions have all been against
this union of ours.I suppose I should have married you in the first
place.Jennie choked in her throat, but said nothing."Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it," he
concluded.He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had
the money, and then--but he hated compromises and
subterfuges.It came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of
February, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could
find.She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she
wanted.After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally.And
he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for
the trouble they had caused him.O'Brien
shortly and talk things over.He wanted for his personal satisfaction
to tell him what he thought of him.At the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy
figure of Mrs.Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in
every sense of the word.He did not want to give her the broad reality
of full thought, but she was always there."Perhaps I'd better," he half concluded.When February came he was
ready to act.CHAPTER LIV


The little town of Sandwood, "this side of Kenosha," as Jennie had
expressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and
fifteen minutes by the local train.It had a population of some three
hundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered
over a pleasant area of lake-shore property.The houses were not worth more than from three to five
thousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously
constructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,
gave them a pleasing summery appearance.Jennie, at the time they had
passed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast
horses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,
set down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon
the summer water."I should like to live in a place like this some time," she had
said to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too
peaceful for him."I can imagine getting to the place where I might
like this, but not now.It came to her when
she thought that the world was trying.If she had to be alone ever and
could afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood.There
she would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole
with a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass
everywhere about.If she could have a little cottage in a place like
this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer
evening and sew.Vesta could play about or come home from school.She
might have a few friends, or not any.She was beginning to think that
she could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social
needs.Books were pleasant things--she was finding that
out--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,
and Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales.Vesta was coming to be quite
a musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined
in musical composition.She had a natural sense of harmony and a love
for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect
sentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite
well.Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only
fourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to.She was beginning to
show the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's
gentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of
spirit and innate executive capacity.She could talk to her mother in
a sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her
developing tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds
which Vesta was to explore.The nature of modern school life, its
consideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all
came to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes.Vesta was
evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not
irritably aggressive, but self-constructive.She would be able to take
care of herself.All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for
Vesta's future.The cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story
and a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between
which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda.The house
was long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a
row--facing the lake.There was a dining-room with windows
opening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for
books, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and
sunshine at all times.The plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet
square and ornamented with a few trees.The former owner had laid out
flower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of
various hardy plants and vines.The house was painted white, with
green shutters and green shingles.It had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie
might keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want
to do that.At first, she did not think she would take
anything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to
do as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection
of silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house."You have no idea what you will or may want," he said.A lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an
option for an additional five years, including the privilege of
purchase.So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be
generous.He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he
did not propose that she should.His one troublesome thought was, what
explanation was to be made to Vesta.He liked her very much and wanted
her "life kept free of complications."Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?"he
suggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was
abandoned as inadvisable.Later they agreed that business affairs made
it necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move.Later Vesta
could be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to
give.It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because
she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was
involved.He really did not care enough, as much as he
cared.The relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in
the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence
holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual
compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in
themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the
relationship itself.These days of final dissolution in which this
household, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant
activities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial
to both Jennie and Lester.On her part it was one of intense
suffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix
itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.For her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory
which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and
enduring scene.One of those chords--this home was her home,
united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each
person and every object.Now the time had come when it must cease.If she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like
this it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had
proved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material
considerations.Her love of life and of personality were free from the
taint of selfishness.She went about among these various rooms
selecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,
wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.Just to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an
evening!She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that
coffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked
just so.It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the
table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she
had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him.Now it
would not be necessary any more--not for him.When one is
accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an
evening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen
at eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo
of a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these
things, is keen with pain.These were the thoughts that were running
through Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.Lester on his part was suffering in another fashion.His was not
the sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but
of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that
he is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,
affection--to policy.Policy was dictating a very splendid course
of action from one point of view.Free of Jennie, providing for her
admirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of
affairs which come naturally with great wealth.He could not help
thinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been
accustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant
and delightful things she meant to him.The virtues which she
possessed were quite dear to his mind.He had gone over them time and
again.Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she
was suffering without making a sign.Her manner and attitude toward
him in these last days were quite the same as they had always
been--no more, no less.She was not indulging in private
hysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a
fortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while
wishing him to see another behind it.She was calm, gentle,
considerate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what
he would do, without irritating him by her inquiries.He was struck
quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and
he admired her.There was something to this woman, let the world think
what it might.It was a shame that her life was passed under such a
troubled star.The sound of its
voice was in his ears.It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.The last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that
neighbor, when having spread the information that they were going
abroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass
of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was
necessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile.Jennie had
visited Sandwood in company with Lester several times.He had
carefully examined the character of the place.He was satisfied that
it was nice but lonely.Spring was at hand, the flowers would be
something.She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work."Very well," he said, "only I want you to be comfortable."In the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs.Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own
attorney, Mr.Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share
of his father's securities on a given date.He had made up his mind
that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he
would do a number of other things equally ruthless.He would sit as a director in the United Carriage
Company--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to
keep him out.Gerald's money he would become a
controlling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his
brother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of
which his brother was now the leading adviser.What a different figure
he would be now from that which he had been during the past few
years!Jennie was depressed to the point of despair.When she first came here
and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the
threshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would
marry her.Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and
dream were a ruin.Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.Frissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in
storage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more.She realized
clearly that he would not come back.If he could do this thing now,
even considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away
later.Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course.Had not everything--everything
illustrated that to her?Love was not enough in this world--that
was so plain.One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to
fight and scheme, She did not want to do that.The day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was
at an end.Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood.He spent some
little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of
change--it was not so bad.He intimated that he would come again
soon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the
fact of the actual and spiritual separation.When Jennie saw him going
down the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure
clad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and
prosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die.She
had kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;
then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom.Vesta came after a time,
to seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided
to a dull ache.The new life was actually begun for her--a life
without Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.she thought, as she went
into the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her
own work.If it
were not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside
employment.Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay
madness.CHAPTER LV


The social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the
breaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in
the social and business spirit of Lester Kane.He had become rather
distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was
living with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with
authority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter
with the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing
himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and
commerce.It must be admitted that he was in
some respects a mentally altered Lester.Up to the time he had met
Jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known
defeat.To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen
only the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so
deluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big
affairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of
them and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,
could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which
is apt to befog the clearest brain.It is so hard for us to know what
we have not seen.It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not
experienced.Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and
persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which
creates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough
to him.It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity
blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that
he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,
that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a
public conviction; that he was wrong.The race spirit, or social
avatar, the "Zeitgeist" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as
something having a system in charge, and the organization of society
began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a
spiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart.He could not fly in
the face of it.The
people of his time believed that some particular form of social
arrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,
as he saw, readily become a social outcast.His own father and mother
had turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.Dear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created!Why, even
the fates seemed adverse.His real estate venture was one of the most
fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of.Were the gods
battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,
vigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still
forceful and worth while.And it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably
soured by what had occurred.He was feeling that he had been compelled
to do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life.It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had
manifested.Truly she had played a finer part than he.Worst of all,
his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity.He could
have lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the
million and more which was now his.He could have done without the
society, the pleasures of which had always been a lure.He could have,
but he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of
another woman.That was a question which always rose
before him.Wasn't she deliberately scheming under
his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his
wife?Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?Ought he
to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal
allegiance to Jennie?Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?He could not shut
out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.Material error in the first place was now being complicated with
spiritual error.He was attempting to right the first by committing
the second.He was
thinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the
old (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling
any happier.As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,
revengeful.If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use
her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he
hated to think he was marrying her for that.He took up his abode at
the Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,
sat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more
at peace with himself, more interested in life.But he did not change
his policy in regard to Jennie.Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's
rehabilitation.She waited tactfully some little time before sending
him any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park
address (as if she did not know where he was), asking, "Where are
you?"By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change
in his life.He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic
companionship, the companionship of a woman, of course.Social
invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that
his financial connections were so obviously restored.He had made his
appearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country
houses, the best sign that he was once more a single man.No reference
was made by any one to the past.Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and
see her.For months preceding his
separation from Jennie he had not gone near her.Even now he waited
until time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner.Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed
dinner-table.Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,
together with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from
England, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr.Berry
Dodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years.Gerald
and Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each
other thoroughly and are happy in each other's company."Aren't you
ashamed of yourself, sir," she said to him when he made his
appearance, "to treat me so indifferently?You are going to be
punished for this."I
suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right."What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?""Boil them in oil, I suppose.""Well, anyhow, that's more like."Be sure and tell me when you decide," he laughed, and passed on to
be presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs.Lester was always at his ease
intellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him.Presently he
turned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow."We
haven't seen you in--oh, when?Dodge is waiting to have a
word with you."Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude."Some time, that's sure," he replied easily."I'm living at the
Auditorium.""I was asking after you the other day.We were thinking of running up into Canada for some
hunting.He had seen Lester's election as a
director of the C. H.& D. Obviously he was coming back into the
world.But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs."Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after
this?"Gerald confidentially when the conversation was
brisk at the other end of the table."I am, indeed," he replied, "and shortly.Seriously, I've been
wanting to look you up.He felt as if he must talk with her; he
was feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made
hotel life objectionable.He felt as though he must find a
sympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here?Letty was
all ears for his troubles.She would have pillowed his solid head upon
her breast in a moment if that had been possible."Well," he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,
"what will you have me say in explanation?""I'm not so sure," he replied gravely."And I can't say that I'm
feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.""I knew how it would be with you.I can see you wading through this mentally, Lester.I have been
watching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind.These
things are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure
it's for the best.You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life.You
are not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am.You may
regret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other
thing quite as much and more.You couldn't work your life out that
way--now, could you?""I don't know about that, Letty.I've wanted to
come and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.The fight was outside--you know what I mean.""Yes, indeed, I do," she said soothingly.I don't know whether
this financial business binds me sufficiently or not.I'll be frank
and tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and
that's something.""She's comfortably provided for, of course," she commented rather
than inquired.She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.I've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here
on the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she
knows she can live anywhere she pleases.""I understand exactly how she feels, Lester.She is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we
have to give up the thing we love.But we can get over it, and we do.It will go hard at first, but after a
while she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward
you.""Jennie will never reproach me, I know that," he replied."I'm the
one who will do the reproaching.The trouble is with my particular turn of mind.I can't tell, for the
life of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is
habit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is
sympathy.I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in
the world.You're lonely living where you are, aren't you?""Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden?"I could come Thursday, for a few days."We can walk and talk things out
down there.She came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe."You're
such a solemn philosopher, sir," she observed comfortably, "working
through all the ramifications of things."I can't help it," he replied."Well, one thing I know--" and she tweaked his ear gently."You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can
help it," she said daringly."You're going to stay disentangled long
enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do.And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my
affairs.You could advise me so much better than my lawyer."He arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her
solemnly."I know what you want," he said doggedly.She
looked at him pleadingly, defiantly."You don't know what you're doing," he grumbled; but he kept on
looking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age
could be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection."You ought not to want to marry me.It won't be
worth anything in the long run.""It will be worth something to me," she insisted.Finally he drew her to him, and
put his arms about her waist.he said; "I'm not worth
it."No, I'll not," she replied.I don't care
what you think you are worth.""If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me," he returned."Oh," she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast."This is bad business," he thought, even as he held her within the
circle of his arms."It isn't what I ought to be doing."Still he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he
kissed her again and again.CHAPTER LVI


It is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to
Jennie after all but for certain influential factors.After a time,
with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his
hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware
that diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even
implied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement
whereby he and Jennie could be together.But he was haunted by the
sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the
form of Mrs.He was compelled to set over against his natural
tendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the
personality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most
significant and interesting figures on the social horizon.For think
as he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his
consciousness.The one polished, sympathetic,
philosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and
with the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,
sympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite
society, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely
things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an
exceptional woman.Her criticism
of Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth
while, but that conditions made it impolitic.On the other hand, union
with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations.He would be as happy with her as he would
be with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction
of knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more
significant figure than himself.It was not wise to delay either this
latter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking
it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not.He
had already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her.What
difference did it make if he did this also?She was possessed of
everything she could possibly want outside of himself.She had herself
deemed it advisable for him to leave.By such figments of the brain,
in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming
used to the idea of a new alliance.The thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in
some form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs.Circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental
quandary at this time.Alone he could do nothing save to make visits
here and there, and he did not care to do that.He was too indifferent
mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he
enjoyed and which a woman like Mrs.Their home then, wherever it
was, would be full of clever people.He would need to do little save
to appear and enjoy it.She understood quite as well as any one how he
liked to live.She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.There were so many things they could do together nicely.He visited
West Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested.He gave himself
over to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives.Her house was
quite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so.She talked
to him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why
she wished him to intervene in this and that matter.She did not wish
him to be much alone.She did not want him to think or regret.She
came to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care.With
the others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually
became rumored about that he would marry her.Because of the fact that
there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty
decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair.She
wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,
and then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had
subsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his
sake."Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?"she asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that
marriage would eventually follow.Then we can come
back in the fall, and take a house on the drive."Lester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe
wave of self-reproach had passed.He was still doubtful, but he
preferred to stifle his misgivings."Very well," he replied, almost
jokingly."Only don't let there be any fuss about it."she exclaimed, looking over at
him; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and
chatting."I've thought about it a long while," he replied.She came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his
shoulders."I can scarcely believe you said that," she said, looking at him
curiously.But my, what a
trousseau I will prepare!"He smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was
a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was
because he was getting old.CHAPTER LVII


In the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the
markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move.It
seemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.Despite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved
with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.Constantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they
had never separated.In the mornings when she woke it was with
the sense that he must be beside her.At night as if she could not go
to bed alone.He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of
course he would not come.Again there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a
change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly.The
explanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.This little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,
was not without her surmises and misgivings.Vesta recalled that her
mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she
was born.She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the
Sunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to
her at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about
it, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it.Lester's
disappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last
two or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she
could hurt her in unexpected ways.Jennie was finally compelled to
tell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving
her, solely because she was not of his station.Vesta listened soberly
and half suspected the truth.She felt terribly sorry for her mother,
and, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and
courageous.She refused outright the suggestion of going to a
boarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could.She
found interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see
plays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's
criticisms on her drawing and modeling.She found a few friends in the
excellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add
lightness and gaiety to the cottage life.Jennie, through her growing
appreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn
toward her.Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta.That prop
would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.There was also her history to account for to the residents of
Sandwood.In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life
it is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something
must be said.People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no
more than butchers and bakers.By degrees one must account for this
and that fact, and it was so here.She could not say that her husband
was dead.She had to say that she had left
him--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who
would permit him to return.This put her in an interesting and
sympathetic light in the neighborhood.It was the most sensible thing
to do.She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting
what denouement to her life she could not guess.Sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and
this, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace.There
was the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a
never-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the
surrounding country.Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one
of the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park.Other household
pets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta
named Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had
grown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate.There was
also a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom
she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance.There was a singing
thrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the
part of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish.So this little household
drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the
undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.There was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his
departure; he was too busy following up the threads of his new
commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a
state of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present
circumstances, could mean nothing.He preferred to let matters rest
for the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and
calmly of how things were going.Daniel went back to the garden.He did this after the silence of a
month, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial
affairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was
the truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large
part of the time in the future.He inquired after Vesta and the
condition of affairs generally at Sandwood."I may get up there one of
these days," he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and
Jennie knew that he did not.Another month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,
not so long as the first one.Jennie had written him frankly and
fully, telling him just how things stood with her.She concealed
entirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the
life very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood.She
expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for
him, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been
settled."You mustn't think of me as being unhappy," she said in one
place, "for I'm not.I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I
wouldn't be happy if it were any other way.Lay out your life so as to
give yourself the greatest happiness, Lester," she added.Whatever you do will be just right for me.Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her
generosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret
unhappiness.It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking
that final step.The written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!After six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on
his part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.One morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw
among the society notes the following item:

The engagement of Mrs.Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,
to Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,
was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on
Tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends.For a few minutes she sat perfectly
still, looking straight ahead of her.She had known that it must
come, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.Had not she
herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way?The idea was
objectionable to her.And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers
absolutely.In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were
railway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which
yielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to
her direct.Jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as
she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry.Life was
always doing this sort of a thing to her.If she went out in the world and earned her own living
what difference would it make to him?Here she was walled in this little place, leading an
obscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying
life in its fullest and freest sense.Her eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in
pieces within her.She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom
of a trunk, and turned the key upon it.CHAPTER LVIII


Now that his engagement to Mrs.Gerald was an accomplished, fact,
Lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the
new order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best.He was sorry
for Jennie--very sorry.Gerald; but there was a
practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for
both Lester and the girl.And
Jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly
thing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so
unselfishly.Gerald, because of her indifference to the
late Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her
youth in getting Lester at last--even though a little
late--she was intensely happy.She could think of nothing finer
than this daily life with him--the places they would go, the
things they would see.Lester Kane
the following winter was going to be something worth remembering.And
as for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.Lester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs.He
said that he had no explanation to make.It wouldn't be worth anything
if he did make it.He
thought he ought to let her (Jennie) know.He
wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart.He
would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable
for her as possible.And would she
remember him affectionately to Vesta?She ought to be sent to a
finishing school.She knew that Lester had
been drawn to Mrs.Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in
London.She was glad to write and tell him
so, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.Lester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines
than the written words conveyed.Her fortitude was a charm to him even
in this hour.In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to
do, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way.She was a
noble and a charming woman.If everything else had been all right he
would not be going to marry Mrs.The ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of
Mrs.Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating.Lester was a poor
example of the faith he occasionally professed.He was an agnostic,
but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as
well be married in it.Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been
invited.There were
jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti.While the
guests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to
escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.Fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the
guests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time
the happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the
rice throwers made no difference.More champagne was opened; then the
starting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair
were at last safely off."Well, now you have me," said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down
beside him into a seat, "what of it?""This of it," she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him
fervently.In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later
on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.In the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood.The original
announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in
April, and she had kept close watch for additional information.Finally she learned that the wedding would take place on April
fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being
high noon.In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it
all hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a
lighted window at Christmas time.On the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock
to strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and
looking on.She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,
the carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the
ceremony--all.Telepathically and psychologically she received
impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were
going to take.The papers had stated that they would spend their
honeymoon in Japan.She could see her now--the new Mrs.Kane that ever was, lying in his arms.There was a solid lump in
her throat as she thought of this.She sighed to herself,
and clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good.She was just as
miserable as before.When the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed
was done and nothing could change it.Vesta was sympathetically aware
of what was happening, but kept silent.She too had seen the report in
the newspaper.When the first and second day after had passed Jennie
was much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the
inevitable.But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old
familiar ache.Then there were months before they would be back again,
though, of course, that made no difference now.Only Japan seemed so
far off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near
her--somewhere in the city.The spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October.One
chilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache.When
Jennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her
mother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,
Vesta went to her room and lay down.The following morning she had a
slight fever.This lingered while the local physician, Dr.Emory,
treated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which
there were several cases in the village.This doctor told Jennie that
Vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but
it might be that she would have a severe siege.Mistrusting her own
skill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained
nurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination
of fear, longing, hope, and courage.Now there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid.Jennie
hesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in
New York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter
there.But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,
pronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no
one could tell what would happen.Lester had been so fond of Vesta.The letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it
arrived he was on his way to the West Indies.Jennie was compelled to
watch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,
realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not
supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us
can give.There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and
both the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she
became weaker.Emory that her heart and kidneys had
become affected.There came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was
imminent.The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in
her opinion.Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is
prayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one
issue--that Vesta should get well.The child had come so close to
her during the last few years!She was
beginning to realize clearly what her life had been.And Jennie,
through her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility.She
knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children.If
Lester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she
would have been glad to have others.Again, she had always felt that
she owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up
to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing.Jennie had been so
happy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,
graceful, intelligent womanhood.Emory
finally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to
consider the case with him.He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,
understanding."The treatment has been correct," he
said."Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the
strain.Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than
others."It was agreed that if within three days a change for the
better did not come the end was close at hand.No one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was
subjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should
know.She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but
scarcely thinking.She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's
altering states.If there was the least improvement she felt it
physically.If there was a decline her barometric temperament
registered the fact.Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and
sympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood
quite well how she was feeling.She had co-operated with the nurse and
doctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal
as possible."Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs.Kane," she would
say to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or
wandering to and fro, wondering what to do.Lord bless you, don't you
think I know?I've been the mother of seven and lost three.Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one
day and cried.And she led her
to her sleeping-room.She came back after a few minutes
unrested and unrefreshed.Finally one midnight, when the nurse had
persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came
a hurried stirring in the sick-room.Jennie was lying down for a few
minutes on her bed in the adjoining room.Davis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's
condition--standing close beside her.She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.Vesta's pale, waxen face told the story.She was breathing faintly,
her eyes closed."She's very weak," whispered the nurse.The moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck
one.Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several
times, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing
Vesta's lips.At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the
weak body--a profound sigh."There, there, you poor dear," she
whispered when she began to shake.Jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still
warm hand."Oh no, Vesta," she pleaded."There, dear, come now," soothed the voice of Mrs."Can't
you leave it all in God's hands?Can't you believe that everything is
for the best?"Jennie felt as if the earth had fallen.There
was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.CHAPTER LIX


This added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to
throw Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she
had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and
affection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park.It was
really weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone.The
emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not
seem like Vesta.Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of
motion, the subtle radiance of health?Only this pale,
lily-hued shell--and silence.Jennie had no tears to shed; only a
deep, insistent pain to feel.If only some counselor of eternal wisdom
could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing
truth--there are no dead.Davis, and some others among the
neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate.Davis sent a
telegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,
there was no response.The house was looked after with scrupulous care
by others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself.She
walked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or
liked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing
over the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more.She gave
instructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in
the Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's
death, had purchased a small plot of ground there.She also expressed
her wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage
Grove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say
a few words at the grave.There were the usual preliminary services at
the house.The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first
epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates
sang "Nearer My God to Thee."There were flowers, a white coffin, a
world of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away.The
coffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and
finally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.She was dazed, almost to the point
of insensibility.Five of her neighborhood friends, at the
solicitation of Mrs.At the
grave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one
might have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering.She
returned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not
stay long.She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near
Vesta and Gerhardt.After the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future.She fixed
her mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need
to.She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at
once to obtain the training which was required.He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and
live with her.Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also
in ignorance of his whereabouts.She finally concluded that she would
try to get work in a store.She
could not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors
sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her.Miserable as
she was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,
and looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near
the Cemetery of the Redeemer.It also occurred to her that she might
adopt a homeless child.There were a number of orphan asylums in the
city.Some three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago
with his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an
additional note telling him that Vesta was dead.He was truly grieved,
for his affection for the girl had been real.He was very sorry for
Jennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.Perhaps
he could suggest something which would help her.He took the train to
Sandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago.He went
there, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called
again and found her in.When the boy presented his card she suffered
an upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that
with which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of
him was greater.Lester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the
restoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think
deeply of what he had done.His original feeling of doubt and
dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted.It did not ease
him any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was
always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.Without it she was like a rudderless
boat on an endless sea, and he knew it.She needed him, and he was
ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of
self-preservation and his desire for material advantage.To-day as the
elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he
knew now that no act of his could make things right.He had been to
blame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing
to stick by a bad bargain.The best
thing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the
best of his sympathy and advice."Hello, Jennie," he said familiarly as she opened the door to him
in her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and
suffering had wrought.She was thinner, her face quite drawn and
colorless, her eyes larger by contrast."I'm awfully sorry about
Vesta," he said a little awkwardly."I never dreamed anything like
that could happen."It was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her
since Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact.It touched
her that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not
speak.Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks."Don't cry, Jennie," he said, putting his arm around her and
holding her head to his shoulder.I've been sorry for a
good many things that can't be helped now."Beside papa," she said, sobbing."Too bad," he murmured, and held her in silence.She finally gained
control of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her
eyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down."I'm so sorry," he went on, "that this should have happened while I
was away.I would have been with you if I had been here.I suppose you
won't want to live out at Sand wood now?""I can't, Lester," she replied.I didn't want to be a bother to those people
out there.I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby
maybe, or get something to do."That isn't a bad idea," he said, "that of adopting a baby.It
would be a lot of company for you.You know how to go about getting
one?""You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?""I think there's something more than that," he replied
thoughtfully."There are some formalities--I don't know what they
are.They try to keep control of the child in some way.You had better
consult with Watson and get him to help you.Pick out your baby, and
then let him do the rest.Lester saw that she needed companionship badly."He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come.Bass said he was
married," she added."There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to
come and live with you?""I might get William, but I don't know where he is.""Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park," he suggested,
"if you want a house here in Chicago?I see some nice cottages out
that way.Just rent until you see how well you're
satisfied."Jennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester.It was
good of him to take this much interest in her affairs.She wasn't
entirely separated from him after all.She asked
him how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he
was going to stay in Chicago.All the while he was thinking that he
had treated her badly.He went to the window and looked down into
Dearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention.The
great mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying
pedestrians, seemed like a puzzle.It was
growing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there."I want to tell you something, Jennie," said Lester, finally
rousing himself from his fit of abstraction."I may seem peculiar to
you, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my
way.I've thought of you right along since I left.I thought it good
business to leave you--the way things were.I thought I liked
Letty well enough to marry her.From one point of view it still seems
best, but I'm not so much happier.I was just as happy with you as I
ever will be.It isn't myself that's important in this transaction
apparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation.I
don't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more
or less pawns.We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over
which we have no control.""After all, life is more or less of a farce," he went on a little
bitterly.The best we can do is to hold our
personality intact.It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do
with it."Jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew
it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry
for her."Don't worry over me, Lester," she consoled."I'm all right; I'll
get along.It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used
to being alone."I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed," he continued
eagerly.Mrs.--Letty
understands that.When you get settled I'll
come in and see how you're fixed.I'll come around here again in a few
days.You understand how I feel, don't you?"He took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own."Don't
worry," he said."I don't want you to do that.You're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind.I'm pretty bad, but I'm
not all bad."You probably are happy since--"

"Now, Jennie," he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her
hand, her arm, her shoulder."Want to kiss me for old times' sake?"She put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,
then kissed him.Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak."You'd better go now," she said firmly.He went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to
remain; she was still the one woman in the world for him.And Jennie
felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its
finality.She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and
ethical entanglements of the situation.She was not, like so many,
endeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting
universe in a mess of strings called law.Lester still cared for her a
little.She had hoped once
that he might want her only.Since he did not, was his affection worth
nothing?She could not think, she could not feel that.CHAPTER LX


The drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and
Jennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their
respective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship
which their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to
foreshadow.Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;
he walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.Jennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful.There was a simple
cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson
Park, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little
foster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home
for the Friendless--as her sole companion.J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of
Kane.Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the
occupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where
parties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times
almost pyrotechnic succession.Lester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and
well-entertained existence.He had cut from his list of acquaintances
and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or
overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which
to him was a memory merely.He was a director, and in several cases
the chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important
financial and commercial organizations of the West--The United
Traction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The
United Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the
First National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal
importance.He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The
United Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by
counsel--Mr.Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its
affairs.He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven
years.He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.Louise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances
were practically strangers.The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien
had nothing whatever to do with his affairs.The truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little
phlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life.He
could not make out what it was all about.In distant ages a queer
thing had come to pass.There had started on its way in the form of
evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced
itself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,
to organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and
birds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man.Man, on
his part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing
himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by
means of union and organization with other men.Here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of
talent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now
scarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him.But he could
not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any
more than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and
constructive and practical as the next one's.He might have been born
poor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next
one--not more so.Why should he complain, why worry, why
speculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own
volition, whether he would or no.And was there any need
for him to disturb himself about it?He fancied at
times that it might as well never have been started at all."The one
divine, far-off event" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any
basis in fact.Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.Jennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose
Perpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life.She
had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr.She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read
some in a desultory way.Her mind had never grasped the nature and
character of specialized knowledge.History, physics, chemistry,
botany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain
as they were in Lester's and Letty's.Instead there was the feeling
that the world moved in some strange, unstable way.Apparently no one
knew clearly what it was all about.Some
believed that the world had been made six thousand years before; some
that it was millions of years old.Was it all blind chance, or was
there some guiding intelligence--a God?Almost in spite of
herself she felt there must be something--a higher power which
produced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the
trees, the grass.If at times life seemed
cruel, yet this beauty still persisted.The thought comforted her; she
fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.It has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.She liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.She was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably
large, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her
cares.Her hair was still of a rich
brown, but there were traces of gray in it.Her neighbors spoke of her
as sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable.They knew nothing of her
history, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before
that in Cleveland.She was very reticent as to her past.Jennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care
of sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse.But she was
obliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people
were wanted.She also thought that some charitable organization might
employ her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which
was then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,
only to help others to help themselves.She believed in giving, and
was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who
asked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency
after another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke.She
finally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she
succeeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as
Henry--Henry Stover.Her support was assured, for her income was
paid to her through a trust company.She had no desire for speculation
or for the devious ways of trade.The care of flowers, the nature of
children, the ordering of a home were more in her province.One of the interesting things in connection with this separation
once it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for
these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had
never met.He had followed
his success since he had left Jennie with interest.Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an
ideal companion for his brother.He knew by many signs and tokens that
his brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's
attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane
Company, did not like him.Still they had never been so far apart
mentally--certainly not in commercial judgment.Lester was
prosperous now.And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to
come to his senses--and with the best intentions.There were
mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends.He
wondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with
him.Time passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the
friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore
in order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied.He knew
its location from hearsay and description.When he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to
him.Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a
conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in
Cincinnati.That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he
would not like to dine with him at the Union Club.He was only in town
for a day or two, and he would like to see him again.There was some
feeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to
him about.On the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown
study.He had never really been healed of the wound that his father
had given him.He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert
had deserted him so summarily.He realized now that the stakes his
brother had been playing for were big.But, after all, he had been his
brother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would
not have done as he had done; at least he hoped not.Then he thought he would
write and say no.But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear
what he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came
over him; he decided to write yes.They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but
the damage had been done.Could a broken bowl be mended and called
whole?It might be called whole, but what of it?He wrote and intimated that he would come.On the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to
remind him of the engagement.Lester listened curiously to the sound
of his voice."All right," he said, "I'll be with you."At noon he
went down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union
Club, the two brothers met and looked at each other again.Robert was
thinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer.His
eyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either
side.Lester was noticeably of
another type--solid, brusque, and indifferent.Men spoke of
Lester these days as a little hard.Robert's keen blue eyes did not
disturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way.He saw
his brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and
interpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly.He
could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years.Lester
was stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking
like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.Lester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye.The latter
shifted a little, for he was restless.He could see that there was no
loss of that mental force and courage which had always been
predominant characteristics in Lester's make-up."I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester," Robert remarked,
after they had clasped hands in the customary grip."It's been a long
time now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?"I don't
often go to bed with anything."We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but
the others are around more or less.I suppose your wife is all right,"
he said hesitatingly.Lester eyed him without a change of expression.They drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired
after the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene.He admitted frankly
that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays."The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,"
said Robert finally, "is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel
Company.You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I
notice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you.The management isn't right--we all know that.We need
a practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to
pay properly.I have voted my stock with yours right along because the
propositions made by Watson have been right.He agrees with me that
things ought to be changed.Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares
held by Rossiter's widow.That with yours and mine would give us
control of the company.I would like to have you take them, though it
doesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family.You
can put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing
come out right."Watson had told him
that Robert's interests were co-operating with him.Lester had long
suspected that Robert would like to make up.This was the olive
branch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a
million and a half."That's very nice of you," said Lester solemnly."It's a rather
liberal thing to do."Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester," replied Robert, "I
never did feel right about that will business.I never did feel right
about that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have
happened.I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at
that--but I can't help telling you how I feel.I've been pretty
ambitious in the past.I was pretty ambitious just about the time that
father died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was
afraid you might not like it.I have thought since that I ought not to
have done it, but I did.I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more
about that old affair.This other thing though--"

"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation," put in Lester
quietly."Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of
that in it.I know these things don't matter very much to you now.I
know that the time to do things was years ago--not now.Still I
thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition.Frankly, I thought it might patch up
matters between us."Yes," said Lester, "we're brothers."He was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation.How
much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past?Robert had
practically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie
had been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling
angry.It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth
of his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,
and now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.It hurt him--Lester--a little."I can't see it, Robert," he said finally and determinedly."I can
appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer.But I can't
see the wisdom of my taking it.We can make all the changes you suggest if you take
the stock.I'm perfectly
willing to talk with you from time to time.This
other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound.You
want my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that.I don't
hold any grudge against you.He admired Lester in
spite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester
was doing to him now."I don't know but what you're right, Lester," he admitted finally."I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though.I wanted to
patch up this matter of feeling between us.I won't say anything more
about it.You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?""I don't expect to," replied Lester."If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us."I'll be glad to," he said, without emotion.But he remembered that
in the days of Jennie it was different.They would never have receded
from their position regarding her."Well," he thought, "perhaps I
can't blame them."I'll have to leave you soon," he said, looking at his
watch."I ought to go, too," said Robert."Well, anyhow," he
added, as they walked toward the cloakroom, "we won't be absolute
strangers in the future, will we?""I'll see you from time to time."There was a sense of
unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his
brother walking briskly away.Why was it that
there was so much feeling between them--had been even before
Jennie had appeared?Then he remembered his old thoughts about "snaky
deeds."That was what his brother lacked, and that only.He was not
crafty; not darkly cruel, hence.On his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition
to, but also of sympathy for, his brother.He was not so terribly
bad--not different from other men.What would he
have done if he had been in Robert's place?He could see now how it all came about--why he had
been made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the
great fortune."It's the way the world runs," he thought.CHAPTER LXI


The days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according
to that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore
years and ten.It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by
mouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths.As a
matter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically
built to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so
if he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an
illusion, and that there is no death.Yet the race-thought, gained
from what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of
man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily
registered.Lester was one of those who believed in this formula.He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost
to live--perhaps not so long.No complaint or resistance would issue from
him.Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.He admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be
so.That it might all be one he sometimes suspected.It was very much
like a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad
dream.All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from
hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material
proposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,
individuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's
social functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a
philosopher.She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,
phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance.All the
winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb
Lester.He refused to budge from his
beliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,
still believing, if he were gotten away at all.He refused to do
anything save as he always said, "Look the facts in the face" and
fight.He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but
only in a stubborn, resisting way.His plan was to resist every effort
to coerce him to the last ditch.If he had to let go in the end he
would when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go
were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.His views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in
creature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of
everything.If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he
was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over.If he
traveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way.He did not
want argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it.Every
one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all.She would chuck him under the chin
mornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he
was a brute, but a nice kind of a brute."Yes, yes," he would growl.You're a seraphic suggestion of
attenuated thought.""No; you hush," she would reply, for at times he could cut like a
knife without really meaning to be unkind.Then he would pet her a
little, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized
that she was more or less dependent upon him.It was always so plain
to her that he could get along without her.For reasons of kindliness
he was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her
presence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her
easily enough.It was something, in
so shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a
quantity as this bear-man.It was like being close to a warmly glowing
lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold.Lester was not
afraid of anything.He felt that he knew how to live and to die.It was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its
solid, material manifestation at every point.Having his financial
affairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big
companies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the
strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to "make good," he had
leisure for living.He and Letty were fond of visiting the various
American and European watering-places.He gambled a little, for he
found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting
sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he
took more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes
to it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends.He was
inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight
whiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and
effervescent white wines.When he drank he could drink a great deal,
and he ate in proportion.Nothing must be served but the
best--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything
that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only
a high-priced chef was worth while.They had found an old cordon
bleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the
great dry goods princes, and this man he engaged.He cost Lester a
hundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only
had one life to live.The trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,
improved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite
end.If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively
meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same
attitude to the end.It would have led him to a stolid indifference to
the social world of which now necessarily he was a part.He would have
drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have
accepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in
the end would not have been so much better off than she was now.One of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes
transferred their residence to New York.Kane had become very
intimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or
nine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of
her activities to New York.She finally did so, leasing a house in
Seventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue.She installed a novelty
for her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English
fashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.Lester smiled at her vanity and love of show."You talk about your democracy," he grunted one day."You have as
much democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all."I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation."Do you call a butler and doorman in
red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?""Maybe not the necessity exactly,
but the spirit surely.You're the first one to
insist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the
order of things.""Oh, I don't mean that literally.But you demand
perfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know
it.""Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?"I'm as democratic in spirit as
any woman.Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as
possible for comfort's sake, and so do you.Don't you throw rocks at
my glass house, Mister Master.Yours is so transparent I can see every
move you make inside.""I'm democratic and you're not," he teased; but he approved
thoroughly of everything she did.She was, he sometimes fancied, a
better executive in her world than he was in his.Drifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of
this curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking
no physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,
quick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of
substance was clogging every essential function.His liver, kidneys,
spleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed
for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination.In
the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy.His kidneys
were weak, and so were the arteries of his brain.By dieting, proper
exercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty
or ninety.As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into
a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.It so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a
cruise with a party of friends.Lester, in order to attend to some
important business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he
arranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the
Christmas holidays.He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms
at the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two
years before and was now living permanently in New York.One late November day, after having attended to a number of details
and cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with
what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in
the intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other
weakness, either of the blood or of some organ.He suffered great
pain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied.There were
bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were
also administered.He experienced some relief, but he was troubled
with a sense of impending disaster.He had Watson cable his
wife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill.A
trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door
to prevent annoyance of any kind.It was plain that Letty could not
reach Chicago under three weeks.He had the feeling that he would not
see her again.Curiously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because
he had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking
about her constantly at this time.He had intended to go out and see
her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and
before he left the city.He had asked Watson how she was getting
along, and had been informed that everything was well with her.She
was living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said.Lester
wished he could see her.This thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better.He was
suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that
seemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak.Several
times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to
relieve him of useless pain.After one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told
him to send the nurse away, and then said: "Watson, I'd like to have
you do me a favor.Stover if she won't come here to see me.Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)
away for the afternoon, or while she's here.If she comes at any other
time I'd like to have her admitted."He wondered what the world
would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with
so prominent a man.The latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.He called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence.He found
her watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his
unusual presence."I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs.Stover," he said,
using her assumed name.Kane is quite sick at
the Auditorium.His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I
wouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him.He wanted me
to bring you, if possible."Why yes," said Jennie, her face a study.An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen.But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she
had had several nights before.It had seemed to her that she was out
on a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like
a fog, or a pall of smoke.She heard the water ripple, or stir
faintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared.It
was a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were
her mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out.Her
mother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in
life.She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then
suddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was
Lester.He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never
seen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, "Well, we
must go now."The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over
her, and she cried, "Oh, don't leave me, mamma!"But her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and
the boat was gone.She woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.She stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up
in the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone.A great
sense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted
her.Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr.She went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her
thoughts.She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly
woman, well dressed and shapely.She had never been separated mentally
from Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her.She
was always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were
together.Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted
her in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as
the cave-man seized his mate--by force.Now she longed to do what
she could for him.For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.He loved her--he loved her, after all.The carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky
down-town district.It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was
escorted to Lester's room.He had talked
little, leaving her to her thoughts.In this great hotel she felt
diffident after so long a period of complete retirement.As she
entered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic
eyes.He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its
growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed.He looked at her
curiously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection
shining in them--weary as they were.His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like
a knife.She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and
pressed it."I'm so sorry, Lester," she murmured.You're not
very sick though, are you?You must get well, Lester--and soon!""Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad," he said."I don't feel right
about this business.I don't seem able to shake it off.But tell me,
how have you been?""Oh, just the same, dear," she replied.You mustn't
talk like that, though.You're going to be all right very soon
now."He shook his head, for he
thought differently."Sit down, dear," he went on, "I'm not worrying
about that.He
sighed and shut his eyes for a minute.She drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and
took his hand.It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send
for her.Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and
gratitude of her heart.At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he
looked!"I can't tell what may happen," he went on.I've wanted to see you again for some time.We are living in New York, you know.You're a little stouter,
Jennie.""Yes, I'm getting old, Lester," she smiled."Oh, that doesn't make any difference," he replied, looking at her
fixedly.A slight twinge of pain
reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through.He couldn't
stand many more paroxysms like the last one."I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again," he observed,
when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again."I've
always wanted to say to you, Jennie," he went on, "that I haven't been
satisfied with the way we parted.It wasn't the right thing, after
all.I wish now, for my own
peace of mind, that I hadn't done it.""Don't say that, Lester," she demurred, going over in her mind all
that had been between them.This was such a testimony to their real
union--their real spiritual compatibility.I wouldn't
have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune.I've been a lot better satisfied as it is.It's been hard, but,
dear, everything is hard at times."The thing wasn't worked out right
from the start; but that wasn't your fault.I'm glad I'm here to do it.""Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't," she pleaded.Why, when I think--" she
stopped, for it was hard for her to speak.She was choking with
affection and sympathy.She was recalling the
house he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of
Gerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness."Well, I've told you now, and I feel better.You're a good woman,
Jennie, and you're kind to come to me this way."It seems strange, but you're the
only woman I ever did love truly.It was the one thing she had waited for
all these years--this testimony.It was the one thing that could
make everything right--this confession of spiritual if not
material union."Oh, Lester,"
she exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand."Oh, they're lovely," she answered, entering upon a detailed
description of their diminutive personalities.He listened
comfortably, for her voice was soothing to him.When it came time for her to go he seemed
desirous of keeping her."I can stay just as well as not, Lester," she volunteered."You needn't do that," he said, but she could see that he wanted
her, that he did not want to be alone.From that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of
the hotel.CHAPTER LXII


The end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside
almost constantly.The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a
relief and company, but the physician was inclined to object.Lester,
however, was stubborn."This is my death," he said, with a touch of
grim humor."If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own
way."Watson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage.He had never seen
anything like it before.There were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the
newspaper.Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go
to Chicago.Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to
Lester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers.The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be
talked to much.When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, "Imogene
has changed a good deal."Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the
afternoon Lester died.He had been meditating whether anything more
could be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.Certainly it was useless to leave her more money.He had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival
might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain.Before
relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was
dead.It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble
which killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the
brain.Jennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,
was beside herself with grief.He had been a part of her thought and
feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had
died.She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any
one, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in
some degree.She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in
tears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her
insensible to pain.He looked so strong--her Lester--lying
there still in death.His expression was unchanged--defiant,
determined, albeit peaceful.Kane that she
would arrive on the Wednesday following.Watson that it was to be transferred to
Cincinnati, where the Paces had a vault.Because of the arrival of
various members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she
could do nothing more.The final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the
anomalies of existence.Kane by wire that
the body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral
held from there.Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry
Dodge, Imogene's husband; Mr.Midgely, and three other citizens of
prominence were selected as pall-bearers.Louise and her husband came
from Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati.The house was full
to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it
expedient to call.Because of the fact that Lester and his family were
tentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual
of that Church was carried out.It was curious to see him lying in the
parlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning
sepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen
fingers.He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the
Kane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find
anything strange in this.She was greatly distraught, for her
love, like Jennie's, was sincere.She left her room that night when
all was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of
the burning candles Lester's beloved features.Tears trickled down her
cheeks, for she had been happy with him.She caressed his cold cheeks
and hands.No
one told her that he had sent for Jennie.Meanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was
enduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss.Through
all these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every
circumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her.He had
come, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone
again.Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had
gone?She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed
her of his removal to Mrs.Midgely's residence, and of the fact that
he was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial.The last
ceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman
Catholic churches of the South Side, St.Michael's, of which the
Midgelys were members.She would have liked so much to have
had him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave
occasionally, but this was not to be.She was never a master of her
fate.She thought of him as being taken
from her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though
distance made any difference.She decided at last to veil herself
heavily and attend the funeral at the church.The paper had explained
that the services would be at two in the afternoon.Then at four the
body would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the
members of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati.A little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the
church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in
black, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner.She
was a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark
and empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but
after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began
to toll solemnly.Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and
white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side
of the altar.A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated
that the service was to be accompanied by music.Some loiterers,
attracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and
citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.Never in her life had
she been inside a Catholic church.The gloom, the beauty of the
windows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles
impressed her.She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,
and mystery.Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified
by this scene.As the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of
altar-boys.The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,
bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross.In the hands of each
subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle.The
priest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either
hand, followed.The procession passed out the entrance into the
vestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began
a mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and
peace.Then, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.There came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,
reading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester
in a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the
pall-bearers, who kept an even pace.Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her
nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current.She
did not know any of these men.Of the long company of notables who followed two by
two she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in
times past.Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind
the coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.He gave a quick glance to either side,
evidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he
turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on.Jennie looked with all
her eyes, her heart gripped by pain.She seemed so much a part of this
solemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.The procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.A white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was
put over it, and the great candles were set beside it.There were the
chanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with
holy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the
mumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its
Catholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin.Jennie was
overawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression
imperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite
loss.To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were
beautiful.They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made
it vibrate through the depths of her being.She was as a house filled
with mournful melody and the presence of death.Kane was sobbing convulsively
also.When it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was
borne to the station.All the guests and strangers departed, and
finally, when all was silent, she arose.Now she would go to the depot
also, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train.They
would have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in
Vesta's case.She took a car, and a little later she entered the
waiting-room of the depot.She lingered about, first in the concourse,
where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,
and then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of
proceedings.She finally observed the group of immediate relatives
waiting--Mrs.Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,
and the others.She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,
though it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and
intuition.No one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was
Thanksgiving Eve.Throughout the great railroad station there was a
hum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs
from the thought of pleasures to come.Announcers were
calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the
time of its departure drew near.Jennie heard with a desperate ache
the description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than
once, slowly and melodiously emphasized."Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,
Buffalo, and New York."There were cries of trains for "Fort Wayne,
Columbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East," and then finally
for "Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points
South."Several times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the
waiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which
separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the
coffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on
the train.There was a baggage porter pushing a
truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.On it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the
honors of wood, and cloth, and silver.There was no thought on the
part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here.He
could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to
her mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from
her beloved.Was not her life a patchwork
of conditions made and affected by these things which she
saw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit?She had
evidently been born to yield, not seek.This panoply of power had been
paraded before her since childhood.What could she do now but stare
vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by?Daniel travelled to the kitchen.She looked through the
grating, and once more there came the cry of "Indianapolis,
Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South."A long red train,
brilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a
dining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen
comfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped.A great black engine,
puffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.As the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in
blue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.All she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.All she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then
it would all be over.There were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making
for the Pullman cars in the rear.They had said their farewells to
their friends.A trio of assistants "gave a
hand" at getting the great wooden case into the car.Jennie saw it
disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.There were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the
baggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine
sounded.There was the insistent calling of "all aboard" from this
quarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move.Its
bell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a
great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.The fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming
furnace door to throw in coal.Jennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her
face white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one
thought in her mind--they were taking his body away.A leaden
November sky was ahead, almost dark.She looked, and looked until the
last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in
the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the
far-stretching yard."Yes," said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the
anticipation of coming pleasures."We're going to have a great time
down there.Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella."Jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle
around her.Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down
which she was steadily gazing.There
were those two orphan children to raise.They would marry and leave
after a while, and then what?Days and days in endless reiteration,
and then--?K. did the work, his
long fingers deft and skillful--while Mrs.Rosenfeld knelt by the bed
with her face buried; while Sidney sat, dazed and bewildered, on her
little chair inside the door; while night nurses tiptoed along the
corridor, and the night watchman stared incredulous from outside the
door.When the two great rectangles that were the emergency ward windows
had turned from mirrors reflecting the room to gray rectangles in the
morning light; Johnny Rosenfeld opened his eyes and spoke the first
words that marked his return from the dark valley.When it was clear that the boy would live, K. rose stiffly from the
bedside and went over to Sidney's chair."He's all right now," he said--"as all right as he can be, poor lad!"How strange that you should know such a thing.The internes, talking among themselves, had wandered down to their
dining-room for early coffee.Wilson was giving a few last instructions
as to the boy's care.'s hand and
held it to her lips.The iron repression of the night, of months indeed,
fell away before her simple caress."My dear, my dear," he said huskily."Anything that I can do--for
you--at any time--"

It was after Sidney had crept like a broken thing to her room that
Carlotta Harrison and K. came face to face.Johnny was quite conscious
by that time, a little blue around the lips, but valiantly cheerful."More things can happen to a fellow than I ever knew there was!"he
said to his mother, and submitted rather sheepishly to her tears and
caresses."You were always a good boy, Johnny," she said."Just you get well
enough to come home.I'll take care of you the rest of my life.We will
get you a wheel-chair when you can be about, and I can take you out in
the park when I come from work.""I'll be passenger and you'll be chauffeur, ma."Le Moyne is going to get your father sent up again.With sixty-five
cents a day and what I make, we'll get along.""Oh, Johnny, if I could see you coming in the door again and yelling
'mother' and'supper' in one breath!"The meeting between Carlotta and Le Moyne was very quiet.She had been
making a sort of subconscious impression on the retina of his mind
during all the night.It would be difficult to tell when he actually
knew her.When the preparations for moving Johnny back to the big ward had been
made, the other nurses left the room, and Carlotta and the boy were
together.K. stopped her on her way to the door.Edwardes here; my name is Le Moyne.""I have not seen you since you left St."No; I--I rested for a few months.""I suppose they do not know that you were--that you have had any
previous hospital experience.""I shall not tell them, of course."And thus, by simple mutual consent, it was arranged that each should
respect the other's confidence.There had been a time, just before dawn,
when she had had one of those swift revelations that sometimes come at
the end of a long night.The boy was
very low, hardly breathing.Her past stretched behind her, a series of
small revenges and passionate outbursts, swift yieldings, slow remorse.She would have given every hope she had in the
world, just then, for Sidney's stainless past.She hated herself with that deadliest loathing that comes of complete
self-revelation.And she carried to her room the knowledge that the night's struggle had
been in vain--that, although Johnny Rosenfeld would live, she had gained
nothing by what he had suffered.The whole night had shown her the
hopelessness of any stratagem to win Wilson from his new allegiance.She
had surprised him in the hallway, watching Sidney's slender figure
as she made her way up the stairs to her room.Never, in all his past
overtures to her, had she seen that look in his eyes.CHAPTER XIX


To Harriet Kennedy, Sidney's sentence of thirty days' suspension came
as a blow.K. broke the news to her that evening before the time for
Sidney's arrival.The little household was sharing in Harriet's prosperity.Katie had
a helper now, a little Austrian girl named Mimi.And Harriet had
established on the Street the innovation of after-dinner coffee.It was
over the after-dinner coffee that K. made his announcement."What do you mean by saying she is coming home for thirty days?"Not ill, although she is not quite well.The fact is, Harriet,"--for
it was "Harriet" and "K."by this time,--"there has been a sort of
semi-accident up at the hospital.It hasn't resulted seriously, but--"

Harriet put down the apostle-spoon in her hand and stared across at him."There was a mistake about the medicine, and she was blamed; that's
all.""She'd better come home and stay home," said Harriet shortly."I hope it
doesn't get in the papers.This dressmaking business is a funny sort of
thing.One word against you or any of your family, and the crowd's off
somewhere else.""There's nothing against Sidney," K. reminded her.It seems it's a
mere matter of discipline.Somebody made a mistake, and they cannot let
such a thing go by.But he believes, as I do, that it was not Sidney."However Harriet had hardened herself against the girl's arrival, all she
had meant to say fled when she saw Sidney's circled eyes and pathetic
mouth.And took her corseted
bosom.For the time at least, Sidney's world had gone to pieces about her.All
her brave vaunt of service faded before her disgrace.When Christine would have seen her, she kept her door locked and asked
for just that one evening alone.But after Harriet had retired, and
Mimi, the Austrian, had crept out to the corner to mail a letter back to
Gratz, Sidney unbolted her door and listened in the little upper hall.Harriet, her head in a towel, her face carefully cold-creamed, had gone
to bed; but K.'s light, as usual, was shining over the transom.Sidney
tiptoed to the door."May I come in and talk to you?"He turned and took a quick survey of the room.The picture was against
the collar-box.But he took the risk and held the door wide.Sidney came in and sat down by the fire.By being adroit he managed to
slip the little picture over and under the box before she saw it.It is
doubtful if she would have realized its significance, had she seen it."I've been thinking things over," she said."It seems to me I'd better
not go back.""That would be foolish, wouldn't it, when you have done so well?And,
besides, since you are not guilty, Sidney--"

"I didn't do it!"I can't keep on; that's all there is to it.All
last night, in the emergency ward, I felt it going.I
kept saying to myself: 'You didn't do it, you didn't do it'; and all the
time something inside of me was saying, 'Not now, perhaps; but sometime
you may.'"Poor K., who had reasoned all this out for himself and had come to the
same impasse!"To go on like this, feeling that one has life and death in one's hand,
and then perhaps some day to make a mistake like that!"She looked up at
him forlornly."I am just not brave enough, K.""Wouldn't it be braver to keep on?Her world was in pieces about her, and she felt alone in a wide and
empty place.And, because her nerves were drawn taut until they were
ready to snap, Sidney turned on him shrewishly."I think you are all afraid I will come back to stay.Nobody really
wants me anywhere--in all the world!Not at the hospital, not here, not
anyplace."When you say that nobody wants you," said K., not very steadily, "I--I
think you are making a mistake."The only person
who ever really wanted me was my mother, and I went away and left her!"She scanned his face closely, and, reading there something she did not
understand, she  suddenly."No; I do not mean Joe Drummond."If he had found any encouragement in her face, he would have gone on
recklessly; but her blank eyes warned him."If you mean Max Wilson," said Sidney, "you are entirely wrong.He's not
in love with me--not, that is, any more than he is in love with a
dozen girls.He likes to be with me--oh, I know that; but that doesn't
mean--anything else.Anyhow, after this disgrace--"

"There is no disgrace, child.""He'll think me careless, at the least."You say he likes to be with you.Sidney had been sitting in a low chair by the fire.She rose with a
sudden passionate movement.In the informality of the household, she,
had visited K. in her dressing-gown and slippers; and now she stood
before him, a tragic young figure, clutching the folds of her gown
across her breast."I worship him, K.," she said tragically."When I see him coming, I want
to get down and let him walk on me.I
know the very way he rings for the elevator.When I see him in the
operating-room, cool and calm while every one else is flustered and
excited, he--he looks like a god."Then, half ashamed of her outburst, she turned her back to him and stood
gazing at the small coal fire.It was as well for K. that she did not
see his face.For that one moment the despair that was in him shone in
his eyes.He glanced around the shabby little room, at the sagging bed,
the collar-box, the pincushion, the old marble-topped bureau under which
Reginald had formerly made his nest, at his untidy table, littered with
pipes and books, at the image in the mirror of his own tall figure,
stooped and weary."You're sure it's not
just--glamour, Sidney?"Her voice was muffled, and he knew then that
she was crying.Tears, of course, except in the privacy
of one's closet, were not ethical on the Street."Give me a handkerchief," said Sidney in a muffled tone, and the little
scene was broken into while K. searched through a bureau drawer.Then:

"It's all over, anyhow, since this.If he'd really cared he'd have come
over to-night.Back in a circle she came inevitably to her suspension.She would never
go back, she said passionately.She was innocent, had been falsely
accused.If they could think such a thing about her, she didn't want to
be in their old hospital.K. questioned her, alternately soothing and probing.I have given him his medicines dozens of times.""Who else had access to the medicine closet?""Carlotta Harrison carried the keys, of course.I was off duty from four
to six.When Carlotta left the ward, the probationer would have them.""Have you reason to think that either one of these girls would wish you
harm?""None whatever," began Sidney vehemently; and then, checking
herself,--"unless--but that's rather ridiculous.""I've sometimes thought that Carlotta--but I am sure she is perfectly
fair with me.Even if she--if she--"

"Yes?"Wilson, I don't believe--Why, K., she wouldn't!"Murder, of course," said K., "in intention, anyhow.I'm only trying to find out whose mistake it was."Soon after that she said good-night and went out.She turned in the
doorway and smiled tremulously back at him."You have done me a lot of good.With a quick movement that was one of her charms, Sidney suddenly closed
the door and slipped back into the room.K., hearing the door close,
thought she had gone, and dropped heavily into a chair.said Sidney suddenly from behind him,
and, bending over, she kissed him on the cheek.The next instant the door had closed behind her, and K. was left alone
to such wretchedness and bliss as the evening had brought him.On toward morning, Harriet, who slept but restlessly in her towel,
wakened to the glare of his light over the transom."I wish you wouldn't go to
sleep and let your light burn!"K., surmising the towel and cold cream, had the tact not to open his
door."I am not asleep, Harriet, and I am sorry about the light.Before he extinguished the light, he walked over to the old dresser and
surveyed himself in the glass.Two nights without sleep and much anxiety
had told on him.He looked old, haggard; infinitely tired.Mentally he
compared himself with Wilson, flushed with success, erect, triumphant,
almost insolent.Nothing had more certainly told him the hopelessness
of his love for Sidney than her good-night kiss.He drew a long breath and proceeded
to undress in the dark.Joe Drummond came to see Sidney the next day.She would have avoided
him if she could, but Mimi had ushered him up to the sewing-room boudoir
before she had time to escape.She had not seen the boy for two months,
and the change in him startled her.He was thinner, rather hectic,
scrupulously well dressed.she said, and then: "Won't you sit down?"He dramatized himself, as he had that
night the June before when he had asked Sidney to marry him.He offered no conventional greeting whatever;
but, after surveying her briefly, her black gown, the lines around her
eyes:--

"You're not going back to that place, of course?""Then somebody's got to decide for you.The thing for you to do is to
stay right here, Sidney.Nobody here
would ever accuse you of trying to murder anybody."In spite of herself, Sidney smiled a little.It was a mistake about the
medicines.His love was purely selfish, for he brushed aside her protest as if she
had not spoken."You give me the word and I'll go and get your things; I've got a car of
my own now.""But, Joe, they have only done what they thought was right.Whoever made
it, there was a mistake.""You don't mean that you are going to stand for this sort of thing?Every time some fool makes a mistake, are they going to blame it on
you?"I can't talk to you
if you explode like a rocket all the time."Her matter-of-fact tone had its effect.He advanced into the room, but
he still scorned a chair."I guess you've been wondering why you haven't heard from me," he said."I've seen you more than you've seen me."The idea of espionage is always repugnant, and
to have a rejected lover always in the offing, as it were, was
disconcerting."I wish you would be just a little bit sensible, Joe.It's so silly of
you, really.It's not because you care for me; it's really because you
care for yourself.""You can't look at me and say that, Sid."He ran his finger around his collar--an old gesture; but the collar was
very loose."I'm just eating my heart out for you, and that's the truth.Everywhere I go, people say, 'There's the fellow Sidney
Page turned down when she went to the hospital.'I've got so I keep off
the Street as much as I can."Sidney was half alarmed, half irritated.This wild, excited boy was not
the doggedly faithful youth she had always known.It seemed to her
that he was hardly sane--that underneath his quiet manner and carefully
repressed voice there lurked something irrational, something she could
not cope with."But what do you want me to do?If you'd
only sit down--"

"I want you to come home.I just want
you to come back, so that things will be the way they used to be.Now
that they have turned you out--"

"They've done nothing of the sort."Because you love the hospital, or because you love somebody connected
with the hospital?"Sidney was thoroughly angry by this time, angry and reckless.She had
come through so much that every nerve was crying in passionate protest."If it will make you understand things any better," she cried, "I am
going back for both reasons!"But her words seemed, surprisingly
enough, to steady him."Then, as far as I am concerned, it's all over, is it?"Suddenly:--

"You think Christine has her hands full with Palmer, don't you?Well,
if you take Max Wilson, you're going to have more trouble than Christine
ever dreamed of.I can tell you some things about him now that will make
you think twice.""Every word that you say shows me how right I am in not marrying you,
Joe," she said."Real men do not say those things about each other under
any circumstances.I don't want you to
come back until you have grown up."He was very white, but he picked up his hat and went to the door."I guess I AM crazy," he said."I've been wanting to go away, but mother
raises such a fuss--I'll not annoy you any more."He reached in his pocket and, pulling out a small box, held it toward
her."Reginald," he said solemnly.Some boys caught
him in the park, and I brought him home."He left her standing there speechless with surprise, with the box in her
hand, and ran down the stairs and out into the Street.At the foot of
the steps he almost collided with Dr.I'm glad
you've made it up."CHAPTER XX


Winter relaxed its clutch slowly that year.March was bitterly cold;
even April found the roads still frozen and the hedgerows clustered with
ice.But at mid-day there was spring in the air.In the courtyard of the
hospital, convalescents sat on the benches and watched for robins.The
fountain, which had frozen out, was being repaired.Here and there on
ward window-sills tulips opened their gaudy petals to the sun.Harriet had gone abroad for a flying trip in March and came back laden
with new ideas, model gowns, and fresh enthusiasm.She carried out and
planted flowers on her sister's grave, and went back to her work with a
feeling of duty done.A combination of crocuses and snow on the ground
had given her an inspiration for a gown.She drew it in pencil on an
envelope on her way back in the street car.Grace Irving, having made good during the white sales, had been sent to
the spring cottons.The day she
sold Sidney material for a simple white gown, she was very happy.Once
a customer brought her a bunch of primroses.All day she kept them under
the counter in a glass of water, and at evening she took them to Johnny
Rosenfeld, still lying prone in the hospital.On Sidney, on K., and on Christine the winter had left its mark heavily.Christine, readjusting her life to new conditions, was graver, more
thoughtful.'s guidance, she
had given up the "Duchess" and was reading real books.She was thinking
real thoughts, too, for the first time in her life.Sidney, as tender as ever, had lost a little of the radiance from her
eyes; her voice had deepened.Where she had been a pretty girl, she
was now lovely.She was back in the hospital again, this time in the
children's ward.K., going in one day to take Johnny Rosenfeld a basket
of fruit, saw her there with a child in her arms, and a light in her
eyes that he had never seen before.It hurt him, rather--things being as
they were with him.With the opening of spring the little house at Hillfoot took on fresh
activities.Tillie was house-cleaning with great thoroughness.She
scrubbed carpets, took down the clean curtains, and put them up again
freshly starched.It was as if she found in sheer activity and fatigue a
remedy for her uneasiness.The impeccable character of the little
house had been against it.Schwitter had a little bar and
served the best liquors he could buy; but he discouraged rowdiness--had
been known to refuse to sell to boys under twenty-one and to men who had
already overindulged.The word went about that Schwitter's was no place
for a good time.Even Tillie's chicken and waffles failed against this
handicap.By the middle of April the house-cleaning was done.One or two motor
parties had come out, dined sedately and wined moderately, and had gone
back to the city again.The
roads dried up, robins filled the trees with their noisy spring songs,
and still business continued dull.By the first day of May, Tillie's uneasiness had become certainty.Schwitter, coming in from the early milking, found her
sitting in the kitchen, her face buried in her apron.He put down the
milk-pails and, going over to her, put a hand on her head."I guess there's no mistake, then?""There's no mistake," said poor Tillie into her apron.He bent down and kissed the back of her neck.Then, when she failed to
brighten, he tiptoed around the kitchen, poured the milk into pans,
and rinsed the buckets, working methodically in his heavy way.The
tea-kettle had boiled dry.Then:--

"Do you want to see a doctor?""I'd better see somebody," she said, without looking up."And--don't
think I'm blaming you.As far as
that goes, I've wanted a child right along.It isn't the trouble I am
thinking of either."He made some tea
clumsily and browned her a piece of toast.When he had put them on one
end of the kitchen table, he went over to her again."I guess I'd ought to have thought of this before, but all I thought of
was trying to get a little happiness out of life.And,"--he stroked
her arm,--"as far as I am concerned, it's been worth while, Tillie.No
matter what I've had to do, I've always looked forward to coming back
here to you in the evening.Maybe I don't say it enough, but I guess you
know I feel it all right."Without looking up, she placed her hand over his."I guess we started wrong," he went on."You can't build happiness on
what isn't right.You and I can manage well enough; but now that there's
going to be another, it looks different, somehow."After that morning Tillie took up her burden stoically.The hope of
motherhood alternated with black fits of depression.She sang at her
work, to burst out into sudden tears.Schwitter had given up his nursery
business; but the motorists who came to Hillfoot did not come back.When, at last, he took the horse and buggy and drove about the country
for orders, he was too late.Other nurserymen had been before him;
shrubberies and orchards were already being set out.The second payment
on his mortgage would be due in July.By the middle of May they were
frankly up against it.Schwitter at last dared to put the situation into
words."We're not making good, Til," he said.We are too decent; that's what's the matter with us."With all her sophistication, Tillie was vastly ignorant of life."We'll have to keep a sort of hotel," he said lamely."Sell to everybody
that comes along, and--if parties want to stay over-night--"

Tillie's white face turned crimson."If it's bad weather, and they're married--"

"How are we to know if they are married or not?"But the
situation was not less acute.There were two or three unfurnished rooms
on the second floor.He began to make tentative suggestions as to their
furnishing.Once he got a catalogue from an installment house, and tried
to hide it from her.She burned it in the kitchen
stove.Schwitter himself was ashamed; but the idea obsessed him.Other people
fattened on the frailties of human nature.Two miles away, on the other
road, was a public house that had netted the owner ten thousand dollars
profit the year before.He was not as young as he had been; there was the expense of keeping
his wife--he had never allowed her to go into the charity ward at the
asylum.Now that there was going to be a child, there would be three
people dependent upon him.One night, after Tillie was asleep, he slipped noiselessly into his
clothes and out to the barn, where he hitched up the horse with nervous
fingers.Tillie never learned of that midnight excursion to the "Climbing Rose,"
two miles away.Lights blazed in every window; a dozen automobiles were
parked before the barn.From the bar came
the jingle of glasses and loud, cheerful conversation.When Schwitter turned the horse's head back toward Hillfoot, his
mind was made up.He would furnish the upper rooms; he would bring a
barkeeper from town--these people wanted mixed drinks; he could get a
second-hand piano somewhere.Tillie's rebellion was instant and complete.When she found him
determined, she made the compromise that her condition necessitated.She
could not leave him, but she would not stay in the rehabilitated little
house.When, a week after Schwitter's visit to the "Climbing Rose," an
installment van arrived from town with the new furniture, Tillie
moved out to what had been the harness-room of the old barn and there
established herself."I am not leaving you," she told him."I don't even know that I am
blaming you.But I am not going to have anything to do with it, and
that's flat."So it happened that K., making a spring pilgrimage to see Tillie,
stopped astounded in the road.The weather was warm, and he carried
his Norfolk coat over his arm.The little house was bustling; a dozen
automobiles were parked in the barnyard.The bar was crowded, and a
barkeeper in a white coat was mixing drinks with the casual indifference
of his kind.There were tables under the trees on the lawn, and a new
sign on the gate.Even Schwitter bore a new look of prosperity.Over his schooner of beer
K. gathered something of the story."I'm not proud of it, Mr.I've come to do a good many things
the last year or so that I never thought I would do.First I took Tillie away from her good position, and after
that nothing went right.Then there were things coming on"--he looked at
K. anxiously--"that meant more expense.I would be glad if you wouldn't
say anything about it at Mrs."I'll not speak of it, of course."It was then, when K. asked for Tillie, that Mr.Schwitter's unhappiness
became more apparent."She wouldn't stand for it," he said."She moved out the day I furnished
the rooms upstairs and got the piano."I--I'll take you
out there, if you would like to see her."K. shrewdly surmised that Tillie would prefer to see him alone, under
the circumstances."I guess I can find her," he said, and rose from the little table."If you--if you can say anything to help me out, sir, I'd appreciate it.Of course, she understands how I am driven.But--especially if you would
tell her that the Street doesn't know--"

"I'll do all I can," K. promised, and followed the path to the barn.Tillie received him with a certain dignity.The little harness-room
was very comfortable.A white iron bed in a corner, a flat table with
a mirror above it, a rocking-chair, and a sewing-machine furnished the
room."I wouldn't stand for it," she said simply; "so here I am.There being but one chair, she sat on the bed.The room was littered
with small garments in the making.She made no attempt to conceal them;
rather, she pointed to them with pride.He's got a
hired girl at the house.It was hard enough to sew at first, with me
making two right sleeves almost every time."Then, seeing his kindly eye
on her: "Well, it's happened, Mr."You're going to be a very good mother, Tillie."K., who also needed cheering
that spring day, found his consolation in seeing her brighten under the
small gossip of the Street.The deaf-and-dumb book agent had taken on
life insurance as a side issue, and was doing well; the grocery store at
the corner was going to be torn down, and over the new store there
were to be apartments; Reginald had been miraculously returned, and was
building a new nest under his bureau; Harriet Kennedy had been to Paris,
and had brought home six French words and a new figure.Outside the open door the big barn loomed cool and shadowy, full of
empty spaces where later the hay would be stored; anxious mother hens
led their broods about; underneath in the horse stable the restless
horses pawed in their stalls.From where he sat, Le Moyne could see only
the round breasts of the two hills, the fresh green of the orchard the
cows in a meadow beyond."I've had more time to think since I
moved out than I ever had in my life before.When the
noise is worst down at the house, I look at the hills there and--"

There were great thoughts in her mind--that the hills meant God, and
that in His good time perhaps it would all come right."The hills help a lot," she repeated.Tillie's work-basket lay near him.He picked up one of the
little garments.In his big hands it looked small, absurd."I--I want to tell you something, Tillie.Don't count on it too much;
but Mrs.Schwitter has been failing rapidly for the last month or two."I wanted to see things work out right for you."All the color had faded from Tillie's face."You're very good to me, Mr."I don't wish the poor
soul any harm, but--oh, my God!if she's going, let it be before the
next four months are over."K. had fallen into the habit, after his long walks, of dropping into
Christine's little parlor for a chat before he went upstairs.Those
early spring days found Harriet Kennedy busy late in the evenings, and,
save for Christine and K., the house was practically deserted.The breach between Palmer and Christine was steadily widening.She was
too proud to ask him to spend more of his evenings with her.On those
occasions when he voluntarily stayed at home with her, he was so
discontented that he drove her almost to distraction.Although she was
convinced that he was seeing nothing of the girl who had been with
him the night of the accident, she did not trust him.Not that girl,
perhaps, but there were others.Into Christine's little parlor, then, K. turned, the evening after he
had seen Tillie.She was reading by the lamp, and the door into the hall
stood open."Come in," she said, as he hesitated in the doorway."There's a brush in the drawer of the hat-rack--although I don't really
mind how you look."The little room always cheered K. Its warmth and light appealed to his
aesthetic sense; after the bareness of his bedroom, it spelled luxury.And perhaps, to be entirely frank, there was more than physical comfort
and satisfaction in the evenings he spent in Christine's firelit parlor.He was entirely masculine, and her evident pleasure in his society
gratified him.He had fallen into a way of thinking of himself as a sort
of older brother to all the world because he was a sort of older brother
to Sidney.The evenings with her did something to reinstate him in his
own self-esteem.It was subtle, psychological, but also it was very
human."Here's a chair, and here are
cigarettes and there are matches.But, for once, K. declined the chair.He stood in front of the fireplace
and looked down at her, his head bent slightly to one side."I wonder if you would like to do a very kind thing," he said
unexpectedly."Something much more trouble and not so pleasant."When she was with him, when his steady eyes
looked down at her, small affectations fell away.She was more genuine
with K. than with anyone else, even herself."Tell me what it is, or shall I promise first?""I want you to promise just one thing: to keep a secret."Christine was not over-intelligent, perhaps, but she was shrewd.That Le
Moyne's past held a secret she had felt from the beginning.I want you to go out to see her."The Street did not go out to see women in
Tillie's situation.She's going to have a child,
Christine; and she has had no one to talk to but her hus--but Mr.I'd really rather not go, K. Not,"
she hastened to set herself right in his eyes--"not that I feel any
unwillingness to see her.But--what in the
world shall I say to her?"It had been rather a long time since Christine had been accused
of having a kind heart.Not that she was unkind, but in all her
self-centered young life there had been little call on her sympathies."I wish I were as good as you think I am."Then Le Moyne spoke briskly:--

"I'll tell you how to get there; perhaps I would better write it."He moved over to Christine's small writing-table and, seating himself,
proceeded to write out the directions for reaching Hillfoot.Behind him, Christine had taken his place on the hearth-rug and stood
watching his head in the light of the desk-lamp."What a strong, quiet
face it is," she thought.Why did she get the impression of such a
tremendous reserve power in this man who was a clerk, and a clerk only?Behind him she made a quick, unconscious gesture of appeal, both hands
out for an instant.She dropped them guiltily as K. rose with the paper
in his hand."I've drawn a sort of map of the roads," he began."You see, this--"

Christine was looking, not at the paper, but up at him."I wonder if you know, K.," she said, "what a lucky woman the woman will
be who marries you?""I wonder how long I could hypnotize her into thinking that.""I've had time to do a little thinking lately," she said, without
bitterness.I've been looking back,
wondering if I ever thought that about him.I wonder--"

She checked herself abruptly and took the paper from his hand."I'll go to see Tillie, of course," she consented."It is like you to
have found her."Although she picked up the book that she had been reading
with the evident intention of discussing it, her thoughts were still on
Tillie, on Palmer, on herself.After a moment:--

"Has it ever occurred to you how terribly mixed up things are?Can you think of anybody on it that--that things
have gone entirely right with?""It's a little world of its own, of course," said K., "and it has plenty
of contact points with life.But wherever one finds people, many or few,
one finds all the elements that make up life--joy and sorrow, birth and
death, and even tragedy.That's rather trite, isn't it?""To a certain extent they make their own
fates.But when you think of the women on the Street,--Tillie,
Harriet Kennedy, Sidney Page, myself, even Mrs.Rosenfeld back in the
alley,--somebody else moulds things for us, and all we can do is to sit
back and suffer.I am beginning to think the world is a terrible place,
K. Why do people so often marry the wrong people?Why can't a man
care for one woman and only one all his life?Why--why is it all so
complicated?""There are men who care for only one woman all their lives.""You're that sort, aren't you?""I don't want to put myself on any pinnacle.If I cared enough for
a woman to marry her, I'd hope to--But we are being very tragic,
Christine."There's going to be another mistake, K., unless you stop
it."He tried to leaven the conversation with a little fun."If you're going to ask me to interfere between Mrs.McKee and the
deaf-and-dumb book and insurance agent, I shall do nothing of the sort.She can both speak and hear enough for both of them."He's mad about her, K.; and, because
she's the sort she is, he'll probably be mad about her all his life,
even if he marries her.But he'll not be true to her; I know the type
now."K. leaned back with a flicker of pain in his eyes.Astute as he was, he did not suspect that Christine was using this
method to fathom his feeling for Sidney.But he had himself in hand by this time, and she learned nothing from
either his voice or his eyes."I'm not in a position to marry anybody.Even
if Sidney cared for me, which she doesn't, of course--"

"Then you don't intend to interfere?You're going to let the Street see
another failure?""I think you can understand," said K. rather wearily, "that if I cared
less, Christine, it would be easier to interfere."After all, Christine had known this, or surmised it, for weeks.But it
hurt like a fresh stab in an old wound.It was K. who spoke again after
a pause:--

"The deadly hard thing, of course, is to sit by and see things happening
that one--that one would naturally try to prevent.""I don't believe that you have always been of those who only stand and
wait," said Christine."Sometime, K., when you know me better and like
me better, I want you to tell me about it, will you?"When I discovered that I
was unfit to hold that trust any longer, I quit.But Christine's eyes were on
him often that evening, puzzled, rather sad.They talked of books, of music--Christine played well in a dashing way.K. had brought her soft, tender little things, and had stood over her
until her noisy touch became gentle.She played for him a little, while
he sat back in the big chair with his hand screening his eyes.When, at last, he rose and picked up his cap; it was nine o'clock."I've taken your whole evening," he said remorsefully."Why don't you
tell me I am a nuisance and send me off?"Christine was still at the piano, her hands on the keys.She spoke
without looking at him:--

"You're never a nuisance, K., and--"

"You'll go out to see Tillie, won't you?"But I'll not go under false pretenses.I am going quite frankly
because you want me to.""I forgot to tell you," she went on."Father has given Palmer five
thousand dollars.He's going to buy a share in a business."I don't believe much in Palmer's business ventures."Underneath it he divined strain and
repression."I hate to go and leave you alone," he said at last from the door."Have
you any idea when Palmer will be back?"Stand behind me; I
don't want to see you, and I want to tell you something."He did as she bade him, rather puzzled."I think I am a fool for saying this.Perhaps I am spoiling the only
chance I have to get any happiness out of life.I was terribly unhappy, K., and then you
came into my life, and I--now I listen for your step in the hall.I
can't be a hypocrite any longer, K."When he stood behind her, silent and not moving, she turned slowly about
and faced him.He towered there in the little room, grave eyes on hers."It's a long time since I have had a woman friend, Christine," he said
soberly.In a good many
ways, I'd not care to look ahead if it were not for you.I value our
friendship so much that I--"

"That you don't want me to spoil it," she finished for him."I know
you don't care for me, K., not the way I--But I wanted you to know.It
doesn't hurt a good man to know such a thing.And it--isn't going to
stop your coming here, is it?""Of course not," said K. heartily."But to-morrow, when we are both
clear-headed, we will talk this over.You are mistaken about this thing,
Christine; I am sure of that.Things have not been going well, and just
because I am always around, and all that sort of thing, you think things
that aren't really so.He tried to make her smile up at him.If she had cried, things might have been different for every one; for
perhaps K. would have taken her in his arms.He was heart-hungry enough,
those days, for anything.And perhaps, too, being intuitive, Christine
felt this.But she had no mind to force him into a situation against his
will."It is because you are good," she said, and held out her hand.Le Moyne took it and bent over and kissed it lightly.There was in
the kiss all that he could not say of respect, of affection and
understanding."Good-night, Christine," he said, and went into the hall and upstairs.The lamp was not lighted in his room, but the street light glowed
through the windows.Once again the waving fronds of the ailanthus tree
flung ghostly shadows on the walls.There was a faint sweet odor of
blossoms, so soon to become rank and heavy.Over the floor in a wild zigzag darted a strip of white paper which
disappeared under the bureau.CHAPTER XXI


Sidney went into the operating-room late in the spring as the result of
a conversation between the younger Wilson and the Head."When are you going to put my protegee into the operating-room?"asked
Wilson, meeting Miss Gregg in a corridor one bright, spring afternoon."That usually comes in the second year, Dr."That isn't a rule, is it?"Miss Page is very young, and of course there are other
girls who have not yet had the experience.But, if you make the
request--"

"I am going to have some good cases soon.I'll not make a request, of
course; but, if you see fit, it would be good training for Miss Page."Miss Gregg went on, knowing perfectly that at his next operation Dr.Wilson would expect Sidney Page in the operating-room.The other doctors
were not so exigent.She would have liked to have all the staff old and
settled, like Dr.These young men came in
and tore things up.The
butter had been bad--she must speak to the matron.The sterilizer in
the operating-room was out of order--that meant a quarrel with the chief
engineer.Requisitions were too heavy--that meant going around to the
wards and suggesting to the head nurses that lead pencils and bandages
and adhesive plaster and safety-pins cost money.It was particularly inconvenient to move Sidney just then.Carlotta
Harrison was off duty, ill.She had been ailing for a month, and now she
was down with a temperature.As the Head went toward Sidney's ward,
her busy mind was playing her nurses in their wards like pieces on a
checkerboard.Sidney went into the operating-room that afternoon.For her blue
uniform, kerchief, and cap she exchanged the hideous operating-room
garb: long, straight white gown with short sleeves and mob-cap,
gray-white from many sterilizations.But the ugly costume seemed to
emphasize her beauty, as the habit of a nun often brings out the placid
saintliness of her face.The relationship between Sidney and Max had reached that point that
occurs in all relationships between men and women: when things must
either go forward or go back, but cannot remain as they are.The
condition had existed for the last three months.As a matter of fact, Wilson could not go ahead.The situation with
Carlotta had become tense, irritating.He felt that she stood ready
to block any move he made.He would not go back, and he dared not go
forward.If Sidney was puzzled, she kept it bravely to herself.In her little
room at night, with the door carefully locked, she tried to think things
out.There were a few treasures that she looked over regularly: a dried
flower from the Christmas roses; a label that he had pasted playfully
on the back of her hand one day after the rush of surgical dressings was
over and which said "Rx, Take once and forever."There was another piece of paper over which Sidney spent much time.It
was a page torn out of an order book, and it read: "Sigsbee may have
light diet; Rosenfeld massage."Underneath was written, very small:

     "You are the most beautiful person in the world."Two reasons had prompted Wilson to request to have Sidney in the
operating-room.He wanted her with him, and he wanted her to see him at
work: the age-old instinct of the male to have his woman see him at his
best.He was in high spirits that first day of Sidney's operating-room
experience.For the time at least, Carlotta was out of the way.Her
somber eyes no longer watched him.Once he looked up from his work and
glanced at Sidney where she stood at strained attention.She  under the eyes that were turned on her."A great many of them faint on the first day.We sometimes have them
lying all over the floor."He challenged Miss Gregg with his eyes, and she reproved him with a
shake of her head, as she might a bad boy.One way and another, he managed to turn the attention of the
operating-room to Sidney several times.It suited his whim, and it did
more than that: it gave him a chance to speak to her in his teasing way.Sidney came through the operation as if she had been through fire--taut
as a string, rather pale, but undaunted.But when the last case had been
taken out, Max dropped his bantering manner.The internes were looking
over instruments; the nurses were busy on the hundred and one tasks of
clearing up; so he had a chance for a word with her alone."I am proud of you, Sidney; you came through it like a soldier."A nurse was coming toward him; he had only a moment."I shall leave a note in the mail-box," he said quickly, and proceeded
with the scrubbing of his hands which signified the end of the day's
work.The operations had lasted until late in the afternoon.The night nurses
had taken up their stations; prayers were over.The internes were
gathered in the smoking-room, threshing over the day's work, as was
their custom.When Sidney was free, she went to the office for the note.It was very brief:--

I have something I want to say to you, dear.I never see you alone at home any more.If you can get off for an
hour, won't you take the trolley to the end of Division Street?I'll be
there with the car at eight-thirty, and I promise to have you back by
ten o'clock.No one saw her as she stood by the mail-box.The
ticking of the office clock, the heavy rumble of a dray outside, the
roll of the ambulance as it went out through the gateway, and in her
hand the realization of what she had never confessed as a hope, even to
herself!He, the great one, was going to stoop to her.It had been in
his eyes that afternoon; it was there, in his letter, now.To get out of her uniform and into
street clothing, fifteen minutes; on the trolley, another fifteen.But she did not meet him, after all.Miss Wardwell met her in the upper
hall."She has been waiting for hours--ever since you went to the
operating-room."Sidney sighed, but she went to Carlotta at once.The girl's condition
was puzzling the staff.--which is hospital for
"typhoid restrictions."has apathy, generally, and Carlotta
was not apathetic.Sidney found her tossing restlessly on her high white
bed, and put her cool hand over Carlotta's hot one.Then, seeing her operating-room uniform: "You've been
THERE, have you?""Is there anything I can do, Carlotta?"Excitement had dyed Sidney's cheeks with color and made her eyes
luminous.The girl in the bed eyed her, and then abruptly drew her hand
away."I'll not keep you if you have an engagement."If you would
like me to stay with you tonight--"

Carlotta shook her head on her pillow.Nothing escaped Carlotta's eyes--the younger girl's radiance, her
confusion, even her operating room uniform and what it signified.How
she hated her, with her youth and freshness, her wide eyes, her soft red
lips!And this engagement--she had the uncanny divination of fury."I was going to ask you to do something for me," she said shortly; "but
I've changed my mind about it.To end the interview, she turned over and lay with her face to the wall.All her training had been to ignore
the irritability of the sick, and Carlotta was very ill; she could see
that."Just remember that I am ready to do anything I can, Carlotta," she
said.She waited a moment, but, receiving no acknowledgement of her offer, she
turned slowly and went toward the door."If it's typhoid, I'm gone."Of course you're not gone, or anything like it.I doze for a little, and when I waken there are
people in the room.They stand around the bed and talk about me."Sidney's precious minutes were flying; but Carlotta had gone into a
paroxysm of terror, holding to Sidney's hand and begging not to be left
alone."I'm too young to die," she would whimper.And in the next breath: "I
want to die--I don't want to live!"The hands of the little watch pointed to eight-thirty when at last she
lay quiet, with closed eyes.Sidney, tiptoeing to the door, was brought
up short by her name again, this time in a more normal voice:--

"Sidney.""Perhaps you are right and I'm going to get over this."Your nerves are playing tricks with you to-night.""I'll tell you now why I sent for you.""If--if I get very bad,--you know what I mean,--will you promise to do
exactly what I tell you?""My trunk key is in my pocket-book.There is a letter in the tray--just
a name, no address on it.Promise to see that it is not delivered; that
it is destroyed without being read."Sidney promised promptly; and, because it was too late now for her
meeting with Wilson, for the next hour she devoted herself to making
Carlotta comfortable.So long as she was busy, a sort of exaltation of
service upheld her.But when at last the night assistant came to sit
with the sick girl, and Sidney was free, all the life faded from her
face.He had waited for her and she had not come.Perhaps, after all, his question had
not been what she had thought.Her stiff cap moved in the breeze as it swung from the corner of her
mirror.Under her window passed and repassed the night life of the
city--taxicabs, stealthy painted women, tired office-cleaners trudging
home at midnight, a city patrol-wagon which rolled in through the gates
to the hospital's always open door.When she could not sleep, she got up
and padded to the window in bare feet.The light from a passing machine
showed a youthful figure that looked like Joe Drummond.Life, that had always seemed so simple, was growing very complicated
for Sidney: Joe and K., Palmer and Christine, Johnny Rosenfeld,
Carlotta--either lonely or tragic, all of them, or both.It
had been a quiet night and she was asleep in her chair.To save her cap
she had taken it off, and early streaks of silver showed in her hair."I want something from my trunk," she said.The assistant wakened reluctantly, and looked at her watch."You don't want me to go to the
trunk-room at this hour!""I can go myself," said Carlotta, and put her feet out of bed.If I wait my temperature will go up and I
can't think.""Bring it here," said Carlotta shortly.The young woman went without haste, to show that a night assistant may
do such things out of friendship, but not because she must.She stopped
at the desk where the night nurse in charge of the rooms on that floor
was filling out records."Give me twelve private patients to look after instead of one nurse like
Carlotta Harrison!""I've got to go to the trunk-room
for her at this hour, and it next door to the mortuary!"As the first rays of the summer sun came through the window, shadowing
the fire-escape like a lattice on the wall of the little gray-walled
room, Carlotta sat up in her bed and lighted the candle on the stand.The night assistant, who dreamed sometimes of fire, stood nervously by."Why don't you let me do it?"The candle was in her hand, and she was
staring at the letter."Because I want to do it myself," she said at last, and thrust the
envelope into the flame.It burned slowly, at first a thin blue flame
tipped with yellow, then, eating its way with a small fine crackling,
a widening, destroying blaze that left behind it black ash and
destruction.The acrid odor of burning filled the room.Not until it was
consumed, and the black ash fell into the saucer of the candlestick, did
Carlotta speak again.Then:--

"If every fool of a woman who wrote a letter burnt it, there would be
less trouble in the world," she said, and lay back among her pillows.She was sleepy and irritated, and she had
crushed her best cap by letting the lid of Carlotta's trunk fall on her.She went out of the room with disapproval in every line of her back."She burned it," she informed the night nurse at her desk."A letter to
a man--one of her suitors, I suppose.The deepening and broadening of Sidney's character had been very
noticeable in the last few months.She had gained in decision without
becoming hard; had learned to see things as they are, not through the
rose mist of early girlhood; and, far from being daunted, had developed
a philosophy that had for its basis God in His heaven and all well with
the world.But her new theory of acceptance did not comprehend everything.She was
in a state of wild revolt, for instance, as to Johnny Rosenfeld, and
more remotely but not less deeply concerned over Grace Irving.Soon
she was to learn of Tillie's predicament, and to take up the cudgels
valiantly for her.But her revolt was to be for herself too.On the day after her failure
to keep her appointment with Wilson she had her half-holiday.No word
had come from him, and when, after a restless night, she went to her new
station in the operating-room, it was to learn that he had been called
out of the city in consultation and would not operate that day.O'Hara
would take advantage of the free afternoon to run in some odds and ends
of cases.The operating-room made gauze that morning, and small packets of
tampons: absorbent cotton covered with sterilized gauze, and fastened
together--twelve, by careful count, in each bundle.Miss Grange, who had been kind to Sidney in her probation months, taught
her the method."Used instead of sponges," she explained."If you noticed yesterday,
they were counted before and after each operation.One of these missing
is worse than a bank clerk out a dollar at the end of the day.There's
no closing up until it's found!"Sidney eyed the small packet before her anxiously.From that time on she handled the small gauze sponges almost reverently.The operating-room--all glass, white enamel, and shining
nickel-plate--first frightened, then thrilled her.It was as if, having
loved a great actor, she now trod the enchanted boards on which he
achieved his triumphs.She was glad that it was her afternoon off, and
that she would not see some lesser star--O'Hara, to wit--usurping his
place.He must have known that
she had been delayed.The operating-room was a hive of industry, and tongues kept pace with
fingers.The hospital was a world, like the Street.The nurses had come
from many places, and, like cloistered nuns, seemed to have left the
other world behind.A new President of the country was less real than a
new interne.The country might wash its soiled linen in public; what was
that compared with enough sheets and towels for the wards?Big buildings
were going up in the city.but the hospital took cognizance of that,
gathering as it did a toll from each new story added.What news of
the world came in through the great doors was translated at once into
hospital terms.It took
up life where the town left it at its gates, and carried it on or saw
it ended, as the case might be.So these young women knew the ending of
many stories, the beginning of some; but of none did they know both the
first and last, the beginning and the end.By many small kindnesses Sidney had made herself popular.And there was
more to it than that.The other girls had the respect
for her of one honest worker for another.The episode that had caused
her suspension seemed entirely forgotten.They showed her carefully what
she was to do; and, because she must know the "why" of everything, they
explained as best they could.It was while she was standing by the great sterilizer that she heard,
through an open door, part of a conversation that sent her through the
day with her world in revolt.The talkers were putting the anaesthetizing-room in readiness for the
afternoon.Sidney, waiting for the time to open the sterilizer, was
busy, for the first time in her hurried morning, with her own thoughts.Because she was very human, there was a little exultation in her mind.What would these girls say when they learned of how things stood between
her and their hero--that, out of all his world of society and clubs and
beautiful women, he was going to choose her?Not shameful, this: the honest pride of a woman in being chosen from
many."Do you think he has really broken with her?"She knows it's coming; that's all.""Sometimes I have wondered--"

"So have others.She oughtn't to be here, of course.But among so many
there is bound to be one now and then who--who isn't quite--"

She hesitated, at a loss for a word."Did you--did you ever think over that trouble with Miss Page about the
medicines?That would have been easy, and like her.""She hates Miss Page, of course, but I hardly think--If that's true, it
was nearly murder."There were two voices, a young one, full of soft southern inflections,
and an older voice, a trifle hard, as from disillusion.Sidney could hear the clatter of
bottles on the tray, the scraping of a moved table.(The younger voice, with a thrill in it.)"I saw her with him in his car one evening.And on her vacation last
summer--"

The voices dropped to a whisper.Sidney, standing cold and white by the
sterilizer, put out a hand to steady herself.How hateful life was, and men and women.Must there always be
something hideous in the background?Now she felt its hot breath on her cheek.She was steady enough in a moment, cool and calm, moving about her work
with ice-cold hands and slightly narrowed eyes.To a sort of physical
nausea was succeeding anger, a blind fury of injured pride.He had been
in love with Carlotta and had tired of her.He was bringing her his
warmed-over emotions.She remembered the bitterness of her month's
exile, and its probable cause.Well he might,
if he suspected the truth.For just a moment she had an illuminating flash of Wilson as he really
was, selfish and self-indulgent, just a trifle too carefully dressed,
daring as to eye and speech, with a carefully calculated daring, frankly
pleasure-loving.The voices in the next room had risen above their whisper."Genius has privileges, of course," said the older voice.To-morrow he is to do the Edwardes operation again.I am
glad I am to see him do it."Sidney still held her hands over her eyes.He WAS a great surgeon: in
his hands he held the keys of life and death.And perhaps he had never
cared for Carlotta: she might have thrown herself at him.He was a man,
at the mercy of any scheming woman.She tried to summon his image to her aid.Instead, there came, clear and distinct, a
picture of K. Le Moyne in the hall of the little house, reaching one of
his long arms to the chandelier over his head and looking up at her as
she stood on the stairs.CHAPTER XXII


"My God, Sidney, I'm asking you to marry me!""I have never been in love with her."He had drawn the car close to a bank, and they were
sitting in the shade, on the grass.It was the Sunday afternoon after
Sidney's experience in the operating-room."You took her out, Max, didn't you?"Good Heavens, you've put me through a catechism in the last
ten minutes!""If my father were living, or even mother, I--one of them would have
done this for me, Max.I've been very wretched for
several days."It was the first encouragement she had given him.There was no coquetry
about her aloofness.It was only that her faith in him had had a shock
and was slow of reviving."You are very, very lovely, Sidney.I wonder if you have any idea what
you mean to me?""You meant a great deal to me, too," she said frankly, "until a few days
ago.I thought you were the greatest man I had ever known, and the best.And then--I think I'd better tell you what I overheard.He listened doggedly to her account of the hospital gossip, doggedly and
with a sinking sense of fear, not of the talk, but of Carlotta herself.Usually one might count on the woman's silence, her instinct for
self-protection.She
had known from the start that the affair was a temporary one; he had
never pretended anything else.There was silence for a moment after Sidney finished.Then:

"You are not a child any longer, Sidney.You have learned a great deal
in this last year.One of the things you know is that almost every man
has small affairs, many of them sometimes, before he finds the woman
he wants to marry.When he finds her, the others are all off--there's
nothing to them.It's the real thing then, instead of the sham.""Palmer was very much in love with Christine, and yet--"

"Palmer is a cad.""I don't want you to think I'm making terms.But if this thing
went on, and I found out afterward that you--that there was anyone else,
it would kill me."There was something boyish in his triumph, in the very gesture with
which he held out his arms, like a child who has escaped a whipping.He
stood up and, catching her hands, drew her to her feet."Then I'm yours, and only yours, if you want me," he said, and took her
in his arms.He was riotously happy, must hold her off for the joy of drawing her to
him again, must pull off her gloves and kiss her soft bare palms.he cried, and bent down to bury his face in the
warm hollow of her neck.Sidney glowed under his caresses--was rather startled at his passion, a
little ashamed."Tell me you love me a little bit."I love you," said Sidney, and flushed scarlet.But even in his arms, with the warm sunlight on his radiant face, with
his lips to her ear, whispering the divine absurdities of passion, in
the back of her obstinate little head was the thought that, while she
had given him her first embrace, he had held other women in his arms.It
made her passive, prevented her complete surrender."You are only letting me love you," he
complained."I don't believe you care, after all."He freed her, took a step back from her."I am afraid I am jealous," she said simply."I keep thinking of--of
Carlotta.""Will it help any if I swear that that is off absolutely?"But he insisted on swearing, standing with one hand upraised, his eyes
on her.The Sunday landscape was very still, save for the hum of busy
insect life.A mile or so away, at the foot of two hills, lay a white
farmhouse with its barn and outbuildings.In a small room in the barn
a woman sat; and because it was Sunday, and she could not sew, she read
her Bible.

"--and that after this there will be only one woman for me," finished
Max, and dropped his hand.He bent over and kissed Sidney on the lips.At the white farmhouse, a little man stood in the doorway and surveyed
the road with eyes shaded by a shirt-sleeved arm.Behind him, in a
darkened room, a barkeeper was wiping the bar with a clean cloth."I guess I'll go and get my coat on, Bill," said the little man heavily.I see a machine about a mile down the
road."Sidney broke the news of her engagement to K. herself, the evening of
the same day.The little house was quiet when she got out of the car at
the door.Harriet was asleep on the couch at the foot of her bed,
and Christine's rooms were empty.She found Katie on the back porch,
mountains of Sunday newspapers piled around her."I'd about give you up," said Katie."I was thinking, rather than see
your ice-cream that's left from dinner melt and go to waste, I'd take it
around to the Rosenfelds."She stood in front of Katie, drawing off her gloves."You're gettin' prettier every day, Miss Sidney.Is that the blue suit
Miss Harriet said she made for you?Sidney obediently turned, and Katie admired."When I think how things have turned out!""You in a
hospital, doing God knows what for all sorts of people, and Miss Harriet
making a suit like that and asking a hundred dollars for it, and that
tony that a person doesn't dare to speak to her when she's in the
dining-room.And your poor ma...well, it's all in a lifetime!"Well, that's what I call it.Don't I hear her dressing
up about four o'clock every afternoon, and, when she's all ready,
sittin' in the parlor with the door open, and a book on her knee, as if
she'd been reading all afternoon?If he doesn't stop, she's at the foot
of the stairs, calling up to him.'K.,' she says, 'K., I'm waiting to
ask you something!'or, 'K., wouldn't you like a cup of tea?'She's
always feedin' him tea and cake, so that when he comes to table he won't
eat honest victuals."Sidney had paused with one glove half off.Was life making another of its queer errors, and were
Christine and K. in love with each other?K. had always been HER
friend, HER confidant.To give him up to Christine--she shook herself
impatiently.Why not be glad that he had some
sort of companionship?She went upstairs to the room that had been her mother's, and took off
her hat.She wanted to be alone, to realize what had happened to
her.It gave her an odd, lost
feeling.She was going to be married--not very soon, but ultimately.A
year ago her half promise to Joe had gratified her sense of romance.She
was loved, and she had thrilled to it.Marriage, that had been but a vision then,
loomed large, almost menacing.She had learned the law of compensation:
that for every joy one pays in suffering.Women who married went down
into the valley of death for their children.One must love and be loved
very tenderly to pay for that.Women grew old, and age was not always
lovely.This very maternity--was it not fatal to beauty?Visions of
child-bearing women in the hospitals, with sagging breasts and relaxed
bodies, came to her.Sidney could hear her moving
about with flat, inelastic steps.One married, happily or not as the case might
be, and took the risk.Or one stayed single, like Harriet, growing a
little hard, exchanging slimness for leanness and austerity of figure,
flat-chested, thin-voiced.One blossomed and withered, then, or one
shriveled up without having flowered.All at once it seemed very
terrible to her.She felt as if she had been caught in an inexorable
hand that had closed about her.Harriet found her a little later, face down on her mother's bed, crying
as if her heart would break."You've been overworking," she said.Your
measurements for that suit showed it.I have never approved of this
hospital training, and after last January--"

She could hardly credit her senses when Sidney, still swollen with
weeping, told her of her engagement.If you care for him and he has asked you to
marry him, why on earth are you crying your eyes out?"It just came over me, all at once,
that I--It was just foolishness.The girl needed her mother, and she,
Harriet, was a hard, middle-aged woman and a poor substitute.She patted
Sidney's moist hand."I'll attend to your wedding things,
Sidney.We'll show this street that even Christine Lorenz can be
outdone."And, as an afterthought: "I hope Max Wilson will settle down
now.K. had taken Christine to see Tillie that Sunday afternoon.Palmer
had the car out--had, indeed, not been home since the morning of the
previous day.He played golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday at the
Country Club, and invariably spent the night there.So K. and Christine
walked from the end of the trolley line, saying little, but under K.'s
keen direction finding bright birds in the hedgerows, hidden field
flowers, a dozen wonders of the country that Christine had never dreamed
of.The interview with Tillie had been a disappointment to K. Christine,
with the best and kindliest intentions, struck a wrong note.In her
endeavor to cover the fact that everything in Tillie's world was wrong,
she fell into the error of pretending that everything was right.Tillie, grotesque of figure and tragic-eyed, listened to her patiently,
while K. stood, uneasy and uncomfortable, in the wide door of the
hay-barn and watched automobiles turning in from the road.When
Christine rose to leave, she confessed her failure frankly."I've meant well, Tillie," she said."I'm afraid I've said exactly
what I shouldn't.I can only think that, no matter what is wrong, two
wonderful pieces of luck have come to you.Schwitter--cares for you,--you admit that,--and you are going to have a
child.""I used to be a good woman, Mrs.When I look in that glass at myself, and call myself what I am, I'd give
a good bit to be back on the Street again."She found opportunity for a word with K. while Christine went ahead of
him out of the barn."I've been wanting to speak to you, Mr."Joe Drummond's been coming out here pretty regular.Schwitter
says he's drinking a little.He don't like him loafing around here: he
sent him home last Sunday."The barkeeper says he carries a revolver around, and talks wild.I
thought maybe Sidney Page could do something with him.""I think he'd not like her to know.'s face was thoughtful as he followed Christine to the road.Christine was very silent, on the way back to the city.More than once
K. found her eyes fixed on him, and it puzzled him.Poor Christine was
only trying to fit him into the world she knew--a world whose men were
strong but seldom tender, who gave up their Sundays to golf, not to
visiting unhappy outcasts in the country.How masculine he was, and
yet how gentle!It gave her a choking feeling in her throat.She took
advantage of a steep bit of road to stop and stand a moment, her fingers
on his shabby gray sleeve.Sidney was sitting on the low step,
waiting for them.Wilson had come across at seven, impatient because he must see a case
that evening, and promising an early return.In the little hall he had
drawn her to him and kissed her, this time not on the lips, but on the
forehead and on each of her white eyelids.he had said, and was rather ashamed of his own
emotion.From across the Street, as he got into his car, he had waved
his hand to her.Christine went to her room, and, with a long breath of content, K.
folded up his long length on the step below Sidney."Well, dear ministering angel," he said, "how goes the world?"Perhaps because she had a woman's
instinct for making the most of a piece of news, perhaps--more likely,
indeed--because she divined that the announcement would not be entirely
agreeable, she delayed it, played with it."I have gone into the operating-room."There was relief in his eyes, and still a question.Apparently he did not wish to hear her say it; for when, after a moment,
he spoke, it was to forestall her, after all."I think I know what it is, Sidney.""I--it's not an entire surprise.""Aren't you going to wish me happiness?""If my wishing could bring anything good to you, you would have
everything in the world."His voice was not entirely steady, but his eyes smiled into hers."Am I--are we going to lose you soon?"Then, in a burst of confidence:--

"I know so little, K., and he knows so much!I am going to read and
study, so that he can talk to me about his work.That's what marriage
ought to be, a sort of partnership.His mind refused to go forward to the unthinkable future.Instead, he was looking back--back to those days when he had hoped
sometime to have a wife to talk to about his work, that beloved work
that was no longer his.And, finding it agonizing, as indeed all thought
was that summer night, he dwelt for a moment on that evening, a year
before, when in the same June moonlight, he had come up the Street and
had seen Sidney where she was now, with the tree shadows playing over
her.Now it was another and older man, daring,
intelligent, unscrupulous.And this time he had lost her absolutely,
lost her without a struggle to keep her.His only struggle had been with
himself, to remember that he had nothing to offer but failure."Do you know," said Sidney suddenly, "that it is almost a year since
that night you came up the Street, and I was here on the steps?""That's a fact, isn't it!"He managed to get some surprise into his
voice."Because--well, you know, K. Why do men always hate a woman who just
happens not to love them?"It would be much better for them if they
could.As a matter of fact, there are poor devils who go through life
trying to do that very thing, and failing."Sidney's eyes were on the tall house across.Ed's evening
office hour, and through the open window she could see a line of people
waiting their turn.They sat immobile, inert, doggedly patient, until
the opening of the back office door promoted them all one chair toward
the consulting-room."I shall be just across the Street," she said at last."Nearer than I am
at the hospital.""But we will still be friends, K.?"But, after another silence, he astounded her.She had fallen into the
way of thinking of him as always belonging to the house, even, in a
sense, belonging to her.And now--

"Shall you mind very much if I tell you that I am thinking of going
away?""My dear child, you do not need a roomer here any more.I have always
received infinitely more than I have paid for, even in the small
services I have been able to render.You are away, and some day you are going to be married.Don't you see--I
am not needed?""That does not mean you are not wanted."I'll always be near enough, so that I can see
you"--he changed this hastily--"so that we can still meet and talk
things over.Old friends ought to be like that, not too near, but to be
turned on when needed, like a tap.""The Rosenfelds are rather in straits.I thought of helping them to get
a small house somewhere and of taking a room with them.If they could furnish it even plainly, it could be
done."Have you always gone
through life helping people, K.?She bent over and put her hand on his shoulder."It will not be home without you, K."To save him, he could not have spoken just then.A riot of rebellion
surged up in him, that he must let this best thing in his life go out
of it.To go empty of heart through the rest of his days, while his very
arms ached to hold her!And she was so near--just above, with her hand
on his shoulder, her wistful face so close that, without moving, he
could have brushed her hair."You have not wished me happiness, K. Do you remember, when I was going
to the hospital and you gave me the little watch--do you remember what
you said?"You are going to leave us, and I--say it, K.""Good-bye, dear, and--God bless you."CHAPTER XXIII


The announcement of Sidney's engagement was not to be made for a year.Wilson, chafing under the delay, was obliged to admit to himself that
it was best.Carlotta would have
finished her training, and by that time would probably be reconciled to
the ending of their relationship.He had meant every word of what he had sworn to
Sidney.He was genuinely in love, even unselfishly--as far as he could
be unselfish.The secret was to be carefully kept also for Sidney's
sake.The hospital did not approve of engagements between nurses and the
staff.It was disorganizing, bad for discipline.Sidney was very happy all that summer.She glowed with pride when her
lover put through a difficult piece of work; flushed and palpitated when
she heard his praises sung; grew to know, by a sort of intuition, when
he was in the house.She wore his ring on a fine chain around her neck,
and grew prettier every day.Once or twice, however, when she was at home, away from the glamour, her
early fears obsessed her.He was so handsome
and so gifted, and there were women who were mad about him.That was the
gossip of the hospital.Suppose she married him and he tired of her?In
her humility she thought that perhaps only her youth, and such charm as
she had that belonged to youth, held him.And before her, always, she
saw the tragic women of the wards.Sidney had been insistent, and
Harriet had topped the argument in her businesslike way."If you insist
on being an idiot and adopting the Rosenfeld family," she said, "wait
until September.The season for boarders doesn't begin until fall."So K. waited for "the season," and ate his heart out for Sidney in the
interval.Johnny Rosenfeld still lay in his ward, inert from the waist down.As a matter of fact, he was watching the
boy closely, at Max Wilson's request."Tell me when I'm to do it," said Wilson, "and when the time comes,
for God's sake, stand by me.He's got so much
confidence that I'll help him that I don't dare to fail."So K. came on visiting days, and, by special dispensation, on Saturday
afternoons.Not that he knew
anything about it himself; but, by means of a blind teacher, he kept
just one lesson ahead.It found
something absurd and rather touching in this tall, serious young man
with the surprisingly deft fingers, tying raffia knots.The first basket went, by Johnny's request, to Sidney Page."I want her to have it," he said."She got corns on her fingers from
rubbing me when I came in first; and, besides--"

"Yes?"said K. He was tying a most complicated knot, and could not look
up."I'm not going to get in wrong by
talking, but I know something.K. looked up then, and surprised Johnny's secret in his face."If I'd squealed she'd have finished me for good.I'm not running in 2.40 these days.""I'll not tell, or make it uncomfortable for you.The ward was in the somnolence of mid-afternoon.The nearest patient, a man in a wheel-chair, was snoring heavily."It was the dark-eyed one that changed the medicine on me," he said."The one with the heels that were always tapping around, waking me up.After all, it was only what K. had suspected before.But a sense of
impending danger to Sidney obsessed him.If Carlotta would do that, what
would she do when she learned of the engagement?The odd coincidence of
their paths crossing again troubled him.Carlotta Harrison was well again, and back on duty.Luckily for Sidney,
her three months' service in the operating-room kept them apart.For
Carlotta was now not merely jealous.It had been her theory that
Wilson would not marry easily--that, in a sense, he would have to be
coerced into marriage.Some clever woman would marry him some day, and
no one would be more astonished than himself.She thought merely that
Sidney was playing a game like her own, with different weapons.So she
planned her battle, ignorant that she had lost already.She stopped sulking, met Max with smiles,
made no overtures toward a renewal of their relations.To desert a woman was justifiable,
under certain circumstances.But to desert a woman, and have her
apparently not even know it, was against the rules of the game.During a surgical dressing in a private room, one day, he allowed his
fingers to touch hers, as on that day a year before when she had taken
Miss Simpson's place in his office.He was rewarded by the same slow,
smouldering glance that had caught his attention before.A new interne had come into the
house, and was going through the process of learning that from a senior
at the medical school to a half-baked junior interne is a long step
back.He had to endure the good-humored contempt of the older men, the
patronizing instructions of nurses as to rules.His uneasy rounds in
Carlotta's precinct took on the state and form of staff visitations.She
flattered, cajoled, looked up to him.After a time it dawned on Wilson that this junior cub was getting more
attention than himself: that, wherever he happened to be, somewhere in
the offing would be Carlotta and the Lamb, the latter eyeing her with
worship.The enthroning of a
successor galled him.Between them, the Lamb suffered mightily--was
subject to frequent "bawling out," as he termed it, in the
operating-room as he assisted the anaesthetist.He took his troubles to
Carlotta, who soothed him in the corridor--in plain sight of her quarry,
of course--by putting a sympathetic hand on his sleeve.Then, one day, Wilson was goaded to speech."For the love of Heaven, Carlotta," he said impatiently, "stop making
love to that wretched boy.He wriggles like a worm if you look at him."I respect him, and--he respects
me.""It's rather a silly game, you know."I--I don't really care a lot about him, Max.Her attraction for him was almost gone--not quite.She lifted her eyes to his, and for once she was not
acting."I knew it would end, of course.Why, after all, should he not be her friend?He
had treated her cruelly, hideously.If she still desired his friendship,
there was no disloyalty to Sidney in giving it.Not once again did she allow him to see what lay in her eyes.She had
a chance to take up institutional work.She abhorred the thought of
private duty.The Lamb was hovering near, hot eyes on them both."Come to the office and we'll talk it over.""I don't like to go there; Miss Simpson is suspicious."The institution she spoke of was in another city.It occurred to
Wilson that if she took it the affair would have reached a graceful and
legitimate end.Also, the thought of another stolen evening alone with her was not
unpleasant.It would be the last, he promised himself.After all, it was
owing to her.Sidney would be at a lecture that night."Suppose you meet me at the old corner," he said carelessly, eyes on
the Lamb, who was forgetting that he was only a junior interne and was
glaring ferociously."We'll run out into the country and talk things
over."She demurred, with her heart beating triumphantly."What's the use of going back to that?When at last she had yielded, and he
made his way down to the smoking-room, it was with the feeling that he
had won a victory.K. had been uneasy all that day; his ledgers irritated him.He had been
sleeping badly since Sidney's announcement of her engagement.At five
o'clock, when he left the office, he found Joe Drummond waiting outside
on the pavement."Mother said you'd been up to see me a couple of times.I'll go about
town for a half-hour or so."Thus forestalled, K. found his subject hard to lead up to.But here
again Joe met him more than halfway."Well, go on," he said, when they found themselves in the park; "I don't
suppose you were paying a call.""I guess I know what you are going to say.""I'm not going to preach, if you're expecting that.Ordinarily, if a man
insists on making a fool of himself, I let him alone.""One reason is that I happen to like you.The other reason is that,
whether you admit it or not, you are acting like a young idiot, and are
putting the responsibility on the shoulders of some one else."You are a man, and you are acting like a bad boy.It's a
disappointment to me.She's going to marry Wilson, isn't she?"If I'd go to her
to-night and tell her what I know, she'd never see him again."The idea,
thus born in his overwrought brain, obsessed him.He was not certain that the boy's
statement had any basis in fact.His single determination was to save
Sidney from any pain.When Joe suddenly announced his inclination to go out into the country
after all, he suspected a ruse to get rid of him, and insisted on going
along."Car's at Bailey's garage," he said sullenly."I don't know when I'll
get back."That passed unnoticed until they were on the highroad, with the car
running smoothly between yellowing fields of wheat.Then:--

"So you've got it too!"We'd both
be better off if I sent the car over a bank."He gave the wheel a reckless twist, and Le Moyne called him to time
sternly.They had supper at the White Springs Hotel--not on the terrace, but in
the little room where Carlotta and Wilson had taken their first meal
together.K. ordered beer for them both, and Joe submitted with bad
grace.K. found him more amenable to
reason, and, gaining his confidence, learned of his desire to leave the
city."I'm the only one, and mother yells blue
murder when I talk about it.His dilated pupils became more normal, his
restless hands grew quiet.'s even voice, the picture he drew of
life on the island, the stillness of the little hotel in its mid-week
dullness, seemed to quiet the boy's tortured nerves.He was nearer
to peace than he had been for many days.But he smoked incessantly,
lighting one cigarette from another.At ten o'clock he left K. and went for the car.He paused for a moment,
rather sheepishly, by K."I'm feeling a lot better," he said."I haven't got the band around my
head.That was the last K. saw of Joe Drummond until the next day.CHAPTER XXIV


Carlotta dressed herself with unusual care--not in black this time, but
in white.She coiled her yellow hair in a soft knot at the back of her
head, and she resorted to the faintest shading of rouge.The ride was to be a bright spot in Wilson's memory.He expected recriminations; she meant to make him happy.That was the
secret of the charm some women had for men.They went to such women to
forget their troubles.She set the hour of their meeting at nine, when
the late dusk of summer had fallen; and she met him then, smiling, a
faintly perfumed white figure, slim and young, with a thrill in her
voice that was only half assumed."Surely you are not going to be back at
ten.""I have special permission to be out late."And then, recollecting their new situation: "We have a lot to
talk over.At the White Springs Hotel they stopped to fill the gasolene tank of the
car.Joe Drummond saw Wilson there, in the sheet-iron garage alongside
of the road.It did not occur to Joe
that the white figure in the car was not Sidney.He went rather white,
and stepped out of the zone of light.The influence of Le Moyne was
still on him, however, and he went on quietly with what he was doing.But his hands shook as he filled the radiator.When Wilson's car had gone on, he went automatically about his
preparations for the return trip--lifted a seat cushion to investigate
his own store of gasolene, replacing carefully the revolver he always
carried under the seat and packed in waste to prevent its accidental
discharge, lighted his lamps, examined a loose brake-band.He had been an ass: Le Moyne was right.He'd
get away--to Cuba if he could--and start over again.He would forget the
Street and let it forget him."To Schwitter's, of course," one of them grumbled."We might as well go
out of business.""There's no money in running a straight place.Schwitter and half a
dozen others are getting rich.""That was Wilson, the surgeon in town.He cut off my brother-in-law's
leg--charged him as much as if he had grown a new one for him.Now he goes to Schwitter's, like the rest.So Max Wilson was taking Sidney to Schwitter's, making her the butt of
garage talk!Joe's hands grew cold, his
head hot.A red mist spread between him and the line of electric lights.He knew Schwitter's, and he knew Wilson.He flung himself into his car and threw the throttle open."You can't start like that, son," one of the men remonstrated."You let
'er in too fast."Joe snarled, and made a second ineffectual effort.Thus adjured, the men offered neither further advice nor assistance.The
minutes went by in useless cranking--fifteen.But when K., growing uneasy, came out
into the yard, the engine had started at last.He was in time to see Joe
run his car into the road and turn it viciously toward Schwitter's.Carlotta's nearness was having its calculated effect on Max Wilson.His
spirits rose as the engine, marking perfect time, carried them along the
quiet roads.Partly it was reaction--relief that she should be so reasonable, so
complaisant--and a sort of holiday spirit after the day's hard work.Oddly enough, and not so irrational as may appear, Sidney formed a
part of the evening's happiness--that she loved him; that, back in the
lecture-room, eyes and even mind on the lecturer, her heart was with
him.So, with Sidney the basis of his happiness, he made the most of his
evening's freedom.He sang a little in his clear tenor--even, once when
they had slowed down at a crossing, bent over audaciously and kissed
Carlotta's hand in the full glare of a passing train."I like to be reckless," he replied.She did not want the situation to get
out of hand.Moreover, what was so real for her was only too plainly a
lark for him.The hopelessness of her situation was dawning on her.Even when the
touch of her beside him and the solitude of the country roads got in
his blood, and he bent toward her, she found no encouragement in his
words:--"I am mad about you to-night."She took her courage in her hands:--"Then why give me up for some one
else?"No one else will
ever care as I do."I don't care for anyone else in the
world.If you let me go I'll want to die."Then, as he was silent:--

"If you'll marry me, I'll be true to you all my life.The sense, if not the words, of what he had sworn to Sidney that Sunday
afternoon under the trees, on this very road!Swift shame overtook
him, that he should be here, that he had allowed Carlotta to remain in
ignorance of how things really stood between them.I'm engaged to marry some one
else."He was ashamed at the way she took the news.If she had stormed or wept,
he would have known what to do."You must have expected it, sooner or later."He thought she might faint, and looked at her
anxiously.Her profile, indistinct beside him, looked white and drawn.If their
escapade became known, it would end things between Sidney and him.It must become known
without any apparent move on her part.If, for instance, she became ill,
and was away from the hospital all night, that might answer.The thing
would be investigated, and who knew--

The car turned in at Schwitter's road and drew up before the house.The narrow porch was filled with small tables, above which hung rows of
electric lights enclosed in Japanese paper lanterns.Midweek, which had
found the White Springs Hotel almost deserted, saw Schwitter's crowded
tables set out under the trees.Seeing the crowd, Wilson drove directly
to the yard and parked his machine."No need of running any risk," he explained to the still figure beside
him."We can walk back and take a table under the trees, away from those
infernal lanterns."She reeled a little as he helped her out.She leaned rather
heavily on him as they walked toward the house.The faint perfume that
had almost intoxicated him, earlier, vaguely irritated him now.At the rear of the house she shook off his arm and preceded him around
the building.She chose the end of the porch as the place in which to
drop, and went down like a stone, falling back.The visitors at Schwitter's were too
much engrossed with themselves to be much interested.She opened her
eyes almost as soon as she fell--to forestall any tests; she was
shrewd enough to know that Wilson would detect her malingering very
quickly--and begged to be taken into the house."I feel very ill," she
said, and her white face bore her out.Schwitter and Bill carried her in and up the stairs to one of the newly
furnished rooms.He had a
horror of knockout drops and the police.They laid her on the bed, her
hat beside her; and Wilson, stripping down the long sleeve of her glove,
felt her pulse."There's a doctor in the next town," said Schwitter."I was going to
send for him, anyhow--my wife's not very well."He closed the door behind the relieved figure of the landlord, and,
going back to Carlotta, stood looking down at her."You were no more faint than I am."The lanterns--"

He crossed the room deliberately and went out, closing the door behind
him.He saw at once where he stood--in what danger.If she insisted
that she was ill and unable to go back, there would be a fuss.At the foot of the stairs, Schwitter pulled himself together.After all,
the girl was only ill.The doctor ought to be here by this time.Tillie was alone, out
in the harness-room.He looked through the crowded rooms, at the
overflowing porch with its travesty of pleasure, and he hated the whole
thing with a desperate hatred.A young man edged his way into the hall and confronted him."Upstairs--first bedroom to the right."Surely, as
a man sowed he reaped.At the top, on the landing, he confronted
Wilson.He fired at him without a word--saw him fling up his arms and
fall back, striking first the wall, then the floor.The buzz of conversation on the porch suddenly ceased.Joe put his
revolver in his pocket and went quietly down the stairs.The crowd
parted to let him through.Carlotta, crouched in her room, listening, not daring to open the door,
heard the sound of a car as it swung out into the road.CHAPTER XXV


On the evening of the shooting at Schwitter's, there had been a late
operation at the hospital.Sidney, having duly transcribed her lecture
notes and said her prayers, was already asleep when she received the
insistent summons to the operating-room.These night battles with death roused all her fighting blood.There were times when she felt as if, by sheer will, she could force
strength, life itself, into failing bodies.Her sensitive nostrils
dilated, her brain worked like a machine.That night she received well-deserved praise.When the Lamb, telephoning
hysterically, had failed to locate the younger Wilson, another staff
surgeon was called.His keen eyes watched Sidney--felt her capacity, her
fiber, so to speak; and, when everything was over, he told her what was
in his mind."Don't wear yourself out, girl," he said gravely.It was good work to-night--fine work.By midnight the work was done, and the nurse in charge sent Sidney to
bed.It was the Lamb who received the message about Wilson; and because he
was not very keen at the best, and because the news was so startling, he
refused to credit his ears.I mustn't make a mess of this."Wilson, the surgeon, has been shot," came slowly and distinctly."Get the staff there and have a room ready.Get the operating-room
ready, too."The Lamb wakened then, and roused the house.He was incoherent, rather,
so that Dr.Ed got the impression that it was Le Moyne who had been
shot, and only learned the truth when he got to the hospital.He liked K., and his heart was sore within
him.Staff's in the
executive committee room, sir."I thought you said--"

The Lamb turned pale at that, and braced himself."I'm sorry--I thought you understood.Ed, who was heavy and not very young, sat down on an office chair.Out of sheer habit he had brought the bag.He put it down on the floor
beside him, and moistened his lips.The Lamb stood by the door, and Dr.Outside the windows, the night world went
by--taxi-cabs full of roisterers, women who walked stealthily close
to the buildings, a truck carrying steel, so heavy that it shook the
hospital as it rumbled by.The bag with the dog-collar in it was on the
floor.He thought of many things, but mostly of the promise he had made
his mother.And, having forgotten the injured man's shortcomings, he
was remembering his good qualities--his cheerfulness, his courage, his
achievements.He remembered the day Max had done the Edwardes operation,
and how proud he had been of him.He figured out how old he was--not
thirty-one yet, and already, perhaps--There he stopped thinking.Cold
beads of sweat stood out on his forehead."I think I hear them now, sir," said the Lamb, and stood back
respectfully to let him pass out of the door.Carlotta stayed in the room during the consultation.No one seemed to
wonder why she was there, or to pay any attention to her.Ed beside the bed, and
then closed in again.Carlotta waited, her hand over her mouth to keep herself from screaming.Surely they would operate; they wouldn't let him die like that!When she saw the phalanx break up, and realized that they would not
operate, she went mad.She stood against the door, and accused them of
cowardice--taunted them."Do you think he would let any of you die like that?""Die
like a hurt dog, and none of you to lift a hand?"It was Pfeiffer who drew her out of the room and tried to talk reason
and sanity to her."If there was a chance, we'd operate, and you
know it."The staff went hopelessly down the stairs to the smoking-room, and
smoked.The night assistant sent coffee down
to them, and they drank it.Ed stayed in his brother's room, and
said to his mother, under his breath, that he'd tried to do his best by
Max, and that from now on it would be up to her.The country doctor had come, too,
finding Tillie's trial not imminent.On the way in he had taken it
for granted that K. was a medical man like himself, and had placed his
hypodermic case at his disposal.When he missed him,--in the smoking-room, that was,--he asked for him."I don't see the chap who came in with us," he said.K. sat alone on a bench in the hall.He wondered who would tell Sidney;
he hoped they would be very gentle with her.He sat in the shadow,
waiting.He did not want to go home and leave her to what she might have
to face.There was a chance she would ask for him.He wanted to be near,
in that case.He sat in the shadow, on the bench.The night watchman went by twice and
stared at him.At last he asked K. to mind the door until he got some
coffee."One of the staff's been hurt," he explained."If I don't get some
coffee now, I won't get any."Somehow, she had not thought
of it before.Now she wondered how she could have failed to think of it.If only she could find him and he would do it!She would go down on her
knees--would tell him everything, if only he would consent.When she found him on his bench, however, she passed him by.She had a
terrible fear that he might go away if she put the thing to him first.So first she went to the staff and confronted them.They were men of
courage, only declining to undertake what they considered hopeless work.The one man among them who might have done the thing with any chance
of success lay stricken.Not one among them but would have given of his
best--only his best was not good enough."It would be the Edwardes operation, wouldn't it?"There were no rules to cover such conduct on
the part of a nurse.One of them--Pfeiffer again, by chance--replied
rather heavily:--

"If any, it would be the Edwardes operation."How
did this thing happen, Miss Harrison?"Her face was ghastly, save for the trace of
rouge; her eyes were red-rimmed.Edwardes is sitting on a bench in the hall outside!"He was to take up the old
burden.Ed remembered
about her when, tracing his brother's career from his babyhood to man's
estate and to what seemed now to be its ending, he had remembered that
Max was very fond of Sidney.He had hoped that Sidney would take him and
do for him what he, Ed, had failed to do.She thought it was another operation, and her spirit was just a little
weary.She forced her shoes on her
tired feet, and bathed her face in cold water to rouse herself.He was fond of Sidney; she always
smiled at him; and, on his morning rounds at six o'clock to waken the
nurses, her voice was always amiable.So she found him in the hall,
holding a cup of tepid coffee.He was old and bleary, unmistakably dirty
too--but he had divined Sidney's romance.She took it obediently, but over the cup her eyes searched his.He had had another name, but it was
lost in the mists of years.So she finished it, not without anxiety that she might be needed.But
daddy's attentions were for few, and not to be lightly received."Can you stand a piece of bad news?"Strangely, her first thought was of K.It ain't much, but I guess you'd like to know
it."So she went down alone to the room where Dr.Ed sat in a chair, with
his untidy bag beside him on the floor, and his eyes fixed on a straight
figure on the bed.When he saw Sidney, he got up and put his arms around
her.His eyes told her the truth before he told her anything.She hardly
listened to what he said.The fact was all that concerned her--that her
lover was dying there, so near that she could touch him with her hand,
so far away that no voice, no caress of hers, could reach him.Ed's arms
about her, and wait.Sidney's voice sounded strange to her
ears.For suddenly Sidney's small world, which
had always sedately revolved in one direction, began to move the other
way.The door opened, and the staff came in.But where before they had
moved heavily, with drooped heads, now they came quickly, as men with a
purpose.There was a tall man in a white coat with them.He ordered them
about like children, and they hastened to do his will.At first Sidney
only knew that now, at last, they were going to do something--the tall
man was going to do something.He stood with his back to Sidney, and
gave orders.The nurses stood
by, while the staff did nurses' work.The senior surgical interne,
essaying assistance, was shoved aside by the senior surgical consultant,
and stood by, aggrieved.It was the Lamb, after all, who brought the news to Sidney.Ed, and she was alone now, her face buried
against the back of a chair."There'll be something doing now, Miss Page," he offered.Do you know who's going to do it?"His voice echoed the subdued excitement of the room--excitement and new
hope."Did you ever hear of Edwardes, the surgeon?--the Edwardes operation,
you know.They found him
sitting on a bench in the hall downstairs."Sidney raised her head, but she could not see the miraculously found
Edwardes.She could see the familiar faces of the staff, and that other
face on the pillow, and--she gave a little cry.How like
him to be there, to be wherever anyone was in trouble!Tears came to her
eyes--the first tears she had shed.As if her eyes had called him, he looked up and saw her.The staff stood back to let him pass, and gazed after him.The wonder of what had happened was growing on them.K. stood beside Sidney, and looked down at her.Just at first it seemed
as if he found nothing to say.Then:

"There's just a chance, Sidney dear.If a shadow passed over his face, no one saw it."I'll not ask you to go back to your room.If you will wait somewhere
near, I'll see that you have immediate word.""I am going to the operating-room."She was
not herself, of course, what with strain and weariness.Whether she knew him as Le Moyne or as Edwardes mattered very
little, after all.The thing that really mattered was that he must try
to save Wilson for her.If he failed--It ran through his mind that if he
failed she might hate him the rest of her life--not for himself, but for
his failure; that, whichever way things went, he must lose.Edwardes says you are to stay away from the operation, but to
remain near.He--he promises to call you if--things go wrong."She sat in the
anaesthetizing-room, and after a time she knew that she was not alone.She realized dully that Carlotta was there,
too, pacing up and down the little room.She was never sure, for
instance, whether she imagined it, or whether Carlotta really stopped
before her and surveyed her with burning eyes."So you thought he was going to marry you!"Sidney tried to answer, and failed--or that was the way the dream went."If you had enough character, I'd think you did it.How do I know you
didn't follow us, and shoot him as he left the room?"It must have been reality, after all; for Sidney's numbed mind grasped
the essential fact here, and held on to it.He had promised--sworn that this should not happen.It seemed as if nothing more could hurt her.In the movement to and from the operating room, the door stood open for
a moment.A tall figure--how much it looked like K.!--straightened and
held out something in its hand.Then more waiting, a stir of movement in the room beyond the closed
door.Carlotta was standing, her face buried in her hands, against the
door.It
must be tragic to care like that!She herself was not caring much; she
was too numb.Beyond, across the courtyard, was the stable.Before the day of the
motor ambulances, horses had waited there for their summons, eager as
fire horses, heads lifted to the gong.When Sidney saw the outline of
the stable roof, she knew that it was dawn.The city still slept, but
the torturing night was over.And in the gray dawn the staff, looking
gray too, and elderly and weary, came out through the closed door and
took their hushed way toward the elevator.Sidney, straining her ears, gathered that they had seen a
miracle, and that the wonder was still on them.Almost on their heels came K. He was in the white coat, and more and
more he looked like the man who had raised up from his work and held out
something in his hand.Sidney's head was aching and confused.She sat there in her chair, looking small and childish.The dawn was
morning now--horizontal rays of sunlight on the stable roof and across
the windowsill of the anaesthetizing-room, where a row of bottles sat on
a clean towel.The tall man--or was it K.?--looked at her, and then reached up and
turned off the electric light.Why, it was K., of course; and he was
putting out the hall light before he went upstairs.When the light was
out everything was gray.She slid very quietly out of
her chair, and lay at his feet in a dead faint.He held her as he had held her that day
at the park when she fell in the river, very carefully, tenderly, as one
holds something infinitely precious.Not until he had placed her on her
bed did she open her eyes.She was
so tired, and to be carried like that, in strong arms, not knowing where
one was going, or caring--

The nurse he had summoned hustled out for aromatic ammonia.Sidney,
lying among her pillows, looked up at K.All the time I was sitting waiting, I kept
thinking that it was you who were operating!The nurse was a long time getting the ammonia.There was so much to talk
about: that Dr.Max had been out with Carlotta Harrison, and had been
shot by a jealous woman; the inexplicable return to life of the great
Edwardes; and--a fact the nurse herself was willing to vouch for, and
that thrilled the training-school to the core--that this very Edwardes,
newly risen, as it were, and being a miracle himself as well as
performing one, this very Edwardes, carrying Sidney to her bed and
putting her down, had kissed her on her white forehead.And,
after all, the nurse had only seen it in the mirror, being occupied
at the time in seeing if her cap was straight.The school, therefore,
accepted the miracle, but refused the kiss.But something had happened to K.
that savored of the marvelous.His faith in himself was coming back--not
strongly, with a rush, but with all humility.He had been loath to
take up the burden; but, now that he had it, he breathed a sort of
inarticulate prayer to be able to carry it.And, since men have looked for signs since the beginning of time, he too
asked for a sign.Not, of course, that he put it that way, or that he
was making terms with Providence.It was like this: if Wilson got well,
he'd keep on working.He'd feel that, perhaps, after all, this was
meant.If Wilson died--Sidney held out her hand to him."What should I do without you, K.?""All you have to do is to want me."His voice was not too steady, and he took her pulse in a most
businesslike way to distract her attention from it.You are quite professional about
pulses."He was not sure, to be frank, that she'd
be interested.Now, with Wilson as he was, was no time to obtrude his
own story."Will you drink some beef tea if I send it to you?""Sleep, while he--"

"I promise to tell you if there is any change.But, as he rose from the chair beside her low bed, she put out her hand
to him.And, when he hesitated: "I bring all my troubles
to you, as if you had none.Somehow, I can't go to Aunt Harriet, and of
course mother--Carlotta cares a great deal for him.He had so many friends, and no enemies that I knew
of."Her mind seemed to stagger about in a circle, making little excursions,
but always coming back to the one thing."Some drunken visitor to the road-house."He could have killed himself for the words the moment they were spoken."It is not just to judge anyone before you hear the story.""I must get up and go on duty."When the nurse
came in with the belated ammonia, she found K. making an arbitrary
ruling, and Sidney looking up at him mutinously."Miss Page is not to go on duty to-day.She is to stay in bed until
further orders."The confusion in Sidney's mind cleared away suddenly.It was K. who had performed the miracle operation--K. who
had dared and perhaps won!Dear K., with his steady eyes and his long
surgeon's fingers!Then, because she seemed to see ahead as well as
back into the past in that flash that comes to the drowning and to those
recovering from shock, and because she knew that now the little house
would no longer be home to K., she turned her face into her pillow and
cried.Her lover was not true and might
be dying; her friend would go away to his own world, which was not the
Street.K. left her at last and went back to Seventeen, where Dr.If Max would only open
his eyes, so he could tell him what had been in his mind all these
years--his pride in him and all that.With a sort of belated desire to make up for where he had failed, he put
the bag that had been Max's bete noir on the bedside table, and began
to clear it of rubbish--odd bits of dirty cotton, the tubing from a long
defunct stethoscope, glass from a broken bottle, a scrap of paper on
which was a memorandum, in his illegible writing, to send Max a check
for his graduating suit.When K. came in, he had the old dog-collar in
his hand."Belonged to an old collie of ours," he said heavily."Milkman ran over
him and killed him.Max chased the wagon and licked the driver with his
own whip."Got him in
a grape-basket."CHAPTER XXVI


Max had rallied well, and things looked bright for him.His patient did
not need him, but K. was anxious to find Joe; so he telephoned the
gas office and got a day off.The sordid little tragedy was easy to
reconstruct, except that, like Joe, K. did not believe in the innocence
of the excursion to Schwitter's.His spirit was heavy with the
conviction that he had saved Wilson to make Sidney ultimately wretched.And it is doubtful if the Street would
have been greatly concerned even had it known.It had never heard of
Edwardes, of the Edwardes clinic or the Edwardes operation.Its medical
knowledge comprised the two Wilsons and the osteopath around the corner.When, as would happen soon, it learned of Max Wilson's injury, it would
be more concerned with his chances of recovery than with the manner of
it.But Joe's affair with Sidney had been the talk of the neighborhood.If
the boy disappeared, a scandal would be inevitable.Twenty people had
seen him at Schwitter's and would know him again.At first it seemed as if the boy had frustrated him.Christine, waylaying K. in the little hall, told him
that.She
says Joe has not been home all night.She says he looks up to you, and
she thought if you could find him and would talk to him--"

"Joe was with me last night.Drummond he was in good spirits, and that she's not to worry.I feel sure she will hear from him to-day.Something went wrong with his
car, perhaps, after he left me."Katie brought his coffee to his room,
and he drank it standing.He was working out a theory about the boy.Beyond Schwitter's the highroad stretched, broad and inviting, across
the State.Either he would have gone that way, his little car eating up
the miles all that night, or--K. would not formulate his fear of what
might have happened, even to himself.As he went down the Street, he saw Mrs.McKee in her doorway, with a
little knot of people around her.The Street was getting the night's
news.He rented a car at a local garage, and drove himself out into the
country.He was not minded to have any eyes on him that day.Bill was
scrubbing the porch, and a farmhand was gathering bottles from the grass
into a box.The dead lanterns swung in the morning air, and from back on
the hill came the staccato sounds of a reaping-machine.He recognized K., and, mopping dry a part of the porch,
shoved a chair on it.Well, how's the man who got his last night?"County detectives were here bright and early.That's what this house
is--money.""Bill, did you see the man who fired that shot last night?"A sort of haze came over Bill's face, as if he had dropped a curtain
before his eyes.But his reply came promptly:

"Surest thing in the world.Dark man,
about thirty, small mustache--"

"Bill, you're lying, and I know it.The barkeeper kept his head, but his color changed.He thrust his mop into the pail.He's been out at the barn all night."The farmhand had filled his box and disappeared around the corner of the
house.K. put his hand on Bill's shirt-sleeved arm."We've got to get him away from here, Bill."The county men may come back to search the premises.""How do I know you aren't one of them?"As a matter of fact,
I followed him here; but I was too late.Did he take the revolver away
with him?"After all, it was a good world:
Tillie with her baby in her arms; Wilson conscious and rallying; Joe
safe, and, without the revolver, secure from his own remorse.Other
things there were, too--the feel of Sidney's inert body in his arms, the
way she had turned to him in trouble.It was not what he wanted, this
last, but it was worth while.The reaping-machine was in sight now; it
had stopped on the hillside.The men were drinking out of a bucket that
flashed in the sun.What had come over Wilson, to do so reckless
a thing?K., who was a one-woman man, could not explain it.From inside the bar Bill took a careful survey of Le Moyne.He noted his
tall figure and shabby suit, the slight stoop, the hair graying over his
ears.Barkeepers know men: that's a part of the job.After his survey he
went behind the bar and got the revolver from under an overturned pail."Now," he said quietly, "where is he?""In my room--top of the house."He remembered the day when he had sat
waiting in the parlor, and had heard Tillie's slow step coming down.And last night he himself had carried down Wilson's unconscious figure.Surely the wages of sin were wretchedness and misery.From nails in the rafters hung Bill's holiday wardrobe.A tin cup and a
cracked pitcher of spring water stood on the window-sill.Joe was sitting in the corner farthest from the window.When the door
swung open, he looked up.He showed no interest on seeing K., who had to
stoop to enter the low room.You're damned glad you didn't, and so am I.""But never mind about that, Joe;
I'll get some."Loud calls from below took Bill out of the room.As he closed the door
behind him, K.'s voice took on a new tone: "Joe, why did you do it?""You saw him with somebody at the White Springs, and followed them?"I did it, and I'll stand by
it.""Has it occurred to you that you made a mistake?""Go and tell that to somebody who'll believe you!""They
came here and took a room.I'd do it again
if I had a chance, and do it better."I got here not two minutes after you left.Sidney was not out of the hospital
last night.She attended a lecture, and then an operation."It was undoubtedly a relief to him to know that it had not
been Sidney; but if K. expected any remorse, he did not get it."If he is that sort, he deserves what he got," said the boy grimly.The hours he had spent
alone in the little room had been very bitter, and preceded by a time
that he shuddered to remember.K. got it by degrees--his descent of the
staircase, leaving Wilson lying on the landing above; his resolve to
walk back and surrender himself at Schwitter's, so that there could be
no mistake as to who had committed the crime."I intended to write a confession and then shoot myself," he told K."But the barkeeper got my gun out of my pocket.And--"

After a pause: "Does she know who did it?""Then, if he gets better, she'll marry him anyhow."The thing we've got to do is to
hush the thing up, and get you away.""I'd go to Cuba, but I haven't the money.""Sidney need never know who did it."There are times when some cataclysm tears down the walls of reserve
between men.That time had come for Joe, and to a lesser extent for K.
The boy rose and followed him to the door."Why don't you tell her the whole thing?--the whole filthy story?"Schwitter had taken in five hundred dollars the previous day."Five hundred gross," the little man hastened to explain.It's going hard
with her, just now, that she hasn't any women friends about.It's in the
safe, in cash; I haven't had time to take it to the bank."He seemed
to apologize to himself for the unbusinesslike proceeding of lending
an entire day's gross receipts on no security."It's better to get him
away, of course.I have tried to have an orderly
place.If they arrest him here--"

His voice trailed off.He had come a far way from the day he had walked
down the Street, and eyed Its poplars with appraising eyes--a far way.Now he had a son, and the child's mother looked at him with tragic eyes.It was arranged that K. should go back to town, returning late that
night to pick up Joe at a lonely point on the road, and to drive him to
a railroad station.But, as it happened, he went back that afternoon.He had told Schwitter he would be at the hospital, and the message found
him there.Wilson was holding his own, conscious now and making a hard
fight.The message from Schwitter was very brief:--

"Something has happened, and Tillie wants you.I don't like to trouble
you again, but she--wants you."K. was rather gray of face by that time, having had no sleep and little
food since the day before.But he got into the rented machine again--its
rental was running up; he tried to forget it--and turned it toward
Hillfoot.But first of all he drove back to the Street, and walked
without ringing into Mrs.McKee's approaching change of state had
altered the "mealing" house.The ticket-punch still lay on the hat-rack
in the hall.Through the rusty screen of the back parlor window one
viewed the spiraea, still in need of spraying.McKee herself was in
the pantry, placing one slice of tomato and three small lettuce leaves
on each of an interminable succession of plates."I've got a car at the door," he announced, "and there's nothing so
extravagant as an empty seat in an automobile.Being of the class who believe a boudoir cap the
ideal headdress for a motor-car, she apologized for having none."If I'd known you were coming I would have borrowed a cap," she said."Miss Tripp, third floor front, has a nice one.If you'll take me in my
toque--"

K. said he'd take her in her toque, and waited with some anxiety,
having not the faintest idea what a toque was.He was not without other
anxieties.What if the sight of Tillie's baby did not do all that he
expected?And Schwitter had been very
vague.But here K. was more sure of himself: the little man's voice had
expressed as exactly as words the sense of a bereavement that was not a
grief.McKee's old fondness for the girl to bring them
together.But, as they neared the house with its lanterns and tables,
its whitewashed stones outlining the drive, its small upper window
behind which Joe was waiting for night, his heart failed him, rather.He
had a masculine dislike for meddling, and yet--Mrs.McKee had suddenly
seen the name in the wooden arch over the gate: "Schwitter's.""I'm not going in there, Mr."Tillie's not in the house."She didn't approve of all that went on there, so she moved out.It's
very comfortable and clean; it smells of hay.You'd be surprised how
nice it is.""She's late with her conscience,
I'm thinking.""Last night," K. remarked, hands on the wheel, but car stopped, "she
had a child there.It--it's rather like very old times, isn't it?McKee, not in a manger, of course."McKee's tone, which had been fierce at
the beginning, ended feebly."I want you to go in and visit her, as you would any woman who'd had a
new baby and needed a friend.Tell her you've been wanting to see her.""Lie a little, for your soul's sake."She wavered, and while she wavered he drove her in under the arch with
the shameful name, and back to the barn.But there he had the tact to
remain in the car, and Mrs.McKee's peace with Tillie was made alone.When, five minutes later, she beckoned him from the door of the barn,
her eyes were red.They're going
to be married right away."The clergyman was coming along the path with Schwitter at his heels.At the door to Tillie's room he uncovered his head.Lorenz had saved Palmer Howe's
credit.On the strength of the deposit, he borrowed a thousand at the
bank with which he meant to pay his bills, arrears at the University and
Country Clubs, a hundred dollars lost throwing aces with poker dice, and
various small obligations of Christine's.He drank nothing for a week,
went into the details of the new venture with Christine's father, sat at
home with Christine on her balcony in the evenings.With the knowledge
that he could pay his debts, he postponed the day.He liked the feeling
of a bank account in four figures.The first evening or two Christine's pleasure in having him there
gratified him.He felt kind, magnanimous, almost virtuous.On the third
evening he was restless.It occurred to him that his wife was beginning
to take his presence as a matter of course.When he found that the ice was out and the beer warm and flat, he was
furious.Christine had been making a fight, although her heart was only half
in it.She was resolutely good-humored, ignored the past, dressed for
Palmer in the things he liked.They still took their dinners at the
Lorenz house up the street.When she saw that the haphazard table
service there irritated him, she coaxed her mother into getting a
butler.The Street sniffed at the butler behind his stately back.Secretly and
in its heart, it was proud of him.With a half-dozen automobiles, and
Christine Howe putting on low neck in the evenings, and now a butler,
not to mention Harriet Kennedy's Mimi, it ceased to pride itself on
its commonplaceness, ignorant of the fact that in its very lack of
affectation had lain its charm.On the night that Joe shot Max Wilson, Palmer was noticeably restless.He had seen Grace Irving that day for the first time but once since
the motor accident.To do him justice, his dissipation of the past few
months had not included women.Perhaps she typified the
care-free days before his marriage; perhaps the attraction was deeper,
fundamental.He met her in the street the day before Max Wilson was
shot.The sight of her walking sedately along in her shop-girl's black
dress had been enough to set his pulses racing.When he saw that she
meant to pass him, he fell into step beside her."I believe you were going to cut me!"And, after a second's hesitation: "I'm keeping straight, too.""Do you have to walk as fast as this?"Once a week I get off a little early.I--"

He eyed her suspiciously.The Rosenfeld boy is still there, you know."But a moment later he burst out irritably:--

"That was an accident, Grace.The boy took the chance when he engaged
to drive the car.I dream of the little
devil sometimes, lying there.I'll tell you what I'll do," he added
magnanimously."I'll stop in and talk to Wilson.He ought to have done
something before this."I don't think you can do anything for
him, unless--"

The monstrous injustice of the thing overcame her.Palmer and she
walking about, and the boy lying on his hot bed!If you could give her some money, it would
help.""You owe him too, don't you?I don't see that I'm under any
obligation, anyhow.I paid his board for two months in the hospital."When she did not acknowledge this generosity,--amounting to forty-eight
dollars,--his irritation grew.Her manner
galled him, into the bargain.She was too calm in his presence, too
cold.Where she had once palpitated visibly under his warm gaze, she was
now self-possessed and quiet.Where it had pleased his pride to think
that he had given her up, he found that the shoe was on the other foot.At the entrance to a side street she stopped.The next day he drew the thousand dollars from the bank.A good many
of his debts he wanted to pay in cash; there was no use putting checks
through, with incriminating indorsements.Also, he liked the idea of
carrying a roll of money around.The big fellows at the clubs always had
a wad and peeled off bills like skin off an onion.He took a couple of
drinks to celebrate his approaching immunity from debt.He played auction bridge that afternoon in a private room at one of the
hotels with the three men he had lunched with.He won eighty dollars, and thrust it loose in his trousers pocket.If he could carry the thousand around for a
day or so, something pretty good might come of it.When the game was over, he
bought drinks to celebrate his victory.The losers treated, too, to show
they were no pikers.He offered to put up
the eighty and throw for it.The losers mentioned dinner and various
engagements.Christine would greet him with raised
eyebrows.They would eat a stuffy Lorenz dinner, and in the evening
Christine would sit in the lamplight and drive him mad with soft music.He wanted lights, noise, the smiles of women.Luck was with him, and he
wanted to be happy.At nine o'clock that night he found Grace.She had moved to a cheap
apartment which she shared with two other girls from the store.His drunkenness was of the mind, mostly.The lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were
slightly accentuated, his eyes open a trifle wider than usual.That
and a slight paleness of the nostrils were the only evidences of his
condition.She retreated before him, her eyes watchful.Men in his condition were
apt to be as quick with a blow as with a caress.But, having gained his
point, he was amiable.We can take in a roof-garden.""I've told you I'm not doing that sort of thing.""You've got somebody else on the string."There--there has never been anybody else, Palmer."He caught her suddenly and jerked her toward him."You let me hear of anybody else, and I'll cut the guts out of him!"He held her for a second, his face black and fierce.Then, slowly and
inevitably, he drew her into his arms.But, in the queer loyalty of her class, he was the only man she had
cared for.She took him for that moment, felt his hot
kisses on her mouth, her throat, submitted while his rather brutal
hands bruised her arms in fierce caresses.Then she put him from her
resolutely.But he was less steady than he had been.The heat of the little flat
brought more blood to his head.He wavered as he stood just inside the
door.She's in love with a fellow at the house.""Lemme come in and sit down, won't you?"She let him pass her into the sitting-room."You've turned me down, and now Christine--she thinks I don't know.I'm
no fool; I see a lot of things.I know that I've made her
miserable.But I made a merry little hell for you too, and you don't
kick about it."Nothing else, perhaps, could have shown her so well what a broken reed
he was.You were a good girl before I knew you.I'm not going to do you any harm, I swear it.I only
wanted to take you out for a good time.He
drew out the roll of bills and showed it to her.She had never known him to have much money.A new look flashed into her eyes, not cupidity, but purpose."Aren't you going to give me some of that?"The very drunk have the intuition sometimes of savages or brute beasts.He thrust it back into his pocket, but his hand retained its grasp of
it."Don't lemme be happy for a minute!"You give me that for the Rosenfeld boy, and I'll go out with you.""If I give you all that, I won't have any money to go out with!""I'm no piker," he said largely.He held it out to her, and from another pocket produced the eighty
dollars, in crushed and wrinkled notes."It's my lucky day," he said thickly.His head dropped back on his chair; he propped his sagging legs on a
stool.She knew him--knew that he would sleep almost all night.She would have to make up something to tell the other girls; but no
matter--she could attend to that later.She had never had a thousand dollars in her hands before.She paused, in
pinning on her hat, to count the bills.CHAPTER XXVII


K. spent all of the evening of that day with Wilson.He was not to go
for Joe until eleven o'clock.The injured man's vitality was standing
him in good stead.He had asked for Sidney and she was at his bedside.The office is full, they tell me," he said, bending
over the bed."I'll come in later, and if they'll make me a shakedown,
I'll stay with you to-night.""Get some sleep...I've been a
poor stick...try to do better--" His roving eyes fell on the dog collar
on the stand.he said, and put his hand over
Dr.Ed's, as it lay on the bed.K. found Sidney in the room, not sitting, but standing by the window.One shaded light burned in a far corner.It seemed to K. that she looked at
him as if she had never really seen him before, and he was right.Sidney was trying to reconcile the K. she had known so well with this
new K., no longer obscure, although still shabby, whose height had
suddenly become presence, whose quiet was the quiet of infinite power.She was suddenly shy of him, as he stood looking down at her.He saw the
gleam of her engagement ring on her finger.As
though she had meant by wearing it to emphasize her belief in her lover.They did not speak beyond their greeting, until he had gone over the
record.Then:--

"We can't talk here.Far away was the
night nurse's desk, with its lamp, its annunciator, its pile of records.The passage floor reflected the light on glistening boards."I have been thinking until I am almost crazy, K. And now I know how it
happened."The principal thing is, not how it happened, but that he is going to
get well, Sidney."She stood looking down, twisting her ring around her finger."We are going to get him away to-night.He'll
get off safely, I think."You shoulder all our
troubles, K., as if they were your own."You mean--but my part in
getting Joe off is practically nothing.As a matter of fact, Schwitter
has put up the money.My total capital in the world, after paying the
taxicab to-day, is seven dollars."Tillie married
and has a baby--all in twenty-four hours!Squalled like a maniac when the water went on its head."She said she would have to go in her toque."You find Max and save him--don't look like
that!And you get Joe away, borrowing money to send
him.And as if that isn't enough, when you ought to have been getting
some sleep, you are out taking a friend to Tillie, and being godfather
to the baby."I--"

"When I look back and remember how all these months I've been talking
about service, and you said nothing at all, and all the time you were
living what I preached--I'm so ashamed, K."She saw that, and tried to
smile.I'm to take him across the country to the railroad.I was
wondering--"

"Yes?""I'd better explain first what happened, and why it happened.Then if
you are willing to send him a line, I think it would help.He saw a girl
in white in the car and followed in his own machine.He thought it was
you, of course.He didn't like the idea of your going to Schwitter's.And Schwitter and--and Wilson took her upstairs
to a room."I feel very guilty, K., as if it all comes back to
me.He watched her go down the hall toward the night nurse's desk.He would
have given everything just then for the right to call her back, to take
her in his arms and comfort her.He himself had
gone through loneliness and heartache, and the shadow was still on him.He waited until he saw her sit down at the desk and take up a pen.Then
he went back into the quiet room.He stood by the bedside, looking down.Wilson was breathing quietly: his
color was coming up, as he rallied from the shock.'s mind now was
just one thought--to bring him through for Sidney, and then to go away.He could do
sanitation work, or he might try the Canal.The Street would go on working out its own salvation.He would have
to think of something for the Rosenfelds.But there again, perhaps it would be better if he went away.Christine's story would have to work itself out.He was glad in a way that Sidney had asked no questions about him, had
accepted his new identity so calmly.It had been overshadowed by the
night tragedy.It would have pleased him if she had shown more interest,
of course.It was enough, he told himself, that he
had helped her, that she counted on him.But more and more he knew in
his heart that it was not enough."I'd better get away from here," he
told himself savagely.And having taken the first step toward flight, as happens in such cases,
he was suddenly panicky with fear, fear that he would get out of hand,
and take her in his arms, whether or no; a temptation to run from
temptation, to cut everything and go with Joe that night.But there
his sense of humor saved him.That would be a sight for the gods, two
defeated lovers flying together under the soft September moon.He thought it was Sidney and turned with the
light in his eyes that was only for her.She wore a dark skirt and white waist and her
high heels tapped as she crossed the room.Of course it will be a day or two before we are quite
sure."She stood looking down at Wilson's quiet figure."I guess you know I've been crazy about him," she said quietly.I played his game and
I--lost.Quite suddenly she dropped on her knees beside the bed, and put her
cheek close to the sleeping man's hand.When after a moment she rose,
she was controlled again, calm, very white.Edwardes, when he is conscious, that I came in
and said good-bye?"She hesitated, as if the thought tempted her.But K. could not let her go like that.I'm about through with my training, but I've lost my
diploma.""I don't like to see you going away like this."She avoided his eyes, but his kindly tone did what neither the Head nor
the Executive Committee had done that day.One way and another I've known you a long time.""I'll tell you where I live, and--"

"I know where you live."I've tried twice for a diploma and failed.But in the end he prevailed on her to promise not to leave the city
until she had seen him again.It was not until she had gone, a straight
figure with haunted eyes, that he reflected whimsically that once again
he had defeated his own plans for flight.In the corridor outside the door Carlotta hesitated.He was kind; he was going to do something for her.But the old instinct of self-preservation prevailed.Sidney brought her letter to Joe back to K. She was flushed with the
effort and with a new excitement."This is the letter, K., and--I haven't been able to say what I wanted,
exactly.You'll let him know, won't you, how I feel, and how I blame
myself?"Somebody has sent Johnny Rosenfeld a lot of money.The ward nurse wants
you to come back."The well-ordered beds of the daytime
were chaotic now, torn apart by tossing figures.The night was hot and
an electric fan hummed in a far corner.Under its sporadic breezes, as
it turned, the ward was trying to sleep.He was sure it was there, for ever
since it came his hot hand had clutched it.He was quite sure that somehow or other K. had had a hand in it.When he
disclaimed it, the boy was bewildered."It'll buy the old lady what she wants for the house, anyhow," he
said."But I hope nobody's took up a collection for me."You can bet your last match he didn't."In some unknown way the news had reached the ward that Johnny's friend,
Mr."He works in the gas office," he said, "I've seen him there.If he's a
surgeon, what's he doing in the gas office.If he's a surgeon, what's he
doing teaching me raffia-work?After
all, he was a man, or almost.Didn't he have a
state license?"They've got a queer story about you here in the ward.""They say that you're a surgeon; that you operated on Dr.They say that you're the king pin where you came from.""I know it's a damn lie, but if it's true--"

"I used to be a surgeon.As a matter of fact I operated on Dr.I--I am rather apologetic, Jack, because I didn't explain to
you sooner.For--various reasons--I gave up that--that line of business."Don't you think you could do something for me, sir?"When K. did not reply at once, he launched into an explanation."I've been lying here a good while.I didn't say much because I knew I'd
have to take a chance.Either I'd pull through or I wouldn't, and the
odds were--well, I didn't say much.The old lady's had a lot of trouble.But now, with THIS under my pillow for her, I've got a right to ask.I'll take a chance, if you will."But lie here and watch these soaks off the street.Old, a
lot of them, and gettin' well to go out and starve, and--My God!Le
Moyne, they can walk, and I can't."He had started, and now he must go on.Faith in
himself or no faith, he must go on.Life, that had loosed its hold on
him for a time, had found him again."I'll go over you carefully to-morrow, Jack.I'll tell you your chances
honestly."Whatever you charge--"

"I'll take it out of my board bill in the new house!"At four o'clock that morning K. got back from seeing Joe off.Over Sidney's letter Joe had shed a shamefaced tear or two.And during
the night ride, with K. pushing the car to the utmost, he had felt that
the boy, in keeping his hand in his pocket, had kept it on the letter.When the road was smooth and stretched ahead, a gray-white line into the
night, he tried to talk a little courage into the boy's sick heart."You'll see new people, new life," he said."In a month from now you'll
wonder why you ever hung around the Street.I have a feeling that you're
going to make good down there."And once, when the time for parting was very near,--"No matter what
happens, keep on believing in yourself.Joe's response showed his entire self-engrossment."If he dies, I'm a murderer.""He's not going to die," said K. stoutly.At four o'clock in the morning he left the car at the garage and walked
around to the little house.He had had no sleep for forty-five hours;
his eyes were sunken in his head; the skin over his temples looked drawn
and white.His clothes were wrinkled; the soft hat he habitually wore
was white with the dust of the road.As he opened the hall door, Christine stirred in the room beyond.Why in the world aren't you in bed?""Palmer has just come home in a terrible rage.He says he's been robbed
of a thousand dollars.""He doesn't know, or says he doesn't.In the dim hall light he realized that her face was strained and set.The tender words broke down the last barrier of her self-control.She held her arms out to him, and because he was very tired and lonely,
and because more than anything else in the world just then he needed a
woman's arms, he drew her to him and held her close, his cheek to her
hair.Surely there must be some
happiness for us somewhere."But the next moment he let her go and stepped back."I shouldn't have
done that--You know how it is with me.""I'm afraid it will always be Sidney."CHAPTER XXVIII


Johnny Rosenfeld was dead.'s skill had not sufficed to save
him.The operation had been a marvel, but the boy's long-sapped strength
failed at the last.K., set of face, stayed with him to the end.The boy did not know he was
going.He roused from the coma and smiled up at Le Moyne."I've got a hunch that I can move my right foot," he said."Brake foot, clutch foot," said Johnny, and closed his eyes again.K. had forbidden the white screens, that outward symbol of death.So the ward had no suspicion, nor had the boy.It was Sunday, and from the chapel far below
came the faint singing of a hymn.When Johnny spoke again he did not
open his eyes.I'll put in a word for you whenever
I get a chance.""Yes, put in a word for me," said K. huskily.He felt that Johnny would be a good mediator--that whatever he, K., had
done of omission or commission, Johnny's voice before the Tribunal would
count.The lame young violin-player came into the ward.She had cherished a
secret and romantic affection for Max Wilson, and now he was in the
hospital and ill.So she wore the sacrificial air of a young nun and
played "The Holy City."Johnny was close on the edge of his long sleep by that time, and very
comfortable."Tell her nix on the sob stuff," he complained."Ask her to play 'I'm
twenty-one and she's eighteen.'"'s quick explanation she changed to
the staccato air."Ask her if she'll come a little nearer; I can't hear her."So she moved to the foot of the bed, and to the gay little tune Johnny
began his long sleep.But first he asked K. a question: "Are you sure
I'm going to walk, Mr."I give you my solemn word," said K. huskily, "that you are going to be
better than you have ever been in your life."It was K. who, seeing he would no longer notice, ordered the screens to
be set around the bed, K. who drew the coverings smooth and folded the
boy's hands over his breast."It was the result of a man's damnable folly," said K. grimly.The immediate result of his death was that K., who had gained some of
his faith in himself on seeing Wilson on the way to recovery, was beset
by his old doubts.What right had he to arrogate to himself again powers
of life and death?Over and over he told himself that there had been no
carelessness here, that the boy would have died ultimately, that he
had taken the only chance, that the boy himself had known the risk and
begged for it.And now came a question that demanded immediate answer.Wilson would
be out of commission for several months, probably.And he wanted K. to take over his work.You're not thinking about going back to that
ridiculous gas office, are you?""I had some thought of going to Cuba."You've done a marvelous thing; I lie
here and listen to the staff singing your praises until I'm sick of your
name!And now, because a boy who wouldn't have lived anyhow--"

"That's not it," K. put in hastily.I guess I could do
it and get away with it as well as the average.All that deters me--I've
never told you, have I, why I gave up before?"K. was walking restlessly about the
room, as was his habit when troubled."I've heard the gossip; that's all.""When you recognized me that night on the balcony, I told you I'd lost
my faith in myself, and you said the whole affair had been gone over
at the State Society.As a matter of fact, the Society knew of only two
cases."Even at that--"

"You know what I always felt about the profession, Max.We went into
that more than once in Berlin.When I left Lorch and built my own hospital, I hadn't
a doubt of myself.And because I was getting results I got a lot of
advertising.I found I was making
enough out of the patients who could pay to add a few free wards.I want
to tell you now, Wilson, that the opening of those free wards was the
greatest self-indulgence I ever permitted myself.I'd seen so much
careless attention given the poor--well, never mind that.It was almost
three years ago that things began to go wrong.All this doesn't influence me, Edwardes."We had a system in the operating-room as perfect as I
could devise it.I never finished an operation without having my first
assistant verify the clip and sponge count.But that first case died
because a sponge had been left in the operating field.You know how
those things go; you can't always see them, and one goes by the count,
after reasonable caution.Then I lost another case in the same way--a
free case."As well as I could tell, the precautions had not been relaxed.I was
doing from four to six cases a day.After the second one I almost went
crazy.I made up my mind, if there was ever another, I'd give up and go
away."When the last case died, a free case again, I
performed my own autopsy.I allowed only my first assistant in the room.He was almost as frenzied as I was.When I
told him I was going away, he offered to take the blame himself, to
say he had closed the incision.He tried to make me think he was
responsible.I've sent them money from time to time.I used to sit and think
about the children he left, and what would become of them.The ironic
part of it was that, for all that had happened, I was busier all the
time.Men were sending me cases from all over the country.It was either
stay and keep on working, with that chance, or--quit."But if
you had stayed, and taken extra precautions--"

"We'd taken every precaution we knew."K. stood, his tall figure outlined
against the window.Far off, in the children's ward, children were
laughing; from near by a very young baby wailed a thin cry of protest
against life; a bell rang constantly.'s mind was busy with the
past--with the day he decided to give up and go away, with the months of
wandering and homelessness, with the night he had come upon the Street
and had seen Sidney on the doorstep of the little house.You had an enemy somewhere--on your
staff, probably.This profession of ours is a big one, but you know its
jealousies.Let a man get his shoulders above the crowd, and the pack
is after him.""Mixed figure, but you know what I
mean."He had had that gift of the big man everywhere, in
every profession, of securing the loyalty of his followers.He would
have trusted every one of them with his life."You're going to do it, of course."To stay on, to be near Sidney, perhaps to stand
by as Wilson's best man when he was married--it turned him cold.But he
did not give a decided negative.The sick man was flushed and growing
fretful; it would not do to irritate him."Give me another day on it," he said at last.Max's injury had been productive of good, in one way.It had brought the
two brothers closer together.In the mornings Max was restless until
Dr.When he came, he brought books in the shabby bag--his
beloved Burns, although he needed no book for that, the "Pickwick
Papers," Renan's "Lives of the Disciples."Very often Max world doze
off; at the cessation of Dr.Ed's sonorous voice the sick man would stir
fretfully and demand more.But because he listened to everything without
discrimination, the older man came to the conclusion that it was the
companionship that counted.It reminded him of
Max's boyhood, when he had read to Max at night.For once in the last
dozen years, he needed him.What in blazes makes you stop every five minutes?"Ed, who had only stopped to bite off the end of a stogie to hold in
his cheek, picked up his book in a hurry, and eyed the invalid over it.Have you any idea what I'm
reading?"For ten minutes I've been reading across both pages!"Max laughed, and suddenly put out his hand.Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with him that for a moment Dr.Then, rather
sheepishly, he took it."When I get out," Max said, "we'll have to go out to the White Springs
again and have supper."Morning and evening, Sidney went to Max's room.In the morning she only
smiled at him from the doorway.In the evening she went to him after
prayers.The shooting had been a closed book between them.At first, when he
began to recover, he tried to talk to her about it.She was very gentle with him, but very firm."I know how it happened, Max," she said--"about Joe's mistake and all
that.The rest can wait until you are much better."If there had been any change in her manner to him, he would not
have submitted so easily, probably.But she was as tender as ever,
unfailingly patient, prompt to come to him and slow to leave.After a
time he began to dread reopening the subject.She seemed so effectually
to have closed it.And, after all, what good could he
do his cause by pleading it?The fact was there, and Sidney knew it.On the day when K. had told Max his reason for giving up his work, Max
was allowed out of bed for the first time.A box of
red roses came that day from the girl who had refused him a year or more
ago.He viewed them with a carelessness that was half assumed.The news had traveled to the Street that he was to get up that day.Early that morning the doorkeeper had opened the door to a gentleman
who did not speak, but who handed in a bunch of early chrysanthemums and
proceeded to write, on a pad he drew from his pocket:--

"From Mrs.McKee's family and guests, with their congratulations on your
recovery, and their hope that they will see you again soon.If their
ends are clipped every day and they are placed in ammonia water, they
will last indefinitely."Sidney spent her hour with Max that evening as
usual.His big chair had been drawn close to a window, and she found him
there, looking out.But this time, instead of letting
her draw away, he put out his arms and caught her to him."Very glad, indeed," she said soberly.You ought to smile; your
mouth--"

"I am almost always tired; that's all, Max.""Aren't you going to let me make love to you at all?"I was looking for the paper to read to you.""You don't like me to touch you any more.The fear of agitating him brought her quickly.For a moment he was
appeased.He lifted first one
hand and then the other to his lips."If you mean about Carlotta, I forgave that long ago."Many a woman would have held that over him for years--not that
he had done anything really wrong on that nightmare excursion.But so
many women are exigent about promises."We needn't discuss that to-night, Max."Let me tell Ed
that you will marry me soon.Then, when I go away, I'll take you with
me.""Can't we talk things over when you are stronger?"Her tone caught his attention, and turned him a little white.He faced
her to the window, so that the light fell full on her.She had meant to wait; but, with his keen eyes
on her, she could not dissemble."I am going to make you very unhappy for a little while.""I've had a lot of time to think.If you had really wanted me, Max--"

"My God, of course I want you!"I think you care for me--"

"I love you!I swear I never loved any other woman as I love you."Suddenly he remembered that he had also sworn to put Carlotta out of his
life.He knew that Sidney remembered, too; but she gave no sign.But there would always be other women, Max."If you loved me you could do anything with me."By the way her color leaped, he knew he had struck fire.All
his conjectures as to how Sidney would take the knowledge of his
entanglement with Carlotta had been founded on one major premise--that
she loved him."But, good Heavens, Sidney, you do care for me, don't you?""I'm afraid I don't, Max; not enough."After one look at his face, she
spoke to the window.To me you were the best
and greatest man that ever lived.I--when I said my prayers, I--But that
doesn't matter.When the Lamb--that's one
of the internes, you know--nicknamed you the 'Little Tin God,' I was
angry.You could never be anything little to me, or do anything that
wasn't big."No man could live up to that, Sidney."Now I know that I
didn't care for you, really, at all.I built up an idol and worshiped
it.I always saw you through a sort of haze.You were operating, with
everybody standing by, saying how wonderful it was.Or you were coming
to the wards, and everything was excitement, getting ready for you.It isn't that I think you
are wicked.It's just that I never loved the real you, because I never
knew you."When he remained silent, she made an attempt to justify herself."I'd known very few men," she said."I came into the hospital, and for
a time life seemed very terrible.There were wickednesses I had never
heard of, and somebody always paying for them.Then you would come in, and a lot of them you cured and sent out.You gave them their chance, don't you see?Until I knew about Carlotta,
you always meant that to me.In the nurses' parlor, a few feet down the
corridor, the nurses were at prayers."The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want," read the Head, her voice
calm with the quiet of twilight and the end of the day."He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters."The nurses read the response a little slowly, as if they, too, were
weary."Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--"

The man in the chair stirred.He had come through the valley of the
shadow, and for what?He said to himself savagely
that they would better have let him die."You say you never loved me
because you never knew me.Isn't it possible
that the man you, cared about, who--who did his best by people and all
that--is the real me?"He missed something out of her eyes, the
sort of luminous, wistful look with which she had been wont to survey
his greatness.Measured by this new glance, so clear, so appraising, he
sank back into his chair."The man who did his best is quite real.You have always done the best
in your work; you always will.But the other is a part of you too, Max.Even if I cared, I would not dare to run the risk."Under the window rang the sharp gong of a city patrol-wagon.It rumbled
through the gates back to the courtyard, where its continued clamor
summoned white-coated orderlies.Sidney, chin lifted, listened
carefully.If it was a case for her, the elevator would go up to the
operating-room.With a renewed sense of loss, Max saw that already she
had put him out of her mind.The call to service was to her a call to
battle.Her sensitive nostrils quivered; her young figure stood erect,
alert.She took a step toward the door, hesitated, came back, and put a light
hand on his shoulder.She had kissed him lightly on the cheek before he knew what she intended
to do.So passionless was the little caress that, perhaps more than
anything else, it typified the change in their relation.When the door closed behind her, he saw that she had left her ring
on the arm of his chair.He held it to his lips with a quick gesture.In all his
successful young life he had never before felt the bitterness of
failure.He didn't want to live--he wouldn't live.He would--

His eyes, lifted from the ring, fell on the red glow of the roses that
had come that morning.Even in the half light, they glowed with fiery
color.With the left he settled his collar and
soft silk tie.K. saw Carlotta that evening for the last time.Katie brought word to
him, where he was helping Harriet close her trunk,--she was on her way
to Europe for the fall styles,--that he was wanted in the lower hall.she said, closing the door behind her by way of caution."And
a good thing for her she's not from the alley.The way those people beg
off you is a sin and a shame, and it's not at home you're going to be to
them from now on."So K. had put on his coat and, without so much as a glance in Harriet's
mirror, had gone down the stairs.She
stood under the chandelier, and he saw at once the ravages that trouble
had made in her.She was a dead white, and she looked ten years older
than her age.Now and then, when some one came to him for help, which was generally
money, he used Christine's parlor, if she happened to be out.So now,
finding the door ajar, and the room dark, he went in and turned on the
light."Come in here; we can talk better."She did not sit down at first; but, observing that her standing kept him
on his feet, she sat finally."You were to come," K. encouraged her, "to see if we couldn't plan
something for you."If it's another hospital--and I don't want to stay here, in the city.""You like surgical work, don't you?""Before we settle this, I'd better tell you what I'm thinking of.You know, of course, that I closed my hospital.I--a series of things
happened, and I decided I was in the wrong business.That wouldn't be
important, except for what it leads to.They are trying to persuade me
to go back, and--I'm trying to persuade myself that I'm fit to go back.You see,"--his tone was determinedly cheerful, "my faith in myself has
been pretty nearly gone.When one loses that, there isn't much left.""Well, I had and I hadn't.I'm not going to worry you about that.My
offer is this: We'll just try to forget about--about Schwitter's and all
the rest, and if I go back I'll take you on in the operating-room.""Well, I can ask you to come back, can't I?"He smiled at her
encouragingly."Are you sure you understand about Max Wilson and myself?""Don't you think you are taking a risk?""Every one makes mistakes now and then, and loving women have made
mistakes since the world began.Most people live in glass houses, Miss
Harrison.And don't make any mistake about this: people can always come
back.But the offer
he made was too alluring.It meant reinstatement, another chance, when
she had thought everything was over.After all, why should she damn
herself?She would work her finger-ends off for him.She would make it up to him in other ways.But she could not tell him
and lose everything."Shall we go back and start over again?"CHAPTER XXIX


Late September had come, with the Street, after its summer indolence
taking up the burden of the year.At eight-thirty and at one the school
bell called the children.Little girls in pig-tails, carrying freshly
sharpened pencils, went primly toward the school, gathering, comet
fashion, a tail of unwilling brothers as they went.Le Moyne had promised
the baseball club a football outfit, rumor said, but would not coach
them himself this year.Le Moyne
intended to go away.The Street had been furiously busy for a month.The cobblestones had
gone, and from curb to curb stretched smooth asphalt.The fascination
of writing on it with chalk still obsessed the children.Every few yards
was a hop-scotch diagram.Generally speaking, too, the Street had put up
new curtains, and even, here and there, had added a coat of paint.To this general excitement the strange case of Mr.One day he was in the gas office, making out statements that
were absolutely ridiculous.(What with no baking all last month, and
every Sunday spent in the country, nobody could have used that amount of
gas.They could come and take their old meter out!)And the next there
was the news that Mr.Le Moyne had been only taking a holiday in the
gas office,--paying off old scores, the barytone at Mrs.McKee's
hazarded!--and that he was really a very great surgeon and had saved Dr.The Street, which was busy at the time deciding whether to leave the old
sidewalks or to put down cement ones, had one evening of mad excitement
over the matter,--of K., not the sidewalks,--and then had accepted the
new situation.What was
the matter with things, anyhow?Here was Christine's marriage, which had
promised so well,--awnings and palms and everything,--turning out badly.True, Palmer Howe was doing better, but he would break out again.And
Johnny Rosenfeld was dead, so that his mother came on washing-days,
and brought no cheery gossip; but bent over her tubs dry-eyed and
silent--even the approaching move to a larger house failed to thrill
her.She was
married now, of course; but the Street did not tolerate such a reversal
of the usual processes as Tillie had indulged in.McKee
severely for having been, so to speak, and accessory after the fact.The Street made a resolve to keep K., if possible.If he had shown
any "high and mightiness," as they called it, since the change in his
estate, it would have let him go without protest.But when a man is the
real thing,--so that the newspapers give a column to his having been
in the city almost two years,--and still goes about in the same shabby
clothes, with the same friendly greeting for every one, it demonstrates
clearly, as the barytone put it, that "he's got no swelled head on him;
that's sure.""Anybody can see by the way he drives that machine of Wilson's that he's
been used to a car--likely a foreign one.Still the barytone, who was almost as fond of conversation as
of what he termed "vocal."Do you notice the way
he takes Dr.The old boy's
tickled to death."A little later, K., coming up the Street as he had that first day, heard
the barytone singing:--

      "Home is the hunter, home from the hill,
       And the sailor, home from sea."The Street seemed to stretch out its arms to
him.The ailanthus tree waved in the sunlight before the little house.Tree and house were old; September had touched them.Christine sat
sewing on the balcony.A boy with a piece of chalk was writing something
on the new cement under the tree.He stood back, head on one side, when
he had finished, and inspected his work.K. caught him up from behind,
and, swinging him around--

"Hey!""Don't you know better than to write all over
the street?"Aw, lemme down, Mr."You tell the boys that if I find this street scrawled over any more,
the picnic's off."Go and spend some of that chalk energy of yours in school."There was a certain tenderness in his hands, as in
his voice, when he dealt with children.'s eye fell on what he had written on the cement.At a certain part of his career, the child of such a neighborhood as the
Street "cancels" names.He does it as he
whittles his school desk or tries to smoke the long dried fruit of the
Indian cigar tree.So K. read in chalk an the smooth street:--

     Max Wilson Marriage.[Note: the a, l, s, and n of "Max Wilson" are crossed through, as are
the S, d, n, and a of "Sidney Page"]

The childish scrawl stared up at him impudently, a sacred thing profaned
by the day.The barytone was still singing;
but now it was "I'm twenty-one, and she's eighteen."It was a cheerful
air, as should be the air that had accompanied Johnny Rosenfeld to his
long sleep.After all, the
Street meant for him not so much home as it meant Sidney.And now,
before very long, that book of his life, like others, would have to be
closed.He turned and went heavily into the little house.Christine called to him from her little balcony:--

"I thought I heard your step outside.K. went through the parlor and stood in the long window.His steady eyes
looked down at her."I see very little of you now," she complained.And, when he did not
reply immediately: "Have you made any definite plans, K.?""I shall do Max's work until he is able to take hold again.After
that--"

"You will go away?"I am getting a good many letters, one way and another.I
suppose, now I'm back in harness, I'll stay.I'd
go back there--they want me.But it seems so futile, Christine, to leave
as I did, because I felt that I had no right to go on as things were;
and now to crawl back on the strength of having had my hand forced, and
to take up things again, not knowing that I've a bit more right to do it
than when I left!"He took an uneasy turn up and down the balcony.I tell you,
Christine, it isn't possible."Her thoughts had flown ahead to the
little house without K., to days without his steps on the stairs or the
heavy creak of his big chair overhead as he dropped into it.But perhaps it would be better if he went.She had no expectation of happiness, but, somehow or other, she must
build on the shaky foundation of her marriage a house of life, with
resignation serving for content, perhaps with fear lurking always.Misery implied affection, and her
love for Palmer was quite dead."Sidney will be here this afternoon.""Has it occurred to you, K., that Sidney is not very happy?""I'm not quite sure, but I think I know.She's lost faith in Max, and
she's not like me.I--I knew about Palmer before I married him.It's all rather hideous--I needn't go into it.I was afraid to
back out; it was just before my wedding.But Sidney has more character
than I have.Max isn't what she thought he was, and I doubt whether
she'll marry him."K. glanced toward the street where Sidney's name and Max's lay open to
the sun and to the smiles of the Street.Christine might be right, but
that did not alter things for him.Christine's thoughts went back inevitably to herself; to Palmer, who was
doing better just now; to K., who was going away--went back with an ache
to the night K. had taken her in his arms and then put her away."When you go away," she said at last, "I want you to remember this.I'm
going to do my best, K. You have taught me all I know.All my life I'll
have to overlook things; I know that.But, in his way, Palmer cares for
me.He will always come back, and perhaps sometime--"

Her voice trailed off.Far ahead of her she saw the years stretching
out, marked, not by days and months, but by Palmer's wanderings away,
his remorseful returns."Do a little more than forgetting," K. said."Try to care for him,
Christine.It's always a
woman's strongest weapon."I shall try, K.," she answered obediently.But he turned away from the look in her eyes.She had sent cards from Paris to her "trade."The two or three people on the Street who received her
engraved announcement that she was there, "buying new chic models
for the autumn and winter--afternoon frocks, evening gowns, reception
dresses, and wraps, from Poiret, Martial et Armand, and others," left
the envelopes casually on the parlor table, as if communications from
Paris were quite to be expected.So K. lunched alone, and ate little.After luncheon he fixed a broken
ironing-stand for Katie, and in return she pressed a pair of trousers
for him.He had it in mind to ask Sidney to go out with him in Max's
car, and his most presentable suit was very shabby."I'm thinking," said Katie, when she brought the pressed garments up
over her arm and passed them in through a discreet crack in the door,
"that these pants will stand more walking than sitting, Mr."I'll take a duster along in case of accident," he promised her; "and
to-morrow I'll order a suit, Katie.""I'll believe it when I see it," said Katie from the stairs."Some fool
of a woman from the alley will come in to-night and tell you she can't
pay her rent, and she'll take your suit away in her pocket-book--as like
as not to pay an installment on a piano.There's two new pianos in the
alley since you came here.""Show it to me," said Katie laconically."And don't go to picking up
anything you drop!"Sidney came home at half-past two--came delicately flushed, as if she
had hurried, and with a tremulous smile that caught Katie's eye at once."There's no need to ask how he is to-day."Katie, some one has written my name out on the street, in chalk."I'm about crazy with their old chalk.But when she learned that K. was upstairs, oddly enough, she did not go
up at once.Her lips parted slightly as she
listened.Christine, looking in from her balcony, saw her there, and, seeing
something in her face that she had never suspected, put her hand to her
throat."Won't you come and sit with me?""I haven't much time--that is, I want to speak to K.""You can see him when he comes down."Sidney came slowly through the parlor.It occurred to her, all at once,
that Christine must see a lot of K., especially now.No doubt he was
in and out of the house often.All that seemed to be necessary to win K.Well, surely, in that case--

"How is Max?"Sidney sat down on the edge of the railing; but she was careful,
Christine saw, to face the staircase.Christine sewed; Sidney sat and swung her feet idly.Ed says Max wants you to give up your training and marry him now.""I'm not going to marry him at all, Chris."It was one of his failings that he always
slammed doors.Harriet used to be quite disagreeable about it.Perhaps, in all her frivolous, selfish life, Christine had never had a
bigger moment than the one that followed.She could have said nothing,
and, in the queer way that life goes, K. might have gone away from the
Street as empty of heart as he had come to it."Be very good to him, Sidney," she said unsteadily.CHAPTER XXX


K. was being very dense.For so long had he considered Sidney as
unattainable that now his masculine mind, a little weary with much
wretchedness, refused to move from its old attitude."It was glamour, that was all, K.," said Sidney bravely."But, perhaps," said K., "it's just because of that miserable incident
with Carlotta.That wasn't the right thing, of course, but Max has told
me the story.She fainted in the yard,
and--"

Sidney was exasperated."Do you want me to marry him, K.?""I want you to be happy, dear."They were on the terrace of the White Springs Hotel again.K. had
ordered dinner, making a great to-do about getting the dishes they both
liked.But now that it was there, they were not eating.K. had placed
his chair so that his profile was turned toward her.He had worn the
duster religiously until nightfall, and then had discarded it.It hung
limp and dejected on the back of his chair.'s profile Sidney
could see the magnolia tree shaped like a heart."It seems to me," said Sidney suddenly, "that you are kind to every one
but me, K."He fairly stammered his astonishment:--

"Why, what on earth have I done?""You are trying to make me marry Max, aren't you?"She was very properly ashamed of that, and, when he failed of reply out
of sheer inability to think of one that would not say too much, she went
hastily to something else:

"It is hard for me to realize that you--that you lived a life of your
own, a busy life, doing useful things, before you came to us.I wish you
would tell me something about yourself.If we're to be friends when you
go away,"--she had to stop there, for the lump in her throat--"I'll want
to know how to think of you,--who your friends are,--all that."He was thinking, of course, that he would be
visualizing her, in the hospital, in the little house on its side
street, as she looked just then, her eyes like stars, her lips just
parted, her hands folded before her on the table."I shall be working," he said at last."Does that mean you won't have time to think of me?""I'm afraid I'm stupider than usual to-night.You can think of me as
never forgetting you or the Street, working or playing."Of course he would not work all the time.And he was going back
to his old friends, to people who had always known him, to girls--

He did his best then.He told her of the old family house, built by one
of his forebears who had been a king's man until Washington had put the
case for the colonies, and who had given himself and his oldest son then
to the cause that he made his own.He told of old servants who had wept
when he decided to close the house and go away.When she fell silent, he
thought he was interesting her.He told her the family traditions that
had been the fairy tales of his childhood.He described the library, the
choice room of the house, full of family paintings in old gilt frames,
and of his father's collection of books.Because it was home, he waxed
warm over it at last, although it had rather hurt him at first to
remember.It brought back the other things that he wanted to forget.Side by side with the
wonders he described so casually, she was placing the little house.What
an exile it must have been for him!How hopelessly middle-class they
must have seemed!How idiotic of her to think, for one moment, that she
could ever belong in this new-old life of his!None, of course, save to be honest and good
and to do her best for the people around her.Her mother's people, the
Kennedys went back a long way, but they had always been poor.She remembered the lamp with the blue-silk
shade, the figure of Eve that used to stand behind the minister's
portrait, and the cherry bookcase with the Encyclopaedia in it and
"Beacon Lights of History."When K., trying his best to interest her and
to conceal his own heaviness of spirit, told her of his grandfather's
old carriage, she sat back in the shadow."Fearful old thing," said K.,--"regular cabriolet.I can remember yet
the family rows over it.But the old gentleman liked it--used to have
it repainted every year.Strangers in the city used to turn around and
stare at it--thought it was advertising something!""When I was a child," said Sidney quietly, "and a carriage drove up and
stopped on the Street, I always knew some one had died!"K., whose ear was attuned to
every note in her voice, looked at her quickly."My great-grandfather,"
said Sidney in the same tone, "sold chickens at market.He didn't do it
himself; but the fact's there, isn't it?"But Sidney's agile mind had already traveled on.This K. she had never
known, who had lived in a wonderful house, and all the rest of it--he
must have known numbers of lovely women, his own sort of women, who had
traveled and knew all kinds of things: girls like the daughters of the
Executive Committee who came in from their country places in summer
with great armfuls of flowers, and hurried off, after consulting their
jeweled watches, to luncheon or tea or tennis."Tell me about the women you have known,
your friends, the ones you liked and the ones who liked you.""I've always been so busy," he confessed."I know a lot, but I don't
think they would interest you.They don't do anything, you know--they
travel around and have a good time.They're rather nice to look at, some
of them.But when you've said that you've said it all."Of course they would be, with nothing else to think of
in all the world but of how they looked.She wanted to go back to the hospital,
and turn the key in the door of her little room, and lie with her face
down on the bed."Would you mind very much if I asked you to take me back?"He had a depressed feeling that the evening had failed.And his depression grew as he brought the car around.After all, a girl couldn't care as
she had for a year and a half, and then give a man up because of another
woman, without a wrench."Do you really want to go home, Sidney, or were you tired of sitting
there?In that case, we could drive around for an hour or two.I'll not
talk if you'd like to be quiet."Being with K. had become an agony, now
that she realized how wrong Christine had been, and that their worlds,
hers and K.Soon they would be separated
by as wide a gulf as that which lay between the cherry bookcase--for
instance,--and a book-lined library hung with family portraits.But she
was not disposed to skimp as to agony.She would go through with it,
every word a stab, if only she might sit beside K. a little longer,
might feel the touch of his old gray coat against her arm."I'd like to
ride, if you don't mind."K. turned the automobile toward the country roads.He was remembering
acutely that other ride after Joe in his small car, the trouble he
had had to get a machine, the fear of he knew not what ahead, and his
arrival at last at the road-house, to find Max lying at the head of the
stairs and Carlotta on her knees beside him."Was there anybody you cared about,--any girl,--when you left home?""I was not in love with anyone, if that's what you mean.""You knew Max before, didn't you?""If you knew things about him that I should have known, why didn't you
tell me?""I couldn't do that, could I?It seemed to me that the mere
fact of your caring for him--" That was shaky ground; he got off it
quickly.Schwitter's had closed up, indeed.The lanterns had been taken down,
and in the dusk they could see Tillie rocking her baby on the porch.As
if to cover the last traces of his late infamy, Schwitter himself was
watering the worn places on the lawn with the garden can.Above the low hum of the engine they could hear
Tillie's voice, flat and unmusical, but filled with the harmonies of
love as she sang to the child.When they had left the house far behind, K. was suddenly aware that
Sidney was crying.She sat with her head turned away, using her
handkerchief stealthily.He drew the car up beside the road, and in a
masterful fashion turned her shoulders about until she faced him."Now, tell me about it," he said.I'm--I'm a little bit lonely.""Aunt Harriet's in Paris, and with Joe gone and everybody--"

"Aunt Harriet!"If she had said she was lonely
because the cherry bookcase was in Paris, he could not have been more
bewildered."And with you going away and never coming back--"

"I'll come back, of course.I'll promise to come back when
you graduate, and send you flowers.""I think," said Sidney, "that I'll become an army nurse.""You won't know, K. You'll be back with your old friends.You'll have
forgotten the Street and all of us.""Girls who have been everywhere, and have lovely clothes, and who won't
know a T bandage from a figure eight!""There will never be anybody in the world like you to me, dear."I--who have wanted you so long that it hurts even to
think about it!Ever since the night I came up the Street, and you were
sitting there on the steps--oh, my dear, my dear, if you only cared a
little!"Because he was afraid that he would get out of hand and take her in his
arms,--which would be idiotic, since, of course, she did not care for
him that way,--he gripped the steering-wheel.It gave him a curious
appearance of making a pathetic appeal to the wind-shield."I have been trying to make you say that all evening!""I
love you so much that--K., won't you take me in your arms?"He held her to him and
muttered incoherencies until she gasped.It was as if he must make up
for long arrears of hopelessness.He held her off a bit to look at her,
as if to be sure it was she and no changeling, and as if he wanted her
eyes to corroborate her lips.There was no lack of confession in her
eyes; they showed him a new heaven and a new earth."It was you always, K.," she confessed.But
now, when you look back, don't you see it was?"He looked back over the months when she had seemed as unattainable as
the stars, and he did not see it."Not when I came to you with everything?I brought you all my troubles,
and you always helped."She bent down and kissed one of his hands.He was so
happy that the foolish little caress made his heart hammer in his ears."I think, K., that is how one can always tell when it is the right one,
and will be the right one forever and ever.It is the person--one goes
to in trouble."He had no words for that, only little caressing touches of her arm, her
hand.Perhaps, without knowing it, he was formulating a sort of prayer
that, since there must be troubles, she would, always come to him and he
would always be able to help her.She was recalling the day she became
engaged to Max, and the lost feeling she had had.She did not feel the
same at all now.She felt as if she had been wandering, and had come
home to the arms that were about her.She would be married, and take the
risk that all women took, with her eyes open.She would go through the
valley of the shadow, as other women did; but K. would be with her.Looking into his steady eyes, she knew that she
was safe.Where before she had felt the clutch of inexorable destiny, the woman's
fate, now she felt only his arms about her, her cheek on his shabby
coat."I shall love you all my life," she said shakily.The little house was dark when they got back to it.The Street, which
had heard that Mr.Le Moyne approved of night air, was raising its
windows for the night and pinning cheesecloth bags over its curtains to
keep them clean.In the second-story front room at Mrs.McKee's, the barytone slept
heavily, and made divers unvocal sounds.He was hardening his throat,
and so slept with a wet towel about it.Wagner sat and made love with
the aid of a lighted match and the pencil-pad.The car drew up at the little house, and Sidney got out.Then it drove
away, for K. must take it to the garage and walk back.Sidney sat on the doorstep and waited.If one did one's best by life, it did its best too.She saw the flicker of the match across the
street, and knew what it meant.Once she would have thought that that
was funny; now it seemed very touching to her.Katie had heard the car, and now she came heavily along the hall."If you think it's a begging
letter, you'd better keep it until he's bought his new suit to-morrow.Almost any moment he's likely to bust out."K. read it in the hall, with Sidney's
shining eyes on him.It began abruptly:--

"I'm going to Africa with one of my cousins.It is a bad station on
the West Coast.I am not going because I feel any call to the work, but
because I do not know what else to do."You were kind to me the other day.I believe, if I had told you then,
you would still have been kind.I tried to tell you, but I was so
terribly afraid."If I caused death, I did not mean to.You will think that no excuse,
but it is true.In the hospital, when I changed the bottles on Miss
Page's medicine-tray, I did not care much what happened.I had been careless about a sponge
count.I made up my mind to get back at you.It seemed hopeless--you
were so secure.For two or three days I tried to think of some way to
hurt you."You remember the packets of gauze sponges we made and used in the
operating-room?When we counted them
as we got them out, we counted by packages.On the night before I left,
I went to the operating-room and added one sponge every here and there.Out of every dozen packets, perhaps, I fixed one that had thirteen.I had meant to give you
trouble, so you would have to do certain cases a second time.I was so frightened that I went down sick over it.When
I got better, I heard you had lost a case and the cause was being
whispered about."I tried to get back into the hospital one night.I went up the
fire-escape, but the windows were locked."I am not going to sign this letter.And I am
not going to ask your forgiveness, or anything of that sort.But one thing hurt me more than anything else, the other
night.You said you'd lost your faith in yourself.This is to tell you
that you need not.And you said something else--that any one can 'come
back.'K. stood in the hall of the little house with the letter in his hand.Just beyond on the doorstep was Sidney, waiting for him.His arms were
still warm from the touch of her.Beyond lay the Street, and beyond that
lay the world and a man's work to do.Work, and faith to do it, a good
woman's hand in the dark, a Providence that made things right in the
end.And, when he was beside her, his long figure folded
to the short measure of the step, he stooped humbly and kissed the hem
of her soft white dress.Wagner wrote something in the dark and then
lighted a match."So K. is in love with Sidney Page, after all!""She
is a sweet girl, and he is every inch a man.But, to my mind, a certain
lady--"

Mrs.McKee flushed and blew out the match.Late September now on the Street, with Joe gone and his mother eyeing
the postman with pitiful eagerness; with Mrs.Rosenfeld moving heavily
about the setting-up of the new furniture; and with Johnny driving
heavenly cars, brake and clutch legs well and Strong.Late September,
with Max recovering and settling his tie for any pretty nurse who
happened along, but listening eagerly for Dr.Ed's square tread in the
hall; with Tillie rocking her baby on the porch at Schwitter's, and
Carlotta staring westward over rolling seas; with Christine taking up
her burden and Grace laying hers down; with Joe's tragic young eyes
growing quiet with the peace of the tropics."The Lord is my shepherd," she reads."Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil."Sidney, on her knees in the little parlor, repeats the words with the
others.K. has gone from the Street, and before long she will join him.With the vision of his steady eyes before her, she adds her own prayer
to the others--that the touch of his arms about her may not make her
forget the vow she has taken, of charity and its sister, service, of a
cup of water to the thirsty, of open arms to a tired child.He even declared that the room they
were to occupy was better than his late apartments in Green Street."Do you think I shall get along with my work, Edward?"asked Harry,
gloomily, after they had gone to bed."Everybody in the store has kicked and cuffed me, swore at and abused
me, till I feel like a jelly.""Oh, never mind that; they always do so with a green one.They served
me just so when I first went into business.""It seemed to me just as though I never could suit them.""I can't help it, I know I did not suit them.""What made them laugh at me and swear at me, then?""That is the fashion; you must talk right up to them.If they swear at
you, swear at them back again--that is, the clerks and salesmen.If
they give you any 'lip,' let 'em have as good as they send."When you go among
the Romans, do as the Romans do."Harry did not like this advice; for he who, among the Romans, would do
as the Romans do, among hogs would do as the hogs do."If I only suit them, I don't care.""You do; I heard Wake tell Wade that you were a first-rate boy."And Harry's heart swelled with joy to think that, in spite
of his trials, he had actually triumphed in the midst of them.So he dropped the subject, with the resolution to redouble his
exertions to please his employers the next day, and turned his
thoughts to Julia Bryant, to wonder if she were still living, or had
become an angel indeed.CHAPTER XVII

IN WHICH HARRY REVISITS ROCKVILLE, AND MEETS WITH A SERIOUS LOSS


The next evening Harry was conscious of having gained a little in the
ability to discharge his novel duties.Either the partners and the
clerks had become tired of swearing and laughing at him, or he had
made a decided improvement, for less fault was found with him, and
his position was much more satisfactory.With a light heart he put up
the shutters; for though he was very much fatigued, the prestige of
future success was so cheering that he scarcely heeded his weary,
aching limbs.Every day was an improvement on the preceding day, and before the week
was out Harry found himself quite at home in his new occupation.He
was never a moment behind the time at which he was required to be at
the store in the morning.This promptness was specially noted by the
partners; for when they came to their business in the morning they
found the store well warmed, the floor nicely swept, and everything
put in order.When he was sent out with bundles he did not stop to look at the
pictures in the shop windows, to play marbles or tell long stories to
other boys in the streets.If his employers had even been very
unreasonable, they could not have helped being pleased with the new
boy, and Wake confidentially assured Wade that they had got a
treasure.He intended to make a man
of himself, and he could only accomplish his purpose by constant
exertion, by constant study and constant "trying again."He was
obliged to keep a close watch over himself, for often he was tempted
to be idle and negligent, to be careless and indifferent.After supper, on Thursday evening of his second week at Wake & Wade's,
he hastened to Major Phillips' stable to see John Lane, and obtain the
news from Rockville.His heart beat violently when he saw John's great
wagon, for he dreaded some fearful announcement from his sick friend.He had not before been so deeply conscious of his indebtedness to the
little angel as now, when she lay upon the bed of pain, perhaps of
death.She had kindled in his soul a love for the good and the
beautiful.She had inspired him with a knowledge of the difference
between the right and the wrong.In a word, she was the guiding star
of his existence.Her approbation was the bright guerdon of fidelity
to truth and principle.asked Harry, without giving John time to inquire why
he had left the stable."They think she is a little grain better."continued Harry, a great load of anxiety
removed from his soul."She is; but it is very doubtful how it will turn.I went in to see
her yesterday, and she spoke of you.""She said she should like to see you.""I should like to see her very much.""Her father told me, if you was a mind to go up to Rockville, he would
pay your expenses."I will go, if I can get away."Julia is an only child, and he
would do anything in the world to please her.""I will go and see the gentlemen I work for, and if they will let me,
I will go with you to-morrow morning.""Better take the stage; you will get there so much quicker."Harry returned home to ascertain of Edward where Mr.Wake lived, and
hastened to see him.That gentleman, however, coldly assured him if he
went to Rockville he must lose his place--they could not get along
without a boy.In vain Harry urged that he should be gone but two
days; the senior was inflexible.said he to himself, when he got into the street
again.Wake says she is no relation of mine, and he don't see why
I should go.She may die, and I shall never see her again.It did not require a great deal of deliberation to convince himself
that it was his duty to visit the sick girl.She had been a true
friend to him, and he could afford to sacrifice his place to procure
her even a slight gratification.Affection and duty called him one
way, self-interest the other.If he did not go, he should regret it as
long as he lived.Wake would take him again on his
return; if not, he could at least go to work in the stable again."Edward, I am going to Rockville to-morrow," he remarked to his
"chum," on his return to Mrs."The old man agreed to it, then?He never will
let a fellow off even for a day.""He did not; but I must go."He will discharge you, for he is a hard nut.""I must go," repeated Harry, taking a candle, and going up to their
chamber."You have got more spunk than I gave you credit for; but you are sure
of losing your place," replied Edward, following him upstairs.Harry opened a drawer in the old broken bureau in the room, and from
beneath his clothes took out the great pill box which served him for a
savings bank."You have got lots of money," remarked Edward, as he glanced at the
contents of the box."Not much; only twelve dollars," replied Harry, taking out three of
them to pay his expenses to Rockville."You won't leave that box there, will you, while you are gone?"I can hide it, though, before I go."Harry took his money and went to a bookstore in Washington Street,
where he purchased an appropriate present for Julia, for which he gave
half a dollar.On his return, he wrote her name in it, with his own as
the giver.Then the safety of his money came up for consideration; and
this matter was settled by raising a loose board in the floor and
depositing the pill box in a secure place.He had scarcely done so
before Edward joined him.He was not altogether
satisfied with the step he was about to take.It was not doing right
by his employers; but he compromised the matter in part by engaging
Edward, "for a consideration," to make the fires and sweep out the
next morning.At noon, on the following day, he reached Rockville, and hastened to
the house of Mr.he asked, breathless with interest, of the girl who
answered his knock.Harry was conducted into the house, and Mr.Bryant was informed of his
presence."I am glad you have come, Harry.Julia is much better to-day," said
her father, taking him by the hand."She has frequently spoken of you
during her illness, and feels a very strong interest in your welfare."I don't know what would have become of me if
she had not been a friend to me.""That is the secret of her interest in you.We love those best whom we
serve most.She is asleep now; but you shall see her as soon as she
wakes.In the meantime you had better have your dinner."Bryant looked very pale, and his eyes were reddened with weeping.Harry saw how much he had suffered during the last fortnight; but it
seemed natural to him that he should suffer terribly at the thought of
losing one so beautiful and precious as the little angel.Bryant could not leave the
couch of the little sufferer.The fond father could speak of nothing
but Julia, and more than once the tears flooded his eyes, as he told
Harry how meek and patient she had been through the fever, how loving
she was, and how resigned even to leave her parents, and go to the
heavenly Parent, to dwell with Him forever.Harry wept, too; and after dinner he almost feared to enter the
chamber, and behold the wreck which disease had made of this bright
and beautiful form.Removing the wrapper from the book he had
brought--a volume of sweet poems, entitled "Angel Songs"--he followed
Mr.Bryant into the sick girl's chamber."Ah, Harry, I am delighted to see you!"exclaimed she, in a whisper,
for her diseased throat rendered articulation difficult and painful."I am sorry to see you so sick, Julia," replied Harry, taking the
wasted hand she extended to him.I feel as though I should get well now.""You don't know how much I have thought of you while I lay here; how I
wished you were my brother, and could come in every day and see me,"
she continued, with a faint smile."Now tell me how you get along in Boston.""Very well; but your father says I must not talk much with you now.I
have brought you a little book," and he placed it in her hand.Now, Harry, you
must read me one of the angel songs.""I will; but I can't read very well," said he, as he opened the
volume.The piece he selected was a very
pretty and a very touching little song; and Harry's feelings were so
deeply moved by the pathetic sentiments of the poem and their
adaptation to the circumstances of the case, that he was quite
eloquent.Bryant interfered to prevent further
conversation; and Julia, though she had a great deal to say to her
young friend, cheerfully yielded to her mother's wishes, and Harry
reluctantly left the room.Towards night he was permitted to see her again, when he read several
of the angel songs to her, and gave her a brief account of the events
of his residence in Boston.She was pleased with his earnestness, and
smiled approvingly upon him for the moral triumphs he had achieved.The reward of all his struggles with trial and temptation was lavishly
bestowed in her commendation, and if fidelity had not been its own
reward, he could have accepted her approval as abundant compensation
for all he had endured.There was no silly sentiment in Harry's
composition; he had read no novels, seen no plays, knew nothing of
romance even "in real life."The homage he yielded to the fair and
loving girl was an unaffected reverence for simple purity and
goodness; that which the True Heart and the True Life never fail to
call forth whenever they exert their power.On the following morning, Julia's condition was very much improved,
and the physician spoke confidently of a favorable issue.Harry was
permitted to spend an hour by her bedside, inhaling the pure spirit
that pervaded the soul of the sick one.She was so much better that
her father proposed to visit the city, to attend to some urgent
business, which had been long deferred by her illness; and an
opportunity was thus afforded for Harry to return.Bryant drove furiously in his haste, changing horses twice on the
journey, so that they reached the city at one o'clock.On their
arrival, Harry's attention naturally turned to the reception he
expected to receive from his employers.He had not spoken of his
relations with them at Rockville, preferring not to pain them, on the
one hand, and not to take too much credit to himself for his devotion
to Julia, on the other.After the horse was disposed of at Major
Phillips's stable, Mr.Bryant walked down town with Harry; and when
they reached the store of Wake & Wade, he entered with him.asked the senior partner, rather
coldly, when he saw the delinquent.Harry was confused at this reception, though it was not unexpected."I didn't know but that you might be willing to take me again."Did you say that you did not want my
young friend, here?"Bryant, taking the offered hand of
Mr."I did say so," said the senior."I was not aware that he was your
friend, though," and he proceeded to inform Mr.Bryant that Harry had
left them against their wish."A few words with you, if you please."Wake conducted him to the private office, where they remained for
half an hour."It is all right, Harry," continued Mr.ejaculated our hero, rejoiced to find his place was
still secure."I would not have gone if I could possibly have helped
it.""You did right, my boy, and I honor you for your courage and
constancy."Bryant bade him an affectionate adieu, promising to write to him
often until Julia recovered, and then departed.With a grateful heart Harry immediately resumed his duties, and the
partners were probably as glad to retain him as he was to remain.At night, when he went to his chamber, he raised the loose board to
get the pill box, containing his savings, in order to return the money
he had not expended.To his consternation, he discovered that it was
gone!CHAPTER XVIII

IN WHICH HARRY MEETS WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AND GETS A HARD KNOCK ON
THE HEAD


It was in vain that Harry searched beneath the broken floor for his
lost treasure; it could not be found.He raised the boards up, and
satisfied himself that it had not slipped away into any crevice, or
fallen through into the room below; and the conclusion was inevitable
that the box had been stolen.The mystery confused Harry, for he was certain
that no one had seen him deposit the box beneath the floor.No one
except Edward even knew that he had any money.Flint nor Katy would have stolen it; and he was not
willing to believe that his room-mate would be guilty of such a mean
and contemptible act.He tried to assure himself that it had not been stolen--that it was
still somewhere beneath the floor; and he pulled up another board, to
resume the search.He had scarcely done so before Edward joined him.he asked, apparently very much astonished
at his chum's occupation."Are you going to pull the house down?"replied Harry, suspending
operations to watch Edward's expression when he told him of his loss."Put it here, under this loose board."Edward manifested a great deal of enthusiasm in the search.He was
sure it must be where Harry had put it, or that it had rolled back out
of sight; and he began tearing up the floor with a zeal that
threatened the destruction of the building.But the box could not be
found, and they were obliged to abandon the search."That is a fact; I can't spare that money, anyhow.I have been a good
while earning it, and it is too thundering bad to lose it.""I don't understand it," continued Edward."Nor I either," replied Harry, looking his companion sharp in the eye."No one knew I had it but you.""Do you mean to say I stole it?"exclaimed Edward, doubling his fist,
while his cheek reddened with anger.I didn't mean to lay it to you."And Edward was very glad to have the matter compromised."I did not; perhaps I spoke hastily.You know how hard I worked for
this money; and it seems hard to lose it.But no matter; I will try
again."Flint and Katy were much grieved when Harry told of his loss.They looked as though they suspected Edward, but said nothing, for it
was very hard to accuse a son or a brother of such a crime.Flint advised Harry to put his money in the savings bank in
future, promising to take care of his spare funds till they amounted
to five dollars, which was then the smallest sum that would be
received.It was a long time before our hero became reconciled to his
loss.He had made up his mind to be a rich man; and he had carefully
hoarded every cent he could spare, thus closely imitating the man who
got rich by saving his fourpences.A few days after the loss he was reading in one of Katy's Sunday
school books about a miser.The wretch was held up as a warning to
young folks by showing them how he starved his body and soul for the
sake of gold.exclaimed Harry, as he laid the book
upon the window."I have been hoarding up my money just like this old man in the book."You couldn't be mean and stingy if you
tried.""A miser wouldn't do what you did for us, Harry," added Mrs."I have been thinking too much of money.After all, perhaps it was
just as well that I lost that money.""I am sorry you lost it; for I don't think there is any danger of your
becoming a miser," said Katy."Perhaps not; at any rate, it has set me to thinking."Harry finished the book; and it was, fortunately, just such a work as
he required to give him right and proper views in regard to the value
of wealth.His dream of being a rich man was essentially modified by
these views; and he renewedly resolved that it was better to be a good
man than a rich man, if he could not be both.It seemed to him a
little remarkable that the minister should preach upon this very topic
on the following Sunday, taking for his text the words, "Seek ye first
the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you."He was deeply impressed by the sermon, probably because it was on a
subject to which he had given some attention.A few days after his return from Rockville, Harry received a very
cheerful letter from Mr.Bryant, to which Julia had added a few lines
in a postscript.The little angel was rapidly recovering, and our hero
was rejoiced beyond expression.The favorable termination of her
illness was a joy which far outbalanced the loss of his money, and he
was as cheerful and contented as ever.As he expressed it, in rather
homely terms, he had got "the streak of fat and the streak of lean."Julia was alive; was to smile upon him again; was still to inspire him
with that love of goodness which had given her such an influence over
him.Week after week passed by, and Harry heard nothing of his lost
treasure; but Julia had fully recovered, and for the treasure lost an
incomparably greater treasure had been gained.Edward and himself
continued to occupy the same room, though ever since the loss of the
money box Harry's chum had treated him coldly.There had never been
much sympathy between them; for while Edward was at the theatre, or
perhaps at worse places, Harry was at home, reading some good book,
writing a letter to Rockville, or employed in some other worthy
occupation.While Harry was at church or at the Sunday school, Edward,
in company with some dissolute companion, was riding about the
adjacent country.Flint often remonstrated with her son upon the life he led, and
the dissipated habits he was contracting; and several times Harry
ventured to introduce the subject.Edward, however, would not hear a
word from either.It is true that we either grow better or worse, as
we advance in life; and Edward Flint's path was down a headlong steep.His mother wept and begged him to be a better boy.Harry often wondered how he could afford to ride out and visit the
theatre and other places of amusement so frequently.His salary was
only five dollars a week now; it was only four when he had said it was
five.He seemed to have money at all times, and to spend it very
freely.He could not help believing that the contents of his pill box
had paid for some of the "stews" and "Tom and Jerrys" which his
reckless chum consumed.But the nine dollars he had lost would have
been but a drop in the bucket compared with his extravagant outlays.One day, about six months after Harry's return from Rockville, as he
was engaged behind the counter, a young man entered the store and
accosted him.It was a familiar voice; and, to Harry's surprise, but not much to his
satisfaction, he recognized his old companion, Ben Smart, who, he had
learned from Mr.Bryant, had been sent to the house of correction for
burning Squire Walker's barn."Yes, I have been here six months.""You have got a sign out for a boy, I see."There were more errands to run than one boy
could attend to; besides, Harry had proved himself so faithful and so
intelligent, that Mr.Wake wished to retain him in the store, to fit
him for a salesman."You can speak a good word for me, Harry; for I should like to work
here," continued Ben."I thought you were in--in the--"

Harry did not like to use the offensive expression, and Ben's face
darkened when he discovered what the other was going to say."Not a word about that," said he."If you ever mention that little
matter, I'll take your life.""My father got me out, and then I ran away.Not a word more, for I had
as lief be hung for an old sheep as a lamb."Wake; you can apply to him," continued Harry.The senior
talked with him a few moments, and then retired to his private office,
calling Harry as he entered."If you say anything, I will be the death of you," whispered Ben, as
Harry passed him on his way to the office.Our hero was not particularly pleased with these threats; he certainly
was not frightened by them.Wake, as he presented himself
before the senior."Who is he, and what is he?"Bryant told you the story about my leaving Redfield,"
said Harry."That is the boy that run away with me.""And the one that set the barn afire?"And Harry returned to his work at the counter.Before Harry had time to make any reply, Mr."We don't want you, young man," said he.With a glance of hatred at Harry, the applicant left the store.Since
leaving Redfield, our hero's views of duty had undergone a change; and
he now realized that to screen a wicked person was to plot with him
against the good order of society.He knew Ben's character; he had no
reason, after their interview, to suppose it was changed; and he could
not wrong his employers by permitting them ignorantly to engage a bad
boy, especially when he had been questioned directly on the point.Towards evening Harry was sent with a bundle to a place in Boylston
Street, which required him to cross the Common.On his return, when he
reached the corner of the burying ground, Ben Smart, who had evidently
followed him, and lay in wait at this spot for him, sprang from his
covert upon him.The young villain struck him a heavy blow in the eye
before Harry realized his purpose.The blow, however, was vigorously
returned; but Ben, besides being larger and stronger than his victim,
had a large stone in his hand, with which he struck him a blow on the
side of his head, knocking him insensible to the ground.The wretch, seeing that he had done his work, fled along the side of
the walk of the burying ground, pursued by several persons who had
witnessed the assault.Ben was a fleet runner this time, and succeeded
in making his escape.CHAPTER XIX

IN WHICH HARRY FINDS THAT EVEN A BROKEN HEAD MAY BE OF SOME USE TO A
PERSON


When Harry recovered his consciousness, he found himself in an
elegantly furnished chamber, with several persons standing around the
bed upon which he had been laid.A physician was standing over him,
engaged in dressing the severe wound he had received in the side of
his head."There, young man, you have had a narrow escape," said the doctor, as
he saw his patient's eyes open.asked Harry, faintly, as he tried to concentrate his
wandering senses."You are in good hands, my boy.replied the sufferer, trying to
rise on the bed."Do you feel as though you could walk home?""I don't know; I feel kind of faint.""No, sir; it feels numb, and everything seems to be flying round."Harry expressed an earnest desire to go home, and the physician
consented to accompany him in a carriage to Mrs.He
had been conveyed in his insensible condition to a house in Boylston
Street, the people of which were very kind to him, and used every
effort to make him comfortable.A carriage was procured, and Harry was assisted to enter it; for he
was so weak and confused that he could not stand alone.Ben had struck
him a terrible blow; and, as the physician declared, it was almost a
miracle that he had not been killed.Flint and Katy were shocked and alarmed when they saw the
helpless boy borne into the house; but everything that the
circumstances required was done for him.he asked, when they had placed him on the bed."They will wonder what has become of me at the store," continued the
sufferer, whose thoughts reverted to his post of duty."I will go down to the store and tell them what has happened," said
Mr.Callender, the kind gentleman to whose house Harry had been
carried, and who had attended him to his home."Thank you, sir; you are very good.I don't want them to think that I
have run away, or anything of that sort.""They will not think so, I am sure," returned Mr.Callender, as he
departed upon his mission."Do you think I can go to the store to-morrow?"asked Harry, turning
to the physician."I am afraid not; you must keep very quiet for a time."He had never been sick a day in
his life; and it seemed to him just then as though the world could not
possibly move on without him to help the thing along.A great many
persons cherish similar notions, and cannot afford to be sick a single
day.I should like to tell my readers at some length what blessings come to
us while we are sick; what angels with healing ministrations for the
soul visit the couch of pain; what holy thoughts are sometimes kindled
in the darkened chamber; what noble resolutions have their birth in
the heart when the head is pillowed on the bed of sickness.But my
remaining space will not permit it; and I content myself with
remarking that sickness in its place is just as great a blessing as
health; that it is a part of our needed discipline.When any of my
young friends are sick, therefore, let them yield uncomplainingly to
their lot, assured that He who hath them in his keeping "doeth all
things well."Harry was obliged to learn this lesson; and when the pain in his head
began to be almost intolerable, he fretted and vexed himself about
things at the store.He was not half as patient as he might have been;
and, during the evening, he said a great many hard things about Ben
Smart, the author of his misfortune.I am sorry to say he cherished
some malignant, revengeful feelings towards him, and looked forward
with a great deal of satisfaction to the time when he should be
arrested and punished for his crime.Wade called upon him as soon as they heard of
his misfortune.They were very indignant when they learned that Harry
was suffering for telling the truth.They assured him that they should
miss him very much at the store, but they would do the best they
could--which, of course, was very pleasant to him.But they told him
they could get along without him, bade him not fret, and said his
salary should be paid just the same as though he did his work.Wade continued; "and, as it will cost you more to be sick,
we will raise your wages to four dollars a week."Certainly," replied the junior, warmly.There was no possible excuse for fretting now.With so many kind
friends around him, he had no excuse for fretting; but his human
nature rebelled at his lot, and he made himself more miserable than
the pain of his wound could possibly have made him.Flint, who
sat all night by his bedside, labored in vain to make him resigned to
his situation.It seemed as though the great trial of his lifetime had
come--that which he was least prepared to meet and conquer.His head ached, and the pain of his
wound was very severe.His moral condition was, if possible, worse
than on the preceding night.He was fretful, morose, and unreasonable
towards those kind friends who kept vigil around his bedside.Strange
as it may seem, and strange as it did seem to himself, his thoughts
seldom reverted to the little angel.Once, when he thought of her
extended on the bed of pain as he was then, her example seemed to
reproach him.She had been meek and patient through all her
sufferings--had been content to die, even, if it was the will of the
Father in heaven.With a peevish exclamation, he drove her--his
guardian angel, as she often seemed to him--from his mind, with the
reflection that she could not have been as sick as he was, that she
did not endure as much pain as he did.For several days he remained in
pretty much the same state.His head ached, and the fever burned in
his veins.His moral symptoms were not improved, and he continued to
snarl and growl at those who took care of him."Give me some cold water, marm; I don't want your slops," fretted he,
when Mrs."But the doctor says you mustn't have cold water."Give me a glass of cold water, and I will--"

The door opened then, causing him to suspend the petulant words; for
one stood there whose good opinion he valued more than that of any
other person.I am so sorry to see you so sick!"exclaimed Julia Bryant,
rushing to his bedside.She was followed by her father and mother; and Katy had admitted them
unannounced to the chamber.replied Harry, smiling for the first time since
the assault."Yes, Harry; I hope you are better.When I heard about it last night,
I would not give father any peace till he promised to bring me to
Boston.""Don't be so wild, Julia," interposed her mother."You forget that he
is very sick.""Forgive me, Harry; I was so glad and so sorry.I hope I didn't make
your head ache," she added, in a very gentle tone.It was very good of you to come and see me."Harry felt a change come over him the moment she entered the room.The
rebellious thoughts in his bosom seemed to be banished by her
presence; and though his head ached and his flesh burned as much as
ever, he somehow had more courage to endure them.Bryant had asked him a few questions, and expressed
their sympathy in proper terms, they departed, leaving Julia to remain
with the invalid for a couple of hours."I did not expect to see you, Julia," said Harry, when they had gone."Didn't you think I would do as much for you as you did for me?"I am only a poor boy, and you are a
rich man's child."You can't think how bad I
felt when father got Mr."It's a hard case to be knocked down in that way, and laid up in the
house for a week or two.""I know it; but we must be patient."I haven't any patience--not a bit.If I could get
hold of Ben Smart, I would choke him.I hope they will catch him and
send him to the state prison for life."These malignant words did not sound like those of
the Harry West she had known and loved.They were so bitter that they
curdled the warm blood in her veins, and the heart of Harry seemed
less tender than before."Harry," said she, in soft tones, and so sad that he could not but
observe the change which had come over her."No, I am sure you don't.asked he, deeply impressed by the sad and solemn
tones of the little angel."Forgive Ben Smart, after he has almost killed me?"Julia took up the
Bible, which lay on the table by the bedside--it was the one she had
given him--and read several passages upon the topic she had
introduced.The gentle rebuke she administered
touched his soul, and he thought how peevish and ill-natured he had
been."You have been badly hurt, Harry, and you are very sick.Now, let me
ask you one question: Which would you rather be, Harry West, sick as
you are, or Ben Smart, who struck the blow?""I had rather be myself," replied he, promptly."You ought to be glad that you are Harry West, instead of Ben Smart.Sick as you are, I am sure you are a great deal happier than he can
be, even if he is not punished for striking you."Here I have been
grumbling and growling all the time for four days.It is lucky for me that I am Harry, instead of Ben.""I am sure I have been a great deal better since I was sick than
before.When I lay on the bed, hardly able to move, I kept thinking
all the time; and my thoughts did me a great deal of good."Harry had learned his lesson, and Julia's presence was indeed an
angel's visit.For an hour longer she sat by his bed, and her words
were full of inspiration; and when her father called for her he could
hardly repress a tear as she bade him good night.Flint and Katy to forgive him for
being so cross, promising to be patient in the future.She read to him, conversed
with him about the scenes of the preceding autumn in the woods, and
told him again about her own illness.In the afternoon she bade him a
final adieu, as she was to return that day to her home.The patience and resignation which he had learned gave a favorable
turn to his sickness, and he began to improve.It was a month,
however, before he was able to take his place in the store again.Without the assistance of Julia, perhaps, he had not learned the moral
of sickness so well.As it was, he came forth from his chamber with
truer and loftier motives, and with a more earnest desire to lead the
true life.Ben Smart had been arrested; and, shortly after his recovery, Harry
was summoned as a witness at his trial.It was a plain case, and Ben
was sent to the house of correction for a long term.CHAPTER XX

IN WHICH HARRY PASSES THROUGH HIS SEVEREST TRIAL, AND ACHIEVES HIS
GREATEST TRIUMPH


Three years may appear to be a great while to the little pilgrim
through life's vicissitudes; but they soon pass away and are as "a
tale that is told."To note all the events of Harry's experience
through this period would require another volume; therefore I can only
tell the reader what he was, and what results he had achieved in that
time.It was filled with trials and temptations, not all of which were
overcome without care and privation.Often he failed, was often
disappointed, and often was pained to see how feebly the Spirit warred
against the Flesh.He loved money, and avarice frequently prompted him to do those things
which would have wrecked his bright hopes.That vision of the grandeur
and influence of the rich man's position sometimes deluded him,
causing him to forget at times that the soul would live forever, while
the body and its treasures would perish in the grave.As he grew
older, he reasoned more; his principles became more firmly fixed; and
the object of existence assumed a more definite character.He was an
attentive student, and every year not only made him wiser, but better.I do not mean to say that Harry was a remarkably good boy, that his
character was perfect, or anything of the kind.He meant well, and
tried to do well, and he did not struggle in vain against the trials
and temptations that beset him.I dare say those with whom he
associated did not consider him much better than themselves.It is
true, he did not swear, did not frequent the haunts of vice and
dissipation, did not spend his Sundays riding about the country; yet
he had his faults, and captious people did not fail to see them.He was still with Wake & Wade, though he was a salesman now, on a
salary of five dollars a week.Flint,
though Edward was no longer his room-mate.A year had been sufficient
to disgust his "fast" companion with the homely fare and homely
quarters of his father's house; and, as his salary was now eight
dollars a week, he occupied a room in the attic of a first-class
hotel.Harry was sixteen years old, and he had three hundred dollars in the
Savings Bank.He might have had more if he had not so carefully
watched and guarded against the sin of avarice.He gave some very
handsome sums to the various public charities, as well as expended
them in relieving distress wherever it presented itself.It is true,
it was sometimes very hard work to give of his earnings to relieve the
poor; and if he had acted in conformity with the nature he had
inherited, he might never have known that it was "more blessed to give
than to receive."As he grew older, and the worth of money was more
apparent, he was tempted to let the poor and the unfortunate take care
of themselves; but the struggle of duty with parsimony rendered his
gifts all the more worthy.Joe Flint had several times violated his solemn resolution to drink no
more ardent spirits; but Harry, who was his friend and confidant,
encouraged him, when he failed, to try again; and it was now nearly a
year since he had been on a "spree."Our hero occasionally heard from Rockville; and a few months before
the event we are about to narrate he had spent the pleasantest week of
his life with Julia Bryant, amid those scenes which were so full of
interest to both of them.As he walked through the woods where he had
first met the "little angel"--she had now grown to be a tall girl--he
could not but recall the events of that meeting.It was there that he
first began to live, in the true sense of the word.It was there that
he had been born into a new sphere of moral existence.Julia was still his friend, still his guiding star.Though the freedom
of childish intimacy had been diminished, the same heart resided in
each, and each felt the same interest in the other.The correspondence
between them had been almost wholly suspended, perhaps by the
interference of the "powers" at Rockville, and perhaps by the growing
sense of the "fitness of things" in the parties.But they occasionally
met, which amply compensated for the deprivations which propriety
demanded.But I must pass on to the closing event of my story--it was Harry's
severest trial, yet it resulted in his most signal triumph.He lived extravagantly, and
his increased salary was insufficient to meet his wants.When Harry
saw him drive a fast horse through the streets on Sundays, and heard
him say how often he went to the theatre, what balls and parties he
attended--when he observed how elegantly he dressed, and that he wore
a gold chain, a costly breastpin and several rings--he did not wonder
that he was "short."He lived like a prince, and it seemed as though
eight dollars a week would be but a drop in the bucket in meeting his
expenses.One day, in his extremity, he applied to Harry for the loan of five
dollars.Our hero did not like to encourage his extravagance, but he
was good-natured, and could not well avoid doing the favor, especially
as Edward wanted the money to pay his board.However, he made it the
occasion for a friendly remonstrance, and gave the spendthrift youth
some excellent advice.Edward was vexed at the lecture; but, as he
obtained the loan, he did not resent the kindly act.About a fortnight after, Edward paid him the money.It consisted of a
two-dollar bill and six half dollars.Harry was about to make a
further application of his views of duty to his friend's case, when
Edward impatiently interrupted him, telling him that, as he had got
his money, he need not preach.This was just before Harry went home to
dinner.Wake called him into the private office, and when
they had entered he closed and locked the door.Harry regarded this as
rather a singular proceeding; but, possessing the entire confidence of
his employers, it gave him no uneasiness.Wake began, "we have been losing money from the store for
the last year or more.I have missed small sums a great many times."exclaimed Harry, not knowing whether he was regarded as a
confidant or as the suspected person."To-day I gave a friend of mine several marked coins, with which he
purchased some goods."Now, we have four salesmen besides yourself."I can form no idea, sir," returned Harry."I can only speak for
myself.""Oh, well, I had no suspicion it was you," added Mr."I am going to try the same experiment again; and I want you to
keep your eyes on the money drawer all the rest of the afternoon."Wade took several silver coins from his pocket and scratched them
in such a way that they could be readily identified, and then
dismissed Harry, with the injunction to be very vigilant.When he came out of the office he perceived that Edward and Charles
Wallis were in close conversation."I say, Harry, what's in the wind?"asked the former, as our hero
returned to his position behind the counter.Harry evaded answering the question, and the other two salesmen, who
were very intimate and whose tastes and amusements were very much
alike, continued their conversation.They were evidently aware that
something unusual had occurred, or was about to occur.Soon after, a person appeared at the counter and purchased a dozen
spools of cotton, offering two half dollars in payment.Harry kept his
eye upon the money drawer, but nothing was discovered.From what he
knew of Edward's mode of life, he was prepared to believe that he was
the guilty person.The experiment was tried for three days in succession before any
result was obtained.The coins were always found in the drawer; but on
the fourth day, when they were very busy, and there was a great deal
of money in the drawer, Harry distinctly observed Edward, while making
change, take several coins from the till.The act appalled him; he
forgot the customer to whose wants he was attending, and hastened to
inform Mr."Only to the office," replied he; and his appearance and manner might
have attracted the attention of any skillful rogue."Come, Harry, don't leave your place," added Edward, playfully
grasping him by the collar, on his return."Don't stop to fool, Edward," answered Harry, as he shook him off and
took his place at the counter again.He was very absent-minded the rest of the forenoon, and his frame
shook with agitation as he heard Mr.But he trembled still more when he was summoned also, for it was very
unpleasant business."Of course, you will not object to letting me see the contents of
your pockets, Edward," said Mr."Certainly not, sir;" and he turned every one of his pockets inside
out.Not one of the decoy pieces was found upon him, or any other coins,
for that matter; he had no money.Wake was confused, for he fully
expected to convict the culprit on the spot."I suppose I am indebted to this young man for this," continued
Edward, with a sneer."I'll bet five dollars he stole the money
himself, if any has been stolen."Search me, sir, by all means," added Harry; and he began to turn his
pockets out.From his vest pocket he took out a little parcel wrapped in a shop
bill.I wasn't aware that there was any such thing in my
pocket.""But you seem to know more about it than Edward," remarked Mr.Wade,
as he took the parcel.The senior opened the wrapper, and to his surprise and sorrow found it
contained two of the marked coins.But he was not disposed hastily to
condemn Harry.He could not believe him capable of stealing; besides,
there was something in Edward's manner which seemed to indicate that
our hero was the victim of a conspiracy."As he has been so very generous towards me, Mr.Wake," interposed
Edward, "I will suggest a means by which you may satisfy yourself.My
mother keeps Harry's money for him, and perhaps, if you look it over,
you will find more marked pieces."Wake, I'm innocent," protested Harry, when he had in some measure
recovered from the first shock of the heavy blow."I never stole a
cent from anybody.""I don't believe you ever did, Harry.But can you explain how this
money happened to be in your pocket?"If you wish to look at my money, Mrs."Don't let him go with you, though," said Edward, maliciously.Flint, requesting her to exhibit the
money, and Harry signed it.sneered Edward, when he had gone."So you have been
watching me, I thought as much."Wade told me to do," replied Harry, exceedingly
mortified at the turn the investigation had taken.That is the way with you psalm-singers.Steal yourself, and
lay it to me!""I am sorry, Harry, to find that I have been mistaken in you.Is it
possible that one who is outwardly so correct in his habits should be
a thief?But your career is finished," said he, very sternly, as he
entered the office."Nothing strange to the rest of us," added Edward."I never knew one
yet who pretended to be so pious that did not turn out a rascal."Wake, I am neither a thief nor a hypocrite," replied Harry, with
spirit."I found four of the coins--four half dollars--which I marked first,
at Mrs.Flint's," said the senior, severely.Those half dollars were part of the money paid
him by Edward, and he so explained how they came in his possession.exclaimed Edward, with well-feigned surprise."I
never borrowed a cent of him in my life; and, of course, never paid
him a cent."Harry looked at Edward, amazed at the coolness with which he uttered
the monstrous lie.He questioned him in regard to the transaction, but
the young reprobate reiterated his declaration with so much force and
art that Mr.Our hero, conscious of his innocence, however strong appearances were
against him, behaved with considerable spirit, which so irritated Mr.Wake that he sent for a constable, and Harry soon found himself in
Leverett Street Jail.Strange as it may seem to my young friends, he
was not very miserable there.He was innocent, and he depended upon
that special Providence which had before befriended him to extricate
him from the difficulty.It is true, he wondered what Julia would say
when she heard of his misfortune.She would weep and grieve; and he
was sad when he thought of her.But she would be the more rejoiced
when she learned that he was innocent.The triumph would be in
proportion to the trial.On the following day he was brought up for examination.As his name
was called, the propriety of the court was suddenly disturbed by an
exclamation of surprise from an elderly man, with sun-browned face and
monstrous whiskers.almost shouted the elderly man, regardless of the dignity
of the court.An officer was on the point of turning him out; but his earnest manner
saved him.Wake, he questioned him in
regard to the youthful prisoner.muttered the elderly man, in the
most intense excitement.Harry had a friend who had not been idle,
as the sequel will show.Wake first testified to the facts we have already related, and the
lawyer, whom Harry's friends had provided, questioned him in regard to
the prisoner's character and antecedents.He was subjected to a severe cross-examination by Harry's
counsel, in which he repeatedly denied that he had ever borrowed or
paid any money to the accused.While the events preceding Harry's
arrest were transpiring, he had been absent from the city, but had
returned early in the afternoon.He disagreed with his partner in
relation to our hero's guilt, and immediately set himself to work to
unmask the conspiracy, for such he was persuaded it was.He testified that, a short time before, Edward had requested him to
pay him his salary two days before it was due, assigning as a reason
the fact that he owed Harry five dollars, which he wished to pay.He
produced two of the marked half dollars, which he had received from
Edward's landlady.Of course, Edward was utterly confounded; and, to add to his
confusion, he was immediately called to the stand again.This time his
coolness was gone; he crossed himself a dozen times, and finally
acknowledged, under the pressure of the skillful lawyer's close
questioning, that Harry was innocent.He had paid him the money found
in Mrs.Flint's possession, and had slipped the coins wrapped in the
shop bills into his pocket when he took him by the collar on his
return from the office.He had known for some time that the partners were on the watch for the
thief.He had heard them talking about the matter; but he supposed he
had managed the case so well as to exonerate himself and implicate
Harry, whom he hated for being a good boy.His heart swelled with gratitude for the kindly
interposition of Providence.The trial was past--the triumph had come.Wade, and other friends, congratulated him on the happy
termination of the affair; and while they were so engaged the elderly
man elbowed his way through the crowd to the place where Harry stood."Young man, what is your father's name?"he asked, in tones tremulous
with emotion."You had a father--what was his name?""Franklin West; a carpenter by trade.He went from Redfield to
Valparaiso when I was very young, and we never heard anything from
him."exclaimed the stranger, grasping our hero by the hand, while
the tears rolled down his brown visage.Harry did not know what to make of this announcement."Is it possible that you are my father?""I am, Harry; but I was sure you were dead.I got a letter, informing
me that your mother and the baby had gone; and about a year after I
met a man from Rockville who told me that you had died also."They continued the conversation as they walked from the court room to
the store.There was a long story for each to tell.West confessed
that, for two years after his arrival at Valparaiso, he had
accomplished very little.He drank hard, and brought on a fever, which
had nearly carried him off.But that fever was a blessing in disguise;
and since his recovery he had been entirely temperate.He had nothing
to send to his family, and shame prevented him from even writing to
his wife.He received the letter which conveyed the intelligence of
the death of his wife and child, and soon after learned that his
remaining little one was also gone.Carpenters were then in great demand in Valparaiso.He was soon in a
condition to take contracts, and fortune smiled upon him.He had
rendered himself independent, and had now returned to spend his
remaining days in his native land.He had been in Boston a week, and
happened to stray into the Police Court, where he had found the son
who, he supposed, had long ago been laid in the grave.Edward Flint finished his career of "fashionable dissipation" by being
sentenced to the house of correction.Just before he was sent over, he
confessed to Mr.Wade that it was he who had stolen Harry's money,
three years before.The next day Harry obtained leave of absence, for the purpose of
accompanying his father on a visit to Redfield.He was in exuberant
spirits.It seemed as though his cup of joy was full.He could hardly
realize that he had a father--a kind, affectionate father--who shared
the joy of his heart.They went to Redfield; but I cannot stop to tell my readers how
astonished Squire Walker, and Mr.Nason, and the paupers were, to see
the spruce young clerk come to his early home, attended by his
father--a rich father, too.We can follow our hero no farther through the highways and byways of
his life-pilgrimage.We have seen him struggle like a hero through
trial and temptation, and come off conqueror in the end.He has found
a rich father, who crowns his lot with plenty; but his true wealth is
in those good principles which the trials, no less than the triumphs,
of his career have planted in his soul.CHAPTER XXI

IN WHICH HARRY IS VERY PLEASANTLY SITUATED, AND THE STORY COMES TO AN
END


Perhaps my young readers will desire to know something of Harry's
subsequent life; and we will "drop in" upon him at his pleasant
residence in Rockville, without the formality of an introduction.The
years have elapsed since we parted with him, after his triumphant
discharge from arrest.His father did not live long after his return
to his native land, and when he was twenty-one, Harry came into
possession of a handsome fortune.But even wealth could not tempt him
to choose a life of idleness; and he went into partnership with Mr.Wade, the senior retiring at the same time.The firm of Wade and West
is quite as respectable as any in the city.Harry is not a slave to business; and he spends a portion of his time
at his beautiful place in Rockville; for the cars pass through the
village, which is only a ride of an hour and a half from the city.West's house is situated on a gentle eminence not far distant from
the turnpike road.It is built upon the very spot where the cabin of
the charcoal burners stood, in which Harry, the fugitive, passed two
nights.The aspect of the place is entirely changed, though the very
rock upon which our hero ate the sumptuous repast the little angel
brought him may be seen in the centre of the beautiful garden, by the
side of the house.West often seats himself there to think of the
events of the past, and to treasure up the pleasant memories connected
with the vicinity.The house is elegant and spacious, though there is nothing gaudy or
gay about it.It is plainly furnished, though the
articles are rich and tasteful.Who is that
beautiful lady sitting at the piano-forte?Do you not recognize her,
gentle reader?West, and an old
acquaintance.She is no longer the little angel, though I cannot tell
her height or her weight; but her husband thinks she is just as much
of an angel now as when she fed him on doughnuts upon the flat rock in
the garden.He is a fine-looking man, rather tall; and
though he does not wear a mustache, I have no doubt Mrs.West thinks
he is handsome--which is all very well, provided he does not think so
himself."This is a capital day, Julia; suppose we ride over to Redfield, and
see friend Nason," said Mr.The horse is ordered; and as they ride along, the gentleman amuses his
wife with the oft-repeated story of his flight from Jacob Wire's."Do you see that high rock, Julia?""That is the very one where I dodged Leman, and took the back track;
and there is where I knocked the bull-dog over."It is a pleasant little
cottage, for he is no longer in the service of the town.Connected with it is a fine farm of
twenty acres.Nason by his
protege, though no money was paid.Harry would have made it a free
gift, if the pride of his friend would have permitted; but it amounts
to the same thing.West and his lady are warmly welcomed by Mr.The ex-keeper is an old man now.He is a member of the church, and
considered an excellent and useful citizen.West
his "boy," and regards him with mingled pride and admiration.Our friends dine at the cottage; and, after dinner, Mr.West talk over old times, ride down to Pine Pleasant, and visit the
poorhouse.Squire Walker, Jacob
Wire, and most of the paupers who were the companions of our hero, are
dead and gone, and the living speak gently of the departed.At Pine Pleasant, they fasten the horse to a tree, and cross over to
the rock which was Harry's favorite resort in childhood."By the way, Harry, have you heard anything of Ben Smart lately?""After his discharge from the state prison, I heard that he went to
sea."They say she never smiled after she
gave him up as a hopeless case."I pity a mother whose son turns out badly.In their absence, a letter for Julia from Katy Flint
has arrived.Joe is a
steady man, and, with Harry's assistance, has purchased an interest in
the stable formerly kept by Major Phillips, who has retired on a
competency.asked Harry, as she broke the seal."Yes; he has just been sent to the Maryland penitentiary for
housebreaking.""Katy says her mother feels very badly about it."Flint is an excellent woman; she was a mother to
me.""She says they are coming up to Rockville next week.""Glad of that; they will always be welcome beneath my roof.I must
call upon them to-morrow when I go to the city.""Do; and give my love to them."And, here, reader, I must leave them--not without regret, I confess,
for it is always sad to part with warm and true-hearted friends; but
if one must leave them, it is pleasant to know that they are happy,
and are surrounded by all the blessings which make life desirable, and
filled with that bright hope which reaches beyond the perishable
things of this world.It is cheering to know that one's friends, after
they have fought a hard battle with foes without and foes within, have
won the victory, and are receiving their reward.If my young friends think well of Harry, let me admonish them to
imitate his virtues, especially his perseverance in trying to do well;
and when they fail to be as good and true as they wish to be, to TRY
AGAIN.THE END

NEW YORK, N. Y.she returned; and her lip took a tremulous curve, the lovely bosom
heaved, and she softly looked away.If Eleanore's beauty had made less of an impression on my fancy, or her
frightful situation awakened less anxiety in my breast, I should have
been a lost man from that moment."I did not mean to do anything very wrong," Miss Leavenworth continued."No, no," said I; and there is not a man living who would not have said
the same in my place.What more might have passed between us on this subject I cannot say, for
just then the door opened and a man entered whom I recognized as the one
who had followed Eleanore Leavenworth out, a short time before.Gryce," said he, pausing just inside the door; "a word if you
please."The detective nodded, but did not hasten towards him; instead of that,
he walked deliberately away to the other end of the room, where he
lifted the lid of an inkstand he saw there, muttered some unintelligible
words into it, and speedily shut it again.Immediately the uncanny fancy
seized me that if I should leap to that inkstand, open it and peer in,
I should surprise and capture the bit of confidence he had intrusted
to it.But I restrained my foolish impulse, and contented myself with
noting the subdued look of respect with which the gaunt subordinate
watched the approach of his superior.inquired the latter as he reached him: "what now?"The man shrugged his shoulders, and drew his principal through the open
door.Once in the hall their voices sank to a whisper, and as their
backs only were visible, I turned to look at my companion."I do not know; I fear so.Miss Leavenworth," I proceeded, "can it be
possible that your cousin has anything in her possession she desires to
conceal?""Then you think she is trying to conceal something?"But there was considerable talk about a paper----"

"They will never find any paper or anything else suspicious in
Eleanore's possession," Mary interrupted."In the first place, there
was no paper of importance enough"--I saw Mr.Gryce's form suddenly
stiffen--"for any one to attempt its abstraction and concealment."May not your cousin be acquainted with
something----"

"There was nothing to be acquainted with, Mr.We lived the most
methodical and domestic of lives.I cannot understand, for my part, why
so much should be made out of this.My uncle undoubtedly came to his
death by the hand of some intended burglar.That nothing was stolen from
the house is no proof that a burglar never entered it.As for the doors
and windows being locked, will you take the word of an Irish servant
as infallible upon such an important point?I believe the
assassin to be one of a gang who make their living by breaking into
houses, and if you cannot honestly agree with me, do try and consider
such an explanation as possible; if not for the sake of the family
credit, why then"--and she turned her face with all its fair beauty upon
mine, eyes, cheeks, mouth all so exquisite and winsome--"why then, for
mine."Raymond, will you be kind
enough to step this way?"Glad to escape from my present position, I hastily obeyed."We propose to take you into our confidence," was the easy response.I bowed to the man I saw before me, and stood uneasily waiting.Anxious
as I was to know what we really had to fear, I still intuitively shrank
from any communication with one whom I looked upon as a spy."A matter of some importance," resumed the detective."It is not
necessary for me to remind you that it is in confidence, is it?"Instantly the whole appearance of the man Fobbs changed.Assuming an
expression of lofty importance, he laid his large hand outspread upon
his heart and commenced.Gryce to watch the movements of Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, I left this room upon her departure from it, and followed
her and the two servants who conducted her up-stairs to her own
apartment.Then it _was_ the fire she was after!"he cried, clapping
himself on the knee."Excuse me; I am ahead of my story.She did not appear to notice me
much, though I was right behind her.It was not until she had reached
the door of this room--which was not her room!"he interpolated
dramatically, "and turned to dismiss her servants, that she seemed
conscious of having been followed.Eying me then with an air of
great dignity, quickly eclipsed, however, by an expression of patient
endurance, she walked in, leaving the door open behind her in a
courteous way I cannot sufficiently commend."Honest as the man appeared, this was
evidently anything but a sore subject with him.Observing me frown, he
softened his manner."Not seeing any other way of keeping her under my eye, except by
entering the room, I followed her in, and took a seat in a remote
corner.She flashed one look at me as I did so, and commenced pacing the
floor in a restless kind of way I'm not altogether unused to.At last
she stopped abruptly, right in the middle of the room.she gasped; 'I'm faint again--quick!Now in order to get that glass of water it was necessary for me
to pass behind a dressing mirror that reached almost to the ceiling;
and I naturally hesitated.But she turned and looked at me, and--Well,
gentlemen, I think either of you would have hastened to do what she
asked; or at least"--with a doubtful look at Mr.Gryce--"have given
your two ears for the privilege, even if you didn't succumb to the
temptation.""I stepped out of sight, then, for a moment;
but it seemed long enough for her purpose; for when I emerged, glass in
hand, she was kneeling at the grate full five feet from the spot where
she had been standing, and was fumbling with the waist of her dress in
a way to convince me she had something concealed there which she was
anxious to dispose of.I eyed her pretty closely as I handed her the
glass of water, but she was gazing into the grate, and didn't appear to
notice.Drinking barely a drop, she gave it back, and in another moment
was holding out her hands over the fire.At any rate, she shivered most
naturally.But there were a few dying embers in the grate, and when
I saw her thrust her hand again into the folds of her dress I became
distrustful of her intentions and, drawing a step nearer, looked over
her shoulder, when I distinctly saw her drop something into the
grate that clinked as it fell.Suspecting what it was, I was about to
interfere, when she sprang to her feet, seized the scuttle of coal that
was upon the hearth, and with one move emptied the whole upon the dying
embers.'I want a fire,' she cried, 'a fire!''That is hardly the way
to make one,' I returned, carefully taking the coal out with my hands,
piece by piece, and putting it back into the scuttle, till--"

"Till what?"opening his large hand, and showing me _a
broken-handled key._



X. MR.GRYCE RECEIVES NEW IMPETUS


    "There's nothing ill
     Can dwell in such a temple."THIS astounding discovery made a most unhappy impression upon me.Eleanore the beautiful, the lovesome, was--I did not, could
not finish the sentence, even in the silence of my own mind.Gryce, glancing curiously towards the
key.A woman does not thrill, blush, equivocate, and
faint for nothing; especially such a woman as Miss Leavenworth.""A woman who could do such a deed would be the last to thrill,
equivocate, and faint," I retorted."Give me the key; let me see it."He complacently put it in my hand."If she declares herself innocent, I will believe her.""You have strong faith in the women," he
laughed.I had no reply for this, and a short silence ensued, first broken by Mr."There is but one thing left to do," said he."Fobbs, you will
have to request Miss Leavenworth to come down.Do not alarm her; only
see that she comes.To the reception room," he added, as the man drew
off.No sooner were we left alone than I made a move to return to Mary, but
he stopped me."Come and see it out," he whispered."She will be down in a moment; see
it out; you had best."Glancing back, I hesitated; but the prospect of beholding Eleanore again
drew me, in spite of myself.Telling him to wait, I returned to Mary's
side to make my excuses."What is the matter--what has occurred?"It is all dreadful; and no one tells me anything.""I pray God there may be nothing to tell.Judging from your present
faith in your cousin, there will not be.Take comfort, then, and be
assured I will inform you if anything occurs which you ought to know."Giving her a look of encouragement, I left her crushed against the
crimson pillows of the sofa on which she sat, and rejoined Mr.We
had scarcely entered the reception room when Eleanore Leavenworth came
in.More languid than she was an hour before, but haughty still, she slowly
advanced, and, meeting my eye, gently bent her head."I have been summoned here," said she, directing herself exclusively to
Mr.Gryce, "by an individual whom I take to be in your employ.If so,
may I request you to make your wishes known at once, as I am quite
exhausted, and am in great need of rest."Gryce, rubbing his hands together and
staring in quite a fatherly manner at the door-knob, "I am very sorry to
trouble you, but the fact is I wish to ask you----"

But here she stopped him."Anything in regard to the key which that man
has doubtless told you he saw me drop into the ashes?""Then I must refuse to answer any questions concerning it.I have
nothing to say on the subject, unless it is this:"--giving him a look
full of suffering, but full of a certain sort of courage, too--"that he
was right if he told you I had the key in hiding about my person, and
that I attempted to conceal it in the ashes of the grate.""Still, Miss----"

But she had already withdrawn to the door."I pray you to excuse me,"
said she."No argument you could advance would make any difference in my
determination; therefore it would be but a waste of energy on your
part to attempt any."And, with a flitting glance in my direction, not
without its appeal, she quietly left the room.Gryce stood gazing after her with a look of great
interest, then, bowing with almost exaggerated homage, he hastily
followed her out.I had scarcely recovered from the surprise occasioned by this unexpected
movement when a quick step was heard in the hall, and Mary, flushed and
anxious, appeared at my side.I answered, "she has not said anything.That is the trouble,
Miss Leavenworth.Your cousin preserves a reticence upon certain points
very painful to witness.She ought to understand that if she persists in
doing this, that----"

"That what?"There was no mistaking the deep anxiety prompting this
question."That she cannot avoid the trouble that will ensue."For a moment she stood gazing at me, with great horror-stricken,
incredulous eyes; then sinking back into a chair, flung her hands over
her face with the cry:

"Oh, why were we ever born!Why did we not
perish with those who gave us birth!"In the face of anguish like this, I could not keep still."Dear Miss Leavenworth," I essayed, "there is no cause for such despair
as this.The future looks dark, but not impenetrable.Your cousin will
listen to reason, and in explaining----"

But she, deaf to my words, had again risen to her feet, and stood before
me in an attitude almost appalling."Some women in my position would go mad!She
was conscious of having given the cue which had led to this suspicion of
her cousin, and that in this way the trouble which hung over their heads
was of her own making.I endeavored to soothe her, but my efforts
were all unavailing.Absorbed in her own anguish, she paid but little
attention to me.Satisfied at last that I could do nothing more for her,
I turned to go."I am sorry to leave," said I, "without having afforded you any comfort.Believe me; I am very anxious to assist you.Is there no one I can send
to your side; no woman friend or relative?It is sad to leave you alone
in this house at such a time.""And do you expect me to remain here?and the long shudders shook her very frame."It is not at all necessary for you to do so, Miss Leavenworth," broke
in a bland voice over our shoulders.Gryce was not only at our back, but had
evidently been there for some moments.Seated near the door, one hand
in his pocket, the other caressing the arm of his chair, he met our
gaze with a sidelong smile that seemed at once to beg pardon for
the intrusion, and to assure us it was made with no unworthy motive."Everything will be properly looked after, Miss; you can leave with
perfect safety."I expected to see her resent this interference; but instead of that, she
manifested a certain satisfaction in beholding him there.Drawing me to one side, she whispered, "You think this Mr.Gryce very
clever, do you not?""Well," I cautiously replied, "he ought to be to hold the position he
does.The authorities evidently repose great confidence in him."Stepping from my side as suddenly as she had approached it, she crossed
the room and stood before Mr."Sir," said she, gazing at him with a glance of entreaty: "I hear you
have great talents; that you can ferret out the real criminal from
a score of doubtful characters, and that nothing can escape the
penetration of your eye.If this is so, have pity on two orphan
girls, suddenly bereft of their guardian and protector, and use your
acknowledged skill in finding out who has committed this crime.It
would be folly in me to endeavor to hide from you that my cousin in her
testimony has given cause for suspicion; but I here declare her to be as
innocent of wrong as I am; and I am only endeavoring to turn the eye
of justice from the guiltless to the guilty when I entreat you to look
elsewhere for the culprit who committed this deed."Pausing, she held
her two hands out before him."It must have been some common burglar or
desperado; can you not bring him, then, to justice?"Her attitude was so touching, her whole appearance so earnest and
appealing, that I saw Mr.Gryce's countenance brim with suppressed
emotion, though his eye never left the coffee-urn upon which it had
fixed itself at her first approach."Hannah--the girl who is
gone--must know all about it.Search for her, ransack the city, do
anything; my property is at your disposal.I will offer a large reward
for the detection of the burglar who did this deed!""Miss Leavenworth," he began, and stopped; the
man was actually agitated."Miss Leavenworth, I did not need your very
touching appeal to incite me to my utmost duty in this case.Personal
and professional pride were in themselves sufficient.But, since you
have honored me with this expression of your wishes, I will not conceal
from you that I shall feel a certain increased interest in the affair
from this hour.What mortal man can do, I will do, and if in one month
from this day I do not come to you for my reward, Ebenezer Gryce is not
the man I have always taken him to be.""We will mention no names," said he, gently waving his hand to and fro.A few minutes later, I left the house with Miss Leavenworth, she having
expressed a wish to have me accompany her to the home of her friend,
Mrs.Gilbert, with whom she had decided to take refuge.As we rolled
down the street in the carriage Mr.Gryce had been kind enough to
provide for us, I noticed my companion cast a look of regret behind her,
as if she could not help feeling some compunctions at this desertion of
her cousin.But this expression was soon changed for the alert look of one who
dreads to see a certain face start up from some unknown quarter.Glancing up and down the street, peering furtively into doorways as
we passed, starting and trembling if a sudden figure appeared on the
curbstone, she did not seem to breathe with perfect ease till we had
left the avenue behind us and entered upon Thirty-seventh Street.Then,
all at once her natural color returned and, leaning gently toward me,
she asked if I had a pencil and piece of paper I could give her.Handing them to her, I watched her with some
little curiosity while she wrote two or three lines, wondering she could
choose such a time and place for the purpose."A little note I wish to send," she explained, glancing at the almost
illegible scrawl with an expression of doubt."Couldn't you stop the
carriage a moment while I direct it?"I did so, and in another instant the leaf which I had torn from my
note-book was folded, directed, and sealed with a stamp which she had
taken from her own pocket-book."That is a crazy-looking epistle," she muttered, as she laid it,
direction downwards, in her lap."Why not wait, then, till you arrive at your destination, where you can
seal it properly, and direct it at your leisure?"Look, there is a box on
the corner; please ask the driver to stop once more.""Shall I not post it for you?"But she shook her head, and, without waiting for my assistance, opened
the door on her own side of the carriage and leaped to the ground.Even
then she paused to glance up and down the street, before venturing to
drop her hastily written letter into the box.But when it had left her
hand, she looked brighter and more hopeful than I had yet seen her.And
when, a few moments later, she turned to bid me good-by in front of her
friend's house, it was with almost a cheerful air she put out her hand
and entreated me to call on her the next day, and inform her how the
inquest progressed.I shall not attempt to disguise from you the fact that I spent all
that long evening in going over the testimony given at the inquest,
endeavoring to reconcile what I had heard with any other theory than
that of Eleanore's guilt.Taking a piece of paper, I jotted down the
leading causes of suspicion as follows:

1.Her late disagreement with her uncle, and evident estrangement from
him, as testified to by Mr.The mysterious disappearance of one of the servants of the house.The forcible accusation made by her cousin,--overheard, however, only
by Mr.Her equivocation in regard to the handkerchief found stained with
pistol smut on the scene of the tragedy.Her refusal to speak in regard to the paper which she was supposed to
have taken from Mr.Leavenworth's table immediately upon the removal of
the body.The finding of the library key in her possession."A dark record," I involuntarily decided, as I looked it over; but
even in doing so began jotting down on the other side of the sheet the
following explanatory notes:

1.Disagreements and even estrangements between relatives are common.Cases where such disagreements and estrangements have led to crime,
rare.The disappearance of Hannah points no more certainly in one direction
than another.If Mary's private accusation of her cousin was forcible and
convincing, her public declaration that she neither knew nor suspected
who might be the author of this crime, was equally so.To be sure, the
former possessed the advantage of being uttered spontaneously; but it
was likewise true that it was spoken under momentary excitement, without
foresight of the consequences, and possibly without due consideration of
the facts.An innocent man or woman, under the influence of terror, will
often equivocate in regard to matters that seem to criminate them.With that key in her
possession, and unexplained, Eleanore Leavenworth stood in an attitude
of suspicion which even I felt forced to recognize.Brought to this
point, I thrust the paper into my pocket, and took up the evening
_Express_.Instantly my eye fell upon these words:


    SHOCKING MURDER

    MR.LEAVENWORTH, THE WELL-KNOWN MILLIONAIRE, FOUND DEAD IN HIS ROOM

    NO CLUE TO THE PERPETRATOR OF THE DEED

    THE AWFUL CRIME COMMITTED WITH A PISTOL--EXTRAORDINARY FEATURES OF
    THE AFFAIR

Ah!here at least was one comfort; her name was not yet mentioned
as that of a suspected party.Gryce's expressive look as he handed me that key, and
shuddered."She must be innocent; she cannot be otherwise," I reiterated to myself,
and then pausing, asked what warranty I had of this?Only her beautiful
face; only, only her beautiful face.Abashed, I dropped the newspaper,
and went down-stairs just as a telegraph boy arrived with a message from
Mr.It was signed by the proprietor of the hotel at which Mr.Veeley was then stopping and ran thus:


    "WASHINGTON, D. C.Everett Raymond--

    "Mr.Veeley is lying at my house ill.Have not shown him telegram,
    fearing results.Why this sudden sensation of relief on my part?Could
it be that I had unconsciously been guilty of cherishing a latent dread
of my senior's return?Why, who else could know so well the secret
springs which governed this family?Who else could so effectually put me
upon the right track?Was it possible that I, Everett Raymond, hesitated
to know the truth in any case?No, that should never be said; and,
sitting down again, I drew out the memoranda I had made and, looking
them carefully over, wrote against No.6 the word suspicious in good
round characters.no one could say, after that, I had allowed
myself to be blinded by a bewitching face from seeing what, in a woman
with no claims to comeliness, would be considered at once an almost
indubitable evidence of guilt.And yet, after it was all done, I found myself repeating aloud as I
gazed at it: "If she declares herself innocent, I will believe her."So
completely are we the creatures of our own predilections.THE SUMMONS


    "The pink of courtesy."THE morning papers contained a more detailed account of the murder than
those of the evening before; but, to my great relief, in none of them
was Eleanore's name mentioned in the connection I most dreaded.The final paragraph in the _Times_ ran thus: "The detectives are upon
the track of the missing girl, Hannah."And in the _Herald_ I read the
following notice:

"_A Liberal Reward_ will be given by the relatives of Horatio
Leavenworth, Esq., deceased, for any news of the whereabouts of one
Hannah Chester, disappeared from the house -------- Fifth Avenue since
the evening of March 4.Said girl was of Irish extraction; in age about
twenty-five, and may be known by the following characteristics.Form
tall and slender; hair dark brown with a tinge of red; complexion fresh;
features delicate and well made; hands small, but with the fingers much
pricked by the use of the needle; feet large, and of a coarser type than
the hands.She had on when last seen a checked gingham dress, brown
and white, and was supposed to have wrapped herself in a red and green
blanket shawl, very old.Beside the above distinctive marks, she had
upon her right hand wrist the scar of a large burn; also a pit or two of
smallpox upon the left temple."This paragraph turned my thoughts in a new direction.Oddly enough, I
had expended very little thought upon this girl; and yet how apparent
it was that she was the one person upon whose testimony, if given,
the whole case in reality hinged, I could not agree with those who
considered her as personally implicated in the murder.An accomplice,
conscious of what was before her, would have hid in her pockets whatever
money she possessed.But the roll of bills found in Hannah's trunk
proved her _to_ have left too hurriedly for this precaution.On the
other hand, if this girl had come unexpectedly upon the assassin at his
work, how could she have been hustled from the house without creating
a disturbance loud enough to have been heard by the ladies, one of
whom had her door open?An innocent girl's first impulse upon such an
occasion would have been to scream; and yet no scream was heard; she
simply disappeared.That the person seen
by her was one both known and trusted?I would not consider such a
possibility; so laying down the paper, I endeavored to put away all
further consideration of the affair till I had acquired more facts
upon which to base the theory.But who can control his thoughts when
over-excited upon any one theme?All the morning I found myself turning
the case over in my mind, arriving ever at one of two conclusions.Hannah Chester must be found, or Eleanore Leavenworth must explain when
and by what means the key of the library door came into her possession.At two o'clock I started from my office to attend the inquest; but,
being delayed on the way, missed arriving at the house until after the
delivery of the verdict.This was a disappointment to me, especially as
by these means I lost the opportunity of seeing Eleanore Leavenworth,
she having retired to her room immediately upon the dismissal of the
jury.Harwell was visible, and from him I heard what the verdict
had been."Death by means of a pistol shot from the hand of some person unknown."The result of the inquest was a great relief to me.Nor could I help seeing that, for all his studied self-command, the
pale-faced secretary shared in my satisfaction.What was less of a relief to me was the fact, soon communicated, that
Mr.Gryce and his subordinates had left the premises immediately upon
the delivery of the verdict.Gryce was not the man to forsake an
affair like this while anything of importance connected with it remained
unexplained.Could it be he meditated any decisive action?Somewhat
alarmed, I was about to hurry from the house for the purpose of learning
what his intentions were, when a sudden movement in the front lower
window of the house on the opposite side of the way arrested my
attention, and, looking closer, I detected the face of Mr.Fobbs peering
out from behind the curtain.The sight assured me I was not wrong in my
estimate of Mr.Gryce; and, struck with pity for the desolate girl left
to meet the exigencies of a fate to which this watch upon her movements
was but the evident precursor, I stepped back and sent her a note, in
which, as Mr.Veeley's representative, I proffered my services in case
of any sudden emergency, saying I was always to be found in my rooms
between the hours of six and eight.This done, I proceeded to the house
in Thirty-seventh Street where I had left Miss Mary Leavenworth the day
before.Ushered into the long and narrow drawing-room which of late years
has been so fashionable in our uptown houses, I found myself almost
immediately in the presence of Miss Leavenworth."Oh," she cried, with an eloquent gesture of welcome, "I had begun to
think I was forsaken!"and advancing impulsively, she held out her hand."A verdict of murder, Miss Leavenworth.""Perpetrated by party or parties unknown."A look of relief broke softly across her features."I found no one in the house who did not belong there.""There is no one here," said she.At length, in an awkward way enough, I turned
towards her and said:

"I do not wish either to offend or alarm you, but I must say that I
consider it your duty to return to your own home to-night.""Is there any particular reason for my doing so?Have you not perceived the impossibility of my remaining in the same
house with Eleanore?""Miss Leavenworth, I cannot recognize any so-called impossibility of
this nature.Eleanore is your cousin; has been brought up to regard you
as a sister; it is not worthy of you to desert her at the time of her
necessity.You will see this as I do, if you will allow yourself a
moment's dispassionate thought.""Dispassionate thought is hardly possible under the circumstances," she
returned, with a smile of bitter irony.But before I could reply to this, she softened, and asked if I was very
anxious to have her return; and when I replied, "More than I can say,"
she trembled and looked for a moment as if she were half inclined to
yield; but suddenly broke into tears, crying it was impossible, and that
I was cruel to ask it."Pardon me," said I, "I have indeed
transgressed the bounds allotted to me.I will not do so again; you have
doubtless many friends; let some of them advise you.""The friends you speak of are flatterers.You alone have the courage to command me to do what is right.""Excuse me, I do not command; I only entreat."She made no reply, but began pacing the room, her eyes fixed, her hands
working convulsively."You little know what you ask," said she."I feel
as though the very atmosphere of that house would destroy me; but--why
cannot Eleanore come here?"Gilbert will be quite willing, and I could keep my room, and we need not
meet.""You forget that there is another call at home, besides the one I have
already mentioned.To-morrow afternoon your uncle is to be buried.""You are the head of the household," I now ventured, "and the proper
one to attend to the final offices towards one who has done so much for
you."There was something strange in the look which she gave me."It is true,"
she assented.Then, with a grand turn of her body, and a quick air of
determination: "I am desirous of being worthy of your good opinion.I
will go back to my cousin, Mr.I felt my spirits rise a little; I took her by the hand."May that
cousin have no need of the comfort which I am now sure you will be ready
to give her.""I mean to do my duty," was her cold
response.As I descended the stoop, I met a certain thin and fashionably dressed
young man, who gave me a very sharp look as he passed.As he wore his
clothes a little too conspicuously for the perfect gentleman, and as I
had some remembrance of having seen him at the inquest, I set him down
for a man in Mr.Gryce's employ, and hasted on towards the avenue; when
what was my surprise to find on the corner another person, who,
while pretending to be on the look out for a car, cast upon me, as I
approached, a furtive glance of intense inquiry.As this latter was,
without question, a gentleman, I felt some annoyance, and, walking
quietly up to him, asked if he found my countenance familiar, that he
scrutinized it so closely."I find it a very agreeable one," was his unexpected reply, as he turned
from me and walked down the avenue.Nettled, and in no small degree mortified, at the disadvantage in which
his courtesy had placed me, I stood watching him as he disappeared,
asking myself who and what he was.For he was not only a gentleman, but
a marked one; possessing features of unusual symmetry as well as a form
of peculiar elegance.Not so very young--he might well be forty--there
were yet evident on his face the impress of youth's strongest emotions,
not a curve of his chin nor a glance of his eye betraying in any way the
slightest leaning towards _ennui,_ though face and figure were of that
type which seems most to invite and cherish it."He can have no connection with the police force," thought I; "nor is it
by any means certain that he knows me, or is interested in my affairs;
but I shall not soon forget him, for all that."The summons from Eleanore Leavenworth came about eight o'clock in the
evening.It was brought by Thomas, and read as follows:

"Come, Oh, come!I--" there breaking off in a tremble, as if the pen had
fallen from a nerveless hand.It did not take me long to find my way to her home."Constant you are--
    ... And for secrecy
     No lady closer.""No, 't is slander,
    Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile.""You will find Miss Eleanore in the
drawing-room, sir," she said, ushering me in.Fearing I knew not what, I hurried to the room thus indicated, feeling
as never before the sumptuousness of the magnificent hall with its
antique flooring, carved woods, and bronze ornamentations:--the mockery
of _things_ for the first time forcing itself upon me.Laying my hand
on the drawing-room door, I listened.Slowly pulling it
open, I lifted the heavy satin curtains hanging before me to the floor,
and looked within.Sitting in the light of a solitary gas jet, whose faint glimmering just
served to make visible the glancing satin and stainless marble of
the gorgeous apartment, I beheld Eleanore Leavenworth.Pale as the
sculptured image of the Psyche that towered above her from the mellow
dusk of the bow-window near which she sat, beautiful as it, and almost
as immobile, she crouched with rigid hands frozen in forgotten entreaty
before her, apparently insensible to sound, movement, or touch; a silent
figure of despair in presence of an implacable fate.Impressed by the scene, I stood with my hand upon the curtain,
hesitating if to advance or retreat, when suddenly a sharp tremble shook
her impassive frame, the rigid hands unlocked, the stony eyes softened,
and, springing to her feet, she uttered a cry of satisfaction, and
advanced towards me.I exclaimed, starting at the sound of my own voice.She paused, and pressed her hands to her face, as if the world and all
she had forgotten had rushed back upon her at this simple utterance of
her name.They--they are beginning to
say that I--" she paused, and clutched her throat.she gasped,
pointing to a newspaper lying on the floor at her feet.I stooped and lifted what showed itself at first glance to be the
_Evening Telegram._ It needed but a single look to inform me to what she
referred.There, in startling characters, I beheld:


    THE LEAVENWORTH MURDER

    LATEST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MYSTERIOUS CASE

    A MEMBER OF THE MURDERED MAN'S OWN FAMILY
    STRONGLY SUSPECTED OF THE CRIME

    THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN NEW YORK UNDER A CLOUD

    PAST HISTORY OF MISS ELEANORE LEAVENWORTH

I was prepared for it; had schooled myself for this very thing, you
might say; and yet I could not help recoiling.Dropping the paper from
my hand, I stood before her, longing and yet dreading to look into her
face.she panted; "what, what does it mean?and her eyes, fixed and glassy, stared into mine as if she found
it impossible to grasp the sense of this outrage."To accuse _me_" she murmured; "me, me!"striking her breast with her
clenched hand, "who loved the very ground he trod upon; who would have
cast my own body between him and the deadly bullet if I had only known
his danger.she cried, "it is not a slander they utter, but a
dagger which they thrust into my heart!"Overcome by her misery, but determined not to show my compassion until
more thoroughly convinced of her complete innocence, I replied, after a
pause:

"This seems to strike you with great surprise, Miss Leavenworth; were
you not then able to foresee what must follow your determined reticence
upon certain points?Did you know so little of human nature as to
imagine that, situated as you are, you could keep silence in regard to
any matter connected with this crime, without arousing the antagonism of
the crowd, to say nothing of the suspicions of the police?""But--but----"

I hurriedly waved my hand."When you defied the coroner to find
any suspicious paper in your possession; when"--I forced myself to
speak--"you refused to tell Mr.Gryce how you came in possession of the
key--"

She drew hastily back, a heavy pall seeming to fall over her with my
words."Don't," she whispered, looking in terror about her.Sometimes I
think the walls have ears, and that the very shadows listen.""Ah," I returned; "then you hope to keep from the world what is known to
the detectives?""Miss Leavenworth," I went on, "I am afraid you do not comprehend
your position.Try to look at the case for a moment in the light of
an unprejudiced person; try to see for yourself the necessity of
explaining----"

"But I cannot explain," she murmured huskily.I do not know whether it was the tone of my voice or the word itself,
but that simple expression seemed to affect her like a blow.she cried, shrinking back: "you do not, cannot doubt me, too?I
thought that you--" and stopped."I did not dream that I--" and stopped
again.You have mistrusted
me from the first; the appearances against me have been too strong"; and
she sank inert, lost in the depths of her shame and humiliation."Ah,
but now I am forsaken!"Starting forward, I exclaimed: "Miss
Leavenworth, I am but a man; I cannot see you so distressed.Say
that you are innocent, and I will believe you, without regard to
appearances."Springing erect, she towered upon me."Can any one look in my face
and accuse me of guilt?"Then, as I sadly shook my head, she hurriedly
gasped: "You want further proof!"and, quivering with an extraordinary
emotion, she sprang to the door."Come, then," she cried, "come!"her eyes flashing full of resolve upon
me.Aroused, appalled, moved in spite of myself, I crossed the room to where
she stood; but she was already in the hall.Hastening after her, filled
with a fear I dared not express, I stood at the foot of the stairs; she
was half-way to the top.Following her into the hall above, I saw her
form standing erect and noble at the door of her uncle's bedroom.she again cried, but this time in a calm and reverential tone;
and flinging the door open before her, she passed in.Subduing the wonder which I felt, I slowly followed her.There was no
light in the room of death, but the flame of the gas-burner, at the far
end of the hall, shone weirdly in, and by its glimmering I beheld her
kneeling at the shrouded bed, her head bowed above that of the murdered
man, her hand upon his breast."You have said that if I declared my innocence you would believe me,"
she exclaimed, lifting her head as I entered."See here," and laying
her cheek against the pallid brow of her dead benefactor, she kissed the
clay-cold lips softly, wildly, agonizedly, then, leaping to her feet,
cried, in a subdued but thrilling tone: "Could I do that if I were
guilty?Would not the breath freeze on my lips, the blood congeal in
my veins, and my heart faint at this contact?Son of a father loved and
reverenced, can you believe me to be a woman stained with crime when I
can do this?"and kneeling again she cast her arms over and about that
inanimate form, looking in my face at the same time with an expression
no mortal touch could paint, nor tongue describe."In olden times," she went on, "they used to say that a dead body would
bleed if its murderer came in contact with it.What then would happen
here if I, his daughter, his cherished child, loaded with benefits,
enriched with his jewels, warm with his kisses, should be the thing they
accuse me of?Would not the body of the outraged dead burst its very
shroud and repel me?"I could not answer; in the presence of some scenes the tongue forgets
its functions.she went on, "if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and
hates a crime, let Him hear me now.If I, by thought or action, with
or without intention, have been the means of bringing this dear head to
this pass; if so much as the shadow of guilt, let alone the substance,
lies upon my heart and across these feeble woman's hands, may His wrath
speak in righteous retribution to the world, and here, upon the breast
of the dead, let this guilty forehead fall, never to rise again!"An awed silence followed this invocation; then a long, long sigh of
utter relief rose tremulously from my breast, and all the feelings
hitherto suppressed in my heart burst their bonds, and leaning towards
her I took her hand in mine."You do not, cannot believe me tainted by crime now?"she whispered,
the smile which does not stir the lips, but rather emanates from the
countenance, like the flowering of an inner peace, breaking softly out
on cheek and brow.The word broke uncontrollably from my lips; "crime!""No," she said calmly, "the man does not live who could accuse me of
crime, _here_."For reply, I took her hand, which lay in mine, and placed it on the
breast of the dead.Softly, slowly, gratefully, she bowed her head."There is one who will
believe in me, however dark appearances may be."THE PROBLEM


    "But who would force the soul, tilts with a straw
     Against a champion cased in adamant."WHEN we re-entered the parlor below, the first sight that met our eyes
was Mary, standing wrapped in her long cloak in the centre of the room.She had arrived during our absence, and now awaited us with lifted head
and countenance fixed in its proudest expression.Looking in her face, I
realized what the embarrassment of this meeting must be to these
women, and would have retreated, but something in the attitude of Mary
Leavenworth seemed to forbid my doing so.At the same time, determined
that the opportunity should not pass without some sort of reconcilement
between them, I stepped forward, and, bowing to Mary, said:

"Your cousin has just succeeded in convincing me of her entire
innocence, Miss Leavenworth.Gryce, heart and
soul, in finding out the true culprit.""I should have thought one look into Eleanore Leavenworth's face would
have been enough to satisfy you that she is incapable of crime," was
her unexpected answer; and, lifting her head with a proud gesture, Mary
Leavenworth fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.I felt the blood flash to my brow, but before I could speak, her voice
rose again still more coldly than before."It is hard for a delicate girl, unused to aught but the most flattering
expressions of regard, to be obliged to assure the world of her
innocence in respect to the committal of a great crime.And sweeping her cloak from her shoulders with a quick
gesture, she turned her gaze for the first time upon her cousin.Instantly Eleanore advanced, as if to meet it; and I could not but feel
that, for some reason, this moment possessed an importance for them
which I was scarcely competent to measure.But if I found myself unable
to realize its significance, I at least responded to its intensity.And
indeed it was an occasion to remember.To behold two such women, either
of whom might be considered the model of her time, face to face
and drawn up in evident antagonism, was a sight to move the dullest
sensibilities.But there was something more in this scene than that.It
was the shock of all the most passionate emotions of the human soul;
the meeting of waters of whose depth and force I could only guess by the
effect.Drawing back with the cold
haughtiness which, alas, I had almost forgotten in the display of later
and softer emotions, she exclaimed:

"There is something better than sympathy, and that is justice"; and
turned, as if to go."I will confer with you in the reception room, Mr.But Mary, springing forward, caught her back with one powerful hand."No," she cried, "you shall confer with _me!_ I have something to say to
you, Eleanore Leavenworth."And, taking her stand in the centre of the
room, she waited.I glanced at Eleanore, saw this was no place for me, and hastily
withdrew.For ten long minutes I paced the floor of the reception room,
a prey to a thousand doubts and conjectures.What had given rise to the deadly mistrust continually manifested
between these cousins, fitted by nature for the completest companionship
and the most cordial friendship?It was not a thing of to-day or
yesterday.No sudden flame could awake such concentrated heat of emotion
as that of which I had just been the unwilling witness.One must go
farther back than this murder to find the root of a mistrust so great
that the struggle it caused made itself felt even where I stood, though
nothing but the faintest murmur came to my ears through the closed
doors.Presently the drawing-room curtain was raised, and Mary's voice was
heard in distinct articulation."The same roof can never shelter us both after this.To-morrow, you or I
find another home."And, blushing and panting, she stepped into the
hall and advanced to where I stood.But at the first sight of my face,
a change came over her; all her pride seemed to dissolve, and, flinging
out her hands, as if to ward off scrutiny, she fled from my side, and
rushed weeping up-stairs.I was yet laboring under the oppression caused by this painful
termination of the strange scene when the parlor curtain was again
lifted, and Eleanore entered the room where I was.Pale but calm,
showing no evidences of the struggle she had just been through, unless
by a little extra weariness about the eyes, she sat down by my side,
and, meeting my gaze with one unfathomable in its courage, said after
a pause: "Tell me where I stand; let me know the worst at once; I fear
that I have not indeed comprehended my own position."Rejoiced to hear this acknowledgment from her lips, I hastened to
comply.I began by placing before her the whole case as it appeared
to an unprejudiced person; enlarged upon the causes of suspicion, and
pointed out in what regard some things looked dark against her, which
perhaps to her own mind were easily explainable and of small account;
tried to make her see the importance of her decision, and finally wound
up with an appeal."And so I am; but I want the world to be so, too."The finger of suspicion never forgets the way
it has once pointed," she sadly answered."And you will submit to this, when a word--"

"I am thinking that any word of mine now would make very little
difference," she murmured.Fobbs, in hiding behind the curtains of
the opposite house, recurring painfully to my mind."If the affair looks as bad as you say it does," she pursued, "it is
scarcely probable that Mr.Gryce will care much for any interpretation
of mine in regard to the matter."Gryce would be glad to know where you procured that key, if only to
assist him in turning his inquiries in the right direction."She did not reply, and my spirits sank in renewed depression."It is worth your while to satisfy him," I pursued; "and though it may
compromise some one you desire to shield----"

She rose impetuously."I shall never divulge to any one how I came in
possession of that key."And sitting again, she locked her hands in
fixed resolve before her.I rose in my turn and paced the floor, the fang of an unreasoning
jealousy striking deep into my heart.Raymond, if the worst should come, and all who love me should plead
on bended knees for me to tell, I will never do it.""Then," said I, determined not to disclose my secret thought, but
equally resolved to find out if possible her motive for this silence,
"you desire to defeat the cause of justice.""Miss Leavenworth," I now said, "this determined shielding of another at
the expense of your own good name is no doubt generous of you; but
your friends and the lovers of truth and justice cannot accept such a
sacrifice.""If you will not assist us," I went on calmly, but determinedly, "we
must do without your aid.After the scene I have just witnessed above;
after the triumphant conviction which you have forced upon me, not only
of your innocence, but your horror of the crime and its consequences, I
should feel myself less than a man if I did not sacrifice even your own
good opinion, in urging your cause, and clearing your character from
this foul aspersion."Crossing the room, I stood before her."I propose to relieve you utterly
and forever from suspicion, by finding out and revealing to the world
the true culprit."I expected to see her recoil, so positive had I become by this time
as to who that culprit was.But instead of that, she merely folded her
hands still more tightly and exclaimed:

"I doubt if you will be able to do that, Mr."Doubt if I will be able to put my finger upon the guilty man, or doubt
if I will be able to bring him to justice?""I doubt," she said with strong effort, "if any one ever knows who is
the guilty person in this case.""There is one who knows," I said with a desire to test her."The girl Hannah is acquainted with the mystery of that night's evil
doings, Miss Leavenworth.Find Hannah, and we find one who can point out
to us the assassin of your uncle.""That is mere supposition," she said; but I saw the blow had told."Your cousin has offered a large reward for the girl, and the whole
country is on the lookout.Within a week we shall see her in our midst."A change took place in her expression and bearing."The girl cannot help me," she said.Baffled by her manner, I drew back."Is there anything or anybody that
can?""Miss Leavenworth," I continued with renewed earnestness, "you have no
brother to plead with you, you have no mother to guide you; let me then
entreat, in default of nearer and dearer friends, that you will rely
sufficiently upon me to tell me one thing.""Whether you took the paper imputed to you from the library table?"She did not instantly respond, but sat looking earnestly before her with
an intentness which seemed to argue that she was weighing the question
as well as her reply.Finally, turning toward me, she said:

"In answering you, I speak in confidence.Crushing back the sigh of despair that arose to my lips, I went on."I will not inquire what the paper was,"--she waved her hand
deprecatingly,--"but this much more you will tell me.I could with difficulty forbear showing my disappointment."Miss
Leavenworth," I now said, "it may seem cruel for me to press you at this
time; nothing less than my strong realization of the peril in which you
stand would induce me to run the risk of incurring your displeasure by
asking what under other circumstances would seem puerile and insulting
questions.You have told me one thing which I strongly desired to know;
will you also inform me what it was you heard that night while sitting
in your room, between the time of Mr.Harwell's going up-stairs and the
closing of the library door, of which you made mention at the inquest?"I had pushed my inquiries too far, and I saw it immediately.Raymond," she returned, "influenced by my desire not to appear
utterly ungrateful to you, I have been led to reply in confidence to one
of your urgent appeals; but I can go no further.Stricken to the heart by her look of reproach, I answered with some
sadness that her wishes should be respected."Not but what I intend to
make every effort in my power to discover the true author of this crime.That is a sacred duty which I feel myself called upon to perform; but I
will ask you no more questions, nor distress you with further appeals.What is done shall be done without your assistance, and with no other
hope than that in the event of my success you will acknowledge my
motives to have been pure and my action disinterested.""I am ready to acknowledge that now," she began, but paused and looked
with almost agonized entreaty in my face.Raymond, cannot you leave
things as they are?I don't ask for assistance, nor do I want
it; I would rather----"

But I would not listen."Guilt has no right to profit by the generosity
of the guiltless.The hand that struck this blow shall not be
accountable for the loss of a noble woman's honor and happiness as well."I shall do what I can, Miss Leavenworth."As I walked down the avenue that night, feeling like an adventurous
traveller that in a moment of desperation has set his foot upon a plank
stretching in narrow perspective over a chasm of immeasurable depth,
this problem evolved itself from the shadows before me: How, with no
other clue than the persuasion that Eleanore Leavenworth was engaged in
shielding another at the expense of her own good name, I was to
combat the prejudices of Mr.Gryce, find out the real assassin of Mr.Leavenworth, and free an innocent woman from the suspicion that had, not
without some show of reason, fallen upon her?HENRY CLAVERING



XIV.GRYCE AT HOME


    "Nay, but hear me."THAT the guilty person for whom Eleanore Leavenworth stood ready to
sacrifice herself was one for whom she had formerly cherished affection,
I could no longer doubt; love, or the strong sense of duty growing out
of love, being alone sufficient to account for such determined action.Obnoxious as it was to all my prejudices, one name alone, that of the
commonplace secretary, with his sudden heats and changeful manners, his
odd ways and studied self-possession, would recur to my mind whenever I
asked myself who this person could be.Not that, without the light which had been thrown upon the affair by
Eleanore's strange behavior, I should have selected this man as one in
any way open to suspicion; the peculiarity of his manner at the inquest
not being marked enough to counteract the improbability of one in his
relations to the deceased finding sufficient motive for a crime so
manifestly without favorable results to himself.But if love had entered
as a factor into the affair, what might not be expected?James Harwell,
simple amanuensis to a retired tea-merchant, was one man; James Harwell,
swayed by passion for a woman beautiful as Eleanore Leavenworth, was
another; and in placing him upon the list of those parties open to
suspicion I felt I was only doing what was warranted by a proper
consideration of probabilities.But, between casual suspicion and actual proof, what a gulf!To believe
James Harwell capable of guilt, and to find evidence enough to accuse
him of it, were two very different things.I felt myself instinctively
shrink from the task, before I had fully made up my mind to attempt it;
some relenting thought of his unhappy position, if innocent, forcing
itself upon me, and making my very distrust of him seem personally
ungenerous if not absolutely unjust.If I had liked the man better, I
should not have been so ready to look upon him with doubt.But Eleanore must be saved at all hazards.Once delivered up to the
blight of suspicion, who could tell what the result might be; the arrest
of her person perhaps,--a thing which, once accomplished, would cast a
shadow over her young life that it would take more than time to dispel.The accusation of an impecunious secretary would be less horrible than
this.I determined to make an early call upon Mr.Meanwhile the contrasted pictures of Eleanore standing with her hand
upon the breast of the dead, her face upraised and mirroring a glory,
I could not recall without emotion; and Mary, fleeing a short half-hour
later indignantly from her presence, haunted me and kept me awake long
after midnight.It was like a double vision of light and darkness that,
while contrasting, neither assimilated nor harmonized.Do what I would, the two pictures followed me, filling my soul
with alternate hope and distrust, till I knew not whether to place my
hand with Eleanore on the breast of the dead, and swear implicit faith
in her truth and purity, or to turn my face like Mary, and fly from what
I could neither comprehend nor reconcile.Expectant of difficulty, I started next morning upon my search for Mr.Gryce, with strong determination not to allow myself to become flurried
by disappointment nor discouraged by premature failure.My business was
to save Eleanore Leavenworth; and to do that, it was necessary for me to
preserve, not only my equanimity, but my self-possession.The worst
fear I anticipated was that matters would reach a crisis before I could
acquire the right, or obtain the opportunity, to interfere.Leavenworth's funeral being announced for that day gave
me some comfort in that direction; my knowledge of Mr.Gryce being
sufficient, as I thought, to warrant me in believing he would wait till
after that ceremony before proceeding to extreme measures.I do not know that I had any very definite ideas of what a detective's
home should be; but when I stood before the neat three-story brick house
to which I had been directed, I could not but acknowledge there was
something in the aspect of its half-open shutters, over closely drawn
curtains of spotless purity, highly suggestive of the character of its
inmate.A pale-looking youth, with vivid locks of red hair hanging straight down
over either ear, answered my rather nervous ring.Gryce was in, he gave a kind of snort which might have meant
no, but which I took to mean yes."My name is Raymond, and I wish to see him."He gave me one glance that took in every detail of my person and
apparel, and pointed to a door at the head of the stairs.Not waiting
for further directions, I hastened up, knocked at the door he had
designated, and went in.Gryce, stooping above a
desk that might have come over in the _Mayflower,_ confronted me.And rising, he opened with a
squeak and shut with a bang the door of an enormous stove that occupied
the centre of the room."Yes," I returned, eyeing him closely to see if he was in a
communicative mood."But I have had but little time to consider the
state of the weather.My anxiety in regard to this murder----"

"To be sure," he interrupted, fixing his eyes upon the poker, though
not with any hostile intention, I am sure.But perhaps it is an open book to you."I have, though I doubt if it is of the nature you expect.Gryce,
since I saw you last, my convictions upon a certain point have been
strengthened into an absolute belief.The object of your suspicions is
an innocent woman."If I had expected him to betray any surprise at this, I was destined to
be disappointed."That is a very pleasing belief," he observed."I honor
you for entertaining it, Mr."So thoroughly is it mine," I went on,
in the determination to arouse him in some way, "that I have come here
to-day to ask you in the name of justice and common humanity to suspend
action in that direction till we can convince ourselves there is no
truer scent to go upon."But there was no more show of curiosity than before.he cried;
"that is a singular request to come from a man like you."I was not to be discomposed, "Mr.Gryce," I went on, "a woman's name,
once tarnished, remains so forever.Eleanore Leavenworth has too many
noble traits to be thoughtlessly dealt with in so momentous a crisis.If
you will give me your attention, I promise you shall not regret it."He smiled, and allowed his eyes to roam from the poker to the arm of my
chair."Very well," he remarked; "I hear you; say on."I drew my notes from my pocketbook, and laid them on the table."Unsafe, very; never put your plans on
paper."Taking no heed of the interruption, I went on.Gryce, I have had fuller opportunities than yourself for studying
this woman.I have seen her in a position which no guilty person could
occupy, and I am assured, beyond all doubt, that not only her hands, but
her heart, are pure from this crime.She may have some knowledge of its
secrets; that I do not presume to deny.The key seen in her possession
would refute me if I did.You can never wish to see
so lovely a being brought to shame for withholding information which she
evidently considers it her duty to keep back, when by a little patient
finesse we may succeed in our purposes without it.""But," interposed the detective, "say this is so; how are we to arrive
at the knowledge we want without following out the only clue which has
yet been given us?""You will never reach it by following out any clue given you by Eleanore
Leavenworth."His eyebrows lifted expressively, but he said nothing."Miss Eleanore Leavenworth has been used by some one acquainted with her
firmness, generosity, and perhaps love.Let us discover who possesses
sufficient power over her to control her to this extent, and we find the
man we seek."Gryce's compressed lips, and no more.Determined that he should speak, I waited."You have, then, some one in your mind"; he remarked at last, almost
flippantly."You are, then, intending to make a personal business of this matter?""May I ask," he inquired at length,
"whether you expect to work entirely by yourself; or whether, if a
suitable coadjutor were provided, you would disdain his assistance and
slight his advice?""I desire nothing more than to have you for my colleague.""You must feel very sure of
yourself!""I am very sure of Miss Leavenworth."The truth was, I had formed no plans."It seems to me," he continued, "that you have undertaken a rather
difficult task for an amateur.Raymond;
better leave it to me.""I am sure," I returned, "that nothing would please me better----"

"Not," he interrupted, "but that a word from you now and then would
be welcome.I am open to suggestions: as, for
instance, now, if you could conveniently inform me of all you have
yourself seen and heard in regard to this matter, I should be most happy
to listen."Relieved to find him so amenable, I asked myself what I really had to
tell; not so much that he would consider vital.However, it would not do
to hesitate now.Gryce," said I, "I have but few facts to add to those already known
to you.Indeed, I am more moved by convictions than facts.That Eleanore
Leavenworth never committed this crime, I am assured.That, on the other
hand, the real perpetrator is known to her, I am equally certain;
and that for some reason she considers it a sacred duty to shield the
assassin, even at the risk of her own safety, follows as a matter
of course from the facts.Now, with such data, it cannot be a very
difficult task for you or me to work out satisfactorily, to our own
minds at least, who this person can be.A little more knowledge of the
family--"

"You know nothing of its secret history, then?""Do not even know whether either of these girls is engaged to be
married?""I do not," I returned, wincing at this direct expression of my own
thoughts.Raymond," he cried at last, "have
you any idea of the disadvantages under which a detective labors?For
instance, now, you imagine I can insinuate myself into all sorts of
society, perhaps; but you are mistaken.Strange as it may appear, I have
never by any possibility of means succeeded with one class of persons at
all.Tailors and barbers are
no good; I am always found out."He looked so dejected I could scarcely forbear smiling, notwithstanding
my secret care and anxiety."I have even employed a French valet, who understood dancing and
whiskers; but it was all of no avail.The first gentleman I approached
stared at me,--real gentleman, I mean, none of your American
dandies,--and I had no stare to return; I had forgotten that emergency
in my confabs with Pierre Catnille Marie Make-face."Amused, but a little discomposed by this sudden turn in the
conversation, I looked at Mr."Now you, I dare say, have no trouble?Can even
ask a lady to dance without blushing, eh?""Just so," he replied; "now, I can't.I can enter a house, bow to the
mistress of it, let her be as elegant as she will, so long as I have
a writ of arrest in my hand, or some such professional matter upon my
mind; but when it comes to visiting in kid gloves, raising a glass of
champagne in response to a toast--and such like, I am absolutely good
for nothing."And he plunged his two hands into his hair, and looked
dolefully at the head of the cane I carried in my hand."But it is much
the same with the whole of us.When we are in want of a gentleman to
work for us, we have to go outside of our profession."I began to see what he was driving at; but held my peace, vaguely
conscious I was likely to prove a necessity to him, after all.Raymond," he now said, almost abruptly; "do you know a gentleman by
the name of Clavering residing at present at the Hoffman House?""He is very polished in his manners; would you mind making his
acquaintance?"Gryce's example, and stared at the chimney-piece."I
cannot answer till I understand matters a little better," I returned at
length.Henry Clavering, a gentleman and
a man of the world, resides at the Hoffman House.He is a stranger in
town, without being strange; drives, walks, smokes, but never visits;
looks at the ladies, but is never seen to bow to one.In short, a
person whom it is desirable to know; but whom, being a proud man,
with something of the old-world prejudice against Yankee freedom and
forwardness, I could no more approach in the way of acquaintance than I
could the Emperor of Austria.""And you wish----"

"He would make a very agreeable companion for a rising young lawyer
of good family and undoubted respectability.I have no doubt, if you
undertook to cultivate him, you would find him well worth the trouble.""But----"

"Might even desire to take him into familiar relations; to confide in
him, and----"

"Mr.Gryce," I hastily interrupted; "I can never consent to plot for any
man's friendship for the sake of betraying him to the police.""It is essential to your plans to make the acquaintance of Mr.I returned, a light breaking in upon me; "he has some connection
with this case, then?"Gryce smoothed his coat-sleeve thoughtfully."I don't know as it
will be necessary for you to betray him.You wouldn't object to being
introduced to him?""Nor, if you found him pleasant, to converse with him?""Not even if, in the course of conversation, you should come across
something that might serve as a clue in your efforts to save Eleanore
Leavenworth?"The no I uttered this time was less assured; the part of a spy was the
very last one I desired to play in the coming drama."Well, then," he went on, ignoring the doubtful tone in which my assent
had been given, "I advise you to immediately take up your quarters at
the Hoffman House.""I doubt if that would do," I said."If I am not mistaken, I have
already seen this gentleman, and spoken to him.""Well, he is tall, finely formed, of very upright carriage, with a
handsome dark face, brown hair streaked with gray, a piercing eye, and a
smooth address.A very imposing personage, I assure you.""I have reason to think I have seen him," I returned; and in a few words
told him when and where.said he at the conclusion; "he is evidently as much interested
in you as we are in him.I think I see," he added, after a moment's thought."Pity you spoke to him; may have created an unfavorable impression; and
everything depends upon your meeting without any distrust.""Well, we must move slowly, that is all.Give him a chance to see you in
other and better lights.Talk with the best men you meet while there; but not too much, or too
indiscriminately.Clavering is fastidious, and will not feel honored
by the attentions of one who is hail-fellow-well-met with everybody.Show yourself for what you are, and leave all advances to him; he 'll
make them.""Supposing we are under a mistake, and the man I met on the corner of
Thirty-seventh Street was not Mr."I should be greatly surprised, that's all."Not knowing what further objection to make, I remained silent."And this head of mine would have to put on its thinking-cap," he
pursued jovially.Gryce," I now said, anxious to show that all this talk about an
unknown party had not served to put my own plans from my mind, "there is
one person of whom we have not spoken."he exclaimed softly, wheeling around until his broad back
confronted me."Why, who but Mr.--" I could get no further.What right had I to
mention any man's name in this connection, without possessing sufficient
evidence against him to make such mention justifiable?"I beg your
pardon," said I; "but I think I will hold to my first impulse, and speak
no names."The quick blush rising to my face gave an involuntary assent."I see no reason why we shouldn't speak of him," he went on; "that is,
if there is anything to be gained by it.""His testimony at the inquest was honest, you think?"I felt myself slightly nonplussed; and, conscious of appearing at a
disadvantage, lifted my hat from the table and prepared to take my
leave; but, suddenly thinking of Hannah, turned and asked if there was
any news of her.He seemed to debate with himself, hesitating so long that I began to
doubt if this man intended to confide in me, after all, when suddenly he
brought his two hands down before him and exclaimed vehemently:

"The evil one himself is in this business!If the earth had opened and
swallowed up this girl, she couldn't have more effectually disappeared."Eleanore had said: "Hannah can do
nothing for me."Could it be that the girl was indeed gone, and forever?"I have innumerable agents at work, to say nothing of the general
public; and yet not so much as a whisper has come to me in regard to her
whereabouts or situation.I am only afraid we shall find her floating in
the river some fine morning, without a confession in her pocket.""Everything hangs upon that girl's testimony," I remarked."What does Miss Leavenworth say about it?"I thought he looked a trifle surprised at this, but he covered it with a
nod and an exclamation."She must be found for all that," said he, "and
shall, if I have to send out Q.""An agent of mine who is a living interrogation point; so we call him
_Q,_ which is short for query."Then, as I turned again to go: "When the
contents of the will are made known, come to me."WAYS OPENING


    "It is not and it cannot come to good."Leavenworth, but did not see the
ladies before or after the ceremony.I, however, had a few moments'
conversation with Mr.Harwell; which, without eliciting anything new,
provided me with food for abundant conjecture.For he had asked, almost
at first greeting, if I had seen the _Telegram_ of the night before;
and when I responded in the affirmative, turned such a look of mingled
distress and appeal upon me, I was tempted to ask how such a frightful
insinuation against a young lady of reputation and breeding could ever
have got into the papers."That the guilty party might be driven by remorse to own himself the
true culprit."A curious remark to come from a person who had no knowledge or
suspicion of the criminal and his character; and I would have pushed
the conversation further, but the secretary, who was a man of few words,
drew off at this, and could be induced to say no more.Evidently it was
my business to cultivate Mr.Clavering, or any one else who could throw
any light upon the secret history of these girls.Veeley had arrived home, but
was in no condition to consult with me upon so painful a subject as
the murder of Mr.Also a line from Eleanore, giving me her
address, but requesting me at the same time not to call unless I had
something of importance to communicate, as she was too ill to receive
visitors.Ill, alone, and in a strange
home,--'twas pitiful!The next day, pursuant to the wishes of Mr.Gryce, in I stepped into the
Hoffman House, and took a seat in the reading room.I had been there but
a few moments when a gentleman entered whom I immediately recognized
as the same I had spoken to on the corner of Thirty-seventh Street
and Sixth Avenue.He must have remembered me also, for he seemed to be
slightly embarrassed at seeing me; but, recovering himself, took up a
paper and soon became to all appearance lost in its contents, though I
could feel his handsome black eye upon me, studying my features,
figure, apparel, and movements with a degree of interest which equally
astonished and disconcerted me.I felt that it would be injudicious on
my part to return his scrutiny, anxious as I was to meet his eye and
learn what emotion had so fired his curiosity in regard to a perfect
stranger; so I rose, and, crossing to an old friend of mine who sat at
a table opposite, commenced a desultory conversation, in the course of
which I took occasion to ask if he knew who the handsome stranger was.Dick Furbish was a society man, and knew everybody."His name is Clavering, and he comes from London.I don't know anything
more about him, though he is to be seen everywhere except in private
houses.He has not been received into society yet; waiting for letters
of introduction, perhaps.""Oh, yes; I talk to him, but the conversation is very one-sided."I could not help smiling at the grimace with which Dick accompanied this
remark."Which same goes to prove," he went on, "that he is the real
thing."Laughing outright this time, I left him, and in a few minutes sauntered
from the room.As I mingled again with the crowd on Broadway, I found myself wondering
immensely over this slight experience.That this unknown gentleman from
London, who went everywhere except into private houses, could be in
any way connected with the affair I had so at heart, seemed not only
improbable but absurd; and for the first time I felt tempted to doubt
the sagacity of Mr.The next day I repeated the experiment, but with no greater success
than before.Clavering came into the room, but, seeing me, did
not remain.I began to realize it was no easy matter to make his
acquaintance.To atone for my disappointment, I called on Mary
Leavenworth in the evening.She received me with almost a sister-like
familiarity."Ah," she cried, after introducing me to an elderly lady at her
side,--some connection of the family, I believe, who had come to remain
with her for a while,--"you are here to tell me Hannah is found; is it
not so?"I shook my head, sorry to disappoint her."No," said I; "not yet."Gryce was here to-day, and he told me he hoped she would be
heard from within twenty-four hours.""Yes; came to report how matters were progressing,--not that they seemed
to have advanced very far."You must not be so easily
discouraged.""But I cannot help it; every day, every hour that passes in this
uncertainty, is like a mountain weight here"; and she laid one trembling
hand upon her bosom."I would have the whole world at work.I would
leave no stone unturned; I----"

"What would you do?""Oh, I don't know," she cried, her whole manner suddenly changing;
"nothing, perhaps."Then, before I could reply to this: "Have you seen
Eleanore to-day?"She did not seem satisfied, but waited till her friend left the room
before saying more.Then, with an earnest look, inquired if I knew
whether Eleanore was well."I fear she is not," I returned."It is a great trial to me, Eleanore being away.Not," she resumed,
noting, perhaps, my incredulous look, "that I would have you think I
wish to disclaim my share in bringing about the present unhappy state
of things.I am willing to acknowledge I was the first to propose a
separation.But it is none the easier to bear on that account.""It is not as hard for you as for her," said I.because she is left comparatively poor, while I am
rich--is that what you would say?Ah," she went on, without waiting for
my answer, "would I could persuade Eleanore to share my riches with me!Willingly would I bestow upon her the half I have received; but I fear
she could never be induced to accept so much as a dollar from me.""Under the circumstances it would be better for her not to.""Just what I thought; yet it would ease me of a great weight if she
would.This fortune, suddenly thrown into my lap, sits like an incubus
upon me, Mr.When the will was read to-day which makes me
possessor of so much wealth, I could not but feel that a heavy, blinding
pall had settled upon me, spotted with blood and woven of horrors.Ah,
how different from the feelings with which I have been accustomed to
anticipate this day!Raymond," she went on, with a hurried
gasp, "dreadful as it seems now, I have been reared to look forward to
this hour with pride, if not with actual longing.Money has been made
so much of in my small world.Not that I wish in this evil time of
retribution to lay blame upon any one; least of all upon my uncle; but
from the day, twelve years ago, when for the first time he took us in
his arms, and looking down upon our childish faces, exclaimed: 'The
light-haired one pleases me best; she shall be my heiress,' I have
been petted, cajoled, and spoiled; called little princess, and uncle's
darling, till it is only strange I retain in this prejudiced breast any
of the impulses of generous womanhood; yes, though I was aware from the
first that whim alone had raised this distinction between myself and
cousin; a distinction which superior beauty, worth, or accomplishments
could never have drawn; Eleanore being more than my equal in all these
things."Pausing, she choked back the sudden sob that rose in her
throat, with an effort at self-control which was at once touching and
admirable.Then, while my eyes stole to her face, murmured in a low,
appealing voice: "If I have faults, you see there is some slight excuse
for them; arrogance, vanity, and selfishness being considered in the gay
young heiress as no more than so many assertions of a laudable dignity.ah," she bitterly exclaimed "money alone has been the ruin of us
all!"Then, with a falling of her voice: "And now it has come to me
with its heritage of evil, and I--I would give it all for--But this is
weakness!I have no right to afflict you with my griefs.Pray forget all
I have said, Mr.Raymond, or regard my complaints as the utterances of
an unhappy girl loaded down with sorrows and oppressed by the weight of
many perplexities and terrors.""But I do not wish to forget," I replied."You have spoken some good
words, manifested much noble emotion.Your possessions cannot but prove
a blessing to you if you enter upon them with such feelings as these."But, with a quick gesture, she ejaculated: "Impossible!Then, as if startled at her own words, bit her lip
and hastily added: "Very great wealth is never a blessing."And now," said she, with a total change of manner, "I wish to
address you on a subject which may strike you as ill-timed, but which,
nevertheless, I must mention, if the purpose I have at heart is ever to
be accomplished.My uncle, as you know, was engaged at the time of his
death in writing a book on Chinese customs and prejudices.It was a work
which he was anxious to see published, and naturally I desire to carry
out his wishes; but, in order to do so, I find it necessary not only
to interest myself in the matter now,--Mr.Harwell's services being
required, and it being my wish to dismiss that gentleman as soon as
possible--but to find some one competent to supervise its completion.Now I have heard,--I have been told,--that you were the one of all
others to do this; and though it is difficult if not improper for me to
ask so great a favor of one who but a week ago was a perfect stranger to
me, it would afford me the keenest pleasure if you would consent to look
over this manuscript and tell me what remains to be done."The timidity with which these words were uttered proved her to be in
earnest, and I could not but wonder at the strange coincidence of this
request with my secret wishes; it having been a question with me for
some time how I was to gain free access to this house without in any way
compromising either its inmates or myself.Gryce had been the one to recommend me to her favor in this respect.But, whatever satisfaction I may have experienced, I felt myself in duty
bound to plead my incompetence for a task so entirely out of the line
of my profession, and to suggest the employment of some one better
acquainted with such matters than myself.Harwell has notes and memoranda in plenty," she exclaimed, "and
can give you all the information necessary.You will have no difficulty;
indeed, you will not."He seems to be
a clever and diligent young man.""He thinks he can; but I know uncle never
trusted him with the composition of a single sentence.""But perhaps he will not be pleased,--Mr.Harwell, I mean--with the
intrusion of a stranger into his work.""That makes no difference," she
cried.Harwell is in my pay, and has nothing to say about it.I have already consulted him, and he expresses
himself as satisfied with the arrangement.""Very well," said I; "then I will promise to consider the subject.I
can at any rate look over the manuscript and give you my opinion of its
condition.""Oh, thank you," said she, with the prettiest gesture of satisfaction."How kind you are, and what can I ever do to repay you?and she moved towards the door; but
suddenly paused, whispering, with a short shudder of remembrance: "He is
in the library; do you mind?"Crushing down the sick qualm that arose at the mention of that spot, I
replied in the negative."The papers are all there, and he says he can work better in his old
place than anywhere else; but if you wish, I can call him down."But I would not listen to this, and myself led the way to the foot of
the stairs."I have sometimes thought I would lock up that room," she hurriedly
observed; "but something restrains me.I can no more do so than I can
leave this house; a power beyond myself forces me to confront all its
horrors.Sometimes, in the
darkness of the night--But I will not distress you.I have already said
too much; come," and with a sudden lift of the head she mounted the
stairs.Harwell was seated, when we entered that fatal room, in the one
chair of all others I expected to see unoccupied; and as I beheld his
meagre figure bending where such a little while before his eyes had
encountered the outstretched form of his murdered employer, I could not
but marvel over the unimaginativeness of the man who, in the face of
such memories, could not only appropriate that very spot for his own
use, but pursue his avocations there with so much calmness and evident
precision.But in another moment I discovered that the disposition of
the light in the room made that one seat the only desirable one for his
purpose; and instantly my wonder changed to admiration at this quiet
surrender of personal feeling to the requirements of the occasion.He looked up mechanically as we came in, but did not rise, his
countenance wearing the absorbed expression which bespeaks the
preoccupied mind."He is utterly oblivious," Mary whispered; "that is a way of his.I doubt if he knows who or what it is that has disturbed him."And,
advancing into the room, she passed across his line of vision, as if
to call attention to herself, and said: "I have brought Mr.Raymond
up-stairs to see you, Mr.He has been so kind as to accede to
my wishes in regard to the completion of the manuscript now before you."Harwell rose, wiped his pen, and put it away; manifesting,
however, a reluctance in doing so that proved this interference to be
in reality anything but agreeable to him.Observing this, I did not wait
for him to speak, but took up the pile of manuscript, arranged in one
mass on the table, saying:

"This seems to be very clearly written; if you will excuse me, I will
glance over it and thus learn something of its general character."He bowed, uttered a word or so of acquiescence, then, as Mary left the
room, awkwardly reseated himself, and took up his pen.Instantly the manuscript and all connected with it vanished from my
thoughts; and Eleanore, her situation, and the mystery surrounding
this family, returned upon me with renewed force.Looking the secretary
steadily in the face, I remarked:

"I am very glad of this opportunity of seeing you a moment alone, Mr.Harwell, if only for the purpose of saying----"

"Anything in regard to the murder?""Then you must pardon me," he respectfully but firmly replied."It is
a disagreeable subject which I cannot bear to think of, much less
discuss."Disconcerted and, what was more, convinced of the impossibility of
obtaining any information from this man, I abandoned the attempt; and,
taking up the manuscript once more, endeavored to master in some small
degree the nature of its contents.Succeeding beyond my hopes, I opened
a short conversation with him in regard to it, and finally, coming to
the conclusion I could accomplish what Miss Leavenworth desired, left
him and descended again to the reception room.When, an hour or so later, I withdrew from the house, it was with the
feeling that one obstacle had been removed from my path.If I failed
in what I had undertaken, it would not be from lack of opportunity of
studying the inmates of this dwelling.THE WILL OF A MILLIONAIRE


    "Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
     Which we ascribe to Heaven."THE next morning's _Tribune_ contained a synopsis of Mr.Its provisions were a surprise to me; for, while the bulk of his
immense estate was, according to the general understanding, bequeathed
to his niece, Mary, it appeared by a codicil, attached to his will some
five years before, that Eleanore was not entirely forgotten, she having
been made the recipient of a legacy which, if not large, was at least
sufficient to support her in comfort.After listening to the various
comments of my associates on the subject, I proceeded to the house
of Mr.Gryce, in obedience to his request to call upon him as soon as
possible after the publication of the will."Good-morning," he remarked as I entered, but whether addressing me or
the frowning top of the desk before which he was sitting it would be
difficult to say.nodding with a curious back movement
of his head towards a chair in his rear."I am curious to know," I remarked,
"what you have to say about this will, and its probable effect upon the
matters we have in hand.""What is your own idea in regard to it?""Well, I think upon the whole it will make but little difference in
public opinion.Those who thought Eleanore guilty before will feel that
they possess now greater cause than ever to doubt her innocence; while
those who have hitherto hesitated to suspect her will not consider
that the comparatively small amount bequeathed her would constitute an
adequate motive for so great a crime.""You have heard men talk; what seems to be the general opinion among
those you converse with?""That the motive of the tragedy will be found in the partiality shown in
so singular a will, though how, they do not profess to know."Gryce suddenly became interested in one of the small drawers before
him."And all this has not set you thinking?"I am sure I have
done nothing but think for the last three days.I----"

"Of course--of course," he cried."I didn't mean to say anything
disagreeable."Yes," said I; "Miss Leavenworth has requested me to do her that little
favor."Then, with an instant return to his business-like tone: "You are going
to have opportunities, Mr.Now there are two things I want you
to find out; first, what is the connection between these ladies and Mr.Clavering----"

"There is a connection, then?"And secondly, what is the cause of the unfriendly feeling
which evidently exists between the cousins."I drew back and pondered the position offered me.A spy in a fair
woman's house!How could I reconcile it with my natural instincts as a
gentleman?"Cannot you find some one better adapted to learn these secrets for
you?""The part of a spy is anything but agreeable to
my feelings, I assure you."Leavenworth's
manuscript for the press," I said; "I will give Mr.Clavering an
opportunity to form my acquaintance; and I will listen, if Miss
Leavenworth chooses to make me her confidant in any way.But any
hearkening at doors, surprises, unworthy feints or ungentlemanly
subterfuges, I herewith disclaim as outside of my province; my task
being to find out what I can in an open way, and yours to search into
the nooks and corners of this wretched business.""In other words, you are to play the hound, and I the mole; just so, I
know what belongs to a gentleman.""And now," said I, "what news of Hannah?"I cannot say I was greatly surprised, that evening, when, upon
descending from an hour's labor with Mr.Harwell, I encountered Miss
Leavenworth standing at the foot of the stairs.There had been something
in her bearing, the night before, which prepared me for another
interview this evening, though her manner of commencing it was a
surprise.Raymond," said she, with an air of marked embarrassment,
"I want to ask you a question.I believe you to be a good man, and I
know you will answer me conscientiously.As a brother would," she added,
lifting her eyes for a moment to my face."I know it will sound strange;
but remember, I have no adviser but you, and I must ask some one.Raymond, do you think a person could do something that was very wrong,
and yet grow to be thoroughly good afterwards?""Certainly," I replied; "if he were truly sorry for his fault.""But say it was more than a fault; say it was an actual harm; would not
the memory of that one evil hour cast a lasting shadow over one's life?""That depends upon the nature of the harm and its effect upon others.If one had irreparably injured a fellow-being, it would be hard for a
person of sensitive nature to live a happy life afterwards; though the
fact of not living a happy life ought to be no reason why one should not
live a good life.""But to live a good life would it be necessary to reveal the evil you
had done?Cannot one go on and do right without confessing to the world
a past wrong?""Yes, unless by its confession he can in some way make reparation."Drawing back, she stood for one moment
in a thoughtful attitude before me, her beauty shining with almost a
statuesque splendor in the glow of the porcelain-shaded lamp at her
side.Nor, though she presently roused herself, leading the way into the
drawing-room with a gesture that was allurement itself, did she recur to
this topic again; but rather seemed to strive, in the conversation that
followed, to make me forget what had already passed between us.That she
did not succeed, was owing to my intense and unfailing interest in her
cousin.As I descended the stoop, I saw Thomas, the butler, leaning over the
area gate.Immediately I was seized with an impulse to interrogate him
in regard to a matter which had more or less interested me ever since
the inquest; and that was, who was the Mr.Robbins who had called
upon Eleanore the night of the murder?He remembered such a person called, but could not
describe his looks any further than to say that he was not a small man.THE BEGINNING OF GREAT SURPRISES


    "Vous regardez une etoile pour deux motifs, parce qu'elle est
    lumineuse et parce qu'elle est impenetrable.Vous avez aupres
    de vous un plus doux rayonnement et un pas grand mystere, la femme."AND now followed days in which I seemed to make little or no progress.Clavering, disturbed perhaps by my presence, forsook his usual
haunts, thus depriving me of all opportunity of making his acquaintance
in any natural manner, while the evenings spent at Miss Leavenworth's
were productive of little else than constant suspense and uneasiness.But, in the
course of making such few changes as were necessary, I had ample
opportunity of studying the character of Mr.I found him to be
neither more nor less than an excellent amanuensis.Stiff, unbending,
and sombre, but true to his duty and reliable in its performance, I
learned to respect him, and even to like him; and this, too, though I
saw the liking was not reciprocated, whatever the respect may have been.He never spoke of Eleanore Leavenworth or, indeed, mentioned the family
or its trouble in any way; till I began to feel that all this reticence
had a cause deeper than the nature of the man, and that if he did
speak, it would be to some purpose.This suspicion, of course, kept me
restlessly eager in his presence.I could not forbear giving him sly
glances now and then, to see how he acted when he believed himself
unobserved; but he was ever the same, a passive, diligent, unexcitable
worker.This continual beating against a stone wall, for thus I regarded it,
became at last almost unendurable.Clavering shy, and the secretary
unapproachable--how was I to gain anything?The short interviews I had
with Mary did not help matters.Haughty, constrained, feverish, pettish,
grateful, appealing, everything at once, and never twice the same, I
learned to dread, even while I coveted, an interview.She appeared to be
passing through some crisis which occasioned her the keenest suffering.I have seen her, when she thought herself alone, throw up her hands
with the gesture which we use to ward off a coming evil or shut out some
hideous vision.I have likewise beheld her standing with her proud head
abased, her nervous hands drooping, her whole form sinking and inert, as
if the pressure of a weight she could neither upbear nor cast aside
had robbed her even of the show of resistance.Ordinarily she was at least stately in her trouble.Even when the
softest appeal came into her eyes she stood erect, and retained her
expression of conscious power.Even the night she met me in the hall,
with feverish cheeks and lips trembling with eagerness, only to turn and
fly again without giving utterance to what she had to say, she comported
herself with a fiery dignity that was well nigh imposing.That all this meant something, I was sure; and so I kept my patience
alive with the hope that some day she would make a revelation.Those
quivering lips would not always remain closed; the secret involving
Eleanore's honor and happiness would be divulged by this restless being,
if by no one else.Nor was the memory of that extraordinary, if not
cruel, accusation I had heard her make enough to destroy this hope--for
hope it had grown to be--so that I found myself insensibly shortening
my time with Mr.Harwell in the library, and extending my _tete-a-tete_
visits with Mary in the reception room, till the imperturbable secretary
was forced to complain that he was often left for hours without work.But, as I say, days passed, and a second Monday evening came round
without seeing me any further advanced upon the problem I had set myself
to solve than when I first started upon it two weeks before.The subject
of the murder had not even been broached; nor was Hannah spoken of,
though I observed the papers were not allowed to languish an instant
upon the stoop; mistress and servants betraying equal interest in their
contents.It was as if you saw a group of
human beings eating, drinking, and sleeping upon the sides of a volcano
hot with a late eruption and trembling with the birth of a new one.I
longed to break this silence as we shiver glass: by shouting the name
of Eleanore through those gilded rooms and satin-draped vestibules.But
this Monday evening I was in a calmer mood.I was determined to expect
nothing from my visits to Mary Leavenworth's house; and entered it upon
the eve in question with an equanimity such as I had not experienced
since the first day I passed under its unhappy portals.But when, upon nearing the reception room, I saw Mary pacing the floor
with the air of one who is restlessly awaiting something or somebody,
I took a sudden resolution, and, advancing towards her, said: "Do I see
you alone, Miss Leavenworth?"She paused in her hurried action, blushed and bowed, but, contrary to
her usual custom, did not bid me enter."Will it be too great an intrusion on my part, if I venture to come in?"Her glance flashed uneasily to the clock, and she seemed about to excuse
herself, but suddenly yielded, and, drawing up a chair before the fire,
motioned me towards it.Though she endeavored to appear calm, I vaguely
felt I had chanced upon her in one of her most agitated moods, and that
I had only to broach the subject I had in mind to behold her haughtiness
disappear before me like melting snow.I also felt that I had but few
moments in which to do it."Miss Leavenworth," said I, "in obtruding upon you to-night, I have a
purpose other than that of giving myself a pleasure.Instantly I saw that in some way I had started wrong.she asked, breathing coldness from every feature of her face."Yes," I went on, with passionate recklessness."Balked in every other
endeavor to learn the truth, I have come to you, whom I believe to be
noble at the core, for that help which seems likely to fail us in every
other direction: for the word which, if it does not absolutely save your
cousin, will at least put us upon the track of what will.""I do not understand what you mean," she protested, slightly shrinking."Miss Leavenworth," I pursued, "it is needless for me to tell you in
what position your cousin stands.You, who remember both the form and
drift of the questions put to her at the inquest, comprehend it all
without any explanation from me.But what you may not know is this, that
unless she is speedily relieved from the suspicion which, justly or not,
has attached itself to her name, the consequences which such suspicion
entails must fall upon her, and----"

"Good God!"she cried; "you do not mean she will be----"

"Subject to arrest?Shame, horror, and anguish were in every line of her
white face."Why," she cried, flushing painfully; "I cannot say; didn't you tell
me?"No, I did
not, either," she avowed, in a sudden burst of shame and penitence."I
knew it was a secret; but--oh, Mr.Raymond, it was Eleanore herself who
told me.""Yes, that last evening she was here; we were together in the
drawing-room.""That the key to the library had been seen in her possession."Eleanore, conscious of the
suspicion with which her cousin regarded her, inform that cousin of a
fact calculated to add weight to that suspicion?"I have revealed nothing I ought to
have kept secret?""No," said I; "and, Miss Leavenworth, it is this thing which makes
your cousin's position absolutely dangerous.It is a fact that,
left unexplained, must ever link her name with infamy; a bit of
circumstantial evidence no sophistry can smother, and no denial
obliterate.Only her hitherto spotless reputation, and the efforts of
one who, notwithstanding appearances, believes in her innocence, keeps
her so long from the clutch of the officers of justice.That key, and
the silence preserved by her in regard to it, is sinking her slowly into
a pit from which the utmost endeavors of her best friends will soon be
inadequate to extricate her.""And you tell me this----"

"That you may have pity on the poor girl, who will not have pity on
herself, and by the explanation of a few circumstances, which cannot be
mysteries to you, assist in bringing her from under the dreadful shadow
that threatens to overwhelm her.""And would you insinuate, sir," she cried, turning upon me with a look
of great anger, "that I know any more than you do of this matter?that
I possess any knowledge which I have not already made public concerning
the dreadful tragedy which has transformed our home into a desert, our
existence into a lasting horror?Has the blight of suspicion fallen upon
me, too; and have you come to accuse me in my own house----"

"Miss Leavenworth," I entreated; "calm yourself.I only desire you to enlighten me as to your cousin's probable
motive for this criminating silence.You
are her cousin, almost her sister, have been at all events her daily
companion for years, and must know for whom or for what she seals her
lips, and conceals facts which, if known, would direct suspicion to the
real criminal--that is, if you really believe what you have hitherto
stated, that your cousin is an innocent woman."She not making any answer to this, I rose and confronted her."Miss
Leavenworth, do you believe your cousin guiltless of this crime, or
not?"my God; if all the world were only as innocent
as she!""Then," said I, "you must likewise believe that if she refrains from
speaking in regard to matters which to ordinary observers ought to be
explained, she does it only from motives of kindness towards one less
guiltless than herself."No, no; I do not say that.What made you think of any such
explanation?"With one of Eleanore's character, such conduct
as hers admits of no other construction.Either she is mad, or she is
shielding another at the expense of herself."Mary's lip, which had trembled, slowly steadied itself."And whom
have you settled upon, as the person for whom Eleanore thus sacrifices
herself?""Ah," said I, "there is where I seek assistance from you.With your
knowledge of her history----"

But Mary Leavenworth, sinking haughtily back into her chair, stopped
me with a quiet gesture."I beg your pardon," said she; "but you make a
mistake.I know little or nothing of Eleanore's personal feelings.The
mystery must be solved by some one besides me.""When Eleanore confessed to you that the missing key had been seen in
her possession, did she likewise inform you where she obtained it, and
for what reason she was hiding it?""Merely told you the fact, without any explanation?""Was not that a strange piece of gratuitous information for her to
give one who, but a few hours before, had accused her to the face of
committing a deadly crime?""You will not deny that you were once, not only ready to believe her
guilty, but that you actually charged her with having perpetrated this
crime.""Miss Leavenworth, do you not remember what you said in that room
upstairs, when you were alone with your cousin on the morning of the
inquest, just before Mr.Her eyes did not fall, but they filled with sudden terror.I was just outside the door, and----"

"What did you hear?"It seemed as if her eyes would devour my face."Yet nothing was said
when you came in?""You, however, have never forgotten it?""How could we, Miss Leavenworth?"Her head fell forward in her hands, and for one wild moment she seemed
lost in despair.Then she roused, and desperately exclaimed:

"And that is why you come here to-night.With that sentence written upon
your heart, you invade my presence, torture me with questions----"

"Pardon me," I broke in; "are my questions such as you, with reasonable
regard for the honor of one with whom you are accustomed to associate,
should hesitate to answer?Do I derogate from my manhood in asking you
how and why you came to make an accusation of so grave a nature, at a
time when all the circumstances of the case were freshly before you,
only to insist fully as strongly upon your cousin's innocence when
you found there was even more cause for your imputation than you had
supposed?""Miss Leavenworth," said I, rising, and taking my stand before her;
"although there is a temporary estrangement between you and your cousin,
you cannot wish to seem her enemy.Speak, then; let me at least know the
name of him for whom she thus immolates herself.A hint from you----"

But rising, with a strange look, to her feet, she interrupted me with a
stern remark: "If you do not know, I cannot inform you; do not ask me,
Mr.And she glanced at the clock for the second time."Miss Leavenworth, you once asked me if a person who had committed a
wrong ought necessarily to confess it; and I replied no, unless by the
confession reparation could be made.Her lips moved, but no words issued from them."I begin to think," I solemnly proceeded, following the lead of her
emotion, "that confession is the only way out of this difficulty: that
only by the words you can utter Eleanore can be saved from the doom that
awaits her.Will you not then show yourself a true woman by responding
to my earnest entreaties?"I seemed to have touched the right chord; for she trembled, and a look
of wistfulness filled her eyes.Eleanore
persists in silence; but that is no reason why you should emulate her
example.You only make her position more doubtful by it.""I know it; but I cannot help myself.Fate has too strong a hold upon
me; I cannot break away."Any one can escape from bonds imaginary as yours.""No, no," she protested; "you do not understand.""I understand this: that the path of rectitude is a straight one, and
that he who steps into devious byways is going astray."A flicker of light, pathetic beyond description, flashed for a moment
across her face; her throat rose as with one wild sob; her lips opened;
she seemed yielding, when--A sharp ring at the front door-bell!"Oh," she cried, sharply turning, "tell him I cannot see him; tell
him----"

"Miss Leavenworth," said I, taking her by both hands, "never mind the
door; never mind anything but this.I have asked you a question which
involves the mystery of this whole affair; answer me, then, for your
soul's sake; tell me, what the unhappy circumstances were which could
induce you--"

But she tore her hands from mine.she cried; "it will open,
and--"

Stepping into the hall, I met Thomas coming up the basement stairs."Go
back," said I; "I will call you when you are wanted.""You expect me to answer," she exclaimed, when I re-entered, "now, in a
moment?"But----"

"Impossible!""I fear the time will never come, if you do not speak now.""You may open the door now,"
said I, and moved to return to her side.But, with a gesture of command, she pointed up-stairs.and
her glance passed on to Thomas, who stopped where he was."I will see you again before I go," said I, and hastened up-stairs.I heard a rich,
tremulous voice inquire."Yes, sir," came in the butler's most respectful and measured accents,
and, leaning over the banisters I beheld, to my amazement, the form of
Mr.Clavering enter the front hall and move towards the reception room.ON THE STAIRS


    "You cannot _say_ I did it."EXCITED, tremulous, filled with wonder at this unlooked-for event, I
paused for a moment to collect my scattered senses, when the sound of
a low, monotonous voice breaking upon my ear from the direction of the
library, I approached and found Mr.Harwell reading aloud from his late
employer's manuscript.It would be difficult for me to describe the
effect which this simple discovery made upon me at this time.There,
in that room of late death, withdrawn from the turmoil of the world, a
hermit in his skeleton-lined cell, this man employed himself in reading
and rereading, with passive interest, the words of the dead, while above
and below, human beings agonized in doubt and shame.Listening, I heard
these words:

"By these means their native rulers will not only lose their jealous
terror of our institutions, but acquire an actual curiosity in regard to
them."you are late, sir," was the greeting with which he rose and brought
forward a chair.My reply was probably inaudible, for he added, as he passed to his own
seat:

"I am afraid you are not well."And, pulling the papers towards me, I began looking them
over.But the words danced before my eyes, and I was obliged to give up
all attempt at work for that night."_I_ fear I am unable to assist you this evening, Mr.The fact
is, I find it difficult to give proper attention to this business while
the man who by a dastardly assassination has made it necessary goes
unpunished."The secretary in his turn pushed the papers aside, as if moved by a
sudden distaste of them, but gave me no answer."You told me, when you first came to me with news of this fearful
tragedy, that it was a mystery; but it is one which must be solved,
Mr.Harwell; it is wearing out the lives of too many whom we love and
respect.""And Miss Mary," I went on; "myself, you, and many others.""You have manifested much interest in the matter from the
beginning,"--he said, methodically dipping his pen into the ink."And you," said I; "do you take no interest in that which involves not
only the safety, but the happiness and honor, of the family in which you
have dwelt so long?""I have no wish to discuss
this subject.I believe I have before prayed you to spare me its
introduction.""But I cannot consider your wishes in this regard," I persisted."If you
know any facts, connected with this affair, which have not yet been made
public, it is manifestly your duty to state them.The position which
Miss Eleanore occupies at this time is one which should arouse the sense
of justice in every true breast; and if you----"

"If I knew anything which would serve to release her from her unhappy
position, Mr.Raymond, I should have spoken long ago."I bit my lip, weary of these continual bafflings, and rose also."If you have nothing more to say," he went on, "and feel utterly
disinclined to work, why, I should be glad to excuse myself, as I have
an engagement out.""Do not let me keep you," I said, bitterly.He turned upon me with a short stare, as if this display of feeling
was well nigh incomprehensible to him; and then, with a quiet, almost
compassionate bow left the room.I heard him go up-stairs, felt the
jar when his room door closed, and sat down to enjoy my solitude.But
solitude in that room was unbearable.Harwell again
descended, I felt I could remain no longer, and, stepping into the hall,
told him that if he had no objection I would accompany him for a short
stroll.He bowed a stiff assent, and hastened before me down the stairs.By the
time I had closed the library door, he was half-way to the foot, and I
was just remarking to myself upon the unpliability of his figure and the
awkwardness of his carriage, as seen from my present standpoint, when
suddenly I saw him stop, clutch the banister at his side, and hang there
with a startled, deathly expression upon his half-turned countenance,
which fixed me for an instant where I was in breathless astonishment,
and then caused me to rush down to his side, catch him by the arm, and
cry:

"What is it?But, thrusting out his hand, he pushed me upwards.he
whispered, in a voice shaking with intensest emotion, "go back."And
catching me by the arm, he literally pulled me up the stairs.Arrived
at the top, he loosened his grasp, and leaning, quivering from head to
foot, over the banisters, glared below.Startled in my turn, I bent beside him, and saw Henry Clavering come out
of the reception room and cross the hall.Clavering," I whispered, with all the self-possession I
could muster; "do you know him?""Clavering, Clavering,"
he murmured with quaking lips; then, suddenly bounding forward, clutched
the railing before him, and fixing me with his eyes, from which all the
stoic calmness had gone down forever in flame and frenzy, gurgled into
my ear: "You want to know who the assassin of Mr.Look there, then: that is the man, Clavering!"And with a leap, he
bounded from my side, and, swaying like a drunken man, disappeared from
my gaze in the hall above.Rushing upstairs, I knocked at the
door of his room, but no response came to my summons.I then called
his name in the hall, but without avail; he was determined not to show
himself.Resolved that he should not thus escape me, I returned to the
library, and wrote him a short note, in which I asked for an explanation
of his tremendous accusation, saying I would be in my rooms the next
evening at six, when I should expect to see him.This done I descended
to rejoin Mary.But the evening was destined to be full of disappointments.She had
retired to her room while I was in the library, and I lost the interview
from which I expected so much."The woman is slippery as an eel," I
inwardly commented, pacing the hall in my chagrin."Wrapped in mystery,
she expects me to feel for her the respect due to one of frank and open
nature."I was about to leave the house, when I saw Thomas descending the stairs
with a letter in his hand."Miss Leavenworth's compliments, sir, and she is too fatigued to remain
below this evening."I moved aside to read the note he handed me, feeling a little
conscience-stricken as I traced the hurried, trembling handwriting
through the following words:


    "You ask more than I can give.Matters must be received as they are
    without explanation from me.It is the grief of my life to deny you;
    but I have no choice.God forgive us all and keep us from despair.And below:


    "As we cannot meet now without embarrassment, it is better we should
    bear our burdens in silence and apart.As I was crossing Thirty-second Street, I heard a quick footstep behind
me, and turning, saw Thomas at my side."Excuse me, sir," said he, "but
I have something a little particular to say to you.When you asked me
the other night what sort of a person the gentleman was who called
on Miss Eleanore the evening of the murder, I didn't answer you as I
should.The fact is, the detectives had been talking to me about that
very thing, and I felt shy; but, sir, I know you are a friend of the
family, and I want to tell you now that that same gentleman, whoever
he was,--Mr.Robbins, he called himself then,--was at the house again
tonight, sir, and the name he gave me this time to carry to Miss
Leavenworth was Clavering.Yes, sir," he went on, seeing me start; "and,
as I told Molly, he acts queer for a stranger.When he came the other
night, he hesitated a long time before asking for Miss Eleanore, and
when I wanted his name, took out a card and wrote on it the one I told
you of, sir, with a look on his face a little peculiar for a caller;
besides----"

"Well?"Raymond," the butler went on, in a low, excited voice, edging up
very closely to me in the darkness."There is something I have never
told any living being but Molly, sir, which may be of use to those as
wishes to find out who committed this murder.""A fact, sir; which I beg your pardon for troubling you with at this
time; but Molly will give me no rest unless I speak of it to you or Mr.Gryce; her feelings being so worked up on Hannah's account, whom we all
know is innocent, though folks do dare to say as how she must be guilty
just because she is not to be found the minute they want her."Gryce," he resumed,
unconscious of my anxiety, "but I have my fears of detectives, sir; they
catch you up so quick at times, and seem to think you know so much more
than you really do.""But this fact," I again broke in."O yes, sir; the fact is, that that night, the one of the murder you
know, I saw Mr.Clavering, Robbins, or whatever his name is, enter the
house, but neither I nor any one else saw him go out of it; nor do I
know that he _did."_

"What do you mean?""Well, sir, what I mean is this.When I came down from Miss Eleanore and
told Mr.Robbins, as he called himself at that time, that my mistress
was ill and unable to see him (the word she gave me, sir, to deliver)
Mr.Robbins, instead of bowing and leaving the house like a gentleman,
stepped into the reception room and sat down.He may have felt sick, he
looked pale enough; at any rate, he asked me for a glass of water.Not knowing any reason then for suspicionating any one's actions, I
immediately went down to the kitchen for it, leaving him there in the
reception room alone.But before I could get it, I heard the front door
close.said Molly, who was helping me, sir.'I don't
know,' said I, 'unless it's the gentleman has got tired of waiting and
gone.''If he's gone, he won't want the water,' she said.So down I set
the pitcher, and up-stairs I come; and sure enough he was gone, or so
I thought then.But who knows, sir, if he was not in that room or the
drawing-room, which was dark that night, all the time I was a-shutting
up of the house?"I made no reply to this; I was more startled than I cared to reveal."You see, sir, I wouldn't speak of such a thing about any person that
comes to see the young ladies; but we all know some one who was in the
house that night murdered my master, and as it was not Hannah----"

"You say that Miss Eleanore refused to see him," I interrupted, in the
hope that the simple suggestion would be enough to elicitate further
details of his interview with Eleanore.When she first looked at the card, she showed a little
hesitation; but in a moment she grew very flushed in the face, and bade
me say what I told you.I should never have thought of it again if I had
not seen him come blazoning and bold into the house this evening, with
a new name on his tongue.Indeed, and I do not like to think any evil of
him now; but Molly would have it I should speak to you, sir, and ease my
mind,--and that is all, sir."When I arrived home that night, I entered into my memorandum-book a
new list of suspicious circumstances, but this time they were under the
caption "C" instead of "E."IN MY OFFICE


    "Something between an hindrance and a help."THE next day as, with nerves unstrung and an exhausted brain, I entered
my office, I was greeted by the announcement:

"A gentleman, sir, in your private room--been waiting some time, very
impatient."Weary, in no mood to hold consultation with clients new or old, I
advanced with anything but an eager step towards my room, when, upon
opening the door, I saw--Mr.Too much astounded for the moment to speak, I bowed to him silently,
whereupon he approached me with the air and dignity of a highly bred
gentleman, and presented his card, on which I saw written, in free and
handsome characters, his whole name, Henry Ritchie Clavering.After this
introduction of himself, he apologized for making so unceremonious
a call, saying, in excuse, that he was a stranger in town; that his
business was one of great urgency; that he had casually heard honorable
mention of me as a lawyer and a gentleman, and so had ventured to seek
this interview on behalf of a friend who was so unfortunately situated
as to require the opinion and advice of a lawyer upon a question which
not only involved an extraordinary state of facts, but was of a nature
peculiarly embarrassing to him, owing to his ignorance of American laws,
and the legal bearing of these facts upon the same.Having thus secured my attention, and awakened my curiosity, he asked me
if I would permit him to relate his story.Recovering in a measure from
my astonishment, and subduing the extreme repulsion, almost horror,
I felt for the man, I signified my assent; at which he drew from his
pocket a memorandum-book from which he read in substance as follows:

"An Englishman travelling in this country meets, at a fashionable
watering-place, an American girl, with whom he falls deeply in love, and
whom, after a few days, he desires to marry.Knowing his position to be
good, his fortune ample, and his intentions highly honorable, he offers
her his hand, and is accepted.But a decided opposition arising in the
family to the match, he is compelled to disguise his sentiments, though
the engagement remained unbroken.While matters were in this uncertain
condition, he received advices from England demanding his instant
return, and, alarmed at the prospect of a protracted absence from the
object of his affections, he writes to the lady, informing her of
the circumstances, and proposing a secret marriage.She consents with
stipulations; the first of which is, that he should leave her instantly
upon the conclusion of the ceremony, and the second, that he should
intrust the public declaration of the marriage to her.It was not
precisely what he wished, but anything which served to make her his
own was acceptable at such a crisis.He readily enters into the plans
proposed.Meeting the lady at a parsonage, some twenty miles from the
watering-place at which she was staying, he stands up with her before
a Methodist preacher, and the ceremony of marriage is performed.There
were two witnesses, a hired man of the minister, called in for the
purpose, and a lady friend who came with the bride; but there was no
license, and the bride had not completed her twenty-first year.If the lady, wedded in good faith upon that day by
my friend, chooses to deny that she is his lawful wife, can he hold
her to a compact entered into in so informal a manner?Raymond, is my friend the lawful husband of that girl or not?"While listening to this story, I found myself yielding to feelings
greatly in contrast to those with which I greeted the relator but a
moment before.I became so interested in his "friend's" case as to
quite forget, for the time being, that I had ever seen or heard of Henry
Clavering; and after learning that the marriage ceremony took place in
the State of New York, I replied to him, as near as I can remember, in
the following words:

"In this State, and I believe it to be American law, marriage is a
civil contract, requiring neither license, priest, ceremony, nor
certificate--and in some cases witnesses are not even necessary to give
it validity.Of old, the modes of getting a wife were the same as those
of acquiring any other species of property, and they are not materially
changed at the present time.It is enough that the man and woman say to
each other, 'From this time we are married,' or, 'You are now my wife,'
or,'my husband,' as the case may be.The mutual consent is all that is
necessary.In fact, you may contract marriage as you contract to lend a
sum of money, or to buy the merest trifle.""Then your opinion is----"

"That upon your statement, your friend is the lawful husband of the lady
in question; presuming, of course, that no legal disabilities of either
party existed to prevent such a union.As to the young lady's age, I
will merely say that any fourteen-year-old girl can be a party to a
marriage contract."Clavering bowed, his countenance assuming a look of great
satisfaction."I am very glad to hear this," said he; "my friend's
happiness is entirely involved in the establishment of his marriage."He appeared so relieved, my curiosity was yet further aroused.I
therefore said: "I have given you my opinion as to the legality of this
marriage; but it may be quite another thing to prove it, should the same
be contested."He started, cast me an inquiring look, and murmured:

"True.""Allow me to ask you a few questions.Was the lady married under her own
name?""Properly signed by the minister and witnesses?""I cannot say; but I presume she did.""The witnesses were----"

"A hired man of the minister----"

"Who can be found?""The minister is dead, the man has disappeared.""The other witness, the lady friend, where is she?""She can be found; but her action is not to be depended upon.""Has the gentleman himself no proofs of this marriage?""He cannot even prove he was in the town
where it took place on that particular day.""The marriage certificate was, however, filed with the clerk of the
town?"I only know that my friend has made inquiry, and that no
such paper is to be found.""I do not wonder your friend is
concerned in regard to his position, if what you hint is true, and the
lady seems disposed to deny that any such ceremony ever took place.Still, if he wishes to go to law, the Court may decide in his favor,
though I doubt it.His sworn word is all he would have to go upon, and
if she contradicts his testimony under oath, why the sympathy of a jury
is, as a rule, with the woman."Clavering rose, looked at me with some earnestness, and finally
asked, in a tone which, though somewhat changed, lacked nothing of its
former suavity, if I would be kind enough to give him in writing that
portion of my opinion which directly bore upon the legality of the
marriage; that such a paper would go far towards satisfying his friend
that his case had been properly presented; as he was aware that no
respectable lawyer would put his name to a legal opinion without first
having carefully arrived at his conclusions by a thorough examination of
the law bearing upon the facts submitted.This request seeming so reasonable, I unhesitatingly complied with it,
and handed him the opinion.He took it, and, after reading it carefully
over, deliberately copied it into his memorandum-book.This done, he
turned towards me, a strong, though hitherto subdued, emotion showing
itself in his countenance."Now, sir," said he, rising upon me to the full height of his majestic
figure, "I have but one more request to make; and that is, that you will
receive back this opinion into your own possession, and in the day you
think to lead a beautiful woman to the altar, pause and ask yourself:
'Am I sure that the hand I clasp with such impassioned fervor is free?Have I any certainty for knowing that it has not already been given
away, like that of the lady whom, in this opinion of mine, I have
declared to be a wedded wife according to the laws of my country? '"But he, with an urbane bow, laid his hand upon the knob of the door."I
thank you for your courtesy, Mr.Raymond, and I bid you good-day.I hope
you will have no need of consulting that paper before I see you again."It was the most vital shock I had yet experienced; and for a moment
I stood paralyzed.Why should he mix me up with the affair
unless--but I would not contemplate that possibility.Eleanore married,
and to this man?And yet I found myself
continually turning the supposition over in my mind until, to escape
the torment of my own conjectures, I seized my hat, and rushed into
the street in the hope of finding him again and extorting from him an
explanation of his mysterious conduct.But by the time I reached the
sidewalk, he was nowhere to be seen.A thousand busy men, with their
various cares and purposes, had pushed themselves between us, and I was
obliged to return to my office with my doubts unsolved.I think I never experienced a longer day; but it passed, and at five
o'clock I had the satisfaction of inquiring for Mr.Clavering at the
Hoffman House.Judge of my surprise when I learned that his visit to
my office was his last action before taking passage upon the steamer
leaving that day for Liverpool; that he was now on the high seas, and
all chance of another interview with him was at an end.I could scarcely
believe the fact at first; but after a talk with the cabman who
had driven him off to my office and thence to the steamer, I became
convinced.I had been brought face to
face with the accused man, had received an intimation from him that he
was not expecting to see me again for some time, and had weakly gone on
attending to my own affairs and allowed him to escape, like the simple
tyro that I was.My next, the necessity of notifying Mr.But it was now six o'clock, the hour set apart for my
interview with Mr.I could not afford to miss that, so merely
stopping to despatch a line to Mr.Gryce, in which I promised to visit
him that evening, I turned my steps towards home."Often do the spirits
    Of great events stride on before the events,
    And in to-day already walks to-morrow."What revelations might not this man
be going to make!But I subdued the feeling; and, greeting him with what
cordiality I could, settled myself to listen to his explanations.But Trueman Harwell had no explanations to give, or so it seemed; on
the contrary, he had come to apologize for the very violent words he had
used the evening before; words which, whatever their effect upon me, he
now felt bound to declare had been used without sufficient basis in fact
to make their utterance of the least importance."But you must have thought you had grounds for so tremendous an
accusation, or your act was that of a madman."His brow wrinkled heavily, and his eyes assumed a very gloomy
expression."Under the pressure of
surprise, I have known men utter convictions no better founded than mine
without running the risk of being called mad."Clavering's face or form must, then, have been known to
you.The mere fact of seeing a strange gentleman in the hall would have
been insufficient to cause you astonishment, Mr.He uneasily fingered the back of the chair before which he stood, but
made no reply."Sit down," I again urged, this time with a touch of command in my
voice."This is a serious matter, and I intend to deal with it as it
deserves.You once said that if you knew anything which might serve
to exonerate Eleanore Leavenworth from the suspicion under which she
stands, you would be ready to impart it."I said that if I had ever known anything calculated to
release her from her unhappy position, I would have spoken," he coldly
corrected.You know, and I know, that you are keeping something
back; and I ask you, in her behalf, and in the cause of justice, to tell
me what it is.""You are mistaken," was his dogged reply."I have reasons, perhaps, for
certain conclusions I may have drawn; but my conscience will not allow
me in cold blood to give utterance to suspicions which may not only
damage the reputation of an honest man, but place me in the unpleasant
position of an accuser without substantial foundation for my
accusations.""You occupy that position already," I retorted, with equal coldness."Nothing can make me forget that in my presence you have denounced Henry
Clavering as the murderer of Mr.You had better explain
yourself, Mr.He gave me a short look, but moved around and took the chair."You have
me at a disadvantage," he said, in a lighter tone."If you choose to
profit by your position, and press me to disclose the little I know, I
can only regret the necessity under which I lie, and speak.""Then you are deterred by conscientious scruples alone?""Yes, and by the meagreness of the facts at my command.""I will judge of the facts when I have heard them."He raised his eyes to mine, and I was astonished to observe a strange
eagerness in their depths; evidently his convictions were stronger
than his scruples.Raymond," he began, "you are a lawyer, and
undoubtedly a practical man; but you may know what it is to scent danger
before you see it, to feel influences working in the air over and
about you, and yet be in ignorance of what it is that affects you so
powerfully, till chance reveals that an enemy has been at your side, or
a friend passed your window, or the shadow of death crossed your book as
you read, or mingled with your breath as you slept?"I shook my head, fascinated by the intensity of his gaze into some sort
of response."Then you cannot understand me, or what I have suffered these last three
weeks."And he drew back with an icy reserve that seemed to promise but
little to my now thoroughly awakened curiosity."I beg your pardon," I hastened to say; "but the fact of my never having
experienced such sensations does not hinder me from comprehending the
emotions of others more affected by spiritual influences than myself.""Then you will not ridicule me if I say
that upon the eve of Mr.Leavenworth's murder I experienced in a dream
all that afterwards occurred; saw him murdered, saw"--and he clasped
his hands before him, in an attitude inexpressibly convincing, while his
voice sank to a horrified whisper, "saw the face of his murderer!"I started, looked at him in amazement, a thrill as at a ghostly presence
running through me."My reason for denouncing the man I beheld before me in the hall of
Miss Leavenworth's house last night?And, taking out his
handkerchief, he wiped his forehead, on which the perspiration was
standing in large drops."You would then intimate that the face you saw in your dream and the
face you saw in the hall last night were the same?"I had gone to bed
feeling especially contented with myself and the world at large; for,
though my life is anything but a happy one," and he heaved a short sigh,
"some pleasant words had been said to me that day, and I was revelling
in the happiness they conferred, when suddenly a chill struck my heart,
and the darkness which a moment before had appeared to me as the abode
of peace thrilled to the sound of a supernatural cry, and I heard my
name, 'Trueman, Trueman, Trueman,' repeated three times in a voice I did
not recognize, and starting from my pillow beheld at my bedside a woman.Her face was strange to me," he solemnly proceeded, "but I can give you
each and every detail of it, as, bending above me, she stared into my
eyes with a growing terror that seemed to implore help, though her lips
were quiet, and only the memory of that cry echoed in my ears.""Describe the face," I interposed."It was a round, fair, lady's face.Very lovely in contour, but devoid
of coloring; not beautiful, but winning from its childlike look of
trust.The hair, banded upon the low, broad forehead, was brown; the
eyes, which were very far apart, gray; the mouth, which was its most
charming feature, delicate of make and very expressive.There was
a dimple in the chin, but none in the cheeks.It was a face to be
remembered.""Meeting the gaze of those imploring eyes, I started up.Instantly the
face and all vanished, and I became conscious, as we sometimes do in
dreams, of a certain movement in the hall below, and the next instant
the gliding figure of a man of imposing size entered the library.I remember experiencing a certain thrill at this, half terror, half
curiosity, though I seemed to know, as if by intuition, what he was
going to do.Strange to say, I now seemed to change my personality,
and to be no longer a third party watching these proceedings, but Mr.Leavenworth himself, sitting at his library table and feeling his doom
crawling upon him without capacity for speech or power of movement to
avert it.Though my back was towards the man, I could feel his stealthy
form traverse the passage, enter the room beyond, pass to that stand
where the pistol was, try the drawer, find it locked, turn the key,
procure the pistol, weigh it in an accustomed hand, and advance again.I could feel each footstep he took as though his feet were in truth upon
my heart, and I remember staring at the table before me as if I expected
every moment to see it run with my own blood.I can see now how the
letters I had been writing danced upon the paper before me, appearing
to my eyes to take the phantom shapes of persons and things long ago
forgotten; crowding my last moments with regrets and dead shames, wild
longings, and unspeakable agonies, through all of which that face, the
face of my former dream, mingled, pale, sweet, and searching, while
closer and closer behind me crept that noiseless foot till I could
feel the glaring of the assassin's eyes across the narrow threshold
separating me from death and hear the click of his teeth as he set his
lips for the final act.and the secretary's livid face showed the
touch of awful horror, "what words can describe such an experience as
that?In one moment, all the agonies of hell in the heart and brain,
the next a blank through which I seemed to see afar, and as if suddenly
removed from all this, a crouching figure looking at its work with
starting eyes and pallid back-drawn lips; and seeing, recognize no face
that I had ever known, but one so handsome, so remarkable, so unique in
its formation and character, that it would be as easy for me to mistake
the countenance of my father as the look and figure of the man revealed
to me in my dream."said I, in a voice I failed to recognize as my own."Was that of him whom we saw leave Mary Leavenworth's presence last
night and go down the hall to the front door."A PREJUDICE


    "True, I talk of dreams,
     Which are the children of an idle brain
     Begot of nothing but vain phantasy."FOR one moment I sat a prey to superstitious horror; then, my natural
incredulity asserting itself, I looked up and remarked:

"You say that all this took place the night previous to the actual
occurrence?""But you did not seem to take it as such?""No; I am subject to horrible dreams.I thought but little of it in a
superstitious way till I looked next day upon Mr."I do not wonder you behaved strangely at the inquest.""Ah, sir," he returned, with a slow, sad smile; "no one knows what
I suffered in my endeavors not to tell more than I actually knew,
irrespective of my dream, of this murder and the manner of its
accomplishment.""You believe, then, that your dream foreshadowed the manner of the
murder as well as the fact?""It is a pity it did not go a little further, then, and tell us how
the assassin escaped from, if not how he entered, a house so securely
fastened.""That would have been convenient," he repeated."Also, if I had been informed where Hannah was, and why a stranger and a
gentleman should have stooped to the committal of such a crime."Seeing that he was nettled, I dropped my bantering vein.I asked; "are you so well acquainted with all who visit
that house as to be able to say who are and who are not strangers to the
family?"I am well acquainted with the faces of their friends, and Henry
Clavering is not amongst the number; but----"

"Were you ever with Mr.Leavenworth," I interrupted, "when he has been
away from home; in the country, for instance, or upon his travels?""Yet I suppose he was in the habit of absenting himself from home?""Can you tell me where he was last July, he and the ladies?""Yes, sir; they went to R----.Ah,"
he cried, seeing a change in my face, "do you think he could have met
them there?"I looked at him for a moment, then, rising in my turn, stood level with
him, and exclaimed:

"You are keeping something back, Mr.Harwell; you have more knowledge of
this man than you have hitherto given me to understand.He seemed astonished at my penetration, but replied: "I know no more
of the man than I have already informed you; but"--and a burning flush
crossed his face, "if you are determined to pursue this matter--" and he
paused, with an inquiring look."I am resolved to find out all I can about Henry Clavering," was my
decided answer."Then," said he, "I can tell you this much.Henry Clavering wrote a
letter to Mr.Leavenworth a few days before the murder, which I have
some reason to believe produced a marked effect upon the household."And, folding his arms, the secretary stood quietly awaiting my next
question.Leavenworth's
business letters, and this, being from one unaccustomed to write to him,
lacked the mark which usually distinguished those of a private nature.""And you saw the name of Clavering?""I did; Henry Ritchie Clavering."Harwell," I reiterated, "this is no time for false delicacy."I did; but hastily, and with an agitated conscience.""You can, however, recall its general drift?""It was some complaint in regard to the treatment received by him at the
hand of one of Mr."But you inferred----"

"No, sir; that is just what I did not do.I forced myself to forget the
whole thing.""And yet you say it produced an effect upon the family?"None of them have ever appeared quite the
same as before."Harwell," I gravely continued; "when you were questioned as to the
receipt of any letter by Mr.Leavenworth, which might seem in any manner
to be connected with this tragedy, you denied having seen any such; how
was that?"Raymond, you are a gentleman; have a chivalrous regard for the
ladies; do you think you could have brought yourself (even if in your
secret heart you considered some such result possible, which I am not
ready to say I did) to mention, at such a time as that, the receipt of
a letter complaining of the treatment received from one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, as a suspicious circumstance worthy to be taken
into account by a coroner's jury?""What reason had I for thinking that letter was one of importance?I
knew of no Henry Ritchie Clavering.""And yet you seemed to think it was."It is true; but not as I should hesitate now, if the question were put
to me again."Silence followed these words, during which I took two or three turns up
and down the room."This is all very fanciful," I remarked, laughing in the vain endeavor
to throw off the superstitious horror his words had awakened."I am practical myself
in broad daylight, and recognize the flimsiness of an accusation based
upon a poor, hardworking secretary's dream, as plainly as you do.This
is the reason I desired to keep from speaking at all; but, Mr.Raymond,"
and his long, thin hand fell upon my arm with a nervous intensity which
gave me almost the sensation of an electrical shock, "if the murderer of
Mr.Leavenworth is ever brought to confess his deed, mark my words, he
will prove to be the man of my dream."For a moment his belief was mine; and a mingled
sensation of relief and exquisite pain swept over me as I thought of the
possibility of Eleanore being exonerated from crime only to be plunged
into fresh humiliation and deeper abysses of suffering."He stalks the streets in freedom now," the secretary went on, as if to
himself; "even dares to enter the house he has so wofully desecrated;
but justice is justice and, sooner or later, something will transpire
which will prove to you that a premonition so wonderful as that
I received had its significance; that the voice calling 'Trueman,
Trueman,' was something more than the empty utterances of an excited
brain; that it was Justice itself, calling attention to the guilty."Did he know that the officers of justice were
already upon the track of this same Clavering?I judged not from his
look, but felt an inclination to make an effort and see."You speak with strange conviction," I said; "but in all probability
you are doomed to be disappointed."I do not propose to denounce him;
I do not even propose to speak his name again.I have spoken thus plainly to you only in explanation of last
night's most unfortunate betrayal; and while I trust you will regard
what I have told you as confidential, I also hope you will give me
credit for behaving, on the whole, as well as could be expected under
the circumstances.""Certainly," I replied as I took it.Then, with a sudden impulse to
test the accuracy of this story of his, inquired if he had any means of
verifying his statement of having had this dream at the time spoken of:
that is, before the murder and not afterwards."No, sir; I know myself that I had it the night previous to that of Mr.Leavenworth's death; but I cannot prove the fact.""Did not speak of it next morning to any one?""O no, sir; I was scarcely in a position to do so.""Yet it must have had a great effect upon you, unfitting you for
work----"

"Nothing unfits me for work," was his bitter reply."I believe you," I returned, remembering his diligence for the last few
days."But you must at least have shown some traces of having passed an
uncomfortable night.Have you no recollection of any one speaking to you
in regard to your appearance the next morning?"Leavenworth may have done so; no one else would be likely to
notice."There was sadness in the tone, and my own voice softened as I
said:

"I shall not be at the house to-night, Mr.Harwell; nor do I know when
I shall return there.Personal considerations keep me from Miss
Leavenworth's presence for a time, and I look to you to carry on the
work we have undertaken without my assistance, unless you can bring it
here----"

"I can do that.""I shall expect you, then, to-morrow evening.""Very well, sir"; and he was going, when a sudden thought seemed to
strike him."Sir," he said, "as we do not wish to return to this subject
again, and as I have a natural curiosity in regard to this man, would
you object to telling me what you know of him?You believe him to be a
respectable man; are you acquainted with him, Mr."I know his name, and where he resides.""In London; he is an Englishman."he murmured, with a strange intonation.He bit his lip, looked down, then up, finally fixed his eyes on mine,
and returned, with marked emphasis: "I used an exclamation, sir, because
I was startled.""Yes; you say he is an Englishman.Leavenworth had the most bitter
antagonism to the English.He
would never be introduced to one if he could help it.""You know," continued the secretary, "that Mr.Leavenworth was a man who
carried his prejudices to the extreme.He had a hatred for the English
race amounting to mania.If he had known the letter I have mentioned was
from an Englishman, I doubt if he would have read it.He used to say he
would sooner see a daughter of his dead before him than married to an
Englishman."I turned hastily aside to hide the effect which this announcement made
upon me."You think I am exaggerating," he said."He had doubtless some cause for hating the English with which we are
unacquainted," pursued the secretary."He spent some time in Liverpool
when young, and had, of course, many opportunities for studying their
manners and character."And the secretary made another movement, as if
to leave.But it was my turn to detain him now.Do you
think that, in the case of one of his nieces, say, desiring to marry a
gentleman of that nationality, his prejudice was sufficient to cause him
to absolutely forbid the match?"I had learned what I wished, and saw no further reason for
prolonging the interview.PATCH-WORK


    "Come, give us a taste of your quality."Clavering in his conversation of
the morning had been giving me, with more or less accuracy, a
detailed account of his own experience and position regarding Eleanore
Leavenworth, I asked myself what particular facts it would be necessary
for me to establish in order to prove the truth of this assumption, and
found them to be:

I. That Mr.Clavering had not only been in this country at the time
designated, but that he had been located for some little time at a
watering-place in New York State.That this watering-place should correspond to the one in which Miss
Eleanore Leavenworth was staying at the same time.That they had been seen while there to hold more or less
communication.That they had both been absent from town, at Lorne one time, long
enough to have gone through the ceremony of marriage at a point twenty
miles or so away.V. That a Methodist clergyman, who has since died, lived at that time
within a radius of twenty miles of said watering-place.I next asked myself how I was to establish these acts.Clavering's
life was as yet too little known to me to offer me any assistance; so,
leaving it for the present, I took up the thread of Eleanore's history,
and found that at the time given me she had been in R----, a fashionable
watering-place in this State.Now, if his was true, and my theory
correct, he must have been there also.To prove this fact, became,
consequently, my first business.I resolved to go to R---- on the
morrow.But before proceeding in an undertaking of such importance, I considered
it expedient to make such inquiries and collect such facts as the few
hours I had left to work in rendered possible.I went first to the house
of Mr.I found him lying upon a hard sofa, in the bare sitting-room I have
before mentioned, suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism.His
hands were done up in bandages, and his feet incased in multiplied folds
of a dingy red shawl which looked as if it had been through the wars.Greeting me with a short nod that was both a welcome and an apology,
he devoted a few words to an explanation of his unwonted position; and
then, without further preliminaries, rushed into the subject which was
uppermost in both our minds by inquiring, in a slightly sarcastic way,
if I was very much surprised to find my bird flown when I returned to
the Hoffman House that afternoon."I was astonished to find you allowed him to fly at this time,"
I replied."From the manner in which you requested me to make his
acquaintance, I supposed you considered him an important character in
the tragedy which has just been enacted.""And what makes you think I don't?Oh, the fact that I let him go off
so easily?I never fiddle with the brakes till the
car starts down-hill.But let that pass for the present; Mr.Clavering,
then, did not explain himself before going?""That is a question which I find it exceedingly difficult to answer.Hampered by circumstances, I cannot at present speak with the directness
which is your due, but what I can say, I will.Know, then, that in my
opinion Mr.Clavering did explain himself in an interview with me this
morning.But it was done in so blind a way, it will be necessary for me
to make a few investigations before I shall feel sufficiently sure of
my ground to take you into my confidence.He has given me a possible
clue----"

"Wait," said Mr.Was it done intentionally
and with sinister motive, or unconsciously and in plain good faith?""It is very unfortunate you
cannot explain yourself a little more definitely," he said at last."I
am almost afraid to trust you to make investigations, as you call them,
on your own hook.You are not used to the business, and will lose time,
to say nothing of running upon false scents, and using up your strength
on unprofitable details.""You should have thought of that when you admitted me into partnership.""And you absolutely insist upon working this mine alone?"Clavering, for all I know,
is a gentleman of untarnished reputation.I am not even aware for what
purpose you set me upon his trail.I only know that in thus following
it I have come upon certain facts that seem worthy of further
investigation.""I know it, and for that reason I have come to you for such assistance
as you can give me at this stage of the proceedings.You are in
possession of certain facts relating to this man which it concerns me
to know, or your conduct in reference to him has been purposeless.Now,
frankly, will you make me master of those facts: in short, tell me all
you know of Mr.Clavering, without requiring an immediate return of
confidence on my part?""That is asking a great deal of a professional detective.""I know it, and under other circumstances I should hesitate long before
preferring such a request; but as things are, I don't see how I am to
proceed in the matter without some such concession on your part.At all
events----"

"Wait a moment!Clavering the lover of one of the young
ladies?"Anxious as I was to preserve the secret of my interest in that
gentleman, I could not prevent the blush from rising to my face at the
suddenness of this question."I thought as much," he went on."Being neither a relative nor
acknowledged friend, I took it for granted he must occupy some such
position as that in the family.""I do not see why you should draw such an inference," said I, anxious
to determine how much he knew about him.Clavering is a stranger in
town; has not even been in this country long; has indeed had no time to
establish himself upon any such footing as you suggest."He was
here a year ago to my certain knowledge."Can it be possible I am groping blindly
about for facts which are already in your possession?I pray you listen
to my entreaties, Mr.Gryce, and acquaint me at once with what I want to
know.If I succeed, the glory shall be yours; it I fail, the shame of the
defeat shall be mine.""My reward will be to free an innocent woman from the imputation of
crime which hangs over her."His voice and appearance changed;
for a moment he looked quite confidential."Well, well," said he; "and
what is it you want to know?""I should first like to know how your suspicions came to light on him
at all.What reason had you for thinking a gentleman of his bearing and
position was in any way connected with this affair?""That is a question you ought not to be obliged to put," he returned."Simply because the opportunity of answering it was in your hands before
ever it came into mine.""Don't you remember the letter mailed in your presence by Miss Mary
Leavenworth during your drive from her home to that of her friend in
Thirty-seventh Street?""Certainly, but----"

"You never thought to look at its superscription before it was dropped
into the box.""I had neither opportunity nor right to do so.""And you never regarded the affair as worth your attention?""However I may have regarded it, I did not see how I could prevent Miss
Leavenworth from dropping a letter into a box if she chose to do so.""That is because you are a _gentleman._ Well, it has its disadvantages,"
he muttered broodingly."But you," said I; "how came you to know anything about this letter?Ah, I see," remembering that the carriage in which we were riding at the
time had been procured for us by him."The man on the box was in your
pay, and informed, as you call it."Gryce winked at his muffled toes mysteriously."That is not the
point," he said."Enough that I heard that a letter, which might
reasonably prove to be of some interest to me, had been dropped at such
an hour into the box on the corner of a certain street.That, coinciding
in the opinion of my informant, I telegraphed to the station connected
with that box to take note of the address of a suspicious-looking letter
about to pass through their hands on the way to the General Post Office,
and following up the telegram in person, found that a curious epistle
addressed in lead pencil and sealed with a stamp, had just arrived, the
address of which I was allowed to see----"

"And which was?""Henry R. Clavering, Hoffman House, New York.""And so that is how your attention first came to
be directed to this man?""Why, next I followed up the clue by going to the Hoffman House and
instituting inquiries.Clavering was a regular guest
of the hotel.That he had come there, direct from the Liverpool
steamer, about three months since, and, registering his name as Henry
R. Clavering, Esq., London, had engaged a first-class room which he had
kept ever since.That, although nothing definite was known concerning
him, he had been seen with various highly respectable people, both of
his own nation and ours, by all of whom he was treated with respect.And
lastly, that while not liberal, he had given many evidences of being a
man of means.So much done, I entered the office, and waited for him to
come in, in the hope of having an opportunity to observe his manner when
the clerk handed him that strange-looking letter from Mary Leavenworth.""No; an awkward gawk of a fellow stepped between us just at the critical
moment, and shut off my view.But I heard enough that evening from the
clerk and servants, of the agitation he had shown on receiving it, to
convince me I was upon a trail worth following.I accordingly put on
my men, and for two days Mr.Clavering was subjected to the most
rigid watch a man ever walked under.But nothing was gained by it; his
interest in the murder, if interest at all, was a secret one; and though
he walked the streets, studied the papers, and haunted the vicinity
of the house in Fifth Avenue, he not only refrained from actually
approaching it, but made no attempt to communicate with any of the
family.Meanwhile, you crossed my path, and with your determination
incited me to renewed effort.Clavering's bearing,
and the gossip I had by this time gathered in regard to him, that no one
short of a gentleman and a friend could succeed in getting at the clue
of his connection with this family, I handed him over to you, and----"

"Found me rather an unmanageable colleague."Gryce smiled very much as if a sour plum had been put in his mouth,
but made no reply; and a momentary pause ensued."Did you think to inquire," I asked at last, "if any one knew where Mr.Clavering had spent the evening of the murder?"It was agreed he went out during the
evening; also that he was in his bed in the morning when the servant
came in to make his fire; but further than this no one seemed posted.""So that, in fact, you gleaned nothing that would in any way connect
this man with the murder except his marked and agitated interest in it,
and the fact that a niece of the murdered man had written a letter to
him?""Another question; did you hear in what manner and at what time he
procured a newspaper that evening?""No; I only learned that he was observed, by more than one, to hasten
out of the dining-room with the _Post_ in his hand, and go immediately
to his room without touching his dinner."that does not look---"

"If Mr.Clavering had had a guilty knowledge of the crime, he would
either have ordered dinner before opening the paper, or, having ordered
it, he would have eaten it.""Then you do not believe, from what you have learned, that Mr.Gryce shifted uneasily, glanced at the papers protruding from my
coat pocket and exclaimed: "I am ready to be convinced by you that he
is."That sentence recalled me to the business in hand.Without appearing to
notice his look, I recurred to my questions.Did you learn that, too, at the Hoffman House?""No; I ascertained that in quite another way.In short, I have had a
communication from London in regard to the matter."Yes; I've a friend there in my own line of business, who sometimes
assists me with a bit of information, when requested."You have not had time to write to London, and receive an
answer since the murder."It is enough for me to telegraph him the
name of a person, for him to understand that I want to know everything
he can gather in a reasonable length of time about that person.""It is not there," he said; "if you will be kind enough to feel in my
breast pocket you will find a letter----"

It was in my hand before he finished his sentence."Excuse my
eagerness," I said."This kind of business is new to me, you know."He smiled indulgently at a very old and faded picture hanging on the
wall before him."Eagerness is not a fault; only the betrayal of it.Let us hear what my friend Brown has to
tell us of Mr.Henry Ritchie Clavering, of Portland Place, London."I took the paper to the light and read as follows:


    "Henry Ritchie Clavering, Gentleman, aged 43.Born in

    ----, Hertfordshire, England.Clavering, for
    short time in the army.Mother was Helen Ritchie, of Dumfriesshire,
    Scotland; she is still living.Home with H. R. C., in Portland Place,
    London.H. R. C. is a bachelor, 6 ft.high, squarely built, weight
    about 12 stone.Eyes dark brown;
    nose straight.Called a handsome man; walks erect and rapidly.In
    society is considered a good fellow; rather a favorite, especially with
    ladies.Is liberal, not extravagant; reported to be worth about
    5000 pounds per year, and appearances give color to this statement.Property consists of a small estate in Hertfordshire, and some funds,
    amount not known.Since writing this much, a correspondent sends the
    following in regard to his history.In '46 went from uncle's house to
    Eton.From Eton went to Oxford, graduating in '56.In
    1855 his uncle died, and his father succeeded to the estates.Father
    died in '57 by a fall from his horse or a similar accident.Within a
    very short time H. R. C. took his mother to London, to the residence
    named, where they have lived to the present time."Travelled considerably in 1860; part of the time was with
    ----, of Munich; also in party of Vandervorts from New York; went
    as far east as Cairo.Went to America in 1875 alone, but at end of
    three months returned on account of mother's illness.Nothing is known
    of his movements while in America."From servants learn that he was always a favorite from a boy.More
    recently has become somewhat taciturn.Toward last of his stay watched
    the post carefully, especially foreign ones.Posted scarcely anything
    but newspapers.Have seen, from waste-paper
    basket, torn envelope directed to Amy Belden, no address.American
    correspondents mostly in Boston; two in New York.Names not known, but
    supposed to be bankers.Brought home considerable luggage, and fitted
    up part of house, as for a lady.Left
    for America two months since.Has been, I understand, travelling in the
    south.Has telegraphed twice to Portland Place.His friends hear from
    him but rarely.Letters rec'd recently, posted in New York.One by last
    steamer posted in F----, N. Y.In the country, ---- of ---- has
    charge of the property.F----, N. Y., was a small town near R----."Your friend is a trump," I declared."He tells me just what I wanted
most to know."And, taking out my book, I made memoranda of the facts
which had most forcibly struck me during my perusal of the communication
before me."With the aid of what he tells me, I shall ferret out the
mystery of Henry Clavering in a week; see if I do not."Gryce, "may I expect to be allowed to take
a hand in the game?""As soon as I am reasonably assured I am upon the right tack.""And what will it take to assure you of that?""Not much; a certain point settled, and----"

"Hold on; who knows but what I can do that for you?"And, looking
towards the desk which stood in the corner, Mr.Gryce asked me if I
would be kind enough to open the top drawer and bring him the bits of
partly-burned paper I would find there.Hastily complying, I brought three or four strips of ragged paper, and
laid them on the table at his side."Another result of Fobbs' researches under the coal on the first day of
the inquest," Mr."You thought the key was
all he found.A second turning over of the coal brought
these to light, and very interesting they are, too."I immediately bent over the torn and discolored scraps with great
anxiety.They were four in number, and appeared at first glance to be
the mere remnants of a sheet of common writing-paper, torn lengthwise
into strips, and twisted up into lighters; but, upon closer inspection,
they showed traces of writing upon one side, and, what was more
important still, the presence of one or more drops of spattered blood.This latter discovery was horrible to me, and so overcame me for the
moment that I put the scraps down, and, turning towards Mr.Gryce,
inquired:

"What do you make of them?""That is just the question I was going to put to you."Swallowing my disgust, I took them up again."They look like the
remnants of some old letter," said I."A letter which, from the drop of blood observable on the written side,
must have been lying face up on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of
the murder--"

"Just so.""And from the uniformity in width of each of these pieces, as well as
their tendency to curl up when left alone, must first have been torn
into even strips, and then severally rolled up, before being tossed into
the grate where they were afterwards found.""The writing, so far as discernible, is that of a cultivated gentleman.Leavenworth; for I have studied his chirography
too much lately not to know it at a glance; but it may be--Hold!"I
suddenly exclaimed, "have you any mucilage handy?I think, if I could
paste these strips down upon a piece of paper, so that they would
remain flat, I should be able to tell you what I think of them much more
easily.""There is mucilage on the desk," signified Mr.Procuring it, I proceeded to consult the scraps once more for evidence
to guide me in their arrangement.These were more marked than I
expected; the longer and best preserved strip, with its "Mr.Hor" at
the top, showing itself at first blush to be the left-hand margin of
the letter, while the machine-cut edge of the next in length presented
tokens fully as conclusive of its being the right-hand margin of the
same.Selecting these, then, I pasted them down on a piece of paper at
just the distance they would occupy if the sheet from which they were
torn was of the ordinary commercial note size.Immediately it became
apparent: first, that it would take two other strips of the same width
to fill up the space left between them; and secondly, that the writing
did not terminate at the foot of the sheet, but was carried on to
another page.Taking up the third strip, I looked at its edge; it was machine-cut
at the top, and showed by the arrangement of its words that it was
the margin strip of a second leaf.Pasting that down by itself, I
scrutinized the fourth, and finding it also machine-cut at the top but
not on the side, endeavored to fit it to the piece already pasted down,
but the words would not match.Moving it along to the position it
would hold if it were the third strip, I fastened it down; the whole
presenting, when completed, the appearance seen on the opposite page.Then, as I held it up
before his eyes: "But don't show it to me.Study it yourself, and tell
me what you think of it.""Well," said I, "this much is certain: that it is a letter directed to
Mr.Leavenworth from some House, and dated--let's see; that is an _h,_
isn't it?"And I pointed to the one letter just discernible on the line
under the word House."I should think so; but don't ask me.""It must be an _h._ The year is 1875, and this is not the termination
of either January or February.Dated, then, March 1st, 1876, and
signed----"

Mr.Gryce rolled his eyes in anticipatory ecstasy towards the ceiling."By Henry Clavering," I announced without hesitation.Gryce's eyes returned to his swathed finger-ends."Wait a moment, and I'll show you"; and, taking out of my pocket the
card which Mr.Clavering had handed me as an introduction at our late
interview, I laid it underneath the last line of writing on the second
page.Henry Ritchie Clavering on the card;
H----chie--in the same handwriting on the letter."Clavering it is," said he, "without a doubt."But I saw he was not
surprised."And now," I continued, "for its general tenor and meaning."And,
commencing at the beginning, I read aloud the words as they came, with
pauses at the breaks, something as follows: "Mr.Hor--Dear--a niece whom
yo--one too who see--the love and trus--any other man ca--autiful, so
char----s she in face fo----conversation.ery rose has its----rose is no
exception------ely as she is, char----tender as she is,
s----------pable of tramplin------one who trusted----heart------------.-------------------- him to----he owes a----honor----ance."If------t believe ---- her to----cruel----face,---- what is----ble
serv----yours

"H------tchie"

"It reads like a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces," I
said, and started at my own words."Why," said I, "the fact is I have heard this very letter spoken of.It _is_ a complaint against one of Mr.Leavenworth's nieces, and was
written by Mr.Harwell's communication
in regard to the matter.I thought he had
forsworn gossip."Harwell and I have seen each other almost daily for the last two
weeks," I replied."It would be strange if he had nothing to tell me.""And he says he has read a letter written to Mr."Yes; but the particular words of which he has now forgotten.""These few here may assist him in recalling the rest.""I would rather not admit him to a knowledge of the existence of
this piece of evidence.I don't believe in letting any one into our
confidence whom we can conscientiously keep out.""I see you don't," dryly responded Mr.Not appearing to notice the fling conveyed by these words, I took up the
letter once more, and began pointing out such half-formed words in it
as I thought we might venture to complete, as the Hor--, yo--,
see--utiful----, har----, for----, tramplin----, pable----, serv----.This done, I next proposed the introduction of such others as seemed
necessary to the sense, as _Leavenworth_ after _Horatio; Sir_ after
_Dear; have_ with a possible _you_ before _a niece; thorn_ after _its_
in the phrase _rose has its; on after trampling; whom_ after _to;
debt after a; you_ after _If; me ask_ after _believe; beautiful_ after
_cruel._

Between the columns of words thus furnished I interposed a phrase or
two, here and there, the whole reading upon its completion as follows:

"------------ House."Horatio Leavenworth; Dear Sir:_

"(You) have a niece whom you    one too who seems    worthy    the love
and trust     of any other man ca    so    beautiful, so charming    is
she in face form and    conversation.But every rose has its thorn
and (this) rose is no exception    lovely as she is, charming (as she
is,) tender as she is, she    is    capable of trampling on     one who
trusted her heart a

him to whom she owes a debt of honor a    ance

"If you don't believe me ask her to    her    cruel beautiful face   
what is (her) humble servant yours:

"Henry Ritchie Clavering.""I think that will do," said Mr."Its general tenor is evident,
and that is all we want at this time.""The whole tone of it is anything but complimentary to the lady it
mentions," I remarked."He must have had, or imagined he had, some
desperate grievance, to provoke him to the use of such plain language in
regard to one he can still characterize as tender, charming, beautiful.""Grievances are apt to lie back of mysterious crimes.""I think I know what this one was," I said; "but"--seeing him look
up--"must decline to communicate my suspicion to you for the present.My
theory stands unshaken, and in some degree confirmed; and that is all I
can say.""Then this letter does not supply the link you wanted?""No: it is a valuable bit of evidence; but it is not the link I am in
search of just now.""Yet it must be an important clue, or Eleanore Leavenworth would not
have been to such pains, first to take it in the way she did from her
uncle's table, and secondly----"

"Wait!what makes you think this is the paper she took, or was believed
to have taken, from Mr.Leavenworth's table on that fatal morning?""Why, the fact that it was found together with the key, which we know
she dropped into the grate, and that there are drops of blood on it.""Because I am not satisfied with your reason for believing this to be
the paper taken by her from Mr."Well, first, because Fobbs does not speak of seeing any paper in her
hand, when she bent over the fire; leaving us to conclude that these
pieces were in the scuttle of coal she threw upon it; which surely you
must acknowledge to be a strange place for her to have put a paper she
took such pains to gain possession of; and, secondly, for the reason
that these scraps were twisted as if they had been used for curl papers,
or something of that kind; a fact hard to explain by your hypothesis."The detective's eye stole in the direction of my necktie, which was as
near as he ever came to a face."You are a bright one," said he; "a very
bright one.A little surprised, and not altogether pleased with this unexpected
compliment, I regarded him doubtfully for a moment and then asked:

"What is your opinion upon the matter?""Oh, you know I have no opinion.I gave up everything of that kind when
I put the affair into your hands.""Still----"

"That the letter of which these scraps are the remnant was on Mr.Leavenworth's table at the time of the murder is believed.That upon the
body being removed, a paper was taken from the table by Miss Eleanore
Leavenworth, is also believed.That, when she found her action had been
noticed, and attention called to this paper and the key, she resorted to
subterfuge in order to escape the vigilance of the watch that had been
set over her, and, partially succeeding in her endeavor, flung the key
into the fire from which these same scraps were afterwards recovered, is
also known."Very well, then," said I, rising; "we will let conclusions go for the
present.My mind must be satisfied in regard to the truth or falsity of
a certain theory of mine, for my judgment to be worth much on this or
any other matter connected with the affair."And, only waiting to get the address of his subordinate P., in case
I should need assistance in my investigations, I left Mr.Gryce, and
proceeded immediately to the house of Mr.THE STORY OF A CHARMING WOMAN


    "Fe, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.""I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted.""YOU have never heard, then, the particulars of Mr.I had been asking him to explain to me Mr.Leavenworth's well-known antipathy to the English race."If you had, you would not need to come to me for this explanation.But
it is not strange you are ignorant of the matter.I doubt if there
are half a dozen persons in existence who could tell you where Horatio
Leavenworth found the lovely woman who afterwards became his wife,
much less give you any details of the circumstances which led to his
marriage.""I am very fortunate, then, in being in the confidence of one who can."It will aid you but little to hear.Horatio Leavenworth, when a young
man, was very ambitious; so much so, that at one time he aspired to
marry a wealthy lady of Providence.But, chancing to go to England, he
there met a young woman whose grace and charm had such an effect upon
him that he relinquished all thought of the Providence lady, though it
was some time before he could face the prospect of marrying the one
who had so greatly interested him; as she was not only in humble
circumstances, but was encumbered with a child concerning whose
parentage the neighbors professed ignorance, and she had nothing to
say.But, as is very apt to be the case in an affair like this, love and
admiration soon got the better of worldly wisdom.Taking his future
in his hands, he offered himself as her husband, when she immediately
proved herself worthy of his regard by entering at once into those
explanations he was too much of a gentleman to demand.She proved to be an American by birth,
her father having been a well-known merchant of Chicago.While he lived,
her home was one of luxury, but just as she was emerging into womanhood
he died.It was at his funeral she met the man destined to be her ruin.How he came there she never knew; he was not a friend of her father's.It is enough he was there, and saw her, and that in three weeks--don't
shudder, she was such a child--they were married.In twenty-four hours
she knew what that word meant for her; it meant blows.Everett, I am
telling no fanciful story.In twenty-four hours after that girl was
married, her husband, coming drunk into the house, found her in his way,
and knocked her down.Her father's estate, on
being settled up, proving to be less than expected, he carried her off
to England, where he did not wait to be drunk in order to maltreat her.She was not free from his cruelty night or day.Before she was sixteen,
she had run the whole gamut of human suffering; and that, not at the
hands of a coarse, common ruffian, but from an elegant, handsome,
luxury-loving gentleman, whose taste in dress was so nice he would
sooner fling a garment of hers into the fire than see her go into
company clad in a manner he did not consider becoming.She bore it till
her child was born, then she fled.Two days after the little one saw the
light, she rose from her bed and, taking her baby in her arms, ran out
of the house.The few jewels she had put into her pocket supported her
till she could set up a little shop.As for her husband, she neither saw
him, nor heard from him, from the day she left him till about two weeks
before Horatio Leavenworth first met her, when she learned from the
papers that he was dead.She was, therefore, free; but though she loved
Horatio Leavenworth with all her heart, she would not marry him.She
felt herself forever stained and soiled by the one awful year of abuse
and contamination.Not till the death of her
child, a month or so after his proposal, did she consent to give him her
hand and what remained of her unhappy life.He brought her to New York,
surrounded her with luxury and every tender care, but the arrow had gone
too deep; two years from the day her child breathed its last, she too
died.It was the blow of his life to Horatio Leavenworth; he was never
the same man again.Though Mary and Eleanore shortly after entered his
home, he never recovered his old light-heartedness.Money became his
idol, and the ambition to make and leave a great fortune behind him
modified all his views of life.But one proof remained that he never
forgot the wife of his youth, and that was, he could not bear to have
the word 'Englishman' uttered in his hearing."Veeley paused, and I rose to go.He seemed a little astonished at my request, but immediately replied:
"She was a very pale woman; not strictly beautiful, but of a contour and
expression of great charm.Her hair was brown, her eyes gray--"

"And very wide apart?"On my way downstairs, I bethought me of a letter which I had in my
pocket for Mr.Veeley's son Fred, and, knowing of no surer way of
getting it to him that night than by leaving it on the library table, I
stepped to the door of that room, which in this house was at the rear
of the parlors, and receiving no reply to my knock, opened it and looked
in.The room was unlighted, but a cheerful fire was burning in the grate,
and by its glow I espied a lady crouching on the hearth, whom at first
glance I took for Mrs.But, upon advancing and addressing her by
that name, I saw my mistake; for the person before me not only refrained
from replying, but, rising at the sound of my voice, revealed a form
of such noble proportions that all possibility of its being that of the
dainty little wife of my partner fled."I see I have made a mistake," said I."I beg your pardon"; and would
have left the room, but something in the general attitude of the lady
before me restrained me, and, believing it to be Mary Leavenworth, I
inquired:

"Can it be this is Miss Leavenworth?"The noble figure appeared to droop, the gently lifted head to fall, and
for a moment I doubted if I had been correct in my supposition.Then
form and head slowly erected themselves, a soft voice spoke, and I heard
a low "yes," and hurriedly advancing, confronted--not Mary, with her
glancing, feverish gaze, and scarlet, trembling lips--but Eleanore, the
woman whose faintest look had moved me from the first, the woman whose
husband I believed myself to be even then pursuing to his doom!The surprise was too great; I could neither sustain nor conceal it.Stumbling slowly back, I murmured something about having believed it
to be her cousin; and then, conscious only of the one wish to fly a
presence I dared not encounter in my present mood, turned, when her
rich, heart-full voice rose once more and I heard:

"You will not leave me without a word, Mr.Raymond, now that chance has
thrown us together?"Then, as I came slowly forward: "Were you so very
much astonished to find me here?""I do not know--I did not expect--" was my incoherent reply."I had
heard you were ill; that you went nowhere; that you had no wish to see
your friends.""I have been ill," she said; "but I am better now, and have come to
spend the night with Mrs.Veeley, because I could not endure the stare
of the four walls of my room any longer."This was said without any effort at plaintiveness, but rather as if she
thought it necessary to excuse herself for being where she was."I am glad you did so," said I."You ought to be here all the while.That dreary, lonesome boarding-house is no place for you, Miss
Leavenworth.It distresses us all to feel that you are exiling yourself
at this time.""I do not wish anybody to be distressed," she returned."It is best for
me to be where I am.There is a child there
whose innocent eyes see nothing but innocence in mine.Do not let my friends be anxious; I can bear it."Then, in
a lower tone: "There is but one thing which really unnerves me; and
that is my ignorance of what is going on at home.Sorrow I can bear, but
suspense is killing me.Will you not tell me something of Mary and home?Veeley; she is kind, but has no real knowledge of Mary
or me, nor does she know anything of our estrangement.She thinks me
obstinate, and blames me for leaving my cousin in her trouble.But you
know I could not help it.You know,--" her voice wavered off into a
tremble, and she did not conclude."I cannot tell you much," I hastened to reply; "but whatever knowledge
is at my command is certainly yours.Is there anything in particular you
wish to know?""Yes, how Mary is; whether she is well, and--and composed.""Your cousin's health is good," I returned; "but I fear I cannot say she
is composed.Harwell in preparing your uncle's book for the
press, and necessarily am there much of the time."The words came in a tone of low horror.It has been thought best to bring it before the
world, and----"

"And Mary has set you at the task?"It seemed as if she could not escape from the horror which this caused."She considers herself as fulfilling her uncle's wishes.He was very
anxious, as you know, to have the book out by July."she broke in, "I cannot bear it."Then, as if she
feared she had hurt my feelings by her abruptness, lowered her voice and
said: "I do not, however, know of any one I should be better pleased to
have charged with the task than yourself.With you it will be a work of
respect and reverence; but a stranger--Oh, I could not have endured a
stranger touching it."She was fast falling into her old horror; but rousing herself, murmured:
"I wanted to ask you something; ah, I know"--and she moved so as to
face me."I wish to inquire if everything is as before in the house; the
servants the same and--and other things?"Darrell there; I do not know of any other change."Darrell to help her bear
her loneliness?"I knew what was coming, and strove to preserve my composure."Yes," I replied; "a few."How low her tones were, but how distinct!Gilbert, Miss Martin, and a--a----"

"Go on," she whispered."A gentleman by the name of Clavering.""You speak that name with evident embarrassment," she said, after a
moment of intense anxiety on my part.Astounded, I raised my eyes to her face.It was very pale, and wore
the old look of self-repressed calm I remembered so well.because there are some circumstances surrounding him which have
struck me as peculiar."To-day it is Clavering; a short time ago it
was----"

"Go on."Her dress rustled on the hearth; there was a sound of desolation in it;
but her voice when she spoke was expressionless as that of an automaton."How many times has this person, of whose name you do not appear to be
certain, been to see Mary?""And do you think he will come again?"A short silence followed this, I felt her eyes searching my face, but
doubt whether, if I had known she held a loaded pistol, I could have
looked up at that moment.Raymond," she at length observed, in a changed tone, "the last time
I saw you, you told me you were going to make some endeavor to restore
me to my former position before the world.I did not wish you to do so
then; nor do I wish you to do so now.Can you not make me comparatively
happy, then, by assuring me you have abandoned or will abandon a project
so hopeless?""It is impossible," I replied with emphasis.Much
as I grieve to be a source of sorrow to you, it is best you should know
that I can never give up the hope of righting you while I live."She put out her hand in a sort of hopeless appeal inexpressibly touching
to behold in the fast waning firelight."I should never be able to face the world or my own conscience if,
through any weakness of my own, I should miss the blessed privilege
of setting the wrong right, and saving a noble woman from unmerited
disgrace."And then, seeing she was not likely to reply to this, drew a
step nearer and said: "Is there not some little kindness I can show you,
Miss Leavenworth?Is there no message you would like taken, or act it
would give you pleasure to see performed?""No," said she; "I have only one request to make,
and that you refuse to grant.""For the most unselfish of reasons," I urged."You think so"; then, before I could reply,
"I could desire one little favor shown me, however.""That if anything should transpire; if Hannah should be found, or--or my
presence required in any way,--you will not keep me in ignorance.That
you will let me know the worst when it comes, without fail."Veeley is coming back, and you would scarcely
wish to be found here by her.""No," said I.

And yet I did not go, but stood watching the firelight flicker on her
black dress till the thought of Clavering and the duty I had for the
morrow struck coldly to my heart, and I turned away towards the
door.But at the threshold I paused again, and looked back.Oh, the
flickering, dying fire flame!Oh, the crowding, clustering shadows!Oh, that drooping figure in their midst, with its clasped hands and its
hidden face!I see it all again; I see it as in a dream; then darkness
falls, and in the glare of gas-lighted streets, I am hastening along,
solitary and sad, to my lonely home.A REPORT FOLLOWED BY SMOKE


    "Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where Hope is coldest, and Despair most sits."Gryce I only waited for the determination of one fact,
to feel justified in throwing the case unreservedly into his hands,
I alluded to the proving or disproving of the supposition that Henry
Clavering had been a guest at the same watering-place with Eleanore
Leavenworth the summer before.When, therefore, I found myself the next morning with the Visitor Book
of the Hotel Union at R---- in my hands, it was only by the strongest
effort of will I could restrain my impatience.Almost immediately I encountered his name, written not half
a page below those of Mr.Leavenworth and his nieces, and, whatever
may have been my emotion at finding my suspicions thus confirmed, I
recognized the fact that I was in the possession of a clue which would
yet lead to the solving of the fearful problem which had been imposed
upon me.Hastening to the telegraph office, I sent a message for the man promised
me by Mr.Gryce, and receiving for an answer that he could not be with
me before three o'clock, started for the house of Mr.Monell, a client
of ours, living in R----.I found him at home and, during our interview
of two hours, suffered the ordeal of appearing at ease and interested
in what he had to say, while my heart was heavy with its first
disappointment and my brain on fire with the excitement of the work then
on my hands.I arrived at the depot just as the train came in.There was but one passenger for R----, a brisk young man, whose whole
appearance differed so from the description which had been given me of
Q that I at once made up my mind he could not be the man I was looking
for, and was turning away disappointed, when he approached, and handed
me a card on which was inscribed the single character "?"Even then I
could not bring myself to believe that the slyest and most successful
agent in Mr.Gryce's employ was before me, till, catching his eye, I saw
such a keen, enjoyable twinkle sparkling in its depths that all doubt
fled, and, returning his bow with a show of satisfaction, I remarked:

"You are very punctual."Glad, sir, to please you.Punctuality
is too cheap a virtue not to be practised by a man on the lookout for
a rise.Down train due in ten minutes; no time to
spare.""I thought you might wish to take it, sir.Brown"--winking
expressively at the name, "always checks his carpet-bag for home when he
sees me coming.But that is your affair; I am not particular.""I wish to do what is wisest under the circumstances.""Go home, then, as speedily as possible."And he gave a third sharp nod
exceedingly business-like and determined."If I leave you, it is with the understanding that you bring your
information first to me; that you are in my employ, and in that of no
one else for the time being; and that _mum_ is the word till I give you
liberty to speak.""Very well then, here are your instructions."He looked at the paper I handed him with a certain degree of care, then
stepped into the waiting-room and threw it into the stove, saying in
a low tone: "So much in case I should meet with some accident: have an
apoplectic fit, or anything of that sort.""But----"

"Oh, don't worry; I sha'n't forget.No need of
anybody using pen and paper with me."And laughing in the short, quick way one would expect from a person of
his appearance and conversation, he added: "You will probably hear from
me in a day or so," and bowing, took his brisk, free way down the street
just as the train came rushing in from the West.My instructions to Q were as follows:

1.To find out on what day, and in whose company, the Misses Leavenworth
arrived at R---- the year before.What their movements had been while
there, and in whose society they were oftenest to be seen.Also the date
of their departure, and such facts as could be gathered in regard to
their habits, etc.Henry Clavering, fellow-guest and probable
friend of said ladies.Name of individual fulfilling the following requirements: Clergyman,
Methodist, deceased since last December or thereabouts, who in July of
Seventy-five was located in some town not over twenty miles from R----.Also name and present whereabouts of a man at that time in service of
the above.To say that the interval of time necessary to a proper inquiry into
these matters was passed by me in any reasonable frame of mind, would be
to give myself credit for an equanimity of temper which I unfortunately
do not possess.Never have days seemed so long as the two which
interposed between my return from R---- and the receipt of the following
letter:

"Sir:

"Individuals mentioned arrived in R---- July 3, 1875.Party consisted
of four; the two ladies, their uncle, and the girl named Hannah.Uncle remained three days, and then left for a short tour through
Massachusetts.Gone two weeks, during which ladies were seen more
or less with the gentleman named between us, but not to an extent
sufficient to excite gossip or occasion remark, when said gentleman
left R---- abruptly, two days after uncle's return.As to
habits of ladies, more or less social.They were always to be seen
at picnics, rides, etc., and in the ballroom.E----considered grave, and, towards the last of her stay, moody.It is
remembered now that her manner was always peculiar, and that she was
more or less shunned by her cousin.However, in the opinion of one girl still to be found at the hotel, she
was the sweetest lady that ever breathed.Uncle, ladies, and servants left R---- for New York, August 7,
1875.H. C. arrived at the hotel in R----July 6, 1875, in-company with Mr.Vandervort, friends of the above.Left July 19, two weeks from
day of arrival.Remembered as the
handsome gentleman who was in the party with the L. girls, and that is
all.F----, a small town, some sixteen or seventeen miles from R----, had
for its Methodist minister, in July of last year, a man who has since
died, Samuel Stebbins by name.Name of man in employ of S. S. at that time is Timothy Cook.He
has been absent, but returned to P---- two days ago.I cried aloud at this point, in my sudden surprise and
satisfaction; "now we have something to work upon!"And sitting down I
penned the following reply:

"T. C. wanted by all means.Also any evidence going to prove that H.
C. and E. L. were married at the house of Mr.S. on any day of July or
August last."Next morning came the following telegram:

"T. C. on the road.Will be with you by 2 p.m."At three o'clock of that same day, I stood before Mr."I am here
to make my report," I announced.The flicker of a smile passed over his face, and he gazed for the first
time at his bound-up finger-ends with a softening aspect which must have
done them good.Gryce," I began, "do you remember the conclusion we came to at our
first interview in this house?""I remember the _one you_ came to.""Well, well," I acknowledged a little peevishly, "the one I came to,
then.It was this: that if we could find to whom Eleanore Leavenworth
felt she owed her best duty and love, we should discover the man who
murdered her uncle.""And do you imagine you have done this?""When I undertook this business of clearing Eleanore Leavenworth from
suspicion," I resumed, "it was with the premonition that this person
would prove to be her lover; but I had no idea he would prove to be her
husband."Gryce's gaze flashed like lightning to the ceiling."The lover of Eleanore Leavenworth is likewise her husband," I repeated.Clavering holds no lesser connection to her than that."Gryce, in a harsh tone that
argued disappointment or displeasure."That I will not take time to state.The question is not how I became
acquainted with a certain thing, but is what I assert in regard to it
true.If you will cast your eye over this summary of events gleaned by
me from the lives of these two persons, I think you will agree with me
that it is."And I held up before his eyes the following:

"During the two weeks commencing July 6, of the year 1875, and ending
July 19, of the same year, Henry R. Clavering, of London, and Eleanore
Leavenworth, of New York, were guests of the same hotel._ Fact proved
by Visitor Book of the Hotel Union at R_----, _New York._

"They were not only guests of the same hotel, but are known to have
held more or less communication with each other._Fact proved by such
servants now employed in R---- as were in the hotel at that time._

"July 19.Clavering left R---- abruptly, a circumstance that would
not be considered remarkable if Mr.Leavenworth, whose violent antipathy
to Englishmen as husbands is publicly known, had not just returned from
a journey.Clavering was seen in the parlor of Mr.Stebbins, the
Methodist minister at F----, a town about sixteen miles from R----,
where he was married to a lady of great beauty._Proved by Timothy Cook,
a man in the employ of Mr.Stebbins, who was called in from the garden
to witness the ceremony and sign a paper supposed to be a certificate._

"July 31._Proved by
newspapers of that date._

"September.Eleanore Leavenworth in her uncle's house in New York,
conducting herself as usual, but pale of face and preoccupied in manner._Proved by servants then in her service._ Mr.Clavering in London;
watches the United States mails with eagerness, but receives no letters.Fits up room elegantly, as for a lady._Proved by secret communication
from London._

"November.Miss Leavenworth still in uncle's house.Clavering in London; shows signs of
uneasiness; the room prepared for lady closed._Proved as above._

"January 17, 1876.Clavering, having returned to America, engages
room at Hoffman House, New York.Leavenworth receives a letter signed by Henry
Clavering, in which he complains of having been ill-used by one of that
gentleman's nieces.A manifest shade falls over the family at this time.Clavering under a false name inquires at the door of Mr.Leavenworth's house for Miss Eleanore Leavenworth."That was the night of
the murder.-"

"Yes; the Mr.Le Roy Robbins said to have called that evening was none
other than Mr.Miss Mary Leavenworth, in a conversation with me,
acknowledges that there is a secret in the family, and is just upon the
point of revealing its nature, when Mr.Upon
his departure she declares her unwillingness ever to mention the subject
again.""And from these facts you draw
the inference that Eleanore Leavenworth is the wife of Mr."And that, being his wife----"

"It would be natural for her to conceal anything she knew likely to
criminate him.""Always supposing Clavering himself had done anything criminal!""Which latter supposition you now propose to justify!""Which latter supposition it is left for _us_ to justify.""Then you have no new evidence against Mr."I should think the fact just given, of his standing in the relation of
unacknowledged husband to the suspected party was something.""No positive evidence as to his being the assassin of Mr.I was obliged to admit I had none which he would consider positive."But
I can show the existence of motive; and I can likewise show it was not
only possible, but probable, he was in the house at the time of the
murder."Gryce, rousing a little from his abstraction."The motive was the usual one of self-interest.Leavenworth stood
in the way of Eleanore's acknowledging him as a husband, and he must
therefore be put out of the way."Too much calculation was shown for the arm
to have been nerved by anything short of the most deliberate intention,
founded upon the deadliest necessity of passion or avarice.""One should never deliberate upon the causes which have led to the
destruction of a rich man without taking into account that most common
passion of the human race.""But----"

"Let us hear what you have to say of Mr.Clavering's presence in the
house at the time of the murder."I related what Thomas the butler had told me in regard to Mr.Clavering's call upon Miss Leavenworth that night, and the lack of proof
which existed as to his having left the house when supposed to do so."Valueless as direct evidence, it might prove of great value as
corroborative."Then, in a graver tone, he went on to say: "Mr.Raymond,
are you aware that in all this you have been strengthening the case
against Eleanore Leavenworth instead of weakening it?"I could only ejaculate, in my sudden wonder and dismay."You have shown her to be secret, sly, and unprincipled; capable of
wronging those to whom she was most bound, her uncle and her husband.""You put it very strongly," said I, conscious of a shocking discrepancy
between this description of Eleanore's character and all that I had
preconceived in regard to it."No more so than your own conclusions from this story warrant me in
doing."Then, as I sat silent, murmured low, and as if to himself:
"If the case was dark against her before, it is doubly so with this
supposition established of her being the woman secretly married to Mr."And yet," I protested, unable to give up my hope without a struggle;
"you do not, cannot, believe the noble-looking Eleanore guilty of this
horrible crime?""No," he slowly said; "you might as well know right here what I think
about that.I believe Eleanore Leavenworth to be an innocent woman."Then what," I cried, swaying between joy at this admission and
doubt as to the meaning of his former expressions, "remains to be done?"Gryce quietly responded: "Why, nothing but to prove your supposition
a false one."TIMOTHY COOK


    "Look here upon this picture and on this.""I doubt if it will be so very difficult,"
said he.Then, in a sudden burst, "Where is the man Cook?""That was a wise move; let us see the boys; have them up.""I expected, of course, you would want to question them," said I, coming
back.In another moment the spruce Q and the shock-headed Cook entered the
room.Gryce, directing his attention at the latter in his own
whimsical, non-committal way; "this is the deceased Mr.Stebbins' hired
man, is it?Well, you look as though you could tell the truth.""I usually calculate to do that thing, sir; at all events, I was never
called a liar as I can remember.""Of course not, of course not," returned the affable detective.Then,
without any further introduction: "What was the first name of the lady
you saw married in your master's house last summer?""As well as if she was my own mother.No disrespect to the lady, sir, if
you know her," he made haste to add, glancing hurriedly at me."What I
mean is, she was so handsome, I could never forget the look of her sweet
face if I lived a hundred years.""I don't know, sirs; she was tall and grand-looking, had the brightest
eyes and the whitest hand, and smiled in a way to make even a common man
like me wish he had never seen her.""Very well; now tell us all you can about that marriage.""Well, sirs, it was something like this.Stebbins'
employ about a year, when one morning as I was hoeing in the garden
I saw a gentleman walk rapidly up the road to our gate and come in.I
noticed him particularly, because he was so fine-looking; unlike anybody
in F----, and, indeed, unlike anybody I had ever seen, for that matter;
but I shouldn't have thought much about that if there hadn't come along,
not five minutes after, a buggy with two ladies in it, which stopped at
our gate, too.I saw they wanted to get out, so I went and held their
horse for them, and they got down and went into the house.""I hadn't been to work long, before I heard some one calling my name,
and looking up, saw Mr.Stebbins standing in the doorway beckoning.I
went to him, and he said, 'I want you, Tim; wash your hands and come
into the parlor.'I had never been asked to do that before, and it
struck me all of a heap; but I did what he asked, and was so taken
aback at the looks of the lady I saw standing up on the floor with
the handsome gentleman, that I stumbled over a stool and made a great
racket, and didn't know much where I was or what was going on, till I
heard Mr.Stebbins say'man and wife'; and then it came over me in a hot
kind of way that it was a marriage I was seeing."Timothy Cook stopped to wipe his forehead, as if overcome with the very
recollection, and Mr.Gryce took the opportunity to remark:

"You say there were two ladies; now where was the other one at this
time?""She was there, sir; but I didn't mind much about her, I was so taken up
with the handsome one and the way she had of smiling when any one looked
at her."Can you remember the color of her hair or eyes?""No, sir; I had a feeling as if she wasn't dark, and that is all I
know."Gryce here whispered me to procure two pictures which I would find
in a certain drawer in his desk, and set them up in different parts of
the room unbeknown to the man.Gryce, "that you have no remembrance
of her name.Weren't you called upon to sign the
certificate?""Yes, sir; but I am most ashamed to say it; I was in a sort of maze,
and didn't hear much, and only remember it was a Mr.Clavering she was
married to, and that some one called some one else Elner, or something
like that.I wish I hadn't been so stupid, sir, if it would have done
you any good.""Tell us about the signing of the certificate," said Mr."Well, sir, there isn't much to tell.Stebbins asked me to put my
name down in a certain place on a piece of paper he pushed towards me,
and I put it down there; that is all.""Was there no other name there when you wrote yours?"Stebbins turned towards the other lady, who now
came forward, and asked her if she wouldn't please sign it, too; and she
said,' yes,' and came very quickly and did so.""And didn't you see her face then?""No, sir; her back was to me when she threw by her veil, and I only saw
Mr.Stebbins staring at her as she stooped, with a kind of wonder on his
face, which made me think she might have been something worth looking at
too; but I didn't see her myself."I went stumbling out of the room, and didn't see
anything more.""Where were you when the ladies went away?""No, sir; that was the queer part of it all.They went back as they
came, and so did he; and in a few minutes Mr.Stebbins came out where I
was, and told me I was to say nothing about what I had seen, for it was
a secret.""Were you the only one in the house who knew anything about it?"No, sir; Miss Stebbins had gone to the sewing circle."I had by this time some faint impression of what Mr.Gryce's suspicions
were, and in arranging the pictures had placed one, that of Eleanore, on
the mantel-piece, and the other, which was an uncommonly fine photograph
of Mary, in plain view on the desk.Cook's back was as yet
towards that part of the room, and, taking advantage of the moment,
I returned and asked him if that was all he had to tell us about this
matter.Gryce, with a glance at Q, "isn't there something you
can give Mr.Q nodded, and moved towards a cupboard in the wall at the side of the
mantel-piece; Mr.Cook following him with his eyes, as was natural,
when, with a sudden start, he crossed the room and, pausing before the
mantelpiece, looked at the picture of Eleanore which I had put there,
gave a low grunt of satisfaction or pleasure, looked at it again, and
walked away.I felt my heart leap into my throat, and, moved by what
impulse of dread or hope I cannot say, turned my back, when suddenly I
heard him give vent to a startled exclamation, followed by the words:
"Why!here she is; this is her, sirs," and turning around saw him
hurrying towards us with Mary's picture in his hands.I do not know as I was greatly surprised.I was powerfully excited, as
well as conscious of a certain whirl of thought, and an unsettling of
old conclusions that was very confusing; but surprised?Gryce's
manner had too well prepared me."This the lady who was married to Mr.I guess
you are mistaken," cried the detective, in a very incredulous tone.Didn't I say I would know her anywhere?This is the lady, if
she is the president's wife herself."Cook leaned over it with a
devouring look that was not without its element of homage.Gryce went on, winking at me in a slow,
diabolical way which in another mood would have aroused my fiercest
anger."Now, if you had said the other lady was the one"--pointing to
the picture on the mantelpiece," I shouldn't have wondered."I never saw that lady before; but this one--would you mind telling
me her name, sirs?""If what you say is true, her name is Mrs."And a very lovely lady," said Mr."Morris, haven't you found
anything yet?"Q, for answer, brought forward glasses and a bottle.I think he was struck with
remorse; for, looking from the picture to Q, and from Q to the picture,
he said:

"If I have done this lady wrong by my talk, I'll never forgive myself.You told me I would help her to get her rights; if you have deceived me
----"

"Oh, I haven't deceived you," broke in Q, in his short, sharp way."Ask
that gentleman there if we are not all interested in Mrs.He had designated me; but I was in no mood to reply.I longed to
have the man dismissed, that I might inquire the reason of the great
complacency which I now saw overspreading Mr.Gryce's frame, to his very
finger-ends.Cook needn't be concerned," remarked Mr."If he will take
a glass of warm drink to fortify him for his walk, I think he may go to
the lodgings Mr.Give the gent
a glass, and let him mix for himself."But it was full ten minutes before we were delivered of the man and his
vain regrets.Mary's image had called up every latent feeling in his
heart, and I could but wonder over a loveliness capable of swaying the
low as well as the high.But at last he yielded to the seductions of the
now wily Q, and departed.Gryce, I must have allowed some of the confused
emotions which filled my breast to become apparent on my countenance;
for after a few minutes of ominous silence, he exclaimed very grimly,
and yet with a latent touch of that complacency I had before noticed:

"This discovery rather upsets you, doesn't it?Well, it don't me,"
shutting his mouth like a trap."Your conclusions must differ very materially from mine," I returned;
"or you would see that this discovery alters the complexion of the whole
affair."Gryce's very legs grew thoughtful; his voice sank to its deepest
tone."Then," said he, "to my notion, the complexion of things has altered,
but very much for the better.As long as Eleanore was believed to be
the wife, her action in this matter was accounted for; but the tragedy
itself was not.Why should Eleanore or Eleanore's husband wish the death
of a man whose bounty they believed would end with his life?But with
Mary, the heiress, proved the wife!--I tell you, Mr.Raymond, it all
hangs together now.You must never, in reckoning up an affair of murder
like this, forget who it is that most profits by the deceased man's
death."her concealment of certain proofs and evidences
in her own breast--how will you account for that?I can imagine a woman
devoting herself to the shielding of a husband from the consequences of
crime; but a cousin's husband, never."Gryce put his feet very close together, and softly grunted.I could only stare at him in my sudden doubt and dread."Why, what else is there to think?You don't--you can't--suspect
Eleanore of having deliberately undertaken to help her cousin out of a
difficulty by taking the life of their mutual benefactor?"Gryce; "no, I do not think Eleanore Leavenworth had any
hand in the business.""Then who--" I began, and stopped, lost in the dark vista that was
opening before me.Why, who but the one whose past deceit and present necessity
demanded his death as a relief?Who but the beautiful, money-loving,
man-deceiving goddess----"

I leaped to my feet in my sudden horror and repugnance.You are wrong; but do not speak the name.""Excuse me," said he; "but it will have to be spoken many times, and we
may as well begin here and now--who then but Mary Leavenworth; or, if
you like it better, Mrs.It
has been my thought from the beginning."GRYCE EXPLAINS HIMSELF


    "Sits the wind in that corner?"I DO not propose to enter into a description of the mingled feelings
aroused in me by this announcement.As a drowning man is said to live
over in one terrible instant the events of a lifetime, so each word
uttered in my hearing by Mary, from her first introduction to me in her
own room, on the morning of the inquest, to our final conversation on
the night of Mr.Clavering's call, swept in one wild phantasmagoria
through my brain, leaving me aghast at the signification which her whole
conduct seemed to acquire from the lurid light which now fell upon it."I perceive that I have pulled down an avalanche of doubts about your
ears," exclaimed my companion from the height of his calm superiority."You never thought of this possibility, then, yourself?""Do not ask me what I have thought.I only know I will never believe
your suspicions true.That, however much Mary may have been benefited by
her uncle's death, she never had a hand in it; actual hand, I mean.""And what makes you so sure of this?""And what makes you so sure of the contrary?It is for you to prove, not
for me to prove her innocence."Gryce, in his slow, sarcastic way, "you recollect that
principle of law, do you?If I remember rightly, you have not always
been so punctilious in regarding it, or wishing to have it regarded,
when the question was whether Mr.It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a
crime.I cannot listen to it; it is
horrible.Nothing short of absolute confession on her part will ever
make me believe Mary Leavenworth, or any other woman, committed this
deed.It was too cruel, too deliberate, too----"

"Read the criminal records," broke in Mr."I do not care for the criminal records.All the
criminal records in the world would never make me believe Eleanore
perpetrated this crime, nor will I be less generous towards her cousin.Mary Leavenworth is a faulty woman, but not a guilty one.""You are more lenient in your judgment of her than her cousin was, it
appears.""I do not understand you," I muttered, feeling a new and yet more
fearful light breaking upon me.have you forgotten, in the hurry of these late events, the
sentence of accusation which we overheard uttered between these ladies
on the morning of the inquest?""No, but----"

"You believed it to have been spoken by Mary to Eleanore?"I left that
baby-play for you.I thought one was enough to follow on that tack."The light, the light that was breaking upon me!"And do you mean to say
it was Eleanore who was speaking at that time?That I have been laboring
all these weeks under a terrible mistake, and that you could have
righted me with a word, and did not?""Well, as to that, I had a purpose in letting you follow your own lead
for a while.In the first place, I was not sure myself which spoke;
though I had but little doubt about the matter.The voices are, as you
must have noticed, very much alike, while the attitudes in which we
found them upon entering were such as to be explainable equally by the
supposition that Mary was in the act of launching a denunciation, or in
that of repelling one.So that, while I did not hesitate myself as to
the true explanation of the scene before me, I was pleased to find you
accept a contrary one; as in this way both theories had a chance of
being tested; as was right in a case of so much mystery.You accordingly
took up the affair with one idea for your starting-point, and I with
another.You saw every fact as it developed through the medium of Mary's
belief in Eleanore's guilt, and I through the opposite.With you, doubt, contradiction, constant unsettlement,
and unwarranted resorts to strange sources for reconcilement between
appearances and your own convictions; with me, growing assurance, and
a belief which each and every development so far has but served to
strengthen and make more probable."Again that wild panorama of events, looks, and words swept before me.Mary's reiterated assertions of her cousin's innocence, Eleanore's
attitude of lofty silence in regard to certain matters which might be
considered by her as pointing towards the murderer."Your theory must be the correct one," I finally admitted; "it was
undoubtedly Eleanore who spoke.She believes in Mary's guilt, and I have
been blind, indeed, not to have seen it from the first.""If Eleanore Leavenworth believes in her cousin's criminality, she must
have some good reasons for doing so.""She did not conceal in her bosom that
telltale key,--found who knows where?--and destroy, or seek to destroy,
it and the letter which introduced her cousin to the public as the
unprincipled destroyer of a trusting man's peace, for nothing.""And yet you, a stranger, a young man who have never seen Mary
Leavenworth in any other light than that in which her coquettish nature
sought to display itself, presume to say she is innocent, in the face of
the attitude maintained from the first by her cousin!""But," said I, in my great unwillingness to accept his conclusions,
"Eleanore Leavenworth is but mortal.She may have been mistaken in her
inferences.She has never stated what her suspicion was founded upon;
nor can we know what basis she has for maintaining the attitude you
speak of.Clavering is as likely as Mary to be the assassin, for all we
know, and possibly for all she knows.""You seem to be almost superstitious in your belief in Clavering's
guilt."Harwell's fanciful conviction in
regard to this man had in any way influenced me to the detriment of my
better judgment?"I do not pretend to be set
in my notions.Future investigation may succeed in fixing something upon
him; though I hardly think it likely.His behavior as the secret husband
of a woman possessing motives for the commission of a crime has been too
consistent throughout.""No exception at all; for he hasn't left her.""I mean that, instead of leaving the country, Mr.Clavering has only
made pretence of doing so.That, in place of dragging himself off to
Europe at her command, he has only changed his lodgings, and can now be
found, not only in a house opposite to hers, but in the window of that
house, where he sits day after day watching who goes in and out of her
front door."I remembered his parting injunction to me, in that memorable interview
we had in my office, and saw myself compelled to put a new construction
upon it."But I was assured at the Hoffman House that he had sailed for Europe,
and myself saw the man who professes to have driven him to the steamer.""In another carriage, and to another house.""And you tell me that man is all right?""No; I only say there isn't the shadow of evidence against him as the
person who shot Mr.Rising, I paced the floor, and for a few minutes silence fell between
us.But the clock, striking, recalled me to the necessity of the hour,
and, turning, I asked Mr."There is but one thing I can do," said he."To go upon such lights as I have, and cause the arrest of Miss
Leavenworth."I had by this time schooled myself to endurance, and was able to hear
this without uttering an exclamation.But I could not let it pass
without making one effort to combat his determination."But," said I, "I do not see what evidence you have, positive enough in
its character, to warrant extreme measures.You have yourself intimated
that the existence of motive is not enough, even though taken with
the fact of the suspected party being in the house at the time of the
murder; and what more have you to urge against Miss Leavenworth?"I said 'Miss Leavenworth'; I should have said 'Eleanore
Leavenworth.'"when you and all unite in thinking that she alone of
all these parties to the crime is utterly guiltless of wrong?""And yet who is the only one against whom positive testimony of any kind
can be brought."Raymond," he remarked very gravely; "the public is becoming
clamorous; something must be done to satisfy it, if only for the moment.Eleanore has laid herself open to the suspicion of the police, and
must take the consequences of her action.I am sorry; she is a noble
creature; I admire her; but justice is justice, and though I think her
innocent, I shall be forced to put her under arrest unless----"

"But I cannot be reconciled to it.It is doing an irretrievable injury
to one whose only fault is an undue and mistaken devotion to an unworthy
cousin."Unless something occurs between now and tomorrow morning," Mr.Gryce
went on, as if I had not spoken.I tried to realize it; tried to face the fact that all my efforts had
been for nothing, and failed."Will you not grant me one more day?"Clavering, and force from him the
truth.""To make a mess of the whole affair!""No, sir; the die is
cast.Eleanore Leavenworth knows the one point which fixes this
crime upon her cousin, and she must tell us that point or suffer the
consequences of her refusal."Having exhausted so much time already in our
inquiries, why not take a little more; especially as the trail is
constantly growing warmer?A little more moleing----"

"A little more folderol!""No,
sir; the hour for moleing has passed; something decisive has got to be
done now; though, to be sure, if I could find the one missing link I
want----"

"Missing link?"The immediate motive of the tragedy; a bit of proof that Mr.Leavenworth threatened his niece with his displeasure, or Mr.Clavering
with his revenge, would place me on the vantage-point at once; no
arresting of Eleanore then!I would walk right into your
own gilded parlors, and when you asked me if I had found the murderer
yet, say 'yes,' and show you a bit of paper which would surprise you!This has been moled for, and
moled for, as you are pleased to call our system of investigation, and
totally without result.Nothing but the confession of some one of these
several parties to the crime will give us what we want.I will tell you
what I will do," he suddenly cried."Miss Leavenworth has desired me to
report to her; she is very anxious for the detection of the murderer,
you know, and offers an immense reward.Well, I will gratify this desire
of hers.The suspicions I have, together with my reasons for them, will
make an interesting disclosure.I should not greatly wonder if they
produced an equally interesting confession."I could only jump to my feet in my horror."At all events, I propose to try it.Eleanore is worth that much risk
any way.""It will do no good," said I."If Mary is guilty, she will never confess
it.If not----"

"She will tell us who is.""Not if it is Clavering, her husband.""Yes; even if it is Clavering, her husband.She has not the devotion of
Eleanore."She would hide no keys for the sake of
shielding another: no, if Mary were accused, she would speak.The future
opening before us looked sombre enough.And yet when, in a short time
from that, I found myself alone in a busy street, the thought that
Eleanore was free rose above all others, filling and moving me till my
walk home in the rain that day has become a marked memory of my life.It was only with nightfall that I began to realize the truly critical
position in which Mary stood if Mr.But,
once seized with this thought, nothing could drive it from my mind.Shrink as I would, it was ever before me, haunting me with the direst
forebodings.Nor, though I retired early, could I succeed in getting
either sleep or rest.All night I tossed on my pillow, saying over to
myself with dreary iteration: "Something must happen, something will
happen, to prevent Mr.Then I would
start up and ask what could happen; and my mind would run over various
contingencies, such as,--Mr.Clavering might confess; Hannah might come
back; Mary herself wake up to her position and speak the word I had more
than once seen trembling on her lips.But further thought showed me how
unlikely any of these things were to happen, and it was with a brain
utterly exhausted that I fell asleep in the early dawn, to dream I saw
Mary standing above Mr.I was awakened
from this pleasing vision by a heavy knock at the door.Hastily rising,
I asked who was there.The answer came in the shape of an envelope
thrust under the door.Raising it, I found it to be a note.Gryce, and ran thus:

"Come at once; Hannah Chester is found.""Sit down, and I will tell you."Drawing up a chair in a flurry of hope and fear, I sat down by Mr."She is not in the cupboard," that person dryly assured me, noting
without doubt how my eyes went travelling about the room in my anxiety
and impatience."We are not absolutely sure that she is anywhere.But
word has come to us that a girl's face believed to be Hannah's has been
seen at the upper window of a certain house in--don't start--R----,
where a year ago she was in the habit of visiting while at the hotel
with the Misses Leavenworth.Now, as it has already been determined that
she left New York the night of the murder, by the ------ ----Railroad,
though for what point we have been unable to ascertain, we consider the
matter worth inquiring into.""But--"

"If she is there," resumed Mr.Gryce, "she is secreted; kept very
close.No one except the informant has ever seen her, nor is there any
suspicion among the neighbors of her being in town.""Hannah secreted at a certain house in R----?Gryce honored me with one of his grimmest smiles."The name of
the lady she's with is given in the communication as Belden; Mrs.the name found written on a torn envelope by Mr."Then we are upon the
verge of some discovery; Providence has interfered, and Eleanore will be
saved!"Last night, or rather this morning; Q brought it.""It was a message, then, to Q?""Yes, the result of his moleings while in R----, I suppose.""A respectable tinsmith who lives next door to Mrs."And is this the first you knew of an Amy Belden living in R----?""Don't know; don't know anything about her but her name.""But you have already sent Q to make inquiries?""No; the affair is a little too serious for him to manage alone.He is
not equal to great occasions, and might fail just for the lack of a keen
mind to direct him.""In short----"

"I wish you to go.Since I cannot be there myself, I know of no one else
sufficiently up in the affair to conduct it to a successful issue.You see, it is not enough to find and identify the girl.The present
condition of things demands that the arrest of so important a witness
should be kept secret.Now, for a man to walk into a strange house in a
distant village, find a girl who is secreted there, frighten her,
cajole her, force her, as the case may be, from her hiding-place to a
detective's office in New York, and all without the knowledge of the
next-door neighbor, if possible, requires judgment, brains, genius.She must have her reasons for doing so; and
they must be known.Altogether, the affair is a delicate one."To think what pleasure I am
losing on your account!"he grumbled, gazing reproachfully at his
helpless limbs.a train leaves the depot at 12.15.Once in R----,
it will be for you to decide upon the means of making Mrs.Belden's
acquaintance without arousing her suspicions.Q, who will follow you,
will hold himself in readiness to render you any assistance you may
require.Only this thing is to be understood: as he will doubtless go in
disguise, you are not to recognize him, much less interfere with him
and his plans, till he gives you leave to do so, by some preconcerted
signal.You are to work in your way, and he in his, till circumstances
seem to call for mutual support and countenance.I cannot even say
whether you will see him or not; he may find it necessary to keep out of
the way; but you may be sure of one thing, that he will know where
you are, and that the display of, well, let us say a red silk
handkerchief--have you such a thing?""Will be regarded by him as a sign that you desire his presence or
assistance, whether it be shown about your person or at the window of
your room.""And these are all the instructions you can give me?""Yes, I don't know of anything else.You must depend largely upon your
own discretion, and the exigencies of the moment.I cannot tell you now
what to do.Only, if possible, let
me either hear from you or see you by to-morrow at this time."And he handed me a cipher in case I should wish to telegraph.HANNAH



XXVII.AMY BELDEN


    "A merrier man
    Within the limits of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal."I HAD a client in R---- by the name of Monell; and it was from him I
had planned to learn the best way of approaching Mrs.When,
therefore, I was so fortunate as to meet him, almost on my arrival,
driving on the long road behind his famous trotter Alfred, I regarded
the encounter as a most auspicious beginning of a very doubtful
enterprise.was his exclamation as, the first
greetings passed, we drove rapidly into town."Your part in it goes pretty smoothly," I returned; and thinking I could
never hope to win his attention to my own affairs till I had satisfied
him in regard to his, I told him all I could concerning the law-suit
then pending; a subject so prolific of question and answer, that we
had driven twice round the town before he remembered he had a letter to
post.As it was an important one, admitting of no delay, we hasted at
once to the post-office, where he went in, leaving me outside to watch
the rather meagre stream of goers and comers who at that time of day
make the post-office of a country town their place of rendezvous.Among
these, for some reason, I especially noted one middle-aged woman; why, I
cannot say; her appearance was anything but remarkable.And yet when
she came out, with two letters in her hand, one in a large and one in a
small envelope, and meeting my eye hastily drew them under her shawl,
I found myself wondering what was in her letters and who she could be,
that the casual glance of a stranger should unconsciously move her to an
action so suspicious.Monell's reappearance at the same moment,
diverted my attention, and in the interest of the conversation that
followed, I soon forgot both the woman and her letters.For determined
that he should have no opportunity to revert to that endless topic, a
law case, I exclaimed with the first crack of the whip,--"There, I knew
there was something I wanted to ask you.It is this: Are you acquainted
with any one is this town by the name of Belden?""There is a widow Belden in town; I don't know of any other.""Who is she, what is she, and what is the
extent of your acquaintance with her?""Well," said he, " I cannot conceive why you should be interested in
such an antiquated piece of commonplace goodness as she is, but seeing
you ask, I have no objection to telling you that she is the very
respectable relict of a deceased cabinetmaker of this town; that she
lives in a little house down the street there, and that if you have any
forlorn old tramp to be lodged over night, or any destitute family of
little ones to be looked after, she is the one to go to.As to knowing
her, I know her as I do a dozen other members of our church there up
over the hill.When I see her I speak to her, and that is all.""No; lives alone, has a little income, I believe; must have, to put the
money on the plate she always does; but spends her time in plain sewing
and such deeds of charity, as one with small means but willing heart can
find the opportunity of doing in a town like this.But why in the name
of wonders do you ask?"Belden--don't mention it by the
way--has got mixed up in a case of mine, and I felt it due to my
curiosity if not to my purse, to find out something about her.The fact is I would give something, Monell, for the
opportunity of studying this woman's character.Now couldn't you manage
to get me introduced into her house in some way that would make it
possible and proper for me to converse with her at my leisure?"Well, I don't know; I suppose it could be done.She used to take
lodgers in the summer when the hotel was full, and might be induced
to give a bed to a friend of mine who is very anxious to be near the
post-office on account of a business telegram he is expecting, and which
when it comes will demand his immediate attention."Monell gave
me a sly wink of his eye, little imagining how near the mark he had
struck.Tell her I have a peculiar dislike to sleeping
in a public house, and that you know of no one better fitted to
accommodate me, for the short time I desire to be in town, than
herself.""And what will be said of my hospitality in allowing you under these
circumstances to remain in any other house than my own?""I don't know; very hard things, no doubt; but I guess your hospitality
can stand it.""Well, if you persist, we will see what can be done."And driving up to
a neat white cottage of homely, but sufficiently attractive appearance,
he stopped."This is her house," said he, jumping to the ground; "let's go in and
see what we can do."Glancing up at the windows, which were all closed save the two on the
veranda overlooking the street, I thought to myself, "If she has anybody
in hiding here, whose presence in the house she desires to keep secret,
it is folly to hope she will take me in, however well recommended I may
come."But, yielding to the example of my friend, I alighted in my turn
and followed him up the short, grass-bordered walk to the front door."As she has no servant, she will come to the door herself, so be ready,"
he remarked as he knocked.I had barely time to observe that the curtains to the window at my left
suddenly dropped, when a hasty step made itself heard within, and a
quick hand drew open the door; and I saw before me the woman whom I
had observed at the post-office, and whose action with the letters had
struck me as peculiar.I recognized her at first glance, though she
was differently dressed, and had evidently passed through some worry or
excitement that had altered the expression of her countenance, and
made her manner what it was not at that time, strained and a trifle
uncertain.But I saw no reason for thinking she remembered me.On the
contrary, the look she directed towards me had nothing but inquiry in
it, and when Mr.Monell pushed me forward with the remark, "A friend
of mine; in fact my lawyer from New York," she dropped a hurried
old-fashioned curtsey whose only expression was a manifest desire to
appear sensible of the honor conferred upon her, through the mist of a
certain trouble that confused everything about her."We have come to ask a favor, Mrs.Belden; but may we not come in?"said
my client in a round, hearty voice well calculated to recall a person's
thoughts into their proper channel."I have heard many times of your
cosy home, and am glad of this opportunity of seeing it."And with a
blind disregard to the look of surprised resistance with which she met
his advance, he stepped gallantly into the little room whose cheery
red carpet and bright picture-hung walls showed invitingly through the
half-open door at our left.Finding her premises thus invaded by a sort of French _coup d'etat,_
Mrs.Belden made the best of the situation, and pressing me to enter
also, devoted herself to hospitality.Monell, he quite
blossomed out in his endeavors to make himself agreeable; so much so,
that I shortly found myself laughing at his sallies, though my heart was
full of anxiety lest, after all, our efforts should fail of the success
they certainly merited.Belden softened more and more,
joining in the conversation with an ease hardly to be expected from one
in her humble circumstances.Indeed, I soon saw she was no common woman.There was a refinement in her speech and manner, which, combined with
her motherly presence and gentle air, was very pleasing.The last woman
in the world to suspect of any underhanded proceeding, if she had not
shown a peculiar hesitation when Mr.Monell broached the subject of my
entertainment there."I don't know, sir; I would be glad, but," and she turned a very
scrutinizing look upon me, "the fact is, I have not taken lodgers of
late, and I have got out of the way of the whole thing, and am afraid I
cannot make him comfortable.In short, you will have to excuse me.""What, entice a fellow into a room
like this"--and he cast a hearty admiring glance round the apartment
which, for all its simplicity, both its warm coloring and general air of
cosiness amply merited, "and then turn a cold shoulder upon him when he
humbly entreats the honor of staying a single night in the enjoyment
of its attractions?Belden; I know you too well for that.Lazarus himself couldn't come to your door and be turned away; much less
a good-hearted, clever-headed young gentleman like my friend here.""You are very good," she began, an almost weak love of praise showing
itself for a moment in her eyes; "but I have no room prepared.I have
been house-cleaning, and everything is topsy-turvy Mrs.Wright, now,
over the way----"

"My young friend is going to stop here," Mr.Mouell broke in, with frank
positiveness."If I cannot have him at my own house,--and for certain
reasons it is not advisable,--I shall at least have the satisfaction of
knowing he is in the charge of the best housekeeper in R----.""Yes," I put in, but without too great a show of interest; "I should be
sorry, once introduced here, to be obliged to go elsewhere."The troubled eye wavered away from us to the door."I was never called inhospitable," she commenced; "but everything in
such disorder."I was in hopes I might remain now," I replied; "I have some letters
to write, and ask nothing better than for leave to sit here and write
them."At the word letters I saw her hand go to her pocket in a movement which
must have been involuntary, for her countenance did not change, and she
made the quick reply:

"Well, you may.If you can put up with such poor accommodations as I can
offer, it shall not be said I refused you what Mr.Monell is pleased to
call a favor."And, complete in her reception as she had been in her resistance, she
gave us a pleasant smile, and, ignoring my thanks, bustled out with Mr.Monell to the buggy, where she received my bag and what was, doubtless,
more to her taste, the compliments he was now more than ever ready to
bestow upon her."I will see that a room is got ready for you in a very short space of
time," she said, upon re-entering."Meanwhile, make yourself at home
here; and if you wish to write, why I think you will find everything for
the purpose in these drawers."And wheeling up a table to the easy chair
in which I sat, she pointed to the small compartments beneath, with
an air of such manifest desire to have me make use of anything and
everything she had, that I found myself wondering over my position with
a sort of startled embarrassment that was not remote from shame."Thank you; I have materials of my own," said I, and hastened to open my
bag and bring out the writing-case, which I always carried with me."Then I will leave you," said she; and with a quick bend and a short,
hurried look out of the window, she hastily quitted the room.I could hear her steps cross the hall, go up two or three stairs, pause,
go up the rest of the flight, pause again, and then pass on.I was left
on the first floor alone.A WEIRD EXPERIENCE


    "Flat burglary as ever was committed."THE first thing I did was to inspect with greater care the room in which
I sat.It was a pleasant apartment, as I have already said; square, sunny, and
well furnished.On the floor was a crimson carpet, on the walls several
pictures, at the windows, cheerful curtains of white, tastefully
ornamented with ferns and autumn leaves; in one corner an old melodeon,
and in the centre of the room a table draped with a bright cloth, on
which were various little knick-knacks which, without being rich or
expensive, were both pretty and, to a certain extent, ornamental.But
it was not these things, which I had seen repeated in many other country
homes, that especially attracted my attention, or drew me forward in the
slow march which I now undertook around the room.It was the something
underlying all these, the evidences which I found, or sought to find,
not only in the general aspect of the room, but in each trivial object
I encountered, of the character, disposition, and history of the woman
with whom I now had to deal.It was for this reason I studied the
daguerreotypes on the mantel-piece, the books on the shelf, and the
music on the rack; for this and the still further purpose of noting if
any indications were to be found of there being in the house any such
person as Hannah.First then, for the little library, which I was pleased to see occupied
one corner of the room.Composed of a few well-chosen books, poetical,
historical, and narrative, it was of itself sufficient to account
for the evidences of latent culture observable in Mrs.Taking out a well-worn copy of _Byron,_ I opened it.There
were many passages marked, and replacing the book with a mental comment
upon her evident impressibility to the softer emotions, I turned towards
the melodeon fronting me from the opposite wall.It was closed, but on
its neatly-covered top lay one or two hymn-books, a basket of russet
apples, and a piece of half-completed knitting work.I took up the latter, but was forced to lay it down again without a
notion for what it was intended.Proceeding, I next stopped before
a window opening upon the small yard that ran about the house, and
separated it from the one adjoining.The scene without failed to attract
me, but the window itself drew my attention, for, written with a diamond
point on one of the panes, I perceived a row of letters which, as
nearly as I could make out, were meant for some word or words, but which
utterly failed in sense or apparent connection.Passing it by as the
work of some school-girl, I glanced down at the work-basket standing on
a table at my side.It was full of various kinds of work, among which I
spied a pair of stockings, which were much too small, as well as in too
great a state of disrepair, to belong to Mrs.Belden; and drawing them
carefully out, I examined them for any name on them.Do not start when I
say I saw the letter H plainly marked upon them.Thrusting them back,
I drew a deep breath of relief, gazing, as I did so, out of the window,
when those letters again attracted my attention.Idly I began to read them backward, when--But try
for yourself, reader, and judge of my surprise!Elate at the discovery
thus made, I sat down to write my letters.I had barely finished them,
when Mrs.Belden came in with the announcement that supper was ready."As for your room," said she, "I have prepared my own room for your use,
thinking you would like to remain on the first floor."And, throwing
open a door at my side, she displayed a small, but comfortable room,
in which I could dimly see a bed, an immense bureau, and a shadowy
looking-glass in a dark, old-fashioned frame."I live in very primitive fashion," she resumed, leading the way into
the dining-room; "but I mean to be comfortable and make others so.""I should say you amply succeeded," I rejoined, with an appreciative
glance at her well-spread board.She smiled, and I felt I had paved the way to her good graces in a way
that would yet redound to my advantage.its dainties, its pleasant freedom, its
mysterious, pervading atmosphere of unreality, and the constant sense
which every bountiful dish she pressed upon me brought of the shame of
eating this woman's food with such feelings of suspicion in my heart!Shall I ever forget the emotion I experienced when I first perceived
she had something on her mind, which she longed, yet hesitated, to give
utterance to!Or how she started when a cat jumped from the sloping roof
of the kitchen on to the grass-plot at the back of the house; or how my
heart throbbed when I heard, or thought I heard, a board creak overhead!We were in a long and narrow room which seemed, curiously enough, to run
crosswise of the house, opening on one side into the parlor, and on the
other into the small bedroom, which had been allotted to my use."You live in this house alone, without fear?"Belden,
contrary to my desire, put another bit of cold chicken on my plate."Have you no marauders in this town: no tramps, of whom a solitary woman
like you might reasonably be afraid?""No one will hurt me," said she; "and no one ever came here for food or
shelter but got it.""I should think, then, that living as you do, upon a railroad, you would
be constantly overrun with worthless beings whose only trade is to take
all they can get without giving a return."It is the only luxury I have: to feed the
poor.""But the idle, restless ones, who neither will work, nor let others
work----"

"Are still the poor."Mentally remarking, here is the woman to shield an unfortunate who has
somehow become entangled in the meshes of a great crime, I drew back
from the table.As I did so, the thought crossed me that, in case
there was any such person in the house as Hannah, she would take the
opportunity of going up-stairs with something for her to eat; and that
she might not feel hampered by my presence, I stepped out on the veranda
with my cigar.While smoking it, I looked about for Q. I felt that the least token
of his presence in town would be very encouraging at this time.But it
seemed I was not to be afforded even that small satisfaction.If Q was
anywhere near, he was lying very low.Belden (who I know came down-stairs with an
empty plate, for going into the kitchen for a drink, I caught her in
the act of setting it down on the table), I made up my mind to wait a
reasonable length of time for what she had to say; and then, if she did
not speak, make an endeavor on my own part to surprise her secret.But her avowal was nearer and of a different nature from what I
expected, and brought its own train of consequences with it."You are a lawyer, I believe," she began, taking down her knitting work,
with a forced display of industry."Yes," I said; "that is my profession."She remained for a moment silent, creating great havoc in her work I am
sure, from the glance of surprise and vexation she afterwards threw it.Then, in a hesitating voice, remarked:

"Perhaps you may be willing, then, to give me some advice.The truth is,
I am in a very curious predicament; one from which I don't know how to
escape, and yet which demands immediate action.I should like to tell
you about it; may I?""You may; I shall be only too happy to give you any advice in my power."She drew in her breath with a sort of vague relief, though her forehead
did not lose its frown."It can all be said in a few words.I have in my possession a package of
papers which were intrusted to me by two ladies, with the understanding
that I should neither return nor destroy them without the full
cognizance and expressed desire of both parties, given in person or
writing.That they were to remain in my hands till then, and that
nothing or nobody should extort them from me.""That is easily understood," said I; for she stopped."But, now comes word from one of the ladies, the one, too, most
interested in the matter, that, for certain reasons, the immediate
destruction of those papers is necessary to her peace and safety.""And do you want to know what your duty is in this case?"I could not help it: a flood of conjectures rushing in tumult
over me."It is to hold on to the papers like grim death till released from your
guardianship by the combined wish of both parties."Once pledged in that way, you have no choice.It
would be a betrayal of trust to yield to the solicitations of one party
what you have undertaken to return to both.The fact that grief or loss
might follow your retention of these papers does not release you from
your bond.You have nothing to do with that; besides, you are by no
means sure that the representations of the so-called interested party
are true.You might be doing a greater wrong, by destroying in this way,
what is manifestly considered of value to them both, than by preserving
the papers intact, according to compact."Circumstances alter cases; and in short, it
seems to me that the wishes of the one most interested ought to be
regarded, especially as there is an estrangement between these ladies
which may hinder the other's consent from ever being obtained.""No," said I; "two wrongs never make a right; nor are we at liberty to
do an act of justice at the expense of an injustice.The papers must be
preserved, Mrs.Her head sank very despondingly; evidently it had been her wish to
please the interested party."Law is very hard," she said; "very hard.""This is not only law, but plain duty," I remarked."Suppose a case
different; suppose the honor and happiness of the other party depended
upon the preservation of the papers; where would your duty be then?""But----"

"A contract is a contract," said I, "and cannot be tampered with.Having
accepted the trust and given your word, you are obliged to fulfil, to
the letter, all its conditions.It would be a breach of trust for you to
return or destroy the papers without the mutual consent necessary."An expression of great gloom settled slowly over her features."I
suppose you are right," said she, and became silent.Watching her, I thought to myself, "If I were Mr.Gryce, or even Q, I
would never leave this seat till I had probed this matter to the bottom,
learned the names of the parties concerned, and where those precious
papers are hidden, which she declares to be of so much importance."But
being neither, I could only keep her talking upon the subject until
she should let fall some word that might serve as a guide to my further
enlightenment; I therefore turned, with the intention of asking her
some question, when my attention was attracted by the figure of a woman
coming out of the back-door of the neighboring house, who, for general
dilapidation and uncouthness of bearing, was a perfect type of the style
of tramp of whom we had been talking at the supper table.Gnawing a
crust which she threw away as she reached the street, she trudged down
the path, her scanty dress, piteous in its rags and soil, flapping in
the keen spring wind, and revealing ragged shoes red with the mud of the
highway."There is a customer that may interest you," said I.

Mrs.Belden seemed to awake from a trance.Rising slowly, she looked
out, and with a rapidly softening gaze surveyed the forlorn creature
before her.she muttered; "but I cannot do much for her to-night.A
good supper is all I can give her."And, going to the front door, she bade her step round the house to the
kitchen, where, in another moment, I heard the rough creature's voice
rise in one long "Bless you!"that could only have been produced by the
setting before her of the good things with which Mrs.Belden's larder
seemed teeming.After a decent length of time,
employed as I should judge in mastication, I heard her voice rise once
more in a plea for shelter."The barn, ma'am, or the wood-house.Any place where I can lie out of
the wind."And she commenced a long tale of want and disease, so piteous
to hear that I was not at all surprised when Mrs.Belden told me,
upon re-entering, that she had consented, notwithstanding her previous
determination, to allow the woman to lie before the kitchen fire for the
night."She has such an honest eye," said she; "and charity is my only luxury."The interruption of this incident effectually broke up our conversation.Belden went up-stairs, and for some time I was left alone to ponder
over what I had heard, and determine upon my future course of action.I
had just reached the conclusion that she would be fully as liable to
be carried away by her feelings to the destruction of the papers in her
charge, as to be governed by the rules of equity I had laid down to her,
when I heard her stealthily descend the stairs and go out by the front
door.Distrustful of her intentions, I took up my hat and hastily
followed her.She was on her way down the main street, and my first
thought was, that she was bound for some neighbor's house or perhaps for
the hotel itself; but the settled swing into which she soon altered her
restless pace satisfied me that she had some distant goal in prospect;
and before long I found myself passing the hotel with its appurtenances,
even the little schoolhouse, that was the last building at this end of
the village, and stepping out into the country beyond.But still her fluttering figure hasted on, the outlines of her form,
with its close shawl and neat bonnet, growing fainter and fainter in the
now settled darkness of an April night; and still I followed, walking on
the turf at the side of the road lest she should hear my footsteps and
look round.Over this I could hear her
pass, and then every sound ceased.She had paused, and was evidently
listening.It would not do for me to pause too, so gathering myself into
as awkward a shape as possible, I sauntered by her down the road, but
arrived at a certain point, stopped, and began retracing my steps with a
sharp lookout for her advancing figure, till I had arrived once more at
the bridge.Convinced now that she had discovered my motive for being in her house
and, by leading me from it, had undertaken to supply Hannah with an
opportunity for escape, I was about to hasten back to the charge I had
so incautiously left, when a strange sound heard at my left arrested me.It came from the banks of the puny stream which ran under the bridge,
and was like the creaking of an old door on worn-out hinges.Leaping the fence, I made my way as best I could down the sloping field
in the direction from which the sound came.It was quite dark, and my
progress was slow; so much so, that I began to fear I had ventured upon
a wild-goose chase, when an unexpected streak of lightning shot across
the sky, and by its glare I saw before me what seemed, in the momentary
glimpse I had of it, an old barn.From the rush of waters near at hand,
I judged it to be somewhere on the edge of the stream, and consequently
hesitated to advance, when I heard the sound of heavy breathing near me,
followed by a stir as of some one feeling his way over a pile of loose
boards; and presently, while I stood there, a faint blue light flashed
up from the interior of the barn, and I saw, through the tumbled-down
door that faced me, the form of Mrs.Belden standing with a lighted
match in her hand, gazing round on the four walls that encompassed her.Hardly daring to breathe, lest I should alarm her, I watched her while
she turned and peered at the roof above her, which was so old as to be
more than half open to the sky, at the flooring beneath, which was in
a state of equal dilapidation, and finally at a small tin box which she
drew from under her shawl and laid on the ground at her feet.The sight
of that box at once satisfied me as to the nature of her errand.She was
going to hide what she dared not destroy; and
