For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.This plot here is
filled with hardy hybrid perpetuals, and that with tender tea-roses,
requiring very different treatment.Here is a moss that will bloom again in
the autumn.It has a sounding name--_Soupert-et-notting_--but it is
worthy of any name.Though not so mossy as some others, look at its fine
form and beautiful rose-color.Only one or two are out yet, but in a week
this bush will be a thing of beauty that one would certainly wish might
last forever.Nothing surpasses it unless it is _La
France_, over there."She inhaled the exquisite perfume in long breaths, and then looked around
at the budding beauty on every side, even to the stone walls that were
covered with climbing varieties.At last she turned to him with eyes that
were dilated as much with wonder as with pleasure, and said: "Well, this
_is_ a surprise.How in the world have you found time to bring all this
about?I never saw anything to equal it even in England.Of course I saw
rose gardens there on a larger scale in the parks and greenhouses, but I
have reference to the bushes and flowers.Why, Amy, an old gentleman who lives but a few
miles away has had seventy distinct kinds of hybrid perpetuals in bloom at
one time, and many of them the finest in existence; and yet he has but a
little mite of a garden, and has been a poor, hard-working man all his
life.Speaking of England, when I read of what the poor working people of
Nottingham accomplished in their little bits of glass-houses and their
Liliputian gardens, I know that all this is very ordinary, and within the
reach of almost any one who loves the flower.After one learns how to grow
roses, they do not cost much more care and trouble than a crop of onions or
cabbages.The soil and location here just suit the rose.You see that the
place is sheltered, and yet there are no trees near to shade them and drain
the ground of its richness.""Oh, you are sure to make it all seem simple and natural.It's a way you
have," she said, "But to me it's a miracle.I don't believe there are many
who have your feeling for this flower or your skill."The love for roses is very common, as it should
be, for millions of plants are sold annually, and the trade in them is
steadily increasing.Come, let me give you a lesson in the distinguishing
marks of the different kinds.A rose will smell as sweet by its own name as
by another, and you will find no scentless flowers here.There are some
fine odorless ones, like the Beauty of Stapleford, but I give them no
place."The moments flew by unheeded until an hour had passed, and then Webb,
looking at the sun, exclaimed: "I must go.This will answer for the first
lesson.You can bring mother here now in her garden chair whenever she
wishes to come, and I will give you other lessons, until you are a true
connoisseur in roses;" and he looked at those in her cheeks as if they were
more lovely than any to which he had been devoted for years."Well, Webb," she said, laughing, "I cannot think of anything lacking in my
morning's experience.I was wakened by the song of birds.You have revealed
to me the mystery of your sanctum, and that alone, you know, would be
happiness to the feminine soul.You have also introduced me to dozens of
your sweethearts, for you look at each rose as Burt does at the pretty
girls he meets.You have shown me your budding rose garden in the dewy
morning, and that was appropriate, too.Every one of your pets was gemmed
and jewelled for the occasion, and unrivalled musicians, cleverly concealed
in the trees near, have filled every moment with melody.Why should we not have them for
breakfast, also?""Why not, indeed, since it would seem that there are to be thousands here
and elsewhere in the garden?Fresh roses and strawberries for
breakfast--that's country life to perfection.He went away as if in a dream, and his heart almost ached with a tension of
feeling that he could not define.It seemed to him the culmination of all
that he had loved and enjoyed.His rose garden had been complete at this
season the year before, but now that Amy had entered it, the roses that she
had touched, admired, and kissed with lips that vied with their petals grew
tenfold more beautiful, and the spot seemed sacred to her alone.He could
never enter it again without thinking of her and seeing her lithe form
bending to favorites which hitherto he had only associated with his mother.His life seemed so full and his happiness so deep that he did not want to
think, and would not analyze according to his habit.He brought the strawberries to Amy in the breakfast-room, and stood near
while she and Johnnie hulled them.He saw the roses arranged by his
mother's plate in such nice harmony that one color did not destroy another.He replied to her mirthful words and rallyings, scarcely knowing what he
said, so deep was the feeling that oppressed him, so strong was his love
for that sweet sister who had come into his life and made it ideally
perfect.She appreciated what he had loved so fully, her very presence had
ever kindled his spirit, and while eager to learn and easily taught, how
truly she was teaching him a philosophy of life that seemed divine!The day passed in a confused maze of thought and
happiness, so strange and absorbing that he dared not speak lest he should
waken as from a dream.The girl had grown so beautiful to him that he
scarcely wished to look at her, and hastened through his meals that he
might be alone with his thoughts.The sun had sunk, and the moon was well
over the eastern mountains, before he visited the rose garden.Amy was
there, and she greeted him with a pretty petulance because he had not come
before.Then, in sudden compunction, she asked:

"Don't you feel well, Webb?You have been so quiet since we were here this
morning!Perhaps you are sorry you let me into this charmed seclusion.""No, Amy, I am not," he said, with an impetuosity very unusual in him."You
should know me better than even to imagine such a thing."Before he could say anything more, Burt's mellow voice rang out, "Amy!""Oh, I half forgot; I promised to take a drive with Burt this evening.Forgive me, Webb," she added, gently, "I only spoke in sport.I do know you
too well to imagine I am unwelcome here.No one ever had a kinder or more
patient brother than you have been to me;" and she clasped her hands upon
his arm, and looked up into his face with frank affection.His arm trembled under her touch, and he felt that he must be alone.In his
usual quiet tones, however, he was able to say: "You, rather, must forgive
me that I spoke so hastily.No; I'm not ill, but very tired.A good night's
rest will bring me around."Webb, you work too hard," she said, earnestly."But Burt is calling--"

"Yes; do not keep him waiting; and think of me," he added, laughing, "as
too weary for moonlight, roses, or anything but prosaic sleep.June is all
very well, but it brings a pile of work to a fellow like me.""Oh, Webb, what a clodhopper you're trying to make yourself out to be!Well, 'Sleep, sleep'--I can't think of the rest of the quotation.rang out her clear voice; and, with a smiling glance
backward, she hastened away.From the shrubbery he watched her pass up the wide garden path, the
moonlight giving an ethereal beauty to her slight form with its white,
close drapery.Then, deeply troubled, he threw himself on a rustic seat
near the wall, and buried his face in his hands.It was all growing too
clear to him now, and he found himself face to face with the conviction
that Amy was no longer his sister, but the woman he loved.The deep-hidden
current of feeling that had been gathering volume for months at last
flashed out into the light, and there could be no more disguise.The
explanation of her power over him was now given to his deepest
consciousness.By some law of his nature, when she spoke he had ever
listened; whatever she said and did had been invested with a nameless
charm.Day after day they had been together, and their lives had harmonized
like two chords that blend in one sweet sound.He had never had a sister,
and his growing interest in Amy had seemed the most natural thing in the
world; that Burt should love her, equally natural--to fall in love was
almost a habit with the mercurial young fellow when thrown into the society
of a pretty girl--and he had felt that he should be only too glad that his
brother had at last fixed his thoughts on one who would not be a stranger
to them.He now remembered that, while all this had been satisfactory to
reason, his heart for a long time had been uttering its low, half-conscious
protest.The events of this long day had revealed him unto
himself, because he was ripe for the knowledge.His nature had its hard, practical business side, but he had never been
content with questions of mere profit and loss.He not only had wanted the
corn, but the secret of the corn's growth and existence.To search into
Nature's hidden life, so that he could see through her outward forms the
mechanism back of all, and trace endless diversity to simple inexorable
laws, had been his pride and the promised solace of his life.His love of
the rose had been to him what it is to many another hard-working man and
woman--recreation, a habit, something for which he had developed the taste
and feeling of a connoisseur.It had had no appreciable influence on the
current of his thoughts.Amy's coming, however, had awakened the poetic
side of his temperament, and, while this had taken nothing from the old, it
had changed everything.Before, his life had been like nature in winter,
when all things are in hard, definite outline.The feeling which she had
inspired brought the transforming flowers and foliage.It was an immense
addition to that which already existed, and which formed the foundation for
it.For a long time he had exulted in this inflorescence of his life, as it
were, and was more than content.He did not know that the spirit gifted
even unconsciously with the power thus to develop his own nature must soon
become to him more than a cause of an effect, more than a sister upon whom
he could look with as tranquil eyes and even pulse in youth as in frosty
age.But now he knew it with the absolute certainty that was characteristic
of his mind when once it grasped a truth.The voice of Burt calling
"Amy," after the experiences of the day, had been like a shaft of light,
instantly revealing everything.For her sake more than his own he had
exerted himself to the utmost to conceal the truth of that moment of bitter
consciousness.He trembled as he thought of his blind, impetuous words and
her look of surprise; he grew cold with dread as he remembered how easily
he might have betrayed himself.what could he do but hide the truth with
sleepless vigilance?In the eyes
of Amy and all the family Burt was her acknowledged suitor, who, having
been brought to reason, was acting most rationally and honorably.Whether
Amy was learning to love him or not made no difference.If she, growing
conscious of her womanhood, was turning her thoughts to Burt as the one who
had first sought her, and who was now cheerfully waiting until the look of
shy choice and appeal came into her eyes, he could not seek to thrust his
younger brother aside.If the illustration of the rose which she had forced
into unnatural bloom was still true of her heart, he would be false to her
and himself, as well as to Burt, should he seek her in the guise of a
lover.He had felt that it was almost sacrilege to disturb her May-like
girlhood; that this child of nature should be left wholly to nature's
impulses and to nature's hour for awakening."If it only could have been, how rich and full life would be!""We were in sympathy at almost every point When shall I forget the hour
we spent here this morning!The exquisite purity and beauty of the dawn,
the roses with the dew upon them, seemed emblems of herself.Hereafter
they will ever speak to me of her.That perfume that comes on the breeze
to me now from the wild grapevine--the most delicate and delightful of
all the odors of June--is instantly associated with her in my mind, as
all things lovely in nature ever will be hereafter.How can I hide all
this from her, and seem merely her quiet elder brother?How can I meet
her here to-morrow morning, and in the witchery of summer evenings, and
still speak in measured tones, and look at her as I would at Johnnie?The
thing is impossible until I have gained a stronger self-control.I must
go away for a day or two, and I will.When I return neither Burt nor Amy
shall have cause to complain;" and he strode away.A firm to whom the Cliffords had been
sending part of their produce had not given full satisfaction, and Webb
announced his intention of going to the city in the morning to investigate
matters.His father and Leonard approved of his purpose, and when he added
that he might stay in town for two or three days, that he felt the need of
a little change and rest before haying and harvest began, they all
expressed their approval still more heartily.The night was so beautiful that Burt prolonged his drive.The witchery of
the romantic scenery through which he and Amy passed, and the loveliness of
her profile in the pale light, almost broke down his resolution, and once,
in accents much too tender, he said, "Oh, Amy, I am so happy when with
you!""I'm happy with you also," she replied, in brusque tones, "now that you
have become so sensible."He took the hint, and said, emphatically: "Don't you ever be apprehensive
or nervous when with me.I'll wait, and be'sensible,' as you express it,
till I'm gray."Her laugh rang out merrily, but she made no other reply.He was a little
nettled, and mentally vowed a constancy that would one day make her regret
that laugh.Webb had retired when Amy returned, and she learned of his plans from
Maggie."It's just the best thing he can do," she said, earnestly."Webb's
been overworking, and he needs and deserves a little rest."In the morning he seemed so busy with his preparations that he had scarcely
time to give her more than a genial off-hand greeting."Oh, Webb, I shall miss you so much!"she said, in parting, and her look
was very kind and wistful.He did not trust himself to speak, but gave her
a humorous and what seemed to her a half-incredulous smile.He puzzled her,
and she thought about him and his manner of the previous day and evening
not a little.With her sensitive nature, she could not approach so near the
mystery that he was striving to conceal without being vaguely impressed
that there was something unusual about him.The following day, however,
brought a cheerful, business-like letter to his father, which was read at
the dinner-table.He had straightened out matters in town and seemed to be
enjoying himself.She more than once admitted that she did miss him as she
would not any other member of the household.But her out-door life was very
full.By the aid of her glass she made the intimate acquaintance of her
favorite songsters.Clifford in her garden chair to
the rosary, and proposed through her instruction to give Webb a surprise
when he returned.She would prove to him that she could name his pets from
their fragrance, form, and color as well as he himself.CHAPTER XXXIV

A SHAM BATTLE AT WEST POINT


Burt did his best to keep things lively, and a few days after Webb's
departure said: "I've heard that there is to be a sham battle at West Point
this afternoon.The heavy guns from the river batteries had been awakening deep echoes
among the mountains every afternoon for some time past, reminding the
Cliffords that the June examinations were taking place at the Military
Academy, and that there was much of interest occurring near them.Not only
did Amy assent to Burt's proposition, but Leonard also resolved to go and
take Maggie and the children.In the afternoon a steam-yacht bore them and
many other excursionists to their destination, and they were soon skirting
the grassy plain on which the military evolutions were to take place.The scene was full of novelty and interest for Amy.Thousands of people
were there, representing every walk and condition of life.Plain farmers
with their wives and children, awkward country fellows with their
sweethearts, dapper clerks with bleached hands and faces, were passing to
and fro among ladies in Parisian toilets and with the unmistakable air of
the metropolis.There were officers with stars upon their shoulders, and
others, quite as important in their bearing, decorated with the insignia of
a second lieutenant.Plain-looking men were pointed out as senators, and
elegantly dressed men were, at a glance, seen to be nobodies.Scarcely a
type was wanting among those who came to see how the nation's wards were
drilled and prepared to defend the nation's honor and maintain peace at the
point of the bayonet.On the piazzas of the officers' quarters were groups
of favored people whose relations or distinguished claims were such as to
give them this advantage over those who must stand where they could to see
the pageant.The cadets in their gray uniforms were conspicuously absent,
but the band was upon the plain discoursing lively music.From the
inclosure within the barracks came the long roll of a drum, and all eyes
turned thitherward expectantly.Soon from under the arched sally-port two
companies of cadets were seen issuing on the double-quick.They crossed the
plain with the perfect time and precision of a single mechanism, and passed
down into a depression of the ground toward the river.After an interval
the other two companies came out in like manner, and halted on the plain
within a few hundred yards of this depression, their bayonets scintillating
in the unclouded afternoon sun.Both parties were accompanied by mounted
cadet officers.The body on the plain threw out pickets, stacked arms, and
lounged at their ease.Suddenly a shot was fired to the eastward, then
another, and in that direction the pickets were seen running in.With
marvellous celerity the loungers on the plain seized their muskets, formed
ranks, and faced toward the point from which the attack was threatened.A
skirmish line was thrown out, and this soon met a similar line advancing
from the depression, sloping eastward.Behind the skirmishers came a
compact line of battle, and it advanced steadily until within fair musket
range, when the firing became general.While the attacking party appeared
to fight resolutely, it was soon observed that they made no further effort
to advance, but sought only to occupy the attention of the party to which
they were opposed.The Cliffords stood on the northwestern edge of the plain near the statue
of General Sedgwick, and from this point they could also see what was
occurring in the depression toward the river."Turn, Amy, quick, and see
what's coming," cried Burt.Stealing up the hillside in solid column was
another body of cadets.A moment later they passed near on the
double-quick, went into battle formation on the run, and with loud shouts
charged the flank and rear of the cadets on the plain, who from the first
had sustained the attack.These seemed thrown into confusion, for they were
now between two fires.After a moment of apparent indecision they gave way
rapidly in seeming defeat and rout, and the two attacking parties drew
together in pursuit.When they had united, the pursued, who a moment before
had seemed a crowd of fugitives, became almost instantly a steady line of
battle.rang out, and, with fixed bayonets, they
rushed upon their assailants, and steadily drove them back over the plain,
and down into their original position.It was all carried out with a far
degree of life-like reality.The "sing" of minie bullets was wanting, but
abundance of noise and sulphurous smoke can be made with blank cartridges;
and as the party attacked plucked victory from seeming defeat, the people's
acclamations were loud and long.At this point the horse of one of the cadet officers became unmanageable.They had all observed this rider during the battle, admiring the manner in
which he restrained the vicious brute, but at last the animal's excitement
or fear became so great that he rushed toward the crowded sidewalk and road
in front of the officers' quarters.Burt had scarcely time to do more than encircle Amy with his arm and sweep
her out of the path of the terrified beast.The cadet made heroic efforts,
until it was evident that the horse would dash into the iron fence beyond
the road, and then the young fellow was off and on his feet with the
agility of a cat, but he still maintained his hold upon the bridle.A
second later there was a heavy thud heard above the screams of women and
children and the shouts of those vociferating advice.The horse fell
heavily in his recoil from the fence, and in a moment or two was led
limping and crestfallen away, while the cadet quietly returned to his
comrades on the plain.Johnnie and little Ned were crying from fright, and
both Amy and Maggie were pale and nervous; therefore Leonard led the way
out of the crowd.From a more distant point they saw the party beneath the
hill rally for a final and united charge, which this time proved
successful, and the companies on the plain, after a stubborn resistance,
were driven back to the barracks, and through the sally-port, followed by
their opponents.The clouds of smoke rolled away, the band struck up a
lively air, and the lines of people broke up into groups and streamed in
all directions.Leonard decided that it would be best for them to return by
the evening boat, and not wait for parade, since the little yacht would
certainly be overcrowded at a later hour.CHAPTER XXXV

CHASED BY A THUNDER-SHOWER


The first one on the "Powell" to greet them was Webb, returning from the
city.Amy thought he looked so thin as to appear almost haggard, but he
seemed in the best of spirits, and professed to feel well and rested.She
half imagined that she missed a certain gentleness in his words and manner
toward her, but when he heard how nearly she had been trampled upon, she
was abundantly satisfied by his look of deep affection and solicitude as he
said: "Heaven bless your strong, ready arm, Burt!""Oh, that it had been
mine!"He masked his feelings so well, however,
that all perplexity passed from her mind.She was eager to visit the rose
garden with him, and when there he praised her quickly acquired skill so
sincerely that her face flushed with pleasure.No one seemed to enjoy the
late but ample supper more than he, or to make greater havoc in the
well-heaped dish of strawberries."I tasted none like these in New York,"
he said."After all, give me the old-fashioned kind.We've tried many
varieties, but the Triomphe de Gand proves the most satisfactory, if one
will give it the attention it deserves.The fruit ripens early and lasts
till late.It is firm and good even in cool, wet weather, and positively
delicious after a sunny day like this.""I agree with you, Webb," said his mother, smiling."It's the best of all
the kinds we've had, except, perhaps, the President Wilder, but that
doesn't bear well in our garden.""Well, mother," he replied, with a laugh, "the best is not too good for
you.I have a row of Wilders, however, for your especial benefit, but
they're late, you know."The next morning he went into the haying with as much apparent zest as
Leonard.The growth had been so heavy that
in many places it had "lodged," or fallen, and it had to be cut with
scythes.Later on, the mowing-machine would be used in the timothy fields
and meadows.Amy, from her open window, watched him as he steadily bent to
the work, and she inhaled with pleasure the odors from the bleeding clover,
for it was the custom of the Cliffords to cut their grasses early, while
full of the native juices.Rakes followed the scythes speedily, and the
clover was piled up into compact little heaps, or "cocks," to sweat out its
moisture rather than yield it to the direct rays of the sun.said Amy, at the dinner-table, "my bees won't fare so well, now
that you are cutting down so much of their pasture.""Red clover affords no pasturage for honey-bees," said Webb, laughing."How
easily he seems to laugh of late!""They can't reach the honey
in the long, tube-like blossoms.Here the bumble-bees have everything their
way, and get it all except what is sipped by the humming-birds, with their
long beaks, as they feed on the minute insects within the flowers.I've
heard the question, Of what use are bumble-bees?--I like to say _bumble_
best, as I did when a boy.Well, I've been told that red clover cannot be
raised without this insect, which, passing from flower to flower, carries
the fertilizing pollen.In Australia the rats and the field mice were so
abundant that they destroyed these bees, which, as you know, make their
nests on the ground, and so cats had to be imported in order to give the
bumble-bees and red clover a chance for life.There is always trouble in
nature unless an equilibrium is kept up.Much as I dislike cats, I must
admit that they have contributed largely toward the prosperity of an
incipient empire.""When I was a boy," remarked Leonard, "I was cruel enough to catch
bumble-bees and pull them apart for the sake of the sac of honey they
carry."Alf hung his head, and looked very conscious."Well, I ain't any worse than papa," said the boy.All through the afternoon the musical sound of whetting the scythes with
the rifle rang out from time to time, and in the evening Leonard said, "If
this warm, dry weather holds till to-morrow night, we shall get in our
clover in perfect condition."On the afternoon of the following day the two-horse wagon, surmounted by
the hay-rack, went into the barn again and again with its fragrant burden;
but at last Amy was aroused from her book by a heavy vibration of thunder.Going to a window facing the west, she saw a threatening cloud that every
moment loomed vaster and darker.The great vapory heads, tipped with light,
towered rapidly, until at last the sun passed into a sudden eclipse that
was so deep as to create almost a twilight.As the cloud approached, there
was a low, distant, continuous sound, quite distinct from nearer and
heavier peals, which after brief and briefer intervals followed the
lightning gleams athwart the gloom.She saw that the hay-makers were
gathering the last of the clover, and raking, pitching, and loading with
eager haste, their forms looking almost shadowy in the distance and the dim
light.Their task was nearly completed, and the horses' heads were turned
barnward, when a flash of blinding intensity came, with an instantaneous
crash, that roared away to the eastward with deep reverberations.Amy
shuddered, and covered her face with her hands.When she looked again, the
clover-field and all that it contained seemed annihilated.The air was
thick with dust, straws, twigs, and foliage torn away, and the gust passed
over the house with a howl of fury scarcely less appalling than the
thunder-peal had been.Trembling, and almost faint with fear, sho strained
her eyes toward the point where she had last seen Webb loading the
hay-rack.The murky obscurity lightened up a little, and in a moment or two
she saw him whipping the horses into a gallop.The doors of the barn stood
open, and the rest of the workers had taken a cross-cut toward it, while
Mr.Clifford was on the piazza, shouting for them to hurry.Great drops
splashed against the window-panes, and the heavy, monotonous sound of the
coming torrent seemed to approach like the rush of a locomotive.Webb, with
the last load, is wheeling to the entrance of the barn.A second later, and
the horses' feet resound on the planks of the floor.Then all is hidden,
and the rain pours against the window like a cataract.In swift alternation
of feeling she clapped her hands in applause, and ran down to meet Mr.Clifford, who, with much effort, was shutting the door against the gale.When he turned he rubbed his hands and laughed as he said, "Well, I never
saw Webb chased so sharply by a thunder-shower before; but he won the race,
and the clover's safe."The storm soon thundered away to parts unknown, the setting sun spanning
its retreating murkiness with a magnificent bow; long before the rain
ceased the birds were exulting in jubilant chorus, and the air grew still
and deliciously cool and fragrant.When at last the full moon rose over the
Beacon Mountains there was not a cloud above the horizon, and Nature, in
all her shower-gemmed and June-clad loveliness, was like a radiant beauty
lost in revery.CHAPTER XXXVI

THE RESCUE OF A HOME


Who remembers when his childhood ceased?Who can name the hour when
buoyant, thoughtless, half-reckless youth felt the first sobering touch of
manhood, or recall the day when he passed over the summit of his life, and
faced the long decline of age?As imperceptibly do the seasons blend when
one passes and merges into another.There were traces of summer in May,
lingering evidences of spring far into June, and even in sultry July came
days in which the wind in the groves and the chirp of insects at night
foretold the autumn.The morning that followed the thunder-shower was one of warm, serene
beauty.The artillery of heaven had done no apparent injury.A rock may
have been riven in the mountains, a lonely tree splintered, but homes were
safe, the warm earth was watered, and the air purified.With the dawn Amy's
bees were out at work, gleaning the last sweets from the white clover, that
was on the wane, from the flowers of the garden, field, and forest.The
rose garden yielded no honey: the queen of flowers is visited by no bees.The sweetbrier, or eglantine, belonging to this family is an exception,
however, and if the sweets of these wild roses could be harvested, an Ariel
would not ask for daintier sustenance.White and delicate pink hues characterize the flowers of early spring.In
June the wild blossoms emulate the skies, and blue predominates.In July
and August many of the more sensitive in Flora's train blush crimson under
the direct gaze of the sun.Yellow hues hold their own throughout the year,
from the dandelions that first star the fields to the golden-rod that
flames until quenched by frost and late autumn storms.During the latter part of June the annual roses of the garden were in all
stages and conditions.Beautiful buds could be gleaned among the developing
seed receptacles and matured flowers that were casting their petals on
every breeze.The thrips and the disgusting rose-bug were also making havoc
here and there.But an untiring vigilance watched over the rose garden.Morning, noon, and evening Webb cut away the fading roses, and Amy soon
learned to aid him, for she saw that his mind was bent on maintaining the
roses in this little nook at the highest attainable point of perfection.It
is astonishing how greatly nature can be assisted and directed by a little
skilled labor at the right time.Left to themselves, the superb varieties
in the rose garden would have spent the remainder of the summer and autumn
chiefly in the development of seed-vessels, and in resting after their
first bloom.But the pruning-knife had been too busy among them, and the
thoroughly fertilized soil sent up supplies that must be disposed of.As
soon as the bushes had given what may be termed their first annual bloom
they were cut back halfway to the ground, and dormant buds were thus forced
into immediate growth.Meanwhile the new shoots that in spring had started
from the roots were already loaded with buds, and so, by a little
management and attention, the bloom would be maintained until frosty nights
should bring the sleep of winter.No rose-bug escaped Webb's vigilant
search, and the foliage was so often sprayed by a garden syringe with an
infusion of white hellebore that thrips and slugs met their deserved fate
before they had done any injury.Clifford and Amy was
maintained a supply of these exquisite flowers, which in a measure became a
part of their daily food.On every side was the fulfilment of its innumerable
promises.The bluebird, with the softness of June in his notes, had told
his love amid the snows and gales of March, and now, with unabated
constancy, and with all a father's solicitude, he was caring for his third
nestful of fledglings.Young orioles were essaying flight from their
wind-rocked cradles on the outer boughs of the elms.Phoebe-birds, with
nests beneath bridges over running streams, had, nevertheless, the skill to
land their young on the banks.Nature was like a vast nursery, and from
gardens, lawns, fields, and forest the cries and calls of feathered infancy
were heard all day, and sometimes in the darkness, as owls, hawks, and
other night prowlers added to the fearful sum of the world's tragedies.The
cat-birds, that had built in some shrubbery near the house, had by the last
of June done much to gain Amy's good-will and respect.As their domestic
character and operations could easily be observed, she had visited them
almost daily from the time they had laid the dry-twig and leafy foundation
of their nest until its lining of fine dry grasses was completed.She bad
found that, although inclined to mock and gibe at outsiders, they were
loyal and affectionate to each other.In their home-building, in the
incubation of the deep bluish-green eggs, and in the care of the young, now
almost ready to fly, they had been mutually helpful and considerate,
fearless and even fierce in attacking all who approached too near their
domicile.To Amy and her daily visits they had become quite reconciled,
even as she had grown interested in them, in spite of a certain lack of the
high breeding which characterized the thrushes and other favorites."My better acquaintance with them," she said one evening to Dr.Marvin,
who, with his wife, had stopped at the Cliffords' in passing, "has taught
me a lesson.I think I'm too much inclined to sweeping censure on the
exhibition of a few disagreeable traits.I've learned that the gossips in
yonder bushes have some excellent qualities, and I suppose you find that
this is true of the gossips among your patients."Sandra moved to the hallway."Yes," replied the doctor, "but the human gossips draw the more largely on
one's charity; and if you knew how many pestiferous slugs and insects your
neighbors in the shrubbery have already destroyed, the human genus of
gossip would suffer still more in comparison."That Amy had become so interested in these out-door neighbors turned out to
their infinite advantage, for one morning their excited cries of alarm
secured her attention.Hastening to the locality of their nest, she looked
upon a scene that chilled the blood in her own veins.A huge black-snake
suspended his weight along the branches of the shrubbery with entire
confidence and ease, and was in the act of swallowing a fledgling that,
even as Amy looked, sent out its last despairing peep.The parent birds
were frantic with terror, and their anguish and fearless efforts to save
their young redeemed them forever in Amy's eyes.she cried, since, for some reason, he ever came first to her mind
in an emergency.It so happened that he had just come from the hay field to
rest awhile and prepare for dinner.In a moment he was at her side, and
followed with hasty glance her pointing finger."Come away, Amy," he said, as he looked at her pale face and dilated eyes."I do not wish you to witness a scene like that;" and almost by force he
drew her to the piazza.In a moment he was out with a breech-loading gun,
and as the smoke of the discharge lifted, she saw a writhing, sinuous form
fall heavily to the earth.After a brief inspection Webb came toward her in
smiling assurance, saying: "The wretch got only one of the little family.You have saved a home
from utter desolation.That, surely, will be a pleasant thing to remember.""What could I have done if you had not come?""I don't like to think of what you might have done--emulated the
mother-bird, perhaps, and flown at the enemy.""I did not know you were near when I called your name," she said."It was
entirely instinctive on my part; and I believe," she added, musingly,
looking with a child's directness into his eyes, "that one's instincts are
usually right; don't you?"He turned away to hide the feeling of intense pleasure caused by her words,
but only said, in a low voice, "I hope I may never fail you, Amy, when you
turn to me for help."Then he added, quickly, as if hastening away from
delicate ground: "While those large black-snakes are not poisonous, they
are ugly customers sometimes.I have read of an instance in which a boy put
his hand into the hole of a tree where there had been a bluebird's nest,
and touched the cold scales of one of these snakes.The boy took to his
heels, with the snake after him, and it is hard to say what would have
happened had not a man plowing near come to the rescue with a heavy
ox-whip.What I should fear most in your case would be a nervous shock had
the snake even approached you, for you looked as if you had inherited from
Mother Eve an unusual degree of hate for the reptile."The report of the gun had attracted Alf and others to the scene.Amy, with
a look of smiling confidence, said: "Perhaps you have rescued me as well as
the birds.I can't believe, though, that such a looking creature could have
tempted Eve to either good or evil;" and she entered the house, leaving him
in almost a friendly mood toward the cause of the cat-bird's woe.Alf exulted over the slain destroyer, and even Johnnie felt no compunction
at the violent termination of its life.The former, with much sportsmanlike
importance, measured it, and at the dinner-table announced its length to be
a little over four feet."By the way," said Webb, "your adventure, Amy, reminds me of one of the
finest descriptions I ever read;" and jumping up, he obtained from the
library Burroughs's account of a like scene and rescue."I will just give
you some glimpses of the picture," he said, reading the following
sentences: "'Three or four yards from me was the nest, beneath which, in
long festoons, rested a huge black-snake.I can conceive of nothing more
overpoweringly terrible to an unsuspecting family of birds than the sudden
appearance above their domicile of the head and neck of this arch enemy.One thinks of the great myth of the tempter and the cause of all our woe,
and wonders if the Arch-One is not playing off some of his pranks before
him.Whether we call it snake or devil matters little.I could but admire
his terrible beauty, however; his black, shining folds; his easy, gliding
movement--head erect, eyes glistening, tongue playing like subtile flame,
and the invisible means of his almost winged locomotion.Presently, as he
came gliding down the slender body of a leaning alder, his attention was
attracted by a slight movement of my arm; eying me an instant with that
crouching, utter, motionless gaze which I believe only snakes and devils
can assume, he turned quickly,'" etc.Clifford looked a little troubled that the scene in
Eden should be spoken of as merely a "myth."When she was a child "Paradise
Lost" had been her story-book, and the stories had become real to her.Burt, however, not to be outdone, recalled his classics."By the way," he said, "I can almost parallel your description from the
'Iliad' of Homer.I won't pretend that I can give you the Greek, and no
doubt it would be Greek to you.I'll get even with you, Webb, however, and
read an extract from Pope's translation," and he also made an excursion to
the library.Returning, he said, "Don't ask me for the connection," and
read:

  "'Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he rolled,
    And curled around in many a winding fold.The topmost branch a mother-bird possessed;
    Eight callow infants filled the mossy nest;
    Herself the ninth: the serpent as he hung
    Stretched his black jaws, and crashed the crying young:
    While hovering near, with miserable moan,
    The drooping mother wailed her children gone.The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
    Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew.'""I am now quite reconciled to your four years at
college.Heretofore I had thought you had passed through it as Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego passed through the fiery furnace, without even the
smell of fire upon their garments, but I now at last detect a genuine
Greek aroma.""I think Burt's quotation very pat," said Amy, "and I could not have
believed that anything written so long ago would apply so marvellously to
what I have seen to-day.""Marvellously pat, indeed," said Leonard."And since your quotation has
led to such a nice little pat on your classical back, Burt, you must feel
repaid for your long burning of the midnight oil."Burt flushed slightly, but he turned Leonard's shafts with smiling
assurance, and said: "Amply repaid.I have ever had an abiding confidence
that my education would be of use to me at some time."The long days grew hot, and often sultry, but the season brought
unremitting toil.The click of the mowing-machine, softened by distance,
came from field after field.As the grain in the rye grew plump and
heavy, the heads drooped more and more, and changed from a pale yellow to
the golden hue that announced the hour of harvest.In smooth and level
fields the reaping-machine also lightened and expedited labor, but there
was one upland <DW72> that was too rough for anything except the
old-fashioned cradle.On a breezy afternoon Amy went out to sketch the
harvesters, and from the shade of an adjacent tree to listen to the
rhythmical rush and rustle as the blade passed through the hollow stocks,
and the cradle dropped the gathered wealth in uniform lines.Almost
immediately the prostrate grain was transformed into tightly girthed
sheaves.How black Abram's great paw looked as he twisted a wisp of
straw, bound together the yellow stalks, and tucked under the end of his
improvised rope!Webb was leading the reapers, and they had to step quickly to keep pace
with him.As Amy appeared upon the scene he had done no more than take
off his hat and wave it to her, but as the men circled round the field
near her again, she saw that her acquaintance of the mountain cabin was
manfully bringing up the rear.Every time, before Lumley stooped to the
sweep of his cradle, she saw that he stole a glance toward her, and she
recognized him with cordial good-will.He, too, doffed his hat in
grateful homage, and as he paused a moment in his honest toil, and stood
erect, he unconsciously asserted the manhood that she had restored to
him.She caught his attitude, and he became the subject of her sketch.Rude and simple though it was, it would ever recall to her a pleasant
picture--the diminishing area of standing rye, golden in the afternoon
sunshine, with light billows running over it before the breeze, Webb
leading, with the strong, assured progress that would ever characterize
his steps through life, and poor Lumley, who had been wronged by
generations that had passed away, as well as by his own evil, following
in an honest emulation which she had evoked.CHAPTER XXXVII

A MIDNIGHT TEMPEST


As far as possible, the prudent Leonard, who was commander-in-chief of
the harvest campaign, had made everything snug before the Fourth of July,
which Alf ushered in with untimely patriotic fervor.Almost before the
first bird had taken its head from under its wing to look for the dawn,
he had fired a salute from a little brass cannon.Not very long afterward
the mountains up and down the river were echoing with the thunder of the
guns at West Point and Newburgh.The day bade fair to justify its
proverbial character for sultriness.Even in the early morning the air
was languid and the heat oppressive.The sun was but a few hours high
before the song of the birds almost ceased, with the exception of the
somewhat sleepy whistling of the orioles.They are half tropical in
nature as well as plumage, and their manner during the heat of the day is
like that of languid Southern beauties.They kept flitting here and there
through their leafy retirement in a mild form of restlessness, exchanging
soft notes--pretty nonsense, no doubt--which often terminated abruptly,
as if they had not energy enough to complete the brief strain attempted.Alf, with his Chinese crackers and his cannon, and Johnnie and Ned, with
their torpedoes, kept things lively during the forenoon, but their elders
were disposed to lounge and rest.The cherry-trees, laden with black and
white ox-hearts, were visited.One of the former variety was fairly
sombre with the abundance of its dark-hued fruit, and Amy's red lips grew
purple as Burt threw her down the largest and ripest from the topmost
boughs.Webb, carrying a little basket lined with grapevine leaves,
gleaned the long row of Antwerp raspberries.The first that ripen of this
kind are the finest and most delicious, and their strong aroma announced
his approach long before he reached the house.His favorite Triomphe de
Grand strawberries, that had supplied the table three weeks before, were
still yielding a fair amount of fruit, and his mother was never without
her dainty dish of pale red berries, to which the sun had been adding
sweetness with the advancing season until nature's combination left
nothing to be desired.By noon the heat was oppressive, and Alf and Ned were rolling on the
grass under a tree, quite satiated for a time with two elements of a
boy's elysium, fire-crackers and cherries.The family gathered in the
wide hall, through the open doors of which was a slight draught of air.All had donned their coolest costumes, and their talk was quite as
languid as the occasional notes and chirpings of the birds without.Amy
was reading a magazine in a very desultory way, her eyelids drooping over
every page before it was finished, Webb and Burt furtively admiring the
exquisite hues that the heat brought into her face, and the soft lustre
of her eyes.Clifford nodded over his newspaper until his
spectacles clattered to the floor, at which they all laughed, and asked
for the news.His invalid wife lay upon the sofa in dreamy, painless
repose.To her the time was like a long, quiet nooning by the wayside of
life, with all her loved band around her, and her large, dark eyes rested
on one and another in loving, lingering glances--each so different, yet
each so dear!Sensible Leonard was losing no time, but was audibly
resting in a great wooden rocking-chair at the further end of the hall.Maggie only, the presiding genius of the household, was not wilted by the
heat.She flitted in and out occasionally, looking almost girlish in her
white wrapper.She had the art of keeping house, of banishing dust and
disorder without becoming an embodiment of dishevelled disorder herself.No matter what she was doing, she always appeared trim and neat, and in
the lover-like expression of her husband's eyes, as they often followed
her, she had her reward.She was not deceived by the semi-torpid
condition of the household, and knew well what would be expected in a
Fourth-of-July dinner.Daniel went to the office.The tinkle of the bell
at two o'clock awakened unusual animation, and then she had her triumph.Leonard beamed upon a hind-quarter of lamb roasted to the nicest turn of
brownness.A great dish of Champion-of-England pease, that supreme
product of the kitchen-garden, was one of the time-honored adjuncts,
while new potatoes, the first of which had been dug that day, had half
thrown off their mottled jackets in readiness for the feast.Nature had
been Maggie's handmaid in spreading that table, and art, with its
culinary mysteries and combinations, was conspicuously absent.If Eve had
had a kitchen range and the Garden of Eden to draw upon, Adam could
scarcely have fared better than did the Clifford household that day.The
dishes heaped with strawberries, raspberries, cherries, and white
grape-currants that had been gathered with the dew upon them might well
tempt the most _blase_ resident of a town to man's primal calling.Before they reached their iced tea, which on this hot day took the place
of coffee, there was a distant peal of thunder."I knew it would come," said old Mr."We shall have a cool
night, after all.""A Fourth rarely passes without showers," Leonard remarked."That's why I
was so strenuous about getting all our grass and grain that was down
under cover yesterday.""You are not the only prudent one," Maggie added, complacently."I've
made my currant jelly, and it jellied beautifully: it always does if I
make it before the Fourth and the showers that come about this time.It's
queer, but a rain on the currants after they are fairly ripe almost
spoils them for jelly."The anticipations raised by the extreme sultriness were fulfilled at
first only in part.Instead of a heavy shower accompanied by violent
gusts, there was a succession of tropical and vertical down-pourings,
with now and then a sharp flash and a rattling peal, but usually a heavy
monotone of thunder from bolts flying in the distance.One great cloud
did not sweep across the sky like a concentrated charge, leaving all
clear behind it, as is so often the case, but, as if from an immense
reserve, Nature appeared to send out her vapory forces by battalions.Instead of enjoying the long siesta which she had promised herself, Amy
spent the afternoon in watching the cloud scenery.A few miles southwest
of the house was a prominent highland that happened to be in the direct
line of the successive showers.This formed a sort of gauge of their
advance.A cloud would loom up behind it, darken it, obscure it until it
faded out even as a shadow; then the nearer spurs of the mountains would
be blotted out, and in eight or ten minutes even the barn and the
adjacent groves would be but dim outlines through the myriad rain-drops.The cloud would soon be well to the eastward, the dim landscape take form
and distinctness, and the distant highland appear again, only to be
obscured in like manner within the next half-hour.It was as if invisible
and Titanic gardeners were stepping across the country with their
watering-pots.Burt and Webb sat near Amy at the open window, the former chatting
easily, and often gayly.Webb, with his deep-set eyes fixed on the
clouds, was comparatively silent.At last he rose somewhat abruptly, and
was not seen again until evening, when he seemed to be in unusually good
spirits.As the dusk deepened he aided Alf and Johnnie in making the
finest possible display of their fireworks, and for half an hour the
excitement was intense.Leonard and
his father, remembering the hay and grain already stored in the barn,
congratulated each other that the recent showers had prevented all danger
from sparks.After the last rocket had run its brief, fiery course, Alf and Johnnie
were well content to go with Webb, Burt, and Amy to an upper room whose
windows looked out on Newburgh Bay and to the westward.Near and far,
from their own and the opposite side of the river, rockets were flaming
into the sky, and Roman candles sending up their globes of fire.But
Nature was having a celebration of her own, which so far surpassed
anything terrestrial that it soon won their entire attention.A great
black cloud that hung darkly in the west was the background for the
electric pyrotechnics.Against this obscurity the lightning played almost
every freak imaginable.At one moment there would be an immense
illumination, and the opaque cloud would become vivid gold.Again, across
its blackness a dozen fiery rills of light would burn their way in zigzag
channels, and not infrequently a forked bolt would blaze earthward.Accompanying these vivid and central effects were constant illuminations
of sheet lightning all round the horizon, and the night promised to be a
carnival of thunder-showers throughout the land.The extreme heat
continued, and was rendered far more oppressive by the humidity of the
atmosphere.The awful grandeur of the cloud scenery at last so oppressed Amy that she
sought relief in Maggie's lighted room.As we have already seen, her
sensitive organization was peculiarly affected by an atmosphere highly
charged with electricity.She was not re-assured, for Leonard inadvertently
remarked that it would take "a rousing old-fashioned storm to cool and
clear the air.""Why, Amy," exclaimed Maggie, "how pale you are!and your eyes shine as
if some of the lightning had got into them.""I wish it was morning," said the girl."Such a sight oppresses me like a
great foreboding of evil;" and, with a restlessness she could not
control, she went down to Mrs.Clifford
fanning the invalid, who was almost faint from the heat.Amy took his
place, and soon had the pleasure of seeing her charge drop off into quiet
slumber.Clifford was very weary also, Amy left them to their
rest, and went to the sitting-room, where Webb was reading.Burt had
fallen asleep on the lounge in the hall.Leonard's prediction promised to
come true.The thunder muttered nearer and nearer, but it was a sullen,
slow, remorseless approach through the absolute silence and darkness
without, and therefore was tenfold more trying to one nervously
apprehensive than a swift, gusty storm would have been in broad day.Webb looked up and greeted her with a smile.His lamp was shaded, and the
room shadowy, so that he did not note that Amy was troubled and
depressed."I am running over
Hawthorne's 'English Note-Books' again.""Yes," she said, in a low voice; and she sat down with her back to the
windows, through which shone momentarily the glare of the coming tempest.He had not read a page before a long, sullen peal rolled across the
entire arc of the sky."Webb," faltered Amy, and she rose and took an
irresolute step toward him.Never had he heard sweeter music
than that low appeal, to which the deep echoes in the mountains formed a
strange accompaniment.He stepped to her side, took her hand, and found
it cold and trembling.Drawing her within the radiance of the lamp, he
saw how pale she was, and that her eyes were dilated with nervous dread."Webb," she began again, "do you--do you think there is danger?""No, Amy," he said, gently; "there is no danger for you in God's
universe.""Webb," she whispered, "won't you stay up till the storm is over?And you
won't think me weak or silly either, will you?I
wish I had a little of your courage and strength.""I like you best as you are," he said; "and all my strength is yours when
you need it.I understand you, Amy, and well know you cannot help this
nervous dread.I saw how these electrical storms affected you last
February, and such experiences are not rare with finely organized
natures.See, I can explain it all with my matter-of-fact philosophy.But, believe me, there is no danger.She looked at him affectionately as she said, with a child's unconscious
frankness: "I don't know why it is, but I always feel safe when with you.I often used to wish that I had a brother, and imagine what he would be
to me; but I never dreamed that a brother could be so much to me as you
are.--Oh, Webb!"and she almost clung to him, as the heavy thunder pealed
nearer than before.Involuntarily he encircled her with his arm, and drew her closer to him
in the impulse of protection.She felt his arm tremble, and wholly
misinterpreted the cause.Springing aloof, she clasped her hands, and
looked around almost wildly."Oh, Webb," she cried, "there is danger.Webb was human, and had nerves also, but all the thunder that ever roared
could not affect them so powerfully as Amy's head bowed upon his
shoulder, and the appealing words of her absolute trust.He mastered
himself instantly, however, for he saw that he must be strong and calm in
order to sustain the trembling girl through one of Nature's most awful
moods.She was equally sensitive to the smiling beauty and the wrath of
the great mother.The latter phase was much the same to her as if a loved
face had suddenly become black with reckless passion.He took both her
hands in a firm grasp, and said: "Amy, I am not afraid, and you must not
be.Come," he added, in tones almost
authoritative, "sit here by me, and give me your hand.I shall read to
you in a voice as quiet and steady as you ever heard me use."She obeyed, and he kept his word.His strong, even grasp reassured her in
a way that excited her wonder, and the nervous paroxysm of fear began to
pass away.While she did not comprehend what he read, his tones and
expression had their influence.His voice, however, was soon drowned by
the howling of the tempest as it rushed upon them.He felt her hand
tremble again, and saw her look apprehensively toward the windows."Amy," he said, and in smiling confidence he fixed his eyes on hers and
held them.The house rocked in the
furious blasts.The uproar without was frightful, suggesting that the
Evil One was in very truth the "prince of the power of the air," and that
he was abroad with all his legions.Amy trembled violently, but Webb's
hand and eyes held hers.he said, cheerily; "the storm is
passing."A wan, grateful smile glimmered for a moment on her pale face, and then
her expression passed into one of horror.With a cry that was lost in a
deafening crash, she sprang into his arms.Even Webb was almost stunned
and blinded for a moment.Burt at last had
been aroused from the slumber of youth, and, fortunately for his peace,
rushed first into his mother's room.Webb thought Amy had fainted, and he
laid her gently on the lounge."Don't leave me," she gasped, faintly."Amy," he said, earnestly, "I assure you that all danger is now over.As
I told you once before, the centre of the storm has passed.Maggie and Burt now came running in, and Webb said, "Amy has had a faint
turn.This revived her speedily, but the truth of Webb's words proved more
efficacious.The gale was sweeping the storm from the sky.The swish of
the torrents mattered little, for the thunder-peals died away steadily to
the eastward.Amy made a great effort to rally, for she felt ashamed of
her weakness, and feared that the others would not interpret her as
charitably as Webb had done.In a few minutes he smilingly withdrew, and
went out on the rear porch with Leonard, whence they anxiously scanned
the barn and out-buildings.These were evidently safe, wherever the bolt
had fallen, and it must have struck near.In half an hour there was a
line of stars along the western horizon, and soon the repose within the
old house was as deep as that of nature without.He sat at his open window, and saw the clouds
roll away.But he felt that a cloud deeper and murkier than any that had
ever blackened the sky hung over his life.He knew too well why his arm
had trembled when for a moment it encircled Amy.The deepest and
strongest impulse of his soul was to protect her, and her instinctive
appeal to him had raised a tempest in his heart as wild as that which had
raged without.He felt that he could not yield her to another, not even
to his brother.It was to him she
turned and clung in her fears.And yet she had not even dreamed of his
untold wealth of love, and probably never would suspect it.He could not
reveal it--indeed, it must be the struggle of his life to hide it--and
she, while loving him as a brother, might easily drift into an engagement
and marriage with Burt.Could he be patient, and wear a smiling mask
through it all?That tropical night and its experiences taught him anew
that he had a human heart, with all its passionate cravings.When he came
down from his long vigil on the following morning his brow was as serene
as the scene without.Amy gave him a grateful and significant smile, and
he smiled back so naturally that observant Burt, who had been a little
uneasy over the events of the previous night, was wholly relieved of
anxiety.They had scarcely seated themselves at the breakfast-table
before Alf came running in, and said that an elm not a hundred yards from
the house had been splintered from the topmost branch to the roots.Clifford went out to look at the smitten tree, and they gazed
with awe at the deep furrow plowed in the blackened wood."It will live," said Webb, quietly, as he turned away; "it will probably
live out its natural life."Amy, in her deep sympathy, looked after him curiously.There was
something in his tone and manner which suggested a meaning beyond his
words.Not infrequently he had puzzled her of late, and this added to her
interest in him.Clifford saw in the shattered tree only reasons for profound
thankfulness, and words of Christian gratitude rose to his lips.CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE TWO LOVERS


The July sun speedily drank up the superabundant moisture, and the farm
operations went on with expedition.The corn grew green and strong, and
its leaves stretched up to Abram's shoulder as he ran the cultivator
through it for the last time.The moist sultriness of the Fourth finished
the ox-heart cherries.They decayed at once, to Alf's great regret."That
is the trouble with certain varieties of cherries," Webb remarked."One
shower will often spoil the entire crop even before it is ripe."But it
so happened that there were several trees of native or ungrafted fruit on
the place, and these supplied the children and the birds for many days
thereafter.The robins never ceased gorging themselves.Indeed, they were
degenerating into shameless _gourmands_, and losing the grace of
song, as were also the bobolinks in the meadows.Already there was a perceptible decline in the morning and evening
minstrelsy of all the birds, and, with the exception of calls and
twitterings, they grew more and more silent through the midday heat.With
the white bloom of the chestnut-trees the last trace of spring passed
away.Summer reached its supreme culmination, and days that would not be
amiss at the equator were often followed by nights of breathless
sultriness.Early in the month haying and harvest were over, and the last
load that came down the lane to the barn was ornamented with green
boughs, and hailed with acclamations by the farm hands, to whom a
generous supper was given, and something substantial also to take home to
their families.As the necessity for prompt action and severe labor passed, the Cliffords
proved that their rural life was not one of plodding, unredeemed toil.For the next few weeks Nature would give them a partial respite.She
would finish much of the work which they had begun.The corn would
mature, the oats ripen, without further intervention on their part.By
slow but sure alchemy the fierce suns would change the acid and bitter
juices in the apples, peaches, plums, and pears into nectar.Already Alf
was revelling in the harvest apples, which, under Maggie's culinary
magic, might tempt an ascetic to surfeit.While Burt had manfully done his part in the harvest-field, he had not
made as long hours as the others, and now was quite inclined to enjoy to
the utmost a season of comparative leisure.He was much with Amy, and she
took pleasure in his society, for, as she characterized his manner in her
thoughts, he had grown very sensible.He had accepted the situation, and
he gave himself not a little credit for his philosophical patience.He
regarded himself as committed to a deep and politic plan, in which,
however, there was no unworthy guile.He would make himself essential to
Amy's happiness.He would be so quietly and naturally devoted to her that
she would gradually come to look forward to a closer union as a matter of
course.He also made it clear to her that she had no rivals in his
thoughts, or even admiration, and, as far as courtesy permitted, withdrew
from the society of a few favorites who once had welcomed him gladly and
often.He had even pretended indifference to the advent of a dark-eyed
beauty to the neighborhood, and had made no efforts to form her
acquaintance.This stranger from the city was so charming, however, that
he had felt more than once that he was giving no slight proof of
constancy.His fleet horse Thunder was his great ally, and in the long
twilight evenings, he, with Amy, explored the country roads far and near.When the early mornings were not too warm they rowed upon the river, or
went up the Moodna Creek for water-lilies, which at that hour floated
upon the surface with their white petals all expanded--beautiful emblems
of natures essentially good.From mud and slime they developed purity and
fragrance.He was also teaching Amy to be an expert horsewoman, and they
promised themselves many a long ride when autumn coolness should make
such exercise more agreeable.Burt was a little surprised at his tranquil enjoyment of all this
companionship, but nevertheless prided himself upon it.He was not so
mercurial and impetuous as the others had believed him to be, but was
capable of a steady and undemonstrative devotion.Amy was worth winning
at any cost, and he proposed to lay such a patient siege that she could
not fail to become his.Indeed, with a disposition toward a little
retaliation, he designed to carry his patience so far as to wait until he
had seen more than once an expression in her eyes that invited warmer
words and manner.But he had to admit that time was passing, and that no
such expression appeared.This piqued him a little, and he felt that he
was not appreciated.The impression grew upon him that she was very
young--unaccountably young for one of her years.She enjoyed his bright
talk and merry ways with much the same spirit that Alf's boyish
exuberance called forth.She had the natural love of all young, healthful
natures for pleasure and change, and she unconsciously acted toward him
as if he were a kind, jolly brother who was doing much to give the spice
of variety to her life.At the same time her unawakened heart was
disposed to take his view of the future.Why should she not marry him,
after her girlhood had passed?All the family wished and expected it, and
surely she liked him exceedingly.But it would be time enough for such
thoughts years hence.He had the leisure and self-control for
good-comradeship, and without questioning she enjoyed it.Her life was
almost as free from care as that of the young birds that had begun their
existence in June.Only Webb perplexed and troubled her a little.At this season, when even
Leonard indulged in not a little leisure and rest, he was busy and
preoccupied.She could not say that he avoided her, and yet it seemed to
happen that they were not much together."I fear I'm too young and
girlish to be a companion for him," she sighed."His manner is just as
kind and gentle, but he treats me as if I were his very little sister.I
don't seem to have the power to interest him that I once had.I wish I
knew enough to talk to him as he would like;" and she stealthily tried to
read some of the scientific books that she saw him poring over.He, poor fellow, was engaged in the most difficult task ever given to
man--the ruling of his own spirit.He saw her sisterly solicitude and
goodwill, but could not respond in a manner as natural as her own.His best resource was the comparative
solitude of constant occupation.He was growing doubtful, however, as to
the result of his struggle, while Amy was daily becoming more lovely in
his eyes.Her English life had not destroyed the native talent of an
American girl to make herself attractive.She knew instinctively how to
dress, how to enhance the charms of which nature had not been chary, and
Webb's philosophy and science were no defence against her winsomeness.In
her changeful eyes lurked spells too mighty for him.Men of his caste
rarely succumb to a learned and aggressive woman.They require
intelligence, but it is a feminine intelligence, which supplements their
own, and is not akin to it.Webb saw in Amy all that his heart craved,
and he believed that he also saw her fulfilling Burt's hopes.She seemed
to be gradually learning that the light-hearted brother might bring into
her life all the sunshine and happiness she could desire.Webb
depreciated himself, and believed that he was too grave and dull to win
in any event more than the affection which she would naturally feel for
an elder brother, and this she already bestowed upon him frankly and
unstintedly.Burt took the same view, and was usually complacency itself,
although a week seemed a long time to him, and he sometimes felt that he
ought to be making more progress.He would be
faithful for years, and Amy could not fail to reward such constancy.CHAPTER XXXIX

BURT'S ADVENTURE


Not only had the little rustic cottages which had been placed on poles
here and there about the Clifford dwelling, and the empty tomato-cans
which Alf, at Dr.Marvin's suggestion, had fastened in the trees, been
occupied by wrens and bluebirds, but larger homes had been taken for the
summer by migrants from the city.Hargrove, a
wealthy gentleman, who had rented a pretty villa on the banks of the
Hudson, a mile or two away.Burt, with all his proposed lifelong
constancy, had speedily discovered that Mr.Hargrove had a very pretty
daughter.Of course, he was quite indifferent to the fact, but he could
no more meet a girl like Gertrude Hargrove and be unobservant than could
Amy pass a new and rare wildflower with unregarding eyes.Miss Hargrove
was not a wildflower, however.She was a product of city life, and was
perfectly aware of her unusual and exotic beauty.Admiring eyes had
followed her even from childhood, and no one better than she knew her
power.Her head had been quite turned by flattery, but there was a saving
clause in her nature--her heart.She was a belle, but not a cold-blooded
coquette.Admiration was like sunshine--a matter of course.She had
always been accustomed to it, as she had been to wealth, and neither had
spoiled her.Beneath all that was artificial, all that fashion prescribed
and society had taught, was the essential womanhood which alone can win
and retain a true man's homage.For reasons just the reverse of those
which explained Amy's indisposition to sentiment, she also had been kept
fancy-free.Seclusion and the companionship of her father, who had been
an invalid in his later years, had kept the former a child in many
respects, at a time when Miss Hargrove had her train of admirers.Miss
Gertrude enjoyed the train very much, but showed no disposition to permit
any one of its constituents to monopolize her.Indeed, their very numbers
had been her safety.Her attention had been divided and distracted by a
score of aspirants, and while in her girlish eyes some found more favor
than others, she was inclined to laughing criticism of them all.They
amused her immensely, and she puzzled them.Her almost velvety black
eyes, and the rich, varying tints of her clear brunette complexion,
suggested a nature that was not cold and unresponsive, yet many who would
gladly have won the heiress for her own sake found her as elusive as only
a woman of perfect tact and self-possession can be.She had no vulgar
ambition to count her victims who had committed themselves in words.With
her keen intuition and abundant experience she recognized the first
glance that was warmer than mere friendliness, and this was all the
committal she wished for.She loved the admiration of men, but was too
good-hearted a girl to wish to make them cynics in regard to women.She
also had the sense to know that it is a miserable triumph to lure a man
to the declaration of a supreme regard, and then in one moment change it
into contempt.While, therefore, she had refused many an offer, no one
had been humiliated, no one had been made to feel that he had been
unworthily trifled with.Thus she retained the respect and goodwill of
those to whom she might easily have become the embodiment of all that was
false and heartless.She had welcomed the comparative seclusion of the
villa on the Hudson, for, although not yet twenty, she was growing rather
weary of society and its exactions.Its pleasures had been tasted too
often, its burdens were beginning to be felt.She was a good horsewoman,
and was learning, under the instruction of a younger brother, to row as
easily and gracefully on the river as she danced in the ballroom, and she
found the former recreation more satisfactory, from its very novelty.Burt was well aware of these outdoor accomplishments.Any one inclined to
rural pleasures won his attention at once; and Miss Hargrove, as she
occasionally trotted smartly by him, or skimmed near on the waters of the
Hudson, was a figure sure to win from his eyes more than a careless
glance.Thus far, as has been intimated, he had kept aloof, but he had
observed her critically, and he found little to disapprove.She also was
observing him, and was quite as well endowed as he with the power of
forming a correct judgment.Men of almost every description had sought
her smiles, but he did not suffer by comparison.His tall, lithe figure
was instinct with manly grace.There was a fascinating trace of reckless
boldness in his blue eyes.He rode like a centaur, and at will made his
light boat, in which Amy was usually seated, cut through the water with
spray flying from its prow.In Miss Hargrove's present mood for rural
life she wished for his acquaintance, and was a little piqued that he had
not sought hers, since her father had opened the way.Hargrove, soon after his arrival in the neighborhood, had had
business transactions with the Cliffords, and had learned enough about
them to awaken a desire for social relations, and he had courteously
expressed his wishes.Maggie and Amy had fully intended compliance, but
the harvest had come, time had passed, and the initial call had not been
made.Leonard was averse to such formalities, and, for reasons already
explained, Burt and Webb were in no mood for them.They would not have
failed in neighborliness much longer, however, and a call was proposed
for the first comparatively cool day.A little incident now occurred
which quite broke the ice, and also somewhat disturbed Burt's serenity.Amy was not feeling very well, and he had gone out alone for a ride on
his superb black horse Thunder.In a shady road some miles away, where
the willows interlaced their branches overhead in a long, Gothic-like
arch, he saw Miss Hargrove, mounted also, coming slowly toward him.He
never forgot the picture she made under the rustic archway.Her fine
horse was pacing along with a stately tread, his neck curved under the
restraining bit, while she was evidently amusing herself by talking, for
the want of a better companion, to an immense Newfoundland dog that was
trotting at her side, and looking up to her in intelligent appreciation.Thus, in her preoccupation, Burt was permitted to draw comparatively
near, but as soon as she observed him it was evidently her intention to
pass rapidly.As she gave her horse the rein and he leaped forward, she
clutched his mane, and by a word brought him to a standstill.Burt saw
the trouble at once, for the girth of her saddle had broken, and hung
loosely down.Only by prompt action and good horsemanship had she kept
her seat.Now she was quite helpless, for an attempt to dismount would
cause the heavy saddle to turn, with unknown and awkward results.She had
recognized Burt, and knew that he was a gentleman; therefore she patted
her horse and quieted him, while the young man came promptly to her
assistance.He, secretly exulting over the promise of an adventure, said,
suavely, as he lifted his hat:

"Miss Hargrove, will you permit me to aid you?""Certainly," she replied, smiling so pleasantly that the words did not
seem ungracious; "I have no other resource."He bowed, leaped lightly to the ground, and fastened his horse by the
roadside; then came forward without the least embarrassment."Your
saddle-girth has broken," he said.You maintained your seat admirably, but a very slight
movement on your part will cause the saddle to turn.""I know that," she replied, laughing.I
am only anxious to reach ground in safety;" and she dropped the reins,
and held out her hands."Your horse is too high for you to dismount in that way," he said,
quietly, "and the saddle might fall after you and hurt you.Pardon me;"
and he encircled her with his right arm, and lifted her gently off.She blushed like the western sky, but he was so grave and apparently
solicitous, and his words had made his course seem so essential, that she
could not take offence.Indeed, he was now giving his whole attention to
the broken girth, and she could only await the result of his examination."I think I can mend it with a strap from my bridle so that it will hold
until you reach home," he said; "but I am sorry to say that I cannot make
it very secure.Clifford, I think," she began, hesitatingly.Clifford, and, believe me, I am wholly at your service.If you
had not been so good a horsewoman you might have met with a very serious
accident.""More thanks are due to you, I imagine," she replied; "though I suppose I
could have got off in some way.""There would have been no trouble in your getting off," he said, with one
of his frank, contagious smiles; "but then your horse might have run
away, or you would have had to lead him some distance, at least.Perhaps
it was well that the girth gave way when it did, for it would have broken
in a few moments more, in any event.Therefore I hope you will tolerate
one not wholly unknown to you, and permit me to be of service.""Indeed, I have only cause for thanks.I have interfered with your ride,
and am putting you to trouble.""I was only riding for pleasure, and as yet you have had all the
trouble."She did not look excessively annoyed, and in truth was enjoying the
adventure quite as much as he was, but she only said: "You have the
finest horse there I ever saw."I fear he would be ungallant."I should not be afraid so long as the saddle remained firm.At the sound of his name the beautiful animal arched his neck
and whinnied."There, be quiet, old fellow, and speak when you are spoken
to," Burt said."He is comparatively gentle with me, but uncontrollable
by others.I have now done my best, Miss Hargrove, and I think you may
mount in safety, if you are willing to walk your horse quietly home.But
I truly think I ought to accompany you, and I will do so gladly, with
your permission.""But it seems asking a great deal of-"

"Of a stranger?I wish I knew how to bring about a formal introduction.Will you not in the emergency defer the introduction
until we arrive at your home?""I think we may as well dispense with it altogether," she said, laughing."It would be too hollow a formality after the hour we must spend
together, since you think so slow a pace is essential to safety.Events,
not we, are to blame for all failures in etiquette.""I was coming to call upon you this very week with the ladies of our
house," he began."I assure you of the truth of what I say," he continued, earnestly,
turning his handsome eyes to hers.Then throwing his head back a little
proudly, he added, "Miss Hargrove, you must know that we are farmers, and
midsummer brings the harvest and unwonted labors."With a slight, piquant imitation of his manner, she said: "My father, you
must know, Mr.Clifford, is a merchant Is not that an equally respectable
calling?""Some people regard it as far more so."There is no higher rank than that of a
gentleman, Mr.He took off his hat, and said, laughingly: "I hope it is not presumption
to imagine a slight personal bearing in your remark.At least, let me
prove that I have some claim to the title by seeing you safely home.Put your foot in my hand, and bear your whole weight upon it,
and none upon the saddle.""You don't know how heavy I am.""No, but I know I can lift you.Without the least effort she found herself in the saddle."Yes," he replied, laughing; "I developed my muscle, if not my brains, at
college."In a moment he vaulted lightly upon his horse, that reared proudly, but,
at a word from his master, arched his neck and paced as quietly as Miss
Hargrove's better-trained animal.Burt's laugh would have thawed Mrs.He was so vital with youth and vigor, and his flow of
spirits so irresistible, that Miss Hargrove found her own nerves tingling
with pleasure.The episode was novel, unexpected, and promised so much
for the future, that in her delightful excitement she cast conventionality
to the winds, and yielded to his sportive mood.They had not gone a mile
together before one would have thought they had been acquainted for years.Burt's frank face was like the open page of a book, and the experienced
society girl saw nothing in it but abounding good-nature, and an enjoyment
as genuine as her own.She was on the alert for traces of provincialism and
rusticity, but was agreeably disappointed at their absence.He certainly
was unmarked, and, to her taste, unmarred, by the artificial mode of the
day, but there was nothing under-bred in his manner or language.He rather
fulfilled her ideal of the light-hearted student who had brought away the
air of the university without being oppressed by its learning.She saw,
with a curious little blending of pique and pleasure, that he was not in
the least afraid of her, and that, while claiming to be simply a farmer, he
unconsciously asserted by every word and glance that he was her equal.She
had the penetration to recognize from the start that she could not
patronize him in the slightest degree, that he was as high-spirited as he
was frank and easy in manner, and she could well imagine that his mirthful
eyes would flash with anger on slight provocation.She had never met just
such a type before, and every moment found her more and more interested and
amused.It must be admitted that his sensations kept pace with hers.Many had
found Miss Hargrove's eyes singularly effective under ordinary
circumstances, but now her mood gave them an unwonted lustre and power.Her color was high, her talk animated and piquant.Even an enemy, had she
had one, would have been forced to admit that she was dazzlingly
beautiful, and inflammable Burt could not be indifferent to her charms.He knew that he was not, but complacently assured himself that he was a
good judge in such matters.Hargrove met them at the door, and his daughter laughingly told him
of her mishap.She evidently reposed in him the utmost confidence.He
justified it by meeting her in like spirit with her own, and he
interpreted her unspoken wishes by so cordially pressing Burt to remain
to dinner that he was almost constrained to yield."You will be too late
for your own evening meal," he said, "and your kindness to my daughter
would be ill-requited, and our reputation for hospitality would suffer,
should we let you depart without taking salt with us.Burt was the last one to have any scruples on such grounds, and he
resolved to have his "lark" out, as he mentally characterized it.Hargrove had been something of a sportsman in his earlier days, and the
young fellow's talk was as interesting to him as it had been to Miss
Gertrude.Fred, her younger brother, was quite captivated, and elegant
Mrs.Hargrove, like her daughter, watched in vain for mannerisms to
criticise in the breezy youth.The evening was half gone before Burt
galloped homeward, smiling broadly to himself at the adventure.His absence had caused little remark in the family.It had been taken for
granted that he was at Dr.Marvin's or the parsonage, for the young
fellow was a great favorite with their pastor.When he entered the
sitting-room, however, there was a suppressed excitement in his manner
which suggested an unusual experience.He was not slow in relating all
that had happened, for the thought had occurred to him that it might be
good policy to awaken a little jealousy in Amy.In this effort he was
obliged to admit to himself that he failed signally.Even Webb's
searching eyes could not detect a trace of chagrin.She only seemed very
much amused, and was laughingly profuse in her congratulations to Burt.Moreover, she was genuinely interested in Miss Hargrove, and eager to
make her acquaintance."If she is as nice as you say, Burt," she
concluded, "she would make a pleasant addition to our little excursions
and pleasure parties.Perhaps she's old and bright enough to talk to
Webb, and draw him out of his learned preoccupation," she added, with a
shy glance toward the one who was growing too remote from her daily life.Even his bronzed face flushed, but he said, with a laugh: "She is evidently
much too bright for me, and would soon regard me as insufferably stupid.I
have never found much favor with city dames, or with dames of any
description, for that matter.""So much the worse for the dames, then," she replied, with a piquant nod
at him."Little sisters are apt to be partial judges--at least, one is," he said,
smilingly, as he left the room.He walked out in the moonlight, thinking:
"There was not a trace of jealousy in her face.Burt's perfect frankness was enough to prevent anything of the kind.If there had been cause for jealousy, he would have been reticent.Besides, Amy is too high-toned to yield readily to this vice, and Burt
can never be such an idiot as to endanger his prospects."A scheme, however, was maturing in Burt's busy brain that night, which he
thought would be a master-stroke of policy.He was quite aware of the
good impression that he had made on Miss Hargrove, and he determined that
Amy's wishes should be carried out in a sufficient degree at least to
prove to her that a city belle would not be wholly indifferent to his
attentions."I'll teach the coy little beauty that others are not so
blind as she is, and I imagine that, with Miss Hargrove's aid, I can
disturb her serenity a little before many weeks pass."CHAPTER XL

MISS HARGROVE


But a few days elapsed before Mr.Clifford, with Burt, Maggie, and Amy,
made the call which would naturally inaugurate an exchange of social
visits.Hargrove was especially interested in the old gentleman, and
they were at once deep in rural affairs.Maggie was a little reserved at
first with Mrs.Hargrove, but the latter, with all her stateliness, was a
zealous housekeeper, and so the two ladies were soon _en rapport._

The young people adjourned to the piazza, and their merry laughter and
animated talk proved that if there had been any constraint it was
vanishing rapidly.Amy was naturally a little shy at first, but Miss
Hargrove had the tact to put her guests immediately at ease.She proposed
to have a good time during the remainder of the summer, and saw in Burt a
means to that end, while she instinctively felt that she must propitiate
Amy in order to accomplish her purpose.Therefore she was disposed to pay
a little court to her on general principles.She had learned that the
young girl was a ward of Mr.What Burt was to Amy she did not
know, but was sure she could soon find out, and his manner had led to the
belief that he was not a committed and acknowledged lover.She made no
discoveries, however, for he was not one to display a real preference in
public, and indeed, in accordance with his scheme, she received his most
marked attentions.She could
not immediately accept of this genuine child of nature, whose very
simplicity was puzzling.It might be the perfection of well-bred reserve,
such complete art as to appear artless.Miss Hargrove had been in society
too long to take anything impulsively on trust.Still, she was charmed
with the young girl, and Amy was also genuinely pleased with her new
acquaintance.Before they parted a horseback ride was arranged, at Burt's
suggestion, for the next afternoon.This was followed by visits that soon
lost all formality, boating on the river, other rides, drives, and
excursions to points of interest throughout the region.Webb was
occasionally led to participate in these, but he usually had some excuse
for remaining at home.He, also, was a new type to Miss Hargrove,
"indigenous to the soil," she smilingly said to herself, "and a fine
growth too.With his grave face and ways he makes a splendid contrast to
his brother."She found him too reticent for good-fellowship, and he gave
her the impression also that he knew too much about that which was remote
from her life and interests.At the same time, with her riper experience,
she speedily divined his secret, to which Amy was blind."He could almost
say his prayers to Amy," she thought, as she returned after an evening
spent at the Cliffords', "and she doesn't know it."With all his frankness, Burt's relations to Amy still baffled her.She
sometimes thought she saw his eyes following the young girl with
lover-like fondness, and she also thought that he was a little more
pronounced in his attentions to her in Amy's absence.Acquaintanceship
ripened into intimacy as plans matured under the waning suns of July, and
the girls often spent the night together.Amy was soon beguiled into
giving her brief, simple history, omitting, of course, all reference to
Bart's passionate declaration and his subsequent expectations.As far as
she herself was concerned, she had no experiences of this character to
relate, and her nature was much too fine to gossip about Burt.Miss
Hargrove soon accepted Amy's perfect simplicity as a charming fact, and
while the young girl had all the refinement and intelligence of her city
friend, the absence of certain phases of experience made her companionship
all the more fascinating and refreshing.It was seen that she had grown
thus far in secluded and sheltered nooks, and the ignorance that resulted
was like morning dew upon a flower.Of one thing her friend thought herself
assured--Burt had never touched Amy's heart, and she was as unconscious of
herself as of Webb's well-hidden devotion.The Clifford family interested
Miss Gertrude exceedingly, and her innate goodness of heart was proved by
the fact that she soon became a favorite with Mr.She
never came to the house without bringing flowers to the latter--not only
beautiful exotics from the florists, but wreaths of clematis, bunches of
meadow-rue from her rambles, and water-lilies and cardinal-flowers from
boating excursions up the Moodna Creek--and the secluded invalid enjoyed
her brilliant beauty and piquant ways as if she had been a rare flower
herself.Burt had entered on his scheme with the deepest interest and with
confident expectations.As time passed, however, he found that he could
not pique Amy in the slightest degree; that she rather regarded his
interest in Miss Hargrove as the most natural thing in the world, because
she was so interesting.Therefore he at last just let himself drift, and
was content with the fact that the summer was passing delightfully.That
Miss Hargrove's dark eyes sometimes quickened his pulse strangely did not
trouble him; it had often been quickened before.When they were alone,
and she sang to him in her rich contralto, and he, at her request, added
his musical tenor, it seemed perfectly natural that he should bend over
her toward the notes in a way that was not the result of near-sightedness.Burt was amenable to other attractions than that of gravitation.Webb was the only one not blind to the drift of events.While he forbore
by word or sign to interfere, he felt that new elements were entering
into the problem of the future.He drove the farm and garden work along
with a tireless energy against which even Leonard remonstrated.But Webb
knew that his most wholesome antidote for suspense and trouble was work,
and good for all would come of his remedy.He toiled long hours in the
oat harvest.He sowed seed which promised a thousand bushels of turnips.Land foul with weeds, or only half subdued, he sowed with that best of
scavenger crops, buckwheat, which was to be plowed under as soon as in
blossom.The vegetable and fruit gardens gave him much occupation, also,
and the table fairly groaned under the over-abundant supply, while Abram
was almost daily despatched to the landing or to neighboring markets with
loads of various produce.The rose garden, however, seemed to afford Webb
his chief recreation and a place of rest, and the roses in Amy's belt
were the wonder and envy of all who saw them.His mother sometimes looked
at him curiously, as he still brought to her the finest specimens, and
one day she said: "Webb, I never knew even you to be so tireless before.You are growing very thin, and you are certainly going beyond your
strength, and--forgive me--you seem restlessly active.Have you any
trouble in which mother can help you?""You always help me, mother," he said, gently; "but I have no trouble
that requires your or any one's attention.I like to be busy, and there
is much to do.I am getting the work well along, so that I can take a
trip in August, and not leave too much for Leonard to look after."August came, and with it the promise of drought, but he and his elder
brother had provided against it.The young trees had been well mulched
while the ground was moist, and deep, thorough cultivation rendered the
crops safe unless the rainless period should be of long duration.Already in the rustling foliage there were whisperings of autumn.The
nights grew longer, and were filled with the sounds of insect life.The
robins disappeared from about the house, and were haunting distant
groves, becoming as wild as they had formerly been domestic.The season
of bird song was over for the year.The orioles whistled in a languid and
desultory way occasionally, and the smaller warblers sometimes gave
utterance to defective strains, but the leaders of the feathered chorus,
the thrushes, were silent.The flower-beds flamed with geraniums and
salvias, and were gay with gladioli, while Amy and Mrs.Clifford exulted
in the extent and variety of their finely quilled and rose-like asters
and dahlias.The foliage of the trees had gained its darkest hues, and
the days passed, one so like another that nature seemed to be taking a
summer siesta.CHAPTER XLI

A FIRE IN THE MOUNTAINS


A day in August can be as depressing as a typical one in May is
inspiring, or in June entrancing.As the season advanced Nature appeared
to be growing languid and faint.There was neither cloud by day nor dew
at night.The sun burned rather than vivified the earth, and the grass
and herbage withered and shrivelled before its unobstructed rays.The
foliage along the roadsides grew dun- from the dust, and those who
rode or drove on thoroughfares were stifled by the irritating clouds that
rose on the slightest provocation.Pleasure could be found only on the
unfrequented lanes that led to the mountains or ran along their bases.Even there trees that drew their sustenance from soil spread thinly on
the rocks were seen to be dying, their leaves not flushing with autumnal
tints, but hanging limp and bleached as if they had exhaled their vital
juices.The moss beneath them, that had been softer to the tread than a
Persian rug, crumbled into powder under the foot.Alf went to gather
huckleberries, but, except in moist and swampy places, found them
shrivelled on the bushes.Even the corn leaves began to roll on the
uplands, and Leonard shook his head despondingly.Webb's anxieties,
however, were of a far deeper character, and he was philosophical enough
to average the year's income.If the cows did come home hungry from their
pasture, there was abundance of hay and green-corn fodder to carry them
through until the skies should become more propitious.Besides, there was
an unfailing spring upon the place, and from this a large cask on wheels
was often filled, and was then drawn by one of the quiet farm-horses to
the best of the flower beds, the young trees, and to such products of the
garden as would repay for the expenditure of time and labor.The ground
was never sprinkled so that the morning sun of the following day would
drink up the moisture, but so deluged that the watering would answer for
several days.It was well known that partial watering does only harm.Nature can be greatly assisted at such times, but it must be in
accordance with her laws.The grapevine is a plant that can endure an
unusual degree of drought, and the fruit will be all the earlier and
sweeter for it.An excellent fertilizer for the grape is suds from the
laundry, and by filling a wide, shallow basin, hollowed out from the
earth around the stems, with this alkaline infusion, the vines were kept
in the best condition.The clusters of the earlier varieties were already
beginning to color, and the season insured the perfect ripening of those
fine old kinds, the Isabella and Catawba, that too often are frost-bitten
before they become fit for the table.Thus it would appear that Nature has compensations for her worst
moods--greater compensations than are thought of by many.Drought causes
the roots of plants and trees to strike deep, and so extends the range of
their feeding-ground, and anchors vegetation of all kinds more firmly in
the soil.Nevertheless, a long dry period is always depressing.The bright green
fades out of the landscape, the lawns and grass-plots become brown and
sear, the air loses its sweet, refreshing vitality, and is often so
charged with smoke from forest-fires, and impalpable dust, that
respiration is not agreeable.Apart from considerations of profit and
loss, the sympathy of the Clifford household was too deep with Nature to
permit the indifference of those whose garden is the market stall and the
florist's greenhouse, and to whom vistas in hotel parlors and piazzas are
the most attractive."It seems to me," Leonard remarked at the dinner-table one day, "that
droughts are steadily growing more serious and frequent.""While I remember a few in early life
that were more prolonged than any we have had of late years, they must
have resulted from exceptional causes, for we usually had an abundance of
rain, and did not suffer as we do now from violent alternations of
weather.There was one year when there was scarcely a drop of rain
throughout the summer.Potatoes planted in the late spring were found in
the autumn dry and unsprouted.But such seasons were exceedingly rare,
and now droughts are the rule.""And the people are chiefly to blame for them," said Webb."We are
suffering from the law of heredity.Our forefathers were compelled to
fell the trees to make room for the plow, and now one of the strongest
impulses of the average American is to cut down a tree.Our forests, on
which a moist climate so largely depends, are treated as if they
encumbered the ground.The smoke that we are breathing proves that fires
are ravaging to the north and west of us.They should be permitted no
more than a fire in the heart of a city.The future of the country
depends upon the people becoming sane on this subject.If we will send to
the Legislature pot-house politicans who are chiefly interested in
keeping up a supply of liquor instead of water, they should be provided
with a little primer giving the condition of lands denuded of their
forests.There is scarcely anything in their shifty ways, their blind
zeal for what the 'deestrict' wants to-day, regardless of coming days,
that so irritates me as their stupidity on this subject.A man who votes
against the protection of our forests is not fit for the office of
road-master.After all, the people are to blame, and their children will
pay dear for their ignorance and the spirit which finds expression in the
saying, 'After me the deluge'; and there will be flood and drought until
every foot of land not adapted to cultivation and pasturage is again
covered with trees.Indeed, a great deal of good land should be given up
to forests, for then what was cultivated would produce far more than
could be obtained from a treeless and therefore rainless country."cried Burt; "we must send you to the Legislature.""Primarily by instruction and the formation of public opinion.The
influence of trees on the climate should be taught in all our schools as
thoroughly as the multiplication-table.The national and state
governments would then be compelled to look beyond the next election, and
to appoint foresters who would have the same power to call out the people
to extinguish a forest fire that the sheriff has to collect his posse to
put down mob violence.In the long-run fire departments in our forest
tracts would be more useful than the same in cities, for, after all,
cities depend upon the country and its productiveness.The owners of
woodland should be taught the folly of cutting everything before them,
and of leaving the refuse brush to become like tinder.The smaller growth
should be left to mature, and the brush piled and burned in a way that
would not involve the destruction of every sprout and sapling over wide
areas.As it is, we are at the mercy of every careless boy, and such
vagrants as Lumley used to be before Amy woke him up.It is said--and
with truth at times, I fear--that the shiftless mountaineers occasionally
start the fires, for a fire means brief high-priced labor for them, and
afterward an abundance of whiskey."Events furnished a practical commentary on Webb's words.Miss Hargrove
had come over to spend the night with Amy, and to try some fine old
English glees that she had obtained from her city home.They had just
adjourned from the supper-table to the piazza when Lumley appeared, hat
in hand.He spoke to Leonard, but looked at Amy with a kind of wondering
admiration, as if he could not believe that the girl, who looked so fair
and delicate in her evening dress, so remote from him and his
surroundings, could ever have given him her hand, and spoken as if their
humanity had anything in common.The Cliffords were informed that a fire had broken out on a tract
adjoining their own."City chaps was up there gunning out o' season,"
Lumley explained, "and wads from their guns must 'a started it."As there was much wood ranked on the Clifford tract, the matter was
serious.Abram and other farm-hands were summoned, and the brothers acted
as did the minute-men in the Revolution when the enemy appeared in their
vicinity.The young men excused themselves, and bustle and confusion
followed.Burt, with a flannel blouse belted tightly around his waist,
soon dashed up to the front piazza on his horse, and, flourishing a rake,
said, laughingly, "I don't look much like a knight sallying forth to
battle-do I?""You look as if you could be one if the occasion arose," Miss Hargrove
replied.During the half-jesting badinage that followed Amy stole away.Behind the
house Webb was preparing to mount, when a light hand fell on his
shoulder."You don't seem
to spare yourself in anything.I dread to have you go up into those
darkening mountains.""Why, Amy," he replied, laughing, "one would think I was going to fight
Indians, and you feared for my scalp.""I am not so young and blind but that I can see that you are quietly half
reckless with yourself," she replied; and her tone indicated that she was
a little hurt."I pledge you my word that I will not be reckless tonight; and, after
all, this is but disagreeable, humdrum work that we often have to do.Burt will be there to watch over me, you
know," he added."Oh, he's talking romantic nonsense to Miss Hargrove.I wish I was as sure of you, and I wish I had more influence
over you.I'm not such a very little sister, even if I don't know enough
to talk to you as you would like;" and she left him abruptly.He mastered a powerful impulse to spring from his horse and call her
back.A moment's thought taught him, however, that he could not trust
himself then to say a word, and he rode rapidly away."That is the best chance for us
both, unless--" But he hesitated to put into words the half-formed hope
that Miss Hargrove's appearance in the little drama of their lives might
change its final scenes."She's jealous of her friend, at last," he
concluded, and this conviction gave him little comfort.Burt soon
overtook him, and their ride was comparatively silent, for each was busy
with his own thoughts.Lumley was directed to join them at the fire, and
then was forgotten by all except Amy, who, by a gentle urgency, induced
him to go to the kitchen and get a good supper.Before he departed she
slipped a banknote into his hand with which to buy a dress for the baby.Lumley had to pass more than one groggery on his way to the mountains,
but the money was as safe in his pocket as it would have been in Amy's.he soliloquized, as he hastened
through the gathering darkness with his long, swinging stride."I didn't
know there was sich gells.She's never lectured me once, but she jest
smiles and looks a feller into bein' a man."Miss Hargrove had noted Amy's influence over the mountaineer, and she
asked for an explanation.Amy, in a very brief, modest way, told of her
visits to the wretched cabin, and said, in conclusion: "I feel sorry for
poor Lumley.The fact that he is trying to do better, with so much
against him, proves what he might have been.That's one of the things
that trouble me most, as I begin to think and see a little of life; so
many people have no chance worth speaking of.""The thing that ought to trouble me most is, I suppose, that those who
have a chance do so little for such people.Amy," she added, sadly, after
a moment's thought, "I've had many triumphs over men, but none like
yours; and I feel to-night as if I could give them all to see a man look
at me as that poor fellow looked at you.It was the grateful homage of a
human soul to whom you had given something that in a dim way was felt to
be priceless.The best that I can remember in my pleasure-loving life is
that I have not permitted myself selfishly and recklessly to destroy
manhood, but I fear no one is the better for having known me.""You do yourself injustice," said Amy, warmly."I'm the better and
happier for having known you.Papa had a morbid horror of fashionable
society, and this accounts for my being so unsophisticated.With all your
experience of such society, I have perfect faith in you, and could trust
you implicitly."(and Amy thought she had never seen such
depth and power in human eyes as in those of Miss Hargrove, who encircled
the young girl with her arm, and looked as if seeking to detect the
faintest doubt)."Yes," said Amy, with quiet emphasis.Miss Hargrove drew a long breath, and then said: "That little word may do
me more good than all the sermons I ever heard.Many would try to be
different if others had more faith in them.I think that is the secret of
your power over the rough man that has just gone.You recognized the good
that was in him, and made him conscious of it.Well, I must try to
deserve your trust."Then she stepped out on the dusky piazza, and
sighed, as she thought: "It may cost me dear.She seemed troubled at my
words to Burt, and stole away as if she were the awkward third person.I
may have misjudged her, and she cares for him after all."Amy went to the piano, and played softly until summoned without by an
excited exclamation from her friend.A line of fire was creeping toward
them around a lofty highland, and it grew each moment more and more
distinct."Oh, I know from its position that it's drawing near our
tract," cried Amy."If it is so bright to us at this distance, it must be
almost terrible to those near by.I suppose they are all up there just in
front of it, and Burt is so reckless."She was about to say Webb, but,
because of some unrecognized impulse, she did not.The utterance of
Burt's name, however, was not lost on Miss Hargrove.For a long time the girls watched the scene with awe, and each, in
imagination, saw an athletic figure begrimed with smoke, and sending out
grotesque shadows into the obscurity, as the destroying element was met
and fought in ways unknown to them, which, they felt sure, involved
danger.Miss Hargrove feared that they both had the same form in mind.She was not a girl to remain long unconscious of her heart's inclinations,
and she knew that Burt Clifford had quickened her pulses as no man had ever
done before.This very fact made her less judicial, less keen, in her
insight.If he was so attractive to her, could Amy be indifferent to him
after months of companionship?She had thought that she understood Amy
thoroughly, but was beginning to lose faith in her impression.While in
some respects Amy was still a child, there were quiet depths in her nature
of which the young girl herself was but half conscious.She often lapsed
into long reveries.Never had he been more
fraternal in his manner, but apparently she was losing her power to
interest him, to lure him away from the material side of life."I can't
keep pace with him," she sighed; "and now that he has learned all about my
little range of thoughts and knowledge, he finds that I can be scarcely
more to him than Johnnie, whom he pets in much the same spirit that he does
me, and then goes to his work or books and forgets us both.He could help
me so much, if he only thought it worth his while!I'm sure I'm not
contented to be ignorant, and many of the things that he knows so much
about interest me most."Thus each girl was busy with her thoughts, as they sat in the warm summer
night and watched the vivid line draw nearer.Clifford and Maggie
came out from time to time, and were evidently disturbed by the unchecked
progress of the fire.Alf had gone with his father, and anything like a
conflagration so terrified Johnnie that she dared not leave her mother's
lighted room.Suddenly the approaching line grew dim, was broken, and before very long
even the last red glow disappeared utterly.Clifford,
rubbing his hands, "they have got the fire under, and I don't believe it
reached oar tract.""How did they put it out so suddenly?""Were they
not fighting it all the time?""The boys will soon be here, and they can give you a more graphic account
than I. Mother is a little excited and troubled, as she always is when
her great babies are away on such affairs, so I must ask you to excuse
me."In little more than half an hour a swift gallop was heard, and Burt soon
appeared, in the light of the late-rising moon."It's all out," he
exclaimed."Leonard and Webb propose remaining an hour or two longer, to
see that it does not break out again.There's no need of their doing so,
for Lumley promised to watch till morning.If
you'll wait till I put on a little of the aspect of a white man, I'll
join you."He had been conscious of a feverish impatience to get back to
the ladies, having carefully, even in his thoughts, employed the plural,
and he had feared that they might have retired.Miss Hargrove exclaimed: "How absurd!You wish to go and divest yourself
of all picturesqueness!I've seen well-dressed men before, and would much
prefer that you should join us as you are.We can then imagine that you
are a bandit or a frontiersman, and that your rake was a rifle, which you
had used against the Indians.We are impatient to have you tell us how
you fought the fire."He gave but scant attention to Thunder that night, and soon stepped out
on the moonlit piazza, his tall, fine figure outlined to perfection in
his close-fitting costume."You will, indeed, need all your imagination to make anything of our task
to-night," he said."Fighting a mountain fire is the most prosaic of hard
work.Suppose the line of fire coming down toward me from where you are
sitting."As yet unknown to him, a certain subtile flame was originating
in that direction."We simply begin well in advance of it, so that we may
have time to rake a space, extending along the whole front of the fire,
clear of leaves and rubbish, and as far as possible to hollow out with
hoes a trench through this space.Thus, when the fire comes to this
cleared area, there is nothing to burn, and it goes out for want of fuel.Of course, it's rough work, and it must be done rapidly, but you can see
that all the heroic elements which you may have associated with our
expedition are utterly lacking."Amy and I have had our little romance, and have
imagined you charging the line of fire in imminent danger of being
strangled with smoke, if nothing worse."Amy soon heard Maggie bustling about, preparing a midnight lunch for
those who would come home hungry as well as weary, and she said that she
would go and try to help.To Burt this seemed sufficient reason for her
absence, but Miss Hargrove thought, "Perhaps she saw that his eyes were
fixed chiefly on me as he gave his description.I wish I knew just how
she feels toward him!"But the temptation to remain in the witching moonlight was too strong to
be resisted.His mellow tones were a music that she had never heard
before, and her eyes grew lustrous with suppressed feeling, and a
happiness to which she was not sure she was entitled.The spell of her
beauty was on him also, and the moments flew by unheeded, until Amy was
heard playing and singing softly to herself.was Miss Hargrove's mental comment, and with not a little
compunction she rose and went into the parlor.Burt lighted a cigar, in
the hope that the girls would again join him, but Leonard, Webb, and Alf
returned sooner than they were expected, and all speedily sat down to
their unseasonable repast.To Amy's surprise, Webb was the liveliest of
the party, but he looked gaunt from fatigue--so worn, indeed, that he
reminded her of the time when he had returned from Burt's rescue.But
there was no such episode as had then occurred before they parted for the
night, and to this she now looked back wistfully.He rose before the
others, pleaded fatigue, and went to his room.CHAPTER XLII

CAMPING OUT


They all gathered at a late breakfast, and the surface current of family
and social life sparkled as if there were no hidden depths and secret
thoughts.Amy's manner was not cold toward Webb, but her pride was
touched, and her feelings were a little hurt.While disposed to blame
herself only that she had not the power to interest him and secure his
companionship, as in the past, it was not in human nature to receive with
indifference such an apparent hint that he was far beyond her."It would
be more generous in Webb to help than to ignore me because I know so
little," she thought."Very well: I can have a good time with Burt and
Gertrude until Webb gets over his hurry and preoccupation;" and with a
slight spirit of retaliation she acted as if she thoroughly enjoyed
Burt's lively talk.The young fellow soon made a proposition that caused a general and breezy
excitement."There never was a better time than this for camping out," he
said."The ground is dry, and there is scarcely any dew.Suppose we go up and spend a few days on our mountain
tract?Maggie could chaperon the party, and I've no doubt that Dr.How could she leave the old people and her housekeeping?Clifford, however, became the strongest advocates of the scheme.They
could get along with the servants, they said, and a little outing would
do Maggie good.Leonard, who had listened in comparative silence, brought
his wife to a decision by saying: "You had better go, Maggie.You will
have all the housekeeping you want on the mountain, and I will go back
and forth every day and see that all's right.It's not as if you were
beyond the reach of home, for you could be here in an hour were there
need.Come now, make up your mind for a regular lark.The children were wild with delight at the prospect, and Miss Hargrove
and Amy scarcely less pleased.The latter had furtively watched Webb, who
at first could not disguise a little perplexity and trouble at the
prospect.But he had thought rapidly, and felt that a refusal to be one
of the party might cause embarrassing surmises.Therefore he also soon
became zealous in his advocacy of the plan.He felt that circumstances
were changing and controlling his action.He had fully resolved on an
absence of some weeks, but the prolonged drought and the danger it
involved--the Cliffords would lose at least a thousand dollars should a
fire sweep over their mountain tract--made it seem wrong for him to leave
home until rain insured safety.Moreover, he believed that he detected
symptoms in Burt which, with his knowledge of his brother, led to hopes
that he could not banish.An occasional expression in Miss Hargrove's
dark eyes, also, did not tend to lessen these hopes."The lack of
conventionality incident to a mountain camp," he thought, "may develop
matters so rapidly as to remove my suspense.With all Amy's gentleness,
she is very sensitive and proud, and Burt cannot go much further with
Miss Hargrove without so awakening her pride as to render futile all
efforts to retrieve himself.After all, Miss Hargrove, perhaps, would
suit him far better than Amy.They are both fond of excitement and
society.At least, if the way were clear, I
would try as no man ever tried to win Amy, and I should be no worse off
than I am if I failed in the attempt."These musings were rather remote from his practical words, for he had
taken pains to give the impression that their woodland would be far safer
for the proposed expedition, and Amy had said, a little satirically, "We
are now sure of Webb, since he can combine so much business with
pleasure."He only smiled back in an inscrutable way.Musk-melons formed one of their breakfast dishes, and Miss Hargrove
remarked, "Papa has been exceedingly annoyed by having some of his finest
ones stolen."Burt began laughing, and said: "He should imitate my tactics.Ours were
stolen last year, and as they approached maturity, some time since, I put
up a notice in large black letters, 'Thieves, take warning: be careful
not to steal the poisoned melons.'Hearing a dog bark one night about a
week ago, I took a revolver and went out.The moonlight was clear, and
there, reading the notice, was a group of ragamuffin boys.Stealing up
near them, behind some shrubbery, I fired my pistol in the air, and they
fairly tumbled over each other in their haste to escape.We've had no
trouble since, I can assure you.I'll drive you home this morning, and,
with your father's permission, will put up a similar notice in your
garden.We also must make our arrangements for camping promptly.It surely will not if our mountain
experience makes us wish it would;" and, full of his projects, he
hastened to harness Thunder to his light top-wagon.He might have taken the two-seated carriage, and asked Amy to accompany
them, but it had not occurred to him to do so, especially as he intended
to drive on rapidly to Newburgh to make arrangements for the tents.She
felt a little slighted and neglected, and Miss Hargrove saw that she did,
but thought that any suggestion of a different arrangement might lead to
embarrassment.She began to think, with Webb, that the camping experience
would make everything clearer.At any rate, it promised so much
unhackneyed pleasure that she resolved to make the most of it, and then
decide upon her course.She was politic, and cautioned Burt to say
nothing until she had first seen her father, for she was not certain how
her stately and conventional mother would regard the affair.Hargrove in his library, and he knew from her preliminary
caresses that some unusual favor was to be asked."Come," he said, "you wily little strategist, what do you want now?His answer was unexpected, for he asked, "Is Mr."No," she replied, faintly; "he's on the piazza."Then, with unusual
animation, she began about the melons.Her father's face softened, and he
looked at her a little humorously, for her flushed, handsome face would
disarm a Puritan."You are seeing a great deal of this young Mr.Her color deepened, and she began, hastily, "Oh, well, papa, I've seen a
good deal of a great many gentlemen.""Come, come, Trurie, no disguises with me.Your old father is not so
blind as you think, and I've not lived to my time of life in ignorance of
the truth that prevention is better than cure.Whether you are aware of
it or not, your eyes have revealed to me a growing interest in Mr."He is a comparatively poor man, I suppose, and while I think him a fine
fellow, I've seen in him no great aptness for business.If I saw that he
was no more to you than others who have sought your favor, I would not
say a word, Trurie, for when you are indifferent you are abundantly able
to take care of yourself.I knew you would in
time meet some one who would have the power to do more than amuse you,
and my love, darling, is too deep and vigilant to be blind until it is
too late to see.You might
become more than interested during an experience like the one proposed.""If I should, papa, am I so poor that I have not even the privilege of a
village girl, who can follow her heart?""My advice would be," he replied, gently, "that you guide yourself by
both reason and your heart.This is our secret council-chamber, and one
is speaking to you who has no thought but for your lasting happiness."She took a chair near him, and looked into his eyes, as she said,
thoughtfully and gravely: "I should be both silly and unnatural, did I
not recognize your motive and love.I know I am not a child any longer,
and should have no excuse for any school-girl or romantic folly.You have
always had my confidence; you would have had it in this case as soon as
there was anything to tell.I scarcely understand myself as yet, but must
admit that I am more interested in Mr.Clifford than in any man I ever
met, and, as you said, I also have not reached my time of life without
knowing what this may lead to.You married mamma when she was younger
than I, and you, too, papa, were 'a comparatively poor man' at the time.I know all that wealth and
fashionable society can give me, and I tell you honestly, papa, I would
rather be the happy wife that Maggie Clifford is than marry any
millionaire in New York.There is no need, however, for such serious
talk, for there is nothing yet beyond congenial companionship, and--Well,"
she added, hastily, in memory of Amy, "I don't believe anything will come
of it.There will probably be two
married ladies in the party, and so I don't see that even mamma can
object.Best assured I shall never become engaged to any one without your
consent; that is," she added, with another of her irresistible caresses,
"unless you are very unreasonable, and I become very old.""Very well, Trurie, you shall go, with your mother's consent, and I think
I can insure that.As you say, you are no longer a child."And his
thought was, "I have seen enough of life to know that it is best not to
be too arbitrary in such matters."After a moment he added, gravely, "You
say you have thought.Think a great deal more before you take any steps
which may involve all your future."Burt was growing uneasy on the piazza, and feared that Miss Hargrove
might not obtain the consent that she had counted on so confidently.He
was a little surprised, also, to find how the glamour faded out of his
anticipations at the thought of her absence, but explained his feeling by
saying to himself, "She is so bright and full of life, and has so fine a
voice, that we should miss her sadly."He was greatly relieved,
therefore, when Mr.Hargrove came out and greeted him courteously.Gertrude had been rendered too conscious, by her recent interview, to
accompany her father, but she soon appeared, and no one could have
imagined that Burt was more to her than an agreeable acquaintance.Hargrove gave a reluctant consent, and it was soon settled that they
should try to get off on the afternoon of the following day.Burt also
included in the invitation young Fred Hargrove, and then drove away
elated.At the dinner-table he announced his success in procuring the tents, and
his intention of going for them in the afternoon.At the same time he
exhorted Leonard and Maggie to prepare provisions adequate to mountain
appetites, adding, "Webb, I suppose, will be too busy to do more than
join us at the last moment."Webb said nothing, but disappeared after dinner.As he was at supper as
usual, no questions were asked.Before it was light the next morning Amy
thought she heard steps on the stairs, and the rear hall-door shut
softly.When finally awaking, she was not sure but that her impression
was a dream.As she came down to breakfast Burt greeted her with dismay."The tents, that I put on the back piazza, are gone," he said.No one had seen him, and it was soon learned that a horse and a strong
wagon were also missing."Ah, Burt," cried Amy, laughing, "rest assured Webb has stolen a march on
you, and taken his own way of retaliation for what you said at the
dinner-table yesterday.I believe he
has chosen a camping-ground, and the tents are standing on it.""He should have remembered that others might have some choice in the
matter," was the discontented reply."If Webb has chosen the camping-ground, you will all be pleased with it,"
said his mother, quietly."I think he is merely trying to give a pleasant
surprise."He soon appeared, and explained that, with Lumley's help, he had made
some preparations, since any suitable place, with water near, from which
there was a fine outlook, would have seemed very rough and uninviting to
the ladies unless more work was done than could be accomplished in the
afternoon of their arrival."Now I think that is very thoughtful of you, Webb," said Amy."The steps
I heard last night were not a dream.At what unearthly hour did you
start?""Was I so heavy-footed as to disturb you?""Oh, no, Webb," she said, with a look of comic distress, in which there
was also a little reproach; "it's not your feet that disturb me, but your
head.You have stuffed it so full of learning that I am depressed by the
emptiness of mine."He laughed, as he replied, "I hope all your troubles may be quite as
imaginary."Then he told Leonard to spend the morning in helping Maggie,
who would know best what was needed for even mountain housekeeping, and
said that he would see to farm matters, and join them early in the
evening.The peaches were ripening, and Amy, from her window, saw that he
was taking from the trees all fit to market; also that Abram, under his
direction, was busy with the watering-cart."Words cannot impose upon
me," she thought, a little bitterly."He knows how I long for his
companionship, and it's not a little thing to be made to feel that I am
scarcely better qualified for it than Johnnie."Marvin's, who promised to join them, with his
wife, on the following day.He had a tent which he had occasionally used
in his ornithological pursuits.At two in the afternoon a merry party started for the hills.All the
vehicles on the farm had been impressed into the service to bring up the
party, with chairs, cooking-utensils, provisions, bedding, etc.When they
reached the ground that Webb had selected, even Burt admitted his pleased
surprise.The outlook over the distant river, and a wide area of country
dotted with villages, was superb, while to the camp a home-like look had
already been given, and the ladies, with many mental encomiums, saw how
secluded and inviting an aspect had been imparted to their especial
abode.As they came on the scene, Lumley was finishing the construction
of a dense screen of evergreen boughs, which surrounded the canvas to the
doorway.Not far away an iron pot was slung on a cross-stick in gypsy
style, and it was flanked by rock-work fireplaces which Maggie declared
were almost equal to a kitchen range.The men's tent was pitched at easy
calling distance, and, like that of the ladies, was surrounded by a thick
growth of trees, whose shade would be grateful.A little space had been
cleared between the two tents for a leaf-canopied dining-hall, and a
table of boards improvised.The ground, as far as possible, had been
cleared of loose stones and rubbish.Around the fireplace mossy rocks
abounded, and were well adapted for picturesque groupings.What touched
Amy most was a little flowerbed made of the rich black mould of decayed
leaves, in which were some of her favorite flowers, well watered.This
did not suggest indifference on the part of Webb.About fifty feet from
the tents the mountain shelf sloped off abruptly, and gave the
magnificent view that has been mentioned.Even Burt saw how much had been
gained by Webb's forethought, and frankly acknowledged it.As it was,
they had no more than time to complete the arrangements for the night
before the sun's level rays lighted up a scene that was full of joyous
activity and bustle.The children's happy voices made the echoes ring,
and Fred Hargrove, notwithstanding his city antecedents, yielded with
delight to the love of primitive life that exists in every boy's heart.Although he was a few years older than Alf, they had become friendly
rivals as incipient sportsmen and naturalists.Amy felt that she was
coming close to nature's heart, and the novelty of it all was scarcely
less exciting to her than to Johnnie.To little Ned it was a place of
wonder and enchantment, and he kept them all in a mild state of terror by
his exploring expeditions.At last his father threatened to take him
home, and, with this awful punishment before his eyes, he put his thumb
in his mouth, perched upon a rock, and philosophically watched the
preparations for supper.Maggie was the presiding genius of the occasion,
and looked like the light-hearted girl that Leonard had wooed more than a
dozen years before.She ordered him around, jested with him, and laughed
at him in such a piquant way that Burt declared she was proving herself
unfit for the duties of chaperon by getting up a flirtation with her
husband.Meanwhile, under her supervision, order was evoked from chaos,
and appetizing odors arose from the fireplace.Miss Hargrove admitted to herself that in all the past she had never
known such hours of keen enjoyment, and she was bent on proving that,
although a city-bred girl, she could take her part in the work as well as
in the fun.Nor were her spirits dampened by the fact that Burt was often
at her side, and that Amy did not appear to care.The latter, however,
was becoming aware of his deepening interesting in her brilliant friend.As yet she was not sure whether it was more than a good-natured and
hospitable effort to make one so recently a stranger at home with them,
or a new lapse on his part into a condition of ever-enduring love and
constancy--and the smile that followed the thought was not flattering to
Burt.A little before supper was ready Maggie asked him to get a pail of water."Come, Miss Gertrude," he said, "and I'll show you the Continental spring
at which the Revolutionary soldiers drank more than a hundred years ago;"
and she tripped away with him, nothing loth.As they reappeared, flushed
and laughing, carrying the pail between them, Amy trilled out,

"Jack and Jill came up the hill."A moment later, Webb followed them, on horseback, and was greeted with
acclamations and overwhelmed with compliments.Miss Hargrove was only too
glad of the diversion from herself, for Amy's words had made her absurdly
conscious for a society girl.Never had green corn, roasted in
its husks on the coals, tasted so delicious, and never before were
peaches and cream so ambrosial.Amy made it her care that poor Lumley
should feast also, but the smile with which she served him was the
sustenance he most craved.Then, as the evening breeze grew chilly, and
the night darkened, lanterns were hung in the trees, the fire was
replenished, and they sat down, the merriest of merry parties.Even Webb
had vowed that he would ignore the past and the future, and make the most
of that camp-fire by the wayside of life.It must be admitted, however,
that his discovery of Burt and Miss Hargrove alone at the spring had much
to do with his resolution.Stories and songs succeeded each other, until
Ned was asleep in Maggie's arms, and Johnnie nodding at her side.In
reaction from the excitements and fatigues of the day, they all early
sought the rest which is never found in such perfection as in a mountain
camp.Hemlock boughs formed the mattresses on which their blankets were
spread, and soon there were no sounds except the strident chirpings of
insects and the calls of night-birds.There was one perturbed spirit, however, and at last Burt stole out and
sat by the dying fire.When the mind is ready for impressions, a very
little thing will produce them vividly, and Amy's snatch of song about
"Jack and Jill" had awakened Burt at last to a consciousness that he
might be carrying his attention to Miss Hargrove too far, in view of his
vows and inexorable purpose of constancy.He assured himself that his
only object was to have a good time, and enjoy the charming society of
his new acquaintance.Of course, he was in love with Amy, and she was all
that he could desire.Girls
even like Amy were not so unsophisticated as they appeared to be, and he
felt that he was profoundly experienced in such questions, if in nothing
else.and would she not be led, by his
evident admiration for Miss Hargrove, to believe that he was mercurial
and not to be depended upon?He had to admit to himself that some
experiences in the past had tended to give him this reputation."I was
only a boy then," he muttered, with a stern compression of the lips."I'll prove that I am a man now;" and having made this sublime
resolution, he slept the sleep of the just.All who have known the freshness, the elasticity, the mental and physical
vigor, with which one springs from a bed of boughs, will envy the camping
party's awakening on the following morning.Webb resolved to remain and
watch the drift of events, for he was growing almost feverish in his
impatience for more definite proof that his hopes were not groundless.But he was doomed to disappointment and increasing doubt.Burt began to
show himself a skilful diplomatist.He felt that, perhaps, he had checked
himself barely in time to retrieve his fortunes and character with Amy,
but he was too adroit to permit any marked change to appear in his manner
and action.He said to himself that he cordially liked and admired Miss
Hargrove, but he believed that she had enjoyed not a few flirtations, and
was not averse to the addition of another to the list.Even his
self-complacency had not led him to think that she regarded him in any
other light than that of a very agreeable and useful summer friend.He
had seen enough of society to be aware that such temporary friendships
often border closely on the sentimental, and yet with no apparent trace
remaining in after-years.To Amy, however, such affairs would not appear
in the same light as they might to Miss Hargrove, and he felt that he had
gone far enough.But not for the world would he be guilty of _gaucherie,_
of neglecting Miss Hargrove for ostentatious devotion to Amy.Indeed, he
was more pronounced in his admiration than ever, but in many little
unobtrusive ways he tried to prove to Amy that she had his deeper thoughts.She, however, was not at this time disposed to dwell upon the subject.His
manner merely tended to confirm the view that he, like herself, regarded
Miss Hargrove as a charming addition to their circle, and proposed that she
should enjoy herself thoroughly while with them.Amy also reproached
herself a little that she had doubted him so easily, and felt that he was
giving renewed proof of his good sense.He could be true to her, and yet be
most agreeable to her friend, and her former acquiescence in the future of
his planning remained undisturbed.Webb was more like the brother she
wished him to be than he had been for a long time.The little flowerbed was
an abiding reassurance, and so the present contained all that she desired.This was not true of either Webb or Miss Hargrove.The former, however,
did not lose heart.He thought he knew Burt too well to give up hope yet.The latter, with all her experience, was puzzled.She speedily became
conscious of the absence of a certain warmth and genuineness in Bart's
manner and words.The thermometer is not so sensitive to heat and cold as
the intuition of a girl like Miss Hargrove to the mental attitude of an
admirer, but no one could better hide her thoughts and feelings than she
when once upon her guard.CHAPTER XLIII

AN OLD TENEMENT


The few remaining days of August passed, and September came, bringing
little suggestion of autumn rains or coolness.Marvin had
joined them, and the former's interest in every wild creature of the
woods became infectious.Alf and Fred were his ardent disciples, and he
rarely found an indifferent listener in Amy.The heat of the day was
given up to reading and the fashioning of alpenstocks, and the mornings
and late afternoons to excursions.In one of these they had sat down to
rest near an immense decaying tree that was hollow in parts, and full of
holes from the topmost shattered branches to the ground."That," said the doctor, "might fitly be called an old tenement-house.You have no idea how many and various creatures may have found a home in
it."He was immediately urged to enumerate its possible inhabitants in the
past, present, and future.The doctor, pleased with the conceit of regarding the decaying tree in
this light, began with animation: "All three of the squirrels of this
region have undoubtedly dwelt in it.I scarcely need do more than mention
the well-known saucy red or fox squirrel, whose delight is mischief.By
the way, we have at home two tame robins that before they could fly were
tumbled out of their nest by one of these ruthless practical jokers.The
birds come in and out of the house like members of the family.The
graceful gray squirrel is scarcely less familiar than the red one.He
makes a lively pet, and we have all seen him turning the wheel attached
to his cage.The curious little flying-squirrel, however, is a stranger
even to those to whom he may be a near neighbor, for the reason that his
habits are chiefly nocturnal.He ventures out occasionally on a cloudy
day, but is shy and retiring.Thoreau relates an interesting experience
with one.He captured it in a decayed hemlock stump, wherein it had a
little nest of leaves, bits of bark, and pine needles.It bit viciously
at first, and uttered a few 'dry shrieks,' but he carried it home.After
it had been in his room a few hours it reluctantly allowed its soft fur
to be stroked.He says it had'very large, prominent black eyes, which
gave it an innocent look.In color it was a chestnut ash, inclining to
fawn, slightly browned, and white beneath.tinged yellow, the upper dark, perhaps black.'He put it into a
barrel, and fed it with an apple and shag-bark hickory-nuts.The next
morning he carried it back and placed it on the stump from which it had
been taken, and it ran up a sapling, from which it skimmed away to a
large maple nine feet distant, whose trunk it struck about four feet from
the ground.This tree it ascended thirty feet on the opposite side from
Thoreau, then, coming into view, it eyed its quondam captor for a moment
or two, as much as to say 'good-by.'Then away it went, first raising its
head as if choosing its objective point.Thoreau says its progress is
more like that of a bird than he had been led to believe from naturalists'
accounts, or than he could have imagined possible in a quadruped.Its
flight was not a regular descent on a given line.It veered to right and
left, avoiding obstructions, passed between branches of trees, and flew
horizontally part of the way, landing on the ground at last, over fifty-one
feet from the foot of the tree from which it sprang.After its leap,
however, it cannot renew its impetus in the air, but must alight and start
again.It appears to sail and steer much like a hawk when the latter does
not flap its wings.The little striped chipmunk, no doubt, has heaped up
its store of nuts in the hole there that opens from the ground into the
tree, and the pretty white-footed mouse, with its large eyes and ears, has
had its apartment in the decayed recesses that exist in the worm-eaten
roots."Opossums and raccoons are well-known denizens of trees, and both furnish
famous country sports, especially in the South.''Possum up de gum-tree,
cooney in de hollow,' is a line from a <DW64> ditty that touches a deep
chord in the African heart.The former is found not infrequently in this
region, but the Hudson seems to be the eastern boundary of its habitat.""I took two from a tree in one night," Burt remarked."The raccoon's haunts, however, extend far to the northward, and it is
abundant in the regions bordering on the Adirondacks, though not common
in the dense pine woods of the interior.They are omnivorous creatures,
and often rob nests of eggs and young birds, for they are expert
climbers.They are fond of nuts and fruits, and especially of corn when
in the condition of a milky pulp.They are
also eager fishermen, although they are unable to pursue their prey under
water like the otter and mink.They like to play in shallows, and leave
no stone unturned in the hope of finding a crawfish under it.If fish have
been left in land-locked pools, they are soon devoured.'<DW53>-hunting by
the light of the harvest-moon has long been one of the most noted of rural
sports.During this month the corn kernels are in the most toothsome state
for the '<DW53> bill of fare, and there are few fields near forests where
they will not be marauding to-night, for they are essentially night
prowlers.A '<DW53> hunt usually takes place near midnight.Men, with dogs
trained to the sport, will repair to a cornfield known to be infested.The
feasters are soon tracked and treed, then shot, or else the tree is felled,
when such a snarling fight ensues as creates no little excitement.No
matter how plucky a cur may be, he finds his match in an old '<DW53>, and
often carries the scars of combat to his dying day."If taken when young, raccoons make amusing pets, and become attached to
their masters, but they cannot be allowed at large, for they are as
mischievous as monkeys.Their curiosity is boundless, and they will pry
into everything within reach.Anything, to be beyond their reach, must be
under lock and key.They use their forepaws as hands, and will unlatch a
door with ease, and soon learn to turn a knob.Alf there could not begin
to ravage a pantry like a tame '<DW53>.They will devour honey, molasses,
sugar, pies, cake, bread, butter, milk--anything edible.They will
uncover preserve-jars as if Mrs.Leonard had given them lessons, and with
the certainty of a toper uncork a bottle and get drunk on its contents.""No pet '<DW53>s, Alf, if you please," said his mother."Raccoons share with Reynard his reputation for cunning," the doctor
resumed, "and deserve it, but they do not use this trait for
self-preservation.They are not suspicious of unusual objects, and,
unlike a fox, are easily trapped.They hibernate during the coldest part
of the winter, reappearing in the latter part of February or March.They
are fond of little excursions, and usually travel in small family
parties, taking refuge in hollow trees about daylight.They make their
home high up, and prefer a hollow limb to the trunk of a tree.Some of
those half-decayed limbs yonder would just suit them.They have their
young in April--from four to six--and these little '<DW53>s remain with the
mother a year.While young they are fair eating, but grow tough and rank
with age."Two other interesting animals may have lived in that tree, the least
weasel and his sanguinary cousin the ermine, or large weasel.Both are
brown, after the snow finally disappears, and both turn white with the
first snowstorm.""Now you are romancing, doctor," cried Miss Hargrove."Yes," added Leonard, "tell us that you have caught a weasel asleep, and
we will, at least, look credulous; but this turning white with the first
snow, and brown as soon as the snow is gone, is a little off color.""It's true, nevertheless," maintained the doctor, "although I have seen
no satisfactory explanation of the changes.They not only make their
nests in hollow trees, but in the sides of banks.Were it not for its
habit of destroying the eggs and young of birds, the least weasel might
be regarded as a wholly useful creature, for it devours innumerable mice,
moles, shrews, and insects, and does not attack larger animals or
poultry.It is so exceedingly lithe and slender that its prey has no
chance to escape.Where a mouse or a mole can go it can go also, and if
outrun in the field, it follows the scent of its game like a hound, and
is as relentless as fate in its pursuit.They are not very shy, and
curiosity speedily overcomes their timidity.Sit down quietly, and they
will investigate you with intense interest, and will even approach rather
near in order to see better.Merriam describes one as standing
bolt-upright, and eying him, with its head bent at right angles to its
slender body.After a brief retreat it made many partial advances toward
him, meanwhile constantly sniffing the air in his direction.Merriam would have liked to know the weasel's opinion.They
have two or three litters a year, and the nest is made of dry leaves and
herbage.The mother weasel will defend her young at any cost, and never
hesitates to sacrifice her life in their behalf.She will fasten herself
by her sharp teeth to the nose of a dog, and teach him that weasel-hunting
has some drawbacks."In its next of kin, the ermine, or large weasel, we have perhaps the
most cruel and bloodthirsty animal in existence.It is among mammals what
the butcher-bird is among the feathered tribes--an assassin, a beautiful
fiend.It would seem that nature reproduces among animals and plants
every phase of human character.Was it Nero or Caligula who said, 'Oh,
that Rome had but one neck, that I might sever it?'Such is the spirit
that animates the ermine.Its instinct to kill is so strong that, were it
possible, it would destroy the means of its subsistence.It would leave
none of its varied prey alive.The lion and even the man-eating tiger,
when gorged, are inert and quiet.They kill no more than they want for a
meal; but the ermine will attack a poultry-yard, satiate itself with the
brains of the fowls or by sucking their blood, and then, out of 'pure
cussedness,' will kill all the rest within reach.Fifty chickens have
been destroyed in a night by one of these remorseless little beasts.It
makes fearful ravages among grouse, rabbits, and hares.It is the
mythical vampire embodied.It is not very much larger than the least
weasel, and has the same long, lithe, slender body and neck.A gray
squirrel would look bulky beside one, but in indomitable courage and
pitiless ferocity I do not think it has an equal.Only a lack of material
or bodily fatigue suspends its bloody work, and its life is one long
career of carnage.It has a terrific set of teeth, which are worked by
most powerful muscles.Coues, an eminent naturalist, has given a
graphic account of him.His words, as I remember them, are a true
portrait of a murderer.'His forehead is low, and nose sharp; his eyes
are small, penetrating, cunning, and glitter with an angry green light.His fierce face surmounts a body extraordinarily wiry, lithe, and
muscular, which ends in a singularly long, slender neck that can be
lifted at right angles with the body.When he is looking around, his neck
stretched up, his flat triangular head bent forward, swaying to and fro,
we have the image of a serpent.'"This is a true picture of the ermine when excited or angry; when at
rest, and in certain conditions of his fur, there are few more beautiful,
harmless, innocent-looking creatures.Let one of the animals on which he
preys approach, however, and instantly he becomes a demon.In the economy
of nature he often serves a very useful purpose.In many regions field
mice are destructive.A rat will fight
a man, if cornered, but it gives up at once in abject terror when
confronted by the large weasel.This arch-enemy has a pride in his
hunting, and when taking up his quarters in a barn will collect in one
place all the rats and mice he kills.Sometimes a hundred or more have
been found together as the result of two or three nights' work.The
ermine hunts, however, both by day and night, and climbs trees with great
facility.He is by no means shy, and one has been known to try to kill
chickens in a coop when a man was standing near him.Hunger was not his
motive, for he had destroyed dozens of fowls the night before.The ermine
has been used successfully as a ferret.Having first filed the creature's
teeth down, so that it could not kill the game, a gentleman secured
twelve live rabbits in one forenoon."But it's getting late, and time we started tentward, and yet I'm not
through even the list of quadrupeds that may have dwelt in our old
tenement.There are four species of bats to be mentioned, besides moles
and shrews, that would burrow in its roots if they are as hollow as the
branches.There are thirteen species of birds, including several very
interesting families of woodpeckers, that would live in a tree like that,
not to speak of tree-toads, salamanders, brown tree-lizards, insects and
slugs innumerable, and black-snakes--"

"Snakes?"I once put my hand in a hole for high-holders' eggs, and a
big black-snake ran down my back, but not inside of my coat, however.""Please say nothing more about snakes," cried Amy; and she rose
decisively, adding, in a low tone: "Come, Gertrude, let us go.The
tenants of the old tree that we've heard about may be very interesting to
naturalists, but some of them are no more to my taste than the people in
the slums of London.""You have made our blood run cold with horrors--an agreeable sensation,
however, to-day," said Burt, also rising."Your ermine out-Herods Herod.By the way, is not the fur of this pitiless beast worn by the highest
dignitaries of the legal profession?"CHAPTER XLIV

"BUT HE RISKED HIS LIFE?"The days passed, and the novelty of their mountain life began to wane a
little.There were agreeable episodes, as, for instance, visits from Mr.Barkdale, who were entertained
in royal style; but, after all, the camping experience was not,
apparently, fulfilling the hopes of two of the party.Webb's doubt and
suspense had only been increased, and Miss Hargrove was compelled to
admit to herself that her father's fears were not groundless.She was the
life of the party, and yet she was not at rest.Even in her dreams there
was a minor key of trouble and dread.The past few weeks were bringing a
revelation.She had read novels innumerable; she had received tender
confidences from friends.Love had been declared to her, and she had seen
its eloquent pleading in more than one face; but she acknowledged that
she had never known the meaning of the word until, without her volition,
her own heart revealed to her the mystery.Reason and will might control
her action, but she could no more divert her thoughts from Burt Clifford
than a flower can turn from the sun.She wondered at herself, and was
troubled.She had supposed that the training of society had brought her
perfect self-possession, and she had looked forward to a match, when she
was ready for one, in which the pros and cons should be weighed with
diplomatic nicety; but now that her heart was touched she learned that
nature is supreme, and her whole being revolted at such a union as she
had contemplated.She saw the basis of true marriage--the glad consent of
body and soul, and not a calculation.She watched Maggie closely, and saw
that her life was happy and rounded out in spite of her many cares.It
was not such a life as she would choose in its detail, and yet it was
infinitely better than that of many of her acquaintances.Burt was no
hero in her eyes, but he was immensely companionable, and it was a
companion, not a hero, or a man remote from her life and interests, that
she desired.He was refined and intelligent, if not learned; low, mean
traits were conspicuously absent; but, above and beyond all, his mirthful
blue eyes, and spirited ways and words, set all her nerves tingling with
a delicious exhilaration which she could neither analyze nor control.In
brief, the time that her father foresaw had come; the man had appeared
who could do more than amuse; her whole nature had made its choice.She
could go back to the city, and still in semblance be the beautiful and
brilliant girl that she had been; but she knew that in all the future few
waking hours would pass without her thoughts reverting to that little
mountain terrace, its gleaming canvas, its gypsy-like fire, with a tall,
lithe form often reclining at her feet beside it.Would the future bring more than regretful memories?As time passed, she
feared not.As Burt grew conscious of himself, his pride was deeply touched.He knew
that he had been greatly fascinated by Miss Hargrove, and, what was
worse, her power had not declined after he had awakened to his danger;
but he felt that Amy and all the family would despise him--indeed, that
he would despise himself--should he so speedily transfer his allegiance;
and under the spur of this dread he made especial, though very
unobtrusive, efforts to prove his loyalty to Amy.Therefore Webb had
grown despondent, and his absences from the camp were longer and more
frequent He pleaded the work of the farm, and the necessity of coping
with the fearful drought, so plausibly that Amy felt that she could not
complain, but, after all, there was a low voice of protest in her heart."It's the old trouble," she thought."The farm interests him far more
than I ever can, and even when here his mind is absent."Thus it may be seen that Nature, to whom they had gone, was not only busy
with the mountain and its life, but that her silent forces were also at
work in those whose unperverted hearts were not beyond her power.But there are dark mysteries in Nature, and some of her creations appear
to be visible and concentrated evil.The camping party came very near
breaking up in a horrible tragedy.The day was growing warm, and they
were returning from a rather extended excursion, straggling along a steep
wood road that was partially overgrown with bushes.Burt had been a
little more attentive to Miss Hargrove than usual, but was now at Amy's
side with his ready laugh and jest.Marvin was in the rear, peering
about, as usual, for some object of interest to a naturalist.Miss
Hargrove, so far from succumbing to the increasing heat, was reluctant to
return, and seemed possessed with what might be almost termed a nervous
activity.She had been the most indefatigable climber of the party, and
on their return had often diverged from the path to gather a fern or some
other sylvan trifle.At one point the ascending path formed an angle with
a ledge of rock that made a little platform.At the further end of this
she saw a flower, and she went to get it.A moment or two later Burt and
Amy heard her scream, and the sound of her voice seemed almost beneath
them.Grasping his alpenstock firmly, Burt sprang through the intervening
copsewood, and witnessed a scene that he never forgot, though he paused
not a second in his horror.Even as he rushed toward her a huge
rattlesnake was sending forth the "long, loud, stinging whir" which, as
Dr.Holmes says, is "the dreadful sound that nothing which breathes can
hear unmoved."Miss Hargrove was looking down upon it, stupefied,
paralyzed with terror.Already the reptile was coiling its thick body for
the deadly stroke, when Burt's stock fell upon its neck and laid it
writhing at the girl's feet.With a flying leap from the rock above he
landed on the venomous head, and crushed it with his heel.He had
scarcely time to catch Miss Hargrove, when she became apparently a
lifeless burden in his arms.Marvin now reached him, and after a glance at the scene exclaimed,
"Great God!"No; but let us get away from here.Where there's one of these devils
there is usually another not far off;" and they carried the unconscious
girl swiftly toward the camp, which fortunately was not far away, all the
others following with dread and anxiety in their faces.Marvin's and Maggie's efforts soon revived Miss Hargrove, but she had
evidently received a very severe nervous shock.When at last Burt was
permitted to see her, she gave him her hand with such a look of gratitude,
and something more, which she could not then disguise, that his heart began
to beat strangely fast.He was so confused that he could only stammer some
incoherent words of congratulation; but he half-consciously gave her hand a
pressure that left the most delicious pain the young girl had ever known.He was deeply excited, for he had taken a tremendous risk in springing upon
a creature that can strike its crooked fangs through the thick leather of a
boot, as a New York physician once learned at the cost of his life, when he
carelessly sought to rouse with his foot a caged reptile of this kind.Miss Hargrove had ceased to be a charming summer acquaintance to Burt.She was the woman at whose side he had stood in the presence of death.Before their midday repast was ready a rumble of wagons was heard coming
up the mountain, and Webb soon appeared."The barometer is falling
rapidly," he said, "and father agrees with me that it will be safer for
you all to return at once."He found ready acquiescence, for after the event of the morning the
ladies were in haste to depart.Lumley, who had come up with Webb, was
sent to take the rattles from the snake, and the men drew apart, with Alf
and Fred, to discuss the adventure, for it was tacitly agreed that it
would be unwise to talk about snakes to those whose nerves were already
unstrung at the thought of such fearful neighbors.Marvin would have
gone with Lumley had not his wife interposed.As it was, he had much to
say concerning the habits and character of the reptiles, to which the
boys listened with awe."By the way," he concluded, "I remember a passage
from that remarkable story, 'Elsie Venner,' by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in
which he gives the most vivid description of the rattlesnake I have ever
seen.One of his characters has two of them in a cage.'The expression of
the creatures,' he writes, 'was watchful, still, grave, passionless,
fate-like, suggesting a cold malignity which seemed to be waiting for its
opportunity.Their awful, deep-cut mouths were sternly closed over long,
hollow fangs, which rested their roots against the swollen poison-gland
where the venom had been hoarded up ever since the last stroke had
emptied it.They never winked, for ophidians have no movable eyelids, but
kept up an awful fixed stare.Their eyes did not flash, but shone with a
cold, still light.They were of a pale golden color, horrible to look
into, with their stony calmness, their pitiless indifference, hardly
enlivened by the almost imperceptible vertical slit of the pupil, through
which Death seemed to be looking out, like the archer behind the long,
narrow loophole in a blank turret wall.'The description is superb, and
impressed itself so deeply on my mind that I can always recall it."The ladies now joined them at dinner--the last at their rustic board.Miss Hargrove was very pale, but she was a spirited girl, and was bent on
proving that there was nothing weak or hysterical in her nature.Neither
was there the flippancy that a shallow woman might have manifested.She
acted like a brave, well-bred lady, whose innate refinement and good
sense enabled her speedily to regain her poise, and take her natural
place among her friends.They all tried to be considerate, and Amy's
solicitude did not indicate the jealousy that her friend almost expected
to see.Before they had finished their repast an east wind was moaning and
sighing in the trees, and a thin scud of clouds overcasting the sky.They
were soon in the haste and bustle of departure.Miss Hargrove found an
opportunity, however, to draw Dr.Marvin aside, and asked, hesitatingly,

"If Burt--if Mr.Clifford had missed his aim when he sprang upon the
snake, what would have happened?""You had better not dwell on that scene for the present, Miss Hargrove.""But I wish to know," she said, decisively."I am not a child, and I
think I have a right to know.""Well," said the doctor, gravely, "you are brave about it, and may as
well know the truth.Indeed, a little thought would soon make it clear to
you that if he had struck the body of the snake and left its head free,
it would have bitten him."She drew a long breath, and said, "I thought as much"; then added, in a
low tone, "Would it have been death?""Not necessarily; but only the most vigorous treatment could have saved
him.""Certainly; but a brave man could scarcely have acted otherwise.The
snake was at your very feet.""Thank you," she said, simply, and there was a very gentle expression in
her eyes.Much of the work of breaking up was left to Lumley, and an abundant
reward for his labor.He had returned with an exultant grin, but at a
sign from Dr.As soon as he had a chance,
however, he gave Burt two rattles, one having twelve and the other
fourteen joints, thus proving the fear, that the mate of the snake first
killed was not far off, to be well grounded.At the foot of the mountain
they met Mr.He explained that his barometer
and the indications of a storm had alarmed him also, and that he had come
for his daughter and Fred.Nothing was said of Miss Hargrove's recent
peril in the brief, cordial parting.Her eyes and Burt's met almost
involuntarily as she was driven away, and he was deeply perturbed.The face of Nature was also clouding fast, and she was sighing and
moaning as if she, too, dreaded the immediate future.CHAPTER XLV

SUMMER'S WEEPING FAREWELL


Nature was at last awakening from her long, deathlike repose with an
energy that was startling.The thin skirmish-line of vapor was followed
by cloudy squadrons, and before sunset great masses of mist were pouring
over Storm King, suggesting that the Atlantic had taken the drought in
hand, and meant to see what it could do.The wind mourned and shrieked
about the house, as if trouble, and not relief, were coming.In spite of
the young moon, the night grew intensely dark.The dash of rain was
expected every moment, but it did not come.Amy thought with a shudder of their desolate camping-ground.Time must
pass before pleasant associations could be connected with it.The intense
darkness, the rush and roar of the coming storm, the agony, the death
that might have occurred there, were now uppermost in her mind.She had
found an opportunity to ask Webb questions similar to those of Miss
Hargrove, and he had given Burt full credit for taking a fearful risk.A
woman loves courage in the abstract, and when it is shown in behalf of
herself or those whom she loves, he who has manifested it became heroic.But her homage troubled Burt, who was all at sea, uncertain of himself,
of the future, of almost everything, but not quite uncertain as to Miss
Hargrove.There was something in her look when they first met after their
common peril that went straight to his deepest consciousness.He had
before received, with not a little complacency, glances of preference,
but none like that, in which a glimpse of feeling, deep and strong, had
been revealed in a moment of weakness.The thought of it moved him far
more profoundly than the remembrance of his danger.Indeed, he scarcely
thought of that, except as it was associated with a girl who now might
have been dead or dying, and who, by a glance, had seemed to say, "What
you saved is yours."If this were true it was indeed a priceless, overwhelming gift, and he
was terrified at himself as he found how his whole nature was responding.He also knew that it was not in his frank, impetuous spirit to disguise
deep feeling.Should Miss Hargrove control his heart, he feared that all
would eventually know it, as they had speedily discovered his other
little affairs.And little, indeed, they now seemed to him, relating to
girls as immature as himself.Some had since married, others were
engaged, "and none ever lost their appetites," he concluded, with a grim
smile.But he could not thus dismiss the past so far as Amy was concerned, the
orphan girl in his own home to whom he had promised fealty.What would be
his feeling toward another man who had promised so much and had proved
fickle?What would the inmates of his own home say?What would even his
gentle mother, of whom he had made a confidante, think of him?Would not
a look of pain, or, even worse, of scorn, come into Amy's eyes?He did
love her dearly; he respected her still more as the embodiment of truth
and delicacy.From Miss Hargrove's manner he knew that Amy had never
gossiped about him, as he felt sure nine-tenths of his acquaintances
would have done.He also believed that she was taking him at his word,
like the rest of the family, and that she was looking forward to the
future that he had once so ardently desired.The past had taught him that
she was not one to fall tumultuously in love, but rather that she would
let a quiet and steady flame kindle in her heart, to last through life.She had proved herself above hasty and resentful jealousy, but she had,
nevertheless, warned him on the mountain, and had received the renewed
manifestations of his loyalty as a matter of course.Since his rescue of
her friend in the morning her eyes had often sought his with a lustre so
gentle and approving that he felt guilty, and cursed himself for a fickle
wretch.Cost him what it might, he must be true to her.She, little divining his tragic mood, which, with the whole force of his
will, he sought to disguise, gave him an affectionate good-night kiss as
she said, "Dear Burt, how happily the day has ended, after all!--and we
know the reason why.""Yes, Burt," added Webb; "no man ever did a braver thing."His father's hearty praise, and even his mother's grateful and almost
passionate embrace, only added to his deep unrest.As he went to his room
he groaned, "If they only knew!"After very little and troubled sleep he awoke on the following morning
depressed and exhausted.Mental distress was a new experience, and he
showed its effects; but he made light of it, as the result of
over-excitement and fatigue.He felt that Nature harmonized with his
mood, for he had scarcely ever looked upon a gloomier sky.Yet, strange
to say, no rain had fallen.It seemed as if the malign spell could not be
broken.The wind that had been whirling the dust in clouds all night long
grew fitful, and died utterly away, while the parched earth and withered
herbage appeared to look at the mocking clouds in mute, despairing
appeal.How could they be so near, so heavy, and yet no rain?The air was
sultry and lifeless.Fall had come, but no autumn days as yet.Clifford looked often at the black, lowering sky, and
predicted that a decided change was at hand."My fear is," he added, "that the drought may be followed by a deluge.I
don't like the looks of the clouds in the southeast."Even as he spoke a gleam of lightning shot athwart them, and was soon
followed by a heavy rumble of thunder.It seemed that the electricity,
or, rather, the concussion of the air, precipitated the dense vapor into
water, for within a few moments down came the rain in torrents.As the
first great drops struck the roads the dust flew up as if smitten by a
blow, and then, with scarcely any interval, the gutters and every incline
were full of tawny rills, that swelled and grew with hoarser and deeper
murmurs, until they combined in one continuous roar with the downfall
from clouds that seemed scarcely able to lift themselves above the
tree-tops.The lightning was not vivid, but often illumined the obscurity
with a momentary dull red glow, and thunder muttered and growled in the
distance almost without cessation.To Amy its gloomy, portentous ending was
even more so.The arid noonday heat and glare of preceding days had given
place to a twilight so unnatural that it had almost the awe-inspiring
effect of an eclipse.The hitherto brazen sky seemed to have become an
overhanging reservoir from which poured a vertical cataract.The clouds
drooped so heavily, and were so black, that they gave an impression of
impending solid masses that might fall at any moment with crushing
weight.Within an hour the beds of streams long dry were full and
overflowing.In spite of remonstrances Webb put on a rubber suit, and went to look
after some little bridges on the place.He soon returned, and said, "If
this keeps up until morning, there will be a dozen bridges lacking in our
region.I've tried to anchor some of our little affairs by putting heavy
stones on them, so that the water will pass over instead of sweeping them
away.It makes one think that the flood was no myth."To the general relief, the rain slackened in the late afternoon, and soon
ceased.The threatening pall of clouds lifted a little, and in rocky
channels on the mountains the dull gleam of rushing water could be seen.From every side its voice was heard, the scale running up, from the
gurgle in the pipes connected with the roof, to the roar of the nearest
large stream.As the day advanced Burt had grown very restless.The long day of imprisonment had given time for thought, and a
review of the past novel and exciting experiences.She had not seen the
glances from Miss Hargrove which had suggested so much to Burt, but she
had long since perceived that her friend greatly enjoyed his society.Had
she loved him she would have seen far more.If this interest had been
shown in Webb, she would have understood herself and Miss Hargrove also
much better.Preoccupied as she was by her sense of loss and shortcoming
produced by Webb's apparent absorption in pursuits which she did not
share, the thought had repeatedly occurred to her that Miss Hargrove's
interest in Burt might be more than passing and friendly.If this were
true, she was sure the event of the preceding day must develop and deepen
it greatly.And now Burt's manner, his fits of absent-mindedness, during
which he stared at vacancy, awakened surmises also.she queried, and she resolved to find out."Burt," she said, arousing him from one of the lapses into deep thought
which alternated with his restless pacings and rather forced gayety, "it
has stopped raining.I think you ought to ride over and see how Gertrude
is."Do you truly think I ought to go?""Certainly, and it would be a favor to me also," she added.He looked at her searchingly for a moment, but there was nothing in her
friendly expression to excite his fears."Very well," he tried to say quietly.A swift gallop would do
me good, I believe.""Of course it will, and so will a walk brighten me up.I'm going out to
see the brook.""Let me go with you," he exclaimed, with an eagerness too pronounced.I'd rather hear how Gertrude is;" and she went to her room
to prepare for her walk, smiling a little bitterly as she mused: "I now
know where his thoughts were.Not only brother
Webb, but also lover Burt, has grown weary of me.I can't entertain
either of them through one rainy day."From her window she saw Burt
riding away with a promptness that brought again the smile rarely seen on
her fair features.In her light rubber suit, she started on her ramble,
her face almost as clouded as the sky.Another had been on the watch
also, and Webb soon joined her, with the question, "May I not go too?""Oh, I fear it will take too much of your time," she said, in tones that
were a little constrained.He, too, had been interpreting Burt, and
guessed his destination as he galloped away.His love for Amy was so deep
that in a generous impulse of self-forgetfulness he was sorry for her,
and sought to cheer her, and make what poor amends he could for Burt's
absence, and all that it foreboded."Since you don't say outright that I
can't go," he said, "I think I'll venture;" and then, in a quiet, genial
way, he began to talk about the storm and its effects.She would not have
believed that even remarkable weather could be made so interesting a
topic as it soon proved.Before long they stood upon the bank, and saw a
dark flood rushing by where but yesterday had trickled a little rill.Now
it would carry away horse and rider, should they attempt to ford it, and
the fields beyond were covered with water."I don't like these violent changes," said Amy."Tennyson's brook, that
'goes on forever,' is more to my taste than one like this, that almost
stops, and then breaks out into a passionate, reckless torrent.""It's the nature of this brook; you should not blame it," he answered."But see, it's falling rapidly already.""Oh, certainly; nothing lasts," and she turned away abruptly."You are mistaken, sister Amy," he replied, with strong, quiet emphasis.The early twilight deepened around them, and gloomy night came on apace,
but before Amy re-entered the house his unselfish efforts were rewarded.Burt's threatened disloyalty apparently had lost its depressing
influence.Some subtile reassuring power had been at work, and the clouds
passed from her face, if not from the sky.CHAPTER XLVI

FATHER AND DAUGHTER


That sombre day would ever be a memorable one to Miss Hargrove.Nature
seemed weeping passionately over the summer that had gone, with all its
wealth of beauty and life.She knew that her girlhood had gone with it.She had cautioned her brother to say nothing of her escape on the
previous day, for she was too unnerved to go over the scene again that
night, and meet her father's questioning eyes.She wanted to be alone
first and face the truth; and this she had done in no spirit of weak
self-deception.The shadow of the unknown had fallen upon her, and in its
cold gray light the glitter and tinsel of the world had faded, but
unselfish human love had grown more luminous.The imminence of death had
kindled rather than quenched it.It was seen to be something intrinsically
precious, something that might survive even the deadliest poison.Her father was disposed to regard Burt as one who looked upon life in the
light of a pleasure excursion, and who might never take it seriously.His
laugh hereafter could never be so light and careless to her but that,
like a minor key, would run the thought, "He risked his life for me; he
might have died for me."Her dark, full eyes, the warm blood that her thoughts brought into her
face even in the solitude of her chamber, did not belie her nature, which
was intense, and capable of a strong and an abiding passion when once
kindled.Hargrove had watched her with the deepest solicitude on her return,
and he felt rather than saw the change that had taken place in his idol.In the morning she was again
conscious of his half-questioning scrutiny, and when he went to his study
she followed, and told him what had occurred.He grew very pale, and drew
a long, deep breath.Then, as if mastered by a strong impulse, he clasped
her to his heart, and said, in trembling tones, "Oh, Trurie, if I had
lost you!""I fear you would have lost me, papa, had it not been for Mr.He paced the room for a few moments in agitation, and at last stopped
before her and said: "Perhaps in a sense I am to lose you after all."No, papa; he has only risked his life to save mine.""Do not think I underestimate his act, Trurie; but, believe me, if he
should speak now or soon, you are in no condition to answer him.""He did what any man would do for a woman in peril.He has no right to
claim such an immense reward.""Before I went to the mountains I said I was no longer a child; but I
was, compared with what I am now.It seems to me that feeling,
experience, more than years, measures our age.I am a woman to-day, one
who has been brought so near the future world that I have been taught how
to value what may be ours now.I have learned how to value you and your
unselfish love as I never did before.Mary went back to the kitchen.Clifford will not speak very
soon, if he ever does, and I have not yet decided upon my answer.Should
it be favorable, rest assured more than gratitude will prompt me; and
also be assured you would not lose me.Could I not be more to you were I
happy than if I went through life with the feeling that I had missed my
chance?""I fear your mother would never give her consent to so unworldly a
choice," he said, with a troubled brow."I've yet to be convinced that it would be such a choice.It's scarcely
unworldly to make the most and the best of the world one is in, and mamma
must permit me to judge for myself, as she chose for herself.I shall
never marry any one but a gentleman, and one who can give me a home.Have
I not a right to prefer a home to an establishment, papa?"He looked at her long and searchingly, and she met his scrutiny with a
grave and gentle dignity."I suppose we must submit to the inevitable,"
he said at last."It seems but the other day that you were a baby on my knee," he began,
sadly; "and now you are drifting far away.""No, papa, there shall be no drifting whatever.I shall marry, if ever,
one whom I have learned to love according to Nature's simple laws--one to
whom I can go without effort or calculation.I could give my heart, and
be made rich indeed by the gift.I couldn't invest it; and if I did, no
one would be more sorry than you in the end.""I should indeed be more than sorry if I ever saw you unhappy," he said,
after another thoughtful pause; then added, shaking his head, "I've seen
those who gave their hearts even more disappointed with life than those
who took counsel of prudence.""I shall take counsel of prudence, and of you too, papa.""I think it is as I feared--you have already given your heart."Before leaving him she pleaded: "Do not make much of
my danger to mamma.She is nervous, and not over-fond of the country at
best.You know that a good many people survive in the country," she
concluded, with a smile that was so winning and disarming that he shook
his head at her as he replied:

"Well, Trurie, I foresee what a lovingly obstinate little girl you are
likely to prove.I think I may as well tell you first as last that you
may count on me in all that is fairly rational.If, with my years and
experience, I can be so considerate, may I hope that you will be also?"Her answer was reassuring, and she went to tell her mother.Fred was quite as confidential with his mother as she with
her father, and the boy had been wild to horrify Mrs.Hargrove by an
account of his sister's adventure.The injunction laid upon him had been
only for the previous evening, and Gertrude found her mother almost
hysterical over the affair, and less inclined to commend Burt than to
blame him as the one who had led her daughter into such "wild,
harum-scarum experiences.""It's always the way," she exclaimed, "when one goes out of one's own
natural associations in life.""I've not been out of my natural associations," Gertrude answered, hotly."The Cliffords are as well-bred and respectable as we are;" and she went
to her room.It was a long, dismal day for her, but, as she had said to her father,
she would not permit herself to drift.Her nature was too positive for
idle, sentimental dreaming.Feeling that she was approaching one of the
crises of her life, she faced it resolutely and intelligently.She went
over the past weeks from the time she had first met Burt under the Gothic
willow arch, and tried to analyze not only the power he had over her, but
also the man himself."I have claimed to papa that I am a woman, and I
should act like one," she thought.Her interest
in Burt had been a purely natural growth, the unsought result of
association with one who had proved congenial.He was so handsome, so
companionable, so vital with spirit and mirthfulness, that his simple
presence was exhilarating, and he had won his influence like the sun in
spring-time.Had he the higher qualities of manhood, those that could
sustain her in the inevitable periods when life would be no laughing
matter?Could he meet the winter of life as well as the summer?She felt
that she scarcely knew him well enough to be sure of this, but she was
still sufficiently young and romantic to think, "If he should ever love
me as I can love him, I could bring out the qualities that papa fears are
lacking."His courage seemed an earnest of all that she could desire.Amy's feeling toward him, and the question whether he had ever regarded
her in another light than that of a sister, troubled her the most.Amy's
assurance of implicit trust, and her promise to deserve it, appeared to
stand directly in her path, and before that stormy day closed she had
reached the calmness of a fixed resolution."If Amy loves him, and he has
given her reason to do so, I shall not come between them, cost me what it
may.I'll do without happiness rather than snatch it from a friend who
has not only spoken her trust, but proved it."Therefore, although her heart gave a great bound as she saw Burt riding
toward the house in the late afternoon, she went to her father and said:
"Mr.I wish you would be present during his call."The young fellow was received cordially, and Mr.Hargrove acknowledged
his indebtedness so feelingly that Burt flushed like a girl, and was
greatly embarrassed.He soon recovered himself, however, and chatted in
his usual easy and spirited way.Before he left he asked, hesitatingly,
"Would you like a souvenir of our little episode yesterday?"and took
from his pocket the rattles of the snake he had killed."It was not a little episode," Gertrude replied, gravely."I shall indeed
value the gift, for it will remind me that I have a friend who did not
count the cost in trying to help me."Impetuous words rose to Burt's lips, but he checked them in time.Trembling for his resolutions, he soon took his departure, and rode
homeward in deeper disquiet than he had ever known.He gave Amy her
friend's messages, and he also, in spite of himself, afforded her a
clearer glimpse of what was passing in his mind than she had received
before."I might have learned to love him in time, I suppose," she
thought, bitterly, "but it's impossible now.I shall build my future on
no such uncertain foundation, and I shall punish him a little, too, for
it's time he had a lesson."CHAPTER XLVII

DISQUIET WITHIN AND WITHOUT


Amy would scarcely have been human had she felt otherwise, for it
appeared that Burt was in a fair way to inflict a slight that would touch
the pride of the gentlest nature.During her long residence abroad Amy
had in a general and unthinking way adopted some English ideas on the
subject of marriage.Burt had at first required what was unnatural and
repugnant, and she had resented the demand that she should pass from an
age and a state of feeling slightly removed from childhood to relations
for which she was not ready.When he had sensibly recognized his error,
and had appeared content to wait patiently and considerately, she had
tacitly assented to his hopes and those of his parents.Her love and
gratitude toward the latter influenced her powerfully, and she saw no
reason why she should disappoint them.But she was much too high-spirited
a girl to look with patience on any wavering in Burt.She had not set her
heart on him or sought to be more to him than to a brother, and if he
wished for more he must win and hold the right by undoubted loyalty.The
fact that Amy had been brought into the Clifford family as a daughter and
sister had not cheated Nature a moment, as both Burt and Webb had proved.She was not their sister, and had unconsciously evoked from each of the
young men a characteristic regard.He had to contend with a temperament not uncommon--one that renders its
possessor highly susceptible to the beauty and fascination of women.He
was as far removed from the male flirt genus as sincerity is from
falsehood; but his passion for Amy had been more like a manifestation of
a trait than a strong individual preference based on mutual fitness and
helpfulness.Miss Hargrove was more truly his counterpart.She could
supplement the weaknesses and defects of his character more successfully
than Amy, and in a vague way he felt this.With all the former's vivacity
there was much reserve strength and magnetism.She was unusually gifted
with will power, and having once gained an influence over a person, she
would have, as agents to maintain it, not only her beauty, but tact, keen
insight and a very quick intelligence.Although true herself, she was by
no means unsophisticated, and having once comprehended Burt's character,
she would have the power, possessed by few others, to make the most of
him.She would first attract unconsciously, like a
rare and beautiful flower, and the loveliness and fragrance of her life
would be undying.Burt had felt her charm, and responded most decisively;
but the tranquil regard of her unawakened heart had little power to
retain and deepen his feeling.She bloomed on at his side, sweet to him,
sweet to all.In Miss Hargrove's dark eyes lurked a stronger spell, and
he almost dared to believe that they had revealed to him a love of which
he began to think Amy was not capable.On the generous young fellow,
whose intentions were good, this fact would have very great influence,
and in preserving her supremacy Miss Hargrove would also be able to
employ not a little art and worldly wisdom.The events that are most desired do not always happen, however, and poor
Burt felt that he had involved himself in complications of which he saw
no solution; while Amy's purpose to give him "a lesson" promised anything
but relief.Her plan involved scarcely any change in her manner toward
him.She would simply act as if she believed all that he had said, and
take it for granted that his hopes for the future were unchanged.She
proposed, however, to maintain this attitude only long enough to teach
him that it is not wise, to say the least, to declare undying devotion
too often to different ladies.The weather during the night and early on the following morning was
puzzling.It might be that the storm was passing, and that the ragged
clouds which still darkened the sky were the rear-guard or the stragglers
that were following the sluggish advance of its main body; or it might be
that there was a partial break in Nature's forces, and that heavier
cloud-masses were still to come.Clifford inclined to the latter
view."Old Storm King is still shrouded," he said at the breakfast-table,
"and this heavy, sultry air does not indicate clearing weather."Nature seemed bent on repeating the
programme of the preceding day, with the purpose of showing how much more
she could do on the same line of action.There was no steady wind from
any quarter.Converging or conflicting currents in the upper air may have
brought heavy clouds together in the highlands to the southwest, for
although the rain began to fall heavily, it could not account for the
unprecedented rise of the streams.In little over an hour there was a
continuous roar of rushing water.Burt, restless and almost reckless,
went out to watch the floods.He soon returned to say that every bridge
on the place had gone, and that what had been dry and stony channels
twenty-four hours before were now filled with resistless torrents.Webb also put on his rubber suit, and they went down the main street
toward the landing.This road, as it descended through a deep valley to
the river, was bordered by a stream that drained for some miles the
northwestern <DW72> of the mountains.For weeks its rocky bed had been
dry; now it was filled with a river yellow as the Tiber.One of the main
bridges across it was gone, and half of the road in one place had been
scooped out and carried away by the furious waters.People were removing
their household goods out into the vertical deluge lest they and all they
had should be swept into the river by the torrent that was above their
doorsteps.The main steamboat wharf, at which the "Powell" had touched
but a few hours before, was scarcely passable with boats, so violent was
the current that poured over it.The rise had been so sudden that people
could scarcely realize it, and strange incidents had occurred.A horse
attached to a wagon had been standing in front of a store.A vivid flash
of lightning startled the animal, and he broke away, galloped up a side
street to the spot where the bridge had been, plunged in, was swept down,
and scarcely more than a minute had elapsed before he was back within a
rod or two of his starting-point, crushed and dead.He had noticed that Amy's eyes had followed him
wistfully, and almost reproachfully, as he went out.Nature's mood was
one to inspire awe, and something akin to dread, in even his own mind.She appeared to have lost or to have relaxed her hold upon her forces.It
seemed that the gathered stores of moisture from the dry, hot weeks of
evaporation were being thrown recklessly away, regardless of consequences.There was no apparent storm-centre, passing steadily to one quarter of the
heavens, but on all sides the lightning would leap from the clouds, while
mingling with the nearer and louder peals was the heavy and continuous
monotone from flashes below the horizon.He was glad he had returned, for he found Amy pale and nervous indeed.Johnnie had been almost crying with terror, and had tremblingly asked her
mother if Noah's flood could come again."If there was to be another flood,
grandpa would have been told to build an ark;" and this assurance had
appeared so obviously true that the child's fears were quieted.Even
Leonard's face was full of gloom and foreboding, when the children were
not present, as he looked out on flooded fields, and from much experience
estimated the possible injury to the farm and the town.They had attained a peace which was not
easily disturbed, and the old gentleman remarked: "I have seen a worse
storm even in this vicinity."But this deluge isn't over," was the reply."It seems a tremendous
reaction from the drought, and where it will end it is hard to tell,
unless this steady downpouring slackens soon."Leonard's fears were not realized, however.The unusual and tropical
manifestations of the storm at last ceased, and by night the rain fell
softly and gently, as if Nature were penitent over her wild passion.The
results of it, however, were left in all directions.Many roads were
impassable; scores of bridges were gone.The passengers from the evening
boats were landed on a wharf partially submerged, and some were taken in
boats to a point whence they could reach their carriages.In the elements' disquiet Burt had found an excuse for his own, and he
had remained out much of the day.He had not called on Miss Hargrove
again, but had ridden far enough to learn that the bridges in that
direction were safe.All the family had remonstrated with him for his
exposure, and Amy asked him, laughingly, if he had been "sitting on
bridges to keep them from floating away.""You are growing ironical," he answered for he was not in an amiable
mood, and he retired early.CHAPTER XLVIII

IDLEWILD


In the morning Nature appeared to have forgotten both her passion and her
penitence, and smiled serenely over the havoc she had made, as if it were
of no consequence.Amy said, "Let us take the strong rockaway, call for Miss Hargrove, and
visit some of the streams"; and she noted that Burt's assent was too
undemonstrative to be natural.Maggie decided to go also, and take the
children, while Leonard proposed to devote the day to repairing the
damage to the farm, his brothers promising to aid him in the afternoon.When at last the party left their carriage at one of the entrances of
Idlewild, the romantic glen made so famous by the poet Willis, a stranger
might have thought that he had never seen a group more in accord with the
open, genial sunshine.This would be true of Maggie and the children.They thought of that they saw, and uttered all their thoughts.The
solution of one of life's deep problems had come to Maggie, but not to
the others, and such is the nature of this problem that its solution can
usually be reached only by long and hidden processes.Not one of the four
young people was capable of a deliberately unfair policy; all, with the
exception of Amy, were conscious whither Nature was leading them, and she
had thoughts also of which she would not speak.There was no lack of
truth in the party, and yet circumstances had brought about a larger
degree of reticence than of frankness.To borrow an illustration from
Nature, who, after all, was to blame for what was developing in each
heart, a rapid growth of root was taking place, and the flower and fruit
would inevitably manifest themselves in time.Miss Hargrove naturally had
the best command over herself.She had taken her course, and would abide
by it, no matter what she might suffer.Burt had mentally set his teeth,
and resolved that he would be not only true to Amy, but also his old gay
self.Amy, however, was not to be
deceived, and her intuition made it clear that he was no longer her old
happy, contented comrade.But she was too proud to show that her pride
was wounded, and appeared to be her former self.Webb, as usual, was
quiet, observant, and not altogether hopeless.And so this merry party,
innocent, notwithstanding all their hidden thoughts about each other,
went down into the glen, and saw the torrent flashing where the sunlight
struck it through the overhanging foliage.Half-way down the ravine there
was a rocky, wooded plateau from which they had a view of the flood for
some distance, as it came plunging toward them with a force and volume
that appeared to threaten the solid foundations of the place on which
they stood.With a roar of baffled fury it sheered off to the left,
rushed down another deep descent, and disappeared from view.The scene
formed a strange blending of peace and beauty with wild, fierce movement
and uproar.From the foliage above and around them came a soft,
slumberous sound, evoked by the balmy wind that fanned their cheeks.The
ground and the surface of the torrent were flecked with waving, dancing
light and shade, as the sunlight filtered through innumerable leaves, on
some of which a faint tinge of red and gold was beginning to appear.Beneath and through all thundered a dark, resistless tide, fit emblem of
lawless passion that, unchanged, unrestrained by gentle influences,
pursues its downward course reckless of consequences.Although the volume
of water passing beneath their feet was still immense, it was evident
that it had been very much greater."I stood here yesterday afternoon,"
said Burt, "and then the sight was truly grand.""Why, it was raining hard in the afternoon!""Burt seemed even more perturbed than the weather yesterday," Amy
remarked, laughing.We were alarmed
about him, fearing lest he should be washed away, dissolved, or
something.""Do I seem utterly quenched this morning?"he asked, in a light vein, but
flushing deeply."Oh, no, not in the least, and yet it's strange, after so much cold water
has fallen on you.""One is not quenched by such trifles," he replied, a little coldly.They were about to turn away, when a figure sprang out upon a rock, far
up the stream, in the least accessible part of the glen.Alvord, as he stood with folded arms and looked down on
the flood that rushed by on either side of him.He had not seen them, and
no greeting was possible above the sound of the waters.Webb thought as
he carried little Ned up the steep path, "Perhaps, in the mad current, he
sees the counterpart of some period in his past."The bridge across the mouth of Idlewild Brook was gone, and they next
went to the landing.The main wharf was covered with large stones and
gravel, the debris of the flood that had poured over it from the adjacent
stream, whose natural outlet had been wholly inadequate.Then they drove
to the wild and beautiful Mountainville road, that follows the Moodna
Creek for a long distance.They could not proceed very far, however, for
they soon came to a place where a tiny brook had passed under a wooden
bridge.Now there was a great yawning chasm.Not only the bridge, but
tons of earth were gone.The Moodna Creek, that had almost ceased to flow
in the drought, had become a tawny river, and rushed by them with a
sullen roar, flanging over the tide was an old dead tree, on which was
perched a fish-hawk.Even while they were looking at him, and Burt was
wishing for his rifle, the bird swooped downward, plunged into the stream
with a splash, and rose with a fish in his talons.It was an admirable
exhibition of fearlessness and power, and Burt admitted that such a
sportsman deserved to live.CHAPTER XLIX

ECHOES OF A PAST STORM


Miss Hargrove returned to dine with them, and as they were lingering over
the dessert and coffee Webb remarked, "By the way, I think the poet
Willis has given an account of a similar, or even greater, deluge in this
region."He soon returned from the library, and read the following
extracts: "'I do not see in the Tribune or other daily papers any mention
of an event which occupies a whole column on the outside page of the
highest mountain above West Point.An avalanche of earth and stone, which
has seamed from summit to base the tall bluff that abuts upon the Hudson,
forming a column of news visible for twenty miles, has reported a deluge
we have had--a report a mile long, and much broader than Broadway.'"Clifford, "that's the flood of which I spoke
yesterday.It was very local, but was much worse than the one we have
just had.Willis
wrote a good deal about the affair in his letters from Idlewild.Webb, selecting here and there, continued to read: "'We have had a deluge
in the valley immediately around us--a deluge which is shown by the
overthrown farm buildings, the mills, dams, and bridges swept away, the
well-built roads cut into chasms, the destruction of horses and cattle,
and the imminent peril to life.It occurred on the evening of August 1,
and a walk to-day down the valley which forms the thoroughfare to
Cornwall Landing (or, rather, a scramble over its gulfs in the road, its
upset barns and sheds, its broken vehicles, drift lumber, rocks, and
rubbish) would impress a stranger like a walk after the deluge of Noah."'The flood came upon us with scarce half an hour's notice.My venerable
neighbor, of eighty years of age, who had passed his life here, and knows
well the workings of the clouds among the mountains, had dined with us,
but hastened his departure to get home before what looked like a shower,
crossing with his feeble steps the stream whose strongest bridge, an hour
after, was swept away.Another of our elderly neighbors had a much
narrower escape.The sudden rush of water alarmed him for the safety of
an old building he used for his stable, which stood upon the bank of the
small stream usually scarce noticeable as it crosses the street at the
landing.He had removed his horse, and returned to unloose a favorite
dog, but before he could accomplish it the building fell.The single jump
with which he endeavored to clear himself of the toppling rafters threw
him into the torrent, and he was swept headlong toward the gulf which it
had already torn in the wharf on the Hudson.His son and two others
plunged in, and succeeded in snatching him from destruction.Another
citizen was riding homeward, when the solid and strongly embanked road
was swept away before and behind him, and he had barely time to unhitch
his horse and escape, leaving his carriage islanded between the chasms.A
man who was driving with his wife and child along our own wall on the
river-shore had a yet more fearful escape: his horse suddenly forced to
swim, and his wagon set afloat, and carried so violently against a tree
by the swollen current of Idlewild Brook that he and his precious load
were thrown into the water, and with difficulty reached the bank beyond.A party of children who were out huckleberrying on the mountain were
separated from home by the swollen brook, and one of them was nearly
drowned in vainly attempting to cross it.Their parents and friends were
out all night in search of them.An aged farmer and his wife, who had
been to Newburgh, and were returning with their two-horse wagon well
laden with goods, attempted to drive over a bridge as it unsettled with
the current, and were precipitated headlong.The old man caught a sapling
as he went down with the flood, the old woman holding on to his
coat-skirts, and so they struggled until their cries brought assistance.'One large building was completely
disembowelled, and the stream coursed violently between the two halves of
its ruins.'I was stopped,' he writes in another place, 'as I scrambled
along the gorge, by a curious picture for the common highway.The brick
front of the basement of a dwelling-house had been torn off, and the
mistress of the house was on her hands and knees, with her head thrust in
from a rear window, apparently getting her first look down into the
desolated kitchen from which she had fled in the night.A man stood in
the middle of the floor, up to his knees in water, looking round in
dismay, though he had begun to pick up some of the overset chairs and
utensils.The fireplace, with its interrupted supper arrangements, the
dresser, with its plates and pans, its cups and saucers, the closets and
cupboards, with their various stores and provisions, were all laid open
to the road like a sliced watermelon.'""Well," ejaculated Leonard, "we haven't so much cause to complain, after
hearing of an affair like that.I do remember many of my impressions at
the time, now that the event is recalled so vividly, but have forgotten
how so sudden a flood was accounted for.""Willis speaks of it on another page," continued Webb, "as 'the
aggregation of extensive masses of clouds into what is sometimes called a
"waterspout," by the meeting of winds upon the converging edge of our
bowl of highlands.The storm for a whole country was thus concentrated.'I think there must have been yesterday a far heavier fall of water on the
mountains a little to the southeast than we had here.Perhaps the truer
explanation in both instances would be that the winds brought heavy
clouds together or against the mountains in such a way as to induce an
enormous precipitation of vapor into rain.Willis indicates by the
following passage the suddenness of the flood he describes: 'My first
intimation that there was anything uncommon in the brook was the sight of
a gentleman in a boat towing a cow across the meadow under our library
window--a green glade seldom or never flooded.The roar from the foaming
precipices in the glen had been heard by us all, but was thought to be
thunder.'Then he tells how he and his daughter put on their rubber suits
and hastened into the glen.'The chasm,' he writes, 'in which the brook,
in any freshet I had heretofore seen, was still only a deep-down stream,
now seemed too small for the torrent.Those giddy precipices on which the
sky seems to lean as you stand below were the foam-lashed sides of a full
and mighty river.The spray broke through the tops of the full-grown
willows and lindens.As the waves plunged against the cliffs they parted,
and disclosed the trunks and torn branches of the large trees they had
overwhelmed and were bearing away, and the earth- flood, in the
wider places, was a struggling mass of planks, timber, rocks, and
roots--tokens of a tumultuous ruin above, to which the thunder-shower
pouring around us gave but a feeble clew.A heavy-limbed willow, which
overhung a rock on which I had often sat to watch the freshets of spring,
rose up while we looked at it, and with a surging heave, as if lifted by
an earthquake, toppled back, and was swept rushingly away.'""How I would have liked to see it!""I can see it," said Amy, leaning back, and closing her eyes."I can see
it all too vividly.I don't like nature in such moods."Then she took up
the volume, and began turning the leaves, and said: "I've never seen this
book before.Why, it's all about this region, and written before I was
born.Oh dear, here is another chapter of horrors!"and she read: "Close
to our gate, at the door of one of our nearest and most valued
neighbors--a lovely girl was yesterday struck dead by lightning.A friend
who stood with her at the moment was a greater sufferer, in being
prostrated by the same flash, and paralyzed from the waist downward--her
life spared at the cost of tortures inexpressible.'"Webb reached out his hand to take the book from her, but she sprang
aloof, and with dilating eyes read further: "'Misa Gilmour had been
chatting with a handsome boy admirer, but left him to take aside a
confidential friend that she might read her a letter.It was from her
mother, a widow with this only daughter.They passed out of the gate,
crossed the road to be out of hearing, and stood under the telegraph
wire, when the letter was opened.Her lips were scarce parted to read
when the flash came--an arrow of intense light-' Oh, horrible!How can you blame me for fear in a thunderstorm?""Amy," said Webb, now quietly taking the book, "your dread at such times
is constitutional.If there were need, you could face danger as well as
any of us.You would have all a woman's fortitude, and that surpasses
ours.Take the world over, the danger from lightning is exceedingly
slight, and it's not the danger that makes you tremble, but your nervous
organization.""You interpret me kindly," she said, "but I don't see why nature is so
full of horrible things.If Gertrude had been bitten by the snake, she
might have fared even worse than the poor girl of whom I have read."Miss Hargrove could not forbear a swift, grateful glance at Burt."I do not think nature is _full_ of horrible things," Webb resumed."Remember how many showers have cooled the air and made the earth
beautiful and fruitful in this region.In no other instance that I know
anything about has life been destroyed in our vicinity.There is indeed a
side to nature that is full of mystery--the old dark mystery of evil; but
I should rather say it is full of all that is beautiful and helpful.At
least this seems true of our region.I have never seen so much beauty in
all my life as during the past year, simply because I am forming the
habit of looking for it.""Why, Webb," exclaimed Amy, laughing, "I thought your mind was
concentrating on crops and subjects as deep as the ocean.""It would take all the salt of the ocean to save that remark," he
replied; but he beat a rather hasty retreat.Clifford, "you may now dismiss your fears.I
imagine that in our tropical storm summer has passed; and with it
thunder-showers and sudden floods.We may now look forward to two months
of almost ideal weather, with now and then a day that will make a book
and a wood fire all the more alluring."The days passed like bright
smiles, in which, however, lurked the pensiveness of autumn.Slowly
failing maples glowed first with the hectic flush of disease, but
gradually warmer hues stole into the face of Nature, for it is the dying
of the leaves that causes the changes of color in the foliage.CHAPTER L

IMPULSES OF THE HEART


The fall season brought increased and varied labors on the farm and in the
garden.As soon as the ground was dry after the tremendous storm, and its
ravages had been repaired as far as possible, the plows were busy preparing
for winter grain, turnips were thinned out, winter cabbages and
cauliflowers cultivated, and the succulent and now rapidly growing celery
earthed up.The fields of corn were watched, and as fast as the kernels
within the husks--now becoming golden-hued--were glazed, the stalks were
cut and tied in compact shocks.The sooner maize is cut, after it has
sufficiently matured, the better, for the leaves make more nutritious
fodder if cured or dried while still full of sap.From some fields the
shocks were wholly removed, that the land might be plowed and seeded with
grain and grass.Buckwheat, used merely as a green and scavenger crop, was
plowed under as it came into blossom, and that which was sown to mature was
cut in the early morning, while the dew was still upon it, for in the heat
of the day the grain shells easily, and is lost.After drying for a few
days in compact little heaps it was ready for the threshing-machine.Then
the black, angular kernels--promises of many winter breakfasts--were spread
to dry on the barn floor, for if thrown into heaps or bins at this early
stage, they heat badly.The Cliffords had long since learned that the large late peaches, that
mature after the Southern crop is out of the market, are the most
profitable, and almost every day Abram took to the landing a load of
baskets full of downy beauties.An orange grove, with Its deep green
foliage and golden fruit, is beautiful indeed, but an orchard laden with
Crawford's Late, in their best development, can well sustain comparison.Sharing the honors and attention given to the peaches were the Bartlett
and other early pears.These latter fruits were treated in much the same
way as the former.The trees were picked over every few days, and the
largest and ripest specimens taken, their maturity being indicated by the
readiness of the stem to part from the spray when the pear is lifted.The
greener and imperfect fruit was left to develop, and the trees, relieved
of much of their burden, were able to concentrate their forces on what
was left.The earlier red grapes, including the Delaware, Brighton, and
Agawam, not only furnished the table abundantly, but also a large surplus
for market.Indeed, there was high and dainty feasting at the Cliffords'
every day--fruit everywhere, hanging temptingly within reach, with its
delicate bloom untouched, untarnished.The storm and the seasonable rains that followed soon restored its
fulness and beauty to Nature's withered face.The drought had brought to
vegetation partial rest and extension of root growth, and now, with the
abundance of moisture, there was almost a spring-like revival.The grass
sprang up afresh, meadows and fields grew green, and annual weeds, from
seeds that had matured in August, appeared by the million."I am glad to see them," Webb remarked."Before they can mature any seed
the frost will put an end to their career of mischief, and there will be
so many seeds less to grow next spring.""There'll be plenty left," Leonard replied.The Cliffords, by their provident system of culture, had prepared for
droughts as mariners do for storms, and hence they had not suffered so
greatly as others; but busy as they were kept by the autumnal bounty of
Nature, and the rewards of their own industry, they found time for
recreation, and thoughts far removed from the material questions of
profit and loss.The drama of life went on, and feeling, conviction, and
love matured like the ripening fruits, although not so openly.As soon as
his duties permitted, Burt took a rather abrupt departure for a hunting
expedition in the northern woods, and a day or two later Amy received a
note from Miss Hargrove, saying that she had accepted an invitation to
join a yachting party.she exclaimed, "I wish you were not so awfully busy all the
time.Here I am, thrown wholly on your tender mercies, and I am neither a
crop nor a scientific subject."The increasing coolness and
exhilarating vitality of the air made not only labor agreeable, but
out-door sports delightful, and he found time for an occasional gallop,
drive, or ramble along roads and lanes lined with golden-rod and purple
asters; and these recreations had no other drawback than the uncertainty
and anxiety within his heart.The season left nothing to be desired, but
the outer world, even in its perfection, is only an accompaniment of
human life, which is often in sad discord with it.Nature, however, is a harmony of many and varied strains, and the unhappy
are always conscious of a deep minor key even on the brightest days.To
Alf and Johnnie the fall brought unalloyed joy and promise; to those who
were older, something akin to melancholy, which deepened with the autumn
of their life; while to Mr.Alvord every breeze was a sigh, every rising
wind a mournful requiem, and every trace of change a reminder that his
spring and summer had passed forever, leaving only a harvest of bitter
memories.Far different was the dreamy pensiveness with which Mr.Clifford looked back upon their vanished youth and maturity.At the
same time they felt within themselves the beginnings of an immortal
youth.Although it was late autumn with them, not memory, but hope, was
in the ascendant.During damp or chilly days, and on the evenings of late September, the
fire burned cheerily on the hearth of their Franklin stove.The old
gentleman had a curious fancy in regard to his fire-wood.He did not want
the straight, shapely sticks from their mountain land, but gnarled and
crooked billets, cut from trees about the place that had required pruning
and removal."I have associations with such fuel" he said, "and can usually recall the
trees--many of which I planted--from which it came; and as I watch it
burn and turn into coals, I see pictures of what happened many years
ago."One evening he threw on the fire a worm-eaten billet, the sound part of
which was as red as mahogany; then drew Amy to him and said, "I once sat
with your father under the apple-tree of which that piece of wood was a
part, and I can see him now as he then looked."She sat down beside him, and said, softly, "Please tell me how he
looked."In simple words the old man portrayed the autumn day, the fruit as golden
as the sunshine, a strong, hopeful man, who had passed away in a
far-distant land, but who was still a living presence to both.Amy looked
at the picture in the flickering blaze until her eyes were blinded with
tears.But such drops fall on the heart like rain and dew, producing
richer and more beautiful life.The pomp and glory of October were ushered in by days of such surpassing
balminess and brightness that it was felt to be a sin to remain indoors.The grapes had attained their deepest purple, and the apples in the
orchard vied with the brilliant and varied hues of the fast-turning
foliage.The nights were soft, warm, and resonant with the unchecked
piping of insects.From every tree and shrub the katydids contradicted
one another with increasing emphasis, as if conscious that the time was
at hand when the last word must be spoken.The stars glimmered near
through a delicate haze, and in the western sky the pale crescent of the
moon was so inclined that the old Indian might have hung upon it his
powder-horn.On such an evening the young people from the Cliffords' had gathered on
Mr.Hargrove's piazza, and Amy and Gertrude were looking at the new moon
with silver in their pockets, each making her silent wish.Amy had to think before deciding what she wanted most, but
not Miss Hargrove.Her face has grown thinner and paler during the last
few weeks; there is unwonted brilliancy in her eyes to-night, but her
expression is resolute.Times of
weakness, if such they could be called, would come, but they should not
appear in Burt's or Amy's presence.The former had just returned, apparently gayer than ever.His face was
bronzed from his out-door life in the Adirondacks.Its expression was
also resolute, and his eyes turned oftenest toward Amy, with a determined
loyalty.As has been said, not long after the experiences following the
storm, he had yielded to his impulse to go away and recover his poise.He
felt that if he continued to see Miss Hargrove frequently he might reveal
a weakness which would lead not only Amy to despise him, but also Miss
Hargrove, should she become aware of the past.As he often took such
outings, the family, with the exception of Webb and Amy, thought nothing
of it.His brother and the girl he had wooed so passionately now
understood him well enough to surmise his motive, and Amy had thought,
"It will do him good to go away and think awhile, but it will make no
difference; this new affair must run its course also."And yet her heart
began to relent toward him after a sisterly fashion.She wondered if Miss
Hargrove did regard him as other than a friend to whom she owed very
much.If so, she smiled at the idea of standing in the way of their
mutual happiness.She had endured his absence with exceeding tranquillity,
for Webb had given her far more of his society, and she, Alf, and Johnnie
often went out and aided him in gathering the fruit.For some reason these
light tasks had been more replete with quiet enjoyment than deliberate
pleasure-seeking.Burt had been at pains to take, in Amy's presence, a most genial and
friendly leave of Miss Hargrove, but there was no trace of the lover in
his manner.His smiles and cordial words had chilled her heart, and had
strengthened the fear that in some way he was bound to Amy.She knew that
she had fascinated and perhaps touched him deeply, but imagined she saw
indications of an allegiance that gave little hope for the future.If he
felt as she did, and were free, he would not have gone away; and when he
had gone, time grew leaden-footed.Absence is the touchstone, and by its
test she knew that her father was right, and that she, to whom so much
love had been given unrequited, had bestowed hers apparently in like
manner.Then had come an invitation to join a yachting party to Fortress
Monroe, and she had eagerly accepted.With the half-reckless impulse of
pride, she had resolved to throw away the dream that had promised so
much, and yet had ended in such bitter and barren reality.She would
forget it all in one brief whirl of gayety; and she had been the
brilliant life of the party.But how often her laugh had ended in a
stifled sigh!How often her heart told her, "This is not happiness, and
never can be again!"Her brief experience of what is deep and genuine in
life taught her that she had outgrown certain pleasures of the past, as a
child outgrows its toys, and she had returned thoroughly convinced that
her remedy was not in the dissipations of society.The evening after her return Burt, with Webb and Amy, had come to call,
and as she looked upon him again she asked herself, in sadness, "Is there
any remedy?"She was not one to give her heart in a half-way manner.It seemed to her that he had been absent for years, and had grown
indefinitely remote.Never before had she gained the impression so
strongly that he was in some way bound to Amy, and would abide by his
choice.If this were true, she felt that the sooner she left the vicinity
the better, and even while she chatted lightly and genially she was
planning to induce her father to return to the city at an early date.Before parting, Amy spoke of her pleasure at the return of her friend,
who, she said, had been greatly missed, adding: "Now we shall make up for
lost time.The roads are in fine condition for horseback exercise,
nutting expeditions will soon be in order, and we have a bee-hunt on the
programme.""I congratulate you on your prospects," said Miss Hargrove."I wish I
could share in all your fun, but fear I shall soon return to the city."Burt felt a sudden chill at these words, and a shadow from them fell
across his face.Webb saw their effect, and he at once entered on a
rather new role for him."Then we must make the most of the time before
you go," he began."I propose we take advantage of this weather and drive
over to West Point, and lunch at Fort Putnam.""Why, Webb, what a burst of genius!"Let us go to-morrow for we can't count on such weather
long."The temptation was indeed strong, but she felt
it would not be wise to yield, and began, hesitatingly, "I fear my
engagements--" At this moment she caught a glimpse of Burt's face in a
mirror, and saw the look of disappointment which he could not disguise."If I return to the city soon," she resumed, "I ought to be at my
preparations.""Why, Gertrude," said Amy, "I almost feel as if you did not wish to go.I thought you were to remain in the country till
November.I have been planning so much that we could do together!""Surely, Miss Hargrove," added Burt, with a slight tremor in his voice,
"you cannot nip Webb's genius in the very bud.Such an expedition as he
proposes is an inspiration.""But you can do without me," she replied, smiling on him bewilderingly.It was a light arrow, but its aim was true.Never before had he so felt
the power of her beauty, the almost irresistible spell of her fascination.While her lips were smiling, there was an expression in her dark eyes that
made her words, so simple and natural in themselves, a searching question,
and he could not forbear saying, earnestly, "We should all enjoy the
excursion far more if you went with us.""Truly, Miss Hargrove," said Webb, "I shall be quenched if you decline,
and feel that I have none of the talent for which I was beginning to gain
a little credit.""I cannot resist such an appeal as that, Mr.Clifford," she said,
laughingly."I anticipate a marvellous day
to-morrow.Bring Fred also, and let us all vie with each other in
encouraging Webb.""Has that quiet Webb any scheme in his mind?"Miss Hargrove thought,
after they had gone."I wish that tomorrow might indeed be 'a marvellous
day' for us all."An affirmative
answer was slow in coming, though he thought long and late.CHAPTER LI

WEBB'S FATEFUL EXPEDITION


Mr.Hargrove had welcomed the invitation that took his daughter among
some of her former companions, hoping that a return to brilliant
fashionable life would prove to her that she could not give it up.It was
his wish that she should marry a wealthy man of the city.His wife did
not dream of any other future for her handsome child, and she looked
forward with no little complacency to the ordering of a new and elegant
establishment.At the dinner-table Gertrude had given a vivacious account of her
yachting experience, and all had appeared to promise well; but when she
went to the library to kiss her father good-night, he looked at her
inquiringly, and said, "You enjoyed every moment, I suppose?"She shook her head sadly, and, after a moment, said: "I fear I've grown
rather tired of that kind of thing.We made much effort to enjoy
ourselves.Is there not a happiness which comes without so much effort?""I'm sorry," he said, simply.Suppose I find more pleasure in staying with
you than in rushing around?""I think it would be less contrary to _my_ nature than forced gayety
among people I care nothing about."He smiled at her fondly, but admitted to himself that absence had
confirmed the impressions of the summer, instead of dissipating them, and
that if Burt became her suitor he would be accepted.When she looked out on the morning of the excursion to Fort Putnam it was
so radiant with light and beauty that hope sprang up within her heart.Disappointment that might last through life could not come on a day like
this.Silvery mists ascended from the river down among the Highlands.The
lawn and many of the fields were as green as they had been in June, and
on every side were trees like immense bouquets, so rich and varied was
their coloring.There was a dewy freshness in the air, a genial warmth in
the sunshine, a spring-like blue in the sky; and in these was no
suggestion that the November of her life was near."And yet it may be,"
she thought."I must soon face my fate, and I must be true to Amy."Hargrove regarded with discontent the prospect of another long
mountain expedition; but Fred, her idol, was wild for it, and in a day or
two he must return to school in the city, from which, at his earnest
plea, he had been absent too long already; so she smiled her farewell at
last upon the fateful excursion.He, with his sister, was soon at the Cliffords', and found the
rockaway--the strong old carryall with which Gertrude already had tender
associations--in readiness.Maggie had agreed to chaperon the party,
little Ned having been easily bribed to remain with his father.Miss Hargrove had looked wistfully at the Clifford mansion as she drew
near to it.Never had it appeared to her more home-like, with its
embowering trees and laden orchards.The bright hues of the foliage
suggested the hopes that centred there: the ocean, as she had seen
it--cold and gray under a clouded sky--was emblematic of life with no
fulfilment of those hopes.Clifford met her at the door, and
took her in to see the invalid, who greeted her almost as affectionately
as she would have welcomed Amy after absence, Miss Hargrove knew in the
depths of her heart how easily she could be at home there.Never did a pleasure-party start under brighter auspices.Clifford came out, on her husband's arm, to wave them a farewell.The young men had their alpenstocks, for it was their intention to walk
up the steep places.Webb was about to take Alf and Johnnie on the front
seat with him, when Amy exclaimed: "I'm going to drive, Mr.Johnnie
can sit between us, and keep me company when you are walking.You needn't
think that because you are the brilliant author of this expedition you
are going to have everything your own way."Indeed, not a little guile lurked behind her laughing eyes, which ever
kept Webb in perplexity--though he looked into them so often--as to
whether they were blue or gray.Miss Hargrove demurely took her seat with
Maggie, and Burt had the two boys with him.Fred had brought his gun, and
was vigilant for game now that the "law was up."They soon reached the foot of the mountain, and there was a general
unloading, for at first every one wished to walk.Maggie good-naturedly
climbed around to the front seat and took the reins, remarking that she
would soon have plenty of company again.Burt had not recognized Amy's tactics, nor did he at once second them,
even unconsciously.His long ruminations had led to the only possible
conclusion--the words he had spoken must be made good.Pride and honor
permitted no other course.Therefore he proposed to-day to be ubiquitous,
and as gallant to Maggie as to the younger ladies.When Miss Hargrove
returned to the city he would quietly prove his loyalty.Never before had
he appeared in such spirits; never so inexorably resolute.He recalled
Amy's incredulous laugh at his protestation of constancy, and felt that
he could never look her in the face if he faltered.It was known that
Miss Hargrove had received much attention, and her interest in him would
be likely to disappear at once should she learn of his declaration of
undying devotion to another but a few months before.He anathematized
himself, but determined that his weakness should remain unknown.It was
evident that Amy had been a little jealous, but probably that she did not
yet care enough for him to be very sensitive on the subject.He had pledged himself to wait until she did care.Miss Hargrove should be made
to believe that she had added much to the pleasure of the excursion, and
there he would stop.And Burt on his mettle was no bungler.The test
would come in his staying powers.Webb, however, was quietly serene.He had not watched and thought so long
in vain.He had seen Burt's expression the evening before, and knew that
a wakeful night had followed.His own feeling had taught him a
clairvoyance which enabled him to divine not a little of what was passing
in his brother's mind and that of Miss Hargrove.Her frank, sisterly affection was not love, and might never
become love.One of the objects of the expedition was to obtain an abundant supply of
autumn leaves and ferns for pressing."I intend to make the old house
look like a bower this winter," Amy remarked."That would be impossible with our city home," Miss Hargrove said, "and
mamma would not hear of such an attempt.But I can do as I please in my
own room, and shall gather my country _souvenirs_ to-day."The idea of decorating her apartment with feathery ferns and bright-hued
leaves took a strong hold upon her fancy, for she hoped that Burt would
aid her in making the collection.Nor was she disappointed, for Amy said:

"Burt, I have gathered and pressed nearly all the ferns I need already.You know the shady nooks where the most delicate ones grow, and you can
help Gertrude make as good a collection as mine.You'll help too, won't
you, Webb?"added the innocent little schemer, who saw that Burt was
looking at her rather keenly.So they wound up the mountain, making long stops here and there to gather
sylvan trophies and to note the fine views.Amy's manner was so cordial
and natural that Burt's suspicions had been allayed, and the young
fellow, who could do nothing by halves, was soon deeply absorbed in
making a superb collection for Miss Hargrove, and she felt that, whatever
happened, she was being enriched by everything he obtained for her.Amy
had brought a great many newspapers folded together so that leaves could
be placed between the pages, and Webb soon noted that his offerings were
kept separate from those of Burt.The latter tried to be impartial in his
labors in behalf of the two girls, bringing Amy bright-hued leaves
instead of ferns, but did not wholly succeed, and sometimes he found
himself alone with Miss Hargrove as they pursued their search a short
distance on some diverging and shaded path.On one of these occasions he
said, "I like to think how beautiful you will make your room this
winter.""I like to think of it too," she replied."I shall feel that I have a
part of my pleasant summer always present.""Yes, the pleasantest I ever enjoyed.""I should think you would find it exceedingly dull after such brilliant
experiences as that of your yachting excursion.""Do you find to-day exceedingly dull?""But I am used to the quiet country, and a day like this is the
exception.""I do not imagine you have ever lived a tame life.""Isn't that about the same as calling me wild?""There's no harm in beginning a little in that way."You are so favored that I can scarcely imagine life bringing sobering
experiences to you very soon."Have you forgotten what occurred on these very mountains, at no
great distance?I assure you I never forget it;" and her eyes were
eloquent as she turned them upon him."One does not forget the most fortunate event of one's life.Since you
were to meet that danger, I would not have missed being near for the
world.I had even a narrower escape, as you know, on this mountain.The
spot where Webb found me is scarcely more than a mile away."She looked at him very wistfully, and her face grew pale, but she only
said, "I don't think either of us can forget the Highlands.""I shall never forget that little path," he said, in a low tone, and he
looked back at it lingeringly as they came out into the road and
approached the rest of the party.That
spot should be marked for future supplies.Miss Hargrove will share with
you, for you can't have anything so fine as this.""Yes, indeed I have, and I shall call you and Webb to account if you do
not to-day make Gertrude fare as well."Both Miss Hargrove and Burt were bewildered.There was lurking mischief
in Amy's eyes when she first spoke, and yet she used her influence to
keep Burt in her friend's society.Her spirits seemed too exuberant to be
natural, and Miss Hargrove, who was an adept at hiding her feelings under
a mask of gayety, surmised that Amy's feminine instincts had taught her
to employ the same tactics.Conscious of their secret, Miss Hargrove and
Burt both thought, "Perhaps it is her purpose to throw us together as far
as possible, and learn the truth."Amy had a kinder purpose than they imagined.She wanted no more of Burt's
forced allegiance, and was much too good-natured to permit mere pique to
cause unhappiness to others."Let Gertrude win him if she cares for him,"
was her thought, "and if _she_ can't hold him his case is
_hopeless_."She could not resist the temptation, however, to tease
Burt a little.But he gave her slight chance for the next few hours.Her mirthful
question and the glance accompanying it had put him on his guard again,
and he at once became the gay cavalier-general he had resolved on being
throughout the day.They made a long pause to enjoy the view looking out upon Constitution
Island, West Point, the southern mountains, and the winding river, dotted
here and there with sails, and with steamers, seemingly held motionless
by their widely separated train of canal boats."What mountain is this that we are now to descend?""It's the first high mountain that abuts on
the river above West Point, you will remember."I have a song relating to it, and will give you a
verse;" and she sang:

  "'Where Hudson's waves o'er silvery sands
      Wind through the hills afar,
    And Cro' Nest like a monarch stands,
      Crowned with a single star.'"After a round of applause had subsided, Burt, whose eyes had been more
demonstrative than his hands, said, "That's by Morris.We can see from
Fort Putnam his old home under Mount Taurus."He is the poet who entreated the woodman to'spare that tree.'""Which the woodman will never do," Webb remarked, "unless compelled by
law; nor even then, I fear."cried Amy, "with what a thump you drop into prose!""I also advise an immediate descent of the mountain if we are to have any
time at Fort Putnam," he added.They were soon winding down the S's by which the road overcame the steep
declivity.On reaching a plateau, before the final descent, they came
across a wretched hovel, gray and storm-beaten, with scarcely strength to
stand.Rags took the place of broken glass in the windows.A pig was
rooting near the doorstep, on which stood a slatternly woman, regarding
the party with dull curiosity."Talk about the elevating influence of mountain scenery," said Miss
Hargrove; "there's a commentary on the theory.""The theory's correct," persisted Burt."Their height above tide-water
and the amount of bad whiskey they consume keep our mountaineers elevated
most of the time.""Does Lumley live in a place like that?""He did--in a worse one, if possible," Webb replied for Amy, who
hesitated."But you should see how it is changed.He now has a good
vegetable garden fenced in, a rustic porch covered with American ivy,
and--would you believe it?--an actual flower-bed.Within the hut there
are two pictures on the wall, and the baby creeps on a carpeted floor.Lumley says Amy is making a man of him.""You forget to mention how much you have helped me," Amy added."Come, let us break up this mutual admiration society," said Burt."I'm
ready for lunch already, and Fort Putnam is miles away."The road from the foot of the mountain descends gradually through wild,
beautiful scenery to West Point.Cro' Nest rises abruptly on the left,
and there is a wooded valley on the right, with mountains beyond.The
trees overhung the road with a canopy of gold, emerald, and crimson
foliage, and the sunlight came to the excursionists as through
stained-glass windows.Taking a side street at the back of the military
post, they soon reached a point over which frowned the ruins of the fort,
and here they left their horses.After a brief climb to the northward
they entered on an old road, grass-grown and leaf-carpeted, and soon
passed through the gaping sally-port, on either side of which cone-like
cedars stood as sentinels.Within the fort Nature had been busy for a
century softening and obliterating the work of man.Cedar trees--some of
which were dying from age--grew everywhere, even on the crumbling
ramparts.Except where ledges of the native rock cropped out, the ground
was covered with a thick sward.Near the centre of the inclosure is the
rocky basin.In it bubbles the spring at which the more temperate of the
ancient garrison may have softened the asperities of their New England
rum.The most extensive ruins are seen by turning sharply to the left from the
sally-port.Here, yawning like caverns, their entrances partially choked
by the debris, are six casemates, or vaults.They were built of brick,
covered with stone, and are eighteen feet deep and twelve wide, with an
arched roof twelve feet high.On the level rampart above them were long,
withered grass, the wild dwarf-rose, and waving golden-rod.The outer
walls, massy and crumbling, or half torn away by vandal hands, were built
in angles, according to the engineering science of the Revolution, except
on the west, where the high ramparts surmount a mural perpendicular
precipice fifty feet in height.Inland, across the valley, the mountains
were seen, rising like rounded billows in every direction, while from the
north, east, and south the windings of the Hudson were visible for
fifteen miles.All but Amy had visited the spot before, and Burt explored the place with
her while the rest prepared for lunch.She had asked Gertrude to
accompany them, but the latter had sought refuge with Maggie, and at her
side she proposed to remain.She scarcely dared trust herself with Burt,
and as the day advanced he certainly permitted his eyes to express an
interest that promised ill for his inexorable purpose of constancy.It had become clear to Miss Hargrove that he was restrained by something
that had occurred between him and Amy, and both her pride and her sense
of truth to her friend decided her to withdraw as far as possible from
his society, and to return to the city.She and Burt vied with each other in gayety at lunch.When it was over
they all grouped themselves in the shade of a clump of cedars, and looked
away upon the wide prospect, Webb pointing out objects of past and
present interest.Alf and Fred speedily grew restless and started off
with the gun, Johnnie's head sank into her mother's lap, Miss Hargrove
and Burt grew quiet and preoccupied, their eyes looking off into vacancy.Webb was saying, "By one who had imagination how much more could be seen
from this point than meets the eye!There, on the plain below us, would
rise the magnificent rustic colonnade two hundred and twenty feet long
and eighty feet wide, beneath which Washington gave the great banquet in
honor of the birth of the Dauphin of France, and on the evening of the
same day these hills blazed with musketry and rolled back the thunder of
cannon with which the festivities of the evening were begun.Think of the
'Father of his Country' being there in flesh and blood, just as we are
here!In the language of an old military journal, 'He carried down a
dance of twenty couple on the green grass, with a graceful and dignified
air, having Mrs.In almost a direct line across
the river you can see the Beverly Robinson house, from which Arnold
carried on his correspondence with Andre.You can look into the window of
the room to which, after hearing of the capture of Andre, he hastened
from the breakfast-table.To this upper room he immediately summoned his
wife, who had been the beautiful Margaret Shippen, you remember, and told
her of his awful peril, then rushed away, leaving the poor, terror-stricken
woman unconscious on the floor.Would you not like to look through the
glass at the house where the tragedy occurred, Miss Hargrove?"At the sound of her name the young girl started visibly, and Webb saw
that there were tears in her eyes; but she complied without a word, and
he so directed the glass that it covered the historic mansion.thought innocent Webb, taking her
quickly suppressed emotion as a tribute to his moving reminiscences."Oh, Webb, have done with your lugubrious ancient history!"cried Burt,
springing up."It's time we were getting ready for a homeward move," said Maggie."I'll
go and pack the things.""And I'll help you," added Miss Hargrove, hastily following her."Let me look at the house, too," said Amy, taking the glass; then added,
after a moment: "Poor Margaret Arnold!It was indeed a tragedy, as you
said, Webb--a sadder one than these old military preparations can
suggest.In all his career of war and treachery Arnold never inflicted a
more cruel wound.""How much feeling Miss Hargrove showed!""Yes," said Amy, quietly, "she was evidently feeling deeply."Her thought
was, "I don't believe she heard a word that Webb said."Then, seeing that
Burt was helping Maggie and Miss Hargrove, she added, "Please point out
to me some other interesting places."Webb, well pleased, talked on to a listener who did not give him her
whole attention.She could not forget Gertrude's paleness, and her
alternations from extreme gayety to a look of such deep sadness as to
awaken not a little sympathetic curiosity.Amy loved her friend truly,
and it did not seem strange to her that Miss Hargrove was deeply
interested in Burt, since they had been much thrown together, and since
she probably owed her life to him.Amy's resentment toward Burt had
passed away.She had found that her pride, merely, and not her heart, was
wounded by his new passion, and she already began to feel that she never
could have any such regard for him as her friend was possibly cherishing.Therefore it was, perhaps, not unnatural that her tranquil regard should
prove unsatisfying to Burt in contrast with the passion of which Miss
Hargrove was capable.She had seen his vain efforts to remain loyal, and
had smiled at them, proposing to let matters take their course, and to
give little aid in extricating him from his dilemma.But, if she had
interpreted her friend's face aright, she could no longer stand aloof, an
amused and slightly satirical spectator.If Burt deserved some
punishment, Gertrude did not, and she was inclined to guess the cause of
the latter's haste to return to the city.It may thus be seen that Amy was fast losing her unsophisticated
girlhood.While Burt's passionate words had awakened no corresponding
feeling, they had taught her that she was no longer a child, since she
could inspire such words.Her intimacy with Miss Hargrove, and the
latter's early confidences, had enlarged her ideas on some subjects.As
the bud of a flower passes slowly through long and apparently slow stages
of immaturity and at last suddenly opens to the light, so she had reached
that age when a little experience suggests a great deal, and the
influences around her tended to develop certain thoughts very rapidly.She saw that her friend had not been brought up in English seclusion.Admirers by the score had flocked around her, and, as she had often said,
she proposed to marry for love."I have the name of being cold," she once
told Amy, "but I know I can love as can few others, and I shall know it
well when I do love, too."The truth was daily growing clearer to Amy
that under our vivid American skies the grand passion is not a fiction of
romance or a quiet arrangement between the parties concerned.Miss Hargrove had not misjudged herself.Her tropical nature, when once
kindled, burned with no feeble, wavering flame.She had passed the point
of criticism of Burt.She loved him, and to her fond eyes he seemed more
worthy of her love than any man she had ever before known.But she had
not passed beyond her sense of truth and duty, and the feeling came to
her that she must go away at once and engage in that most pathetic of all
struggles that fall to woman's lot.As the conviction grew clear on this
bright October day, she felt that her heart was bleeding internally.Tears would come into her eyes at the dreary prospect.Her former
brilliant society life now looked as does an opera-house in the morning,
when the gilding and tinsel that flashed and sparkled the evening before
are seen to be dull and tarnished.Burt had appeared to especial
advantage in his mountain home.His
tall, fine figure and unconscious, easy manner were as full of grace as
deficient in conventionality, and she thought with disgust of many of her
former admirers, who were nothing if not stylish after the arbitrary mode
of the hour.At the same time he had proved that he could be at home in a
drawing-room on the simple ground of good-breeding, and not because he
had been run through fashion's latest mold.The grand scenery around her
suggested the manhood that kindled her imagination--a manhood strong,
fearless, and not degenerated from that sturdy age which had made these
scenes historic.By the time they were ready to start homeward the southern side of Cro'
Nest was in deep blue shadow.They bowled along rapidly till they came to
the steep ascent, and then the boys and the young men sprang out."Would
you like to walk, Gertrude?"Amy asked, for she was bent on throwing her
friend and Burt together during the witching twilight that was coming on
apace."I fear I am too tired, unless the load is heavy," she replied."Oh, no, indeed," said Webb."It does not take long to reach the top of
the mountain on this side, and then it's chiefly down hill the rest of
the way."Amy, who had been sitting with Webb and Johnnie as before, said to Miss
Hargrove, "Won't you step across the seats and keep me company?"She was so utterly unhappy that she
wished to be left to herself as far as possible.In her realization of a
loss that seemed immeasurable, she was a little resentful toward Amy,
feeling that she had been more frank and confidential than her friend.If
Amy had claims on Burt, why had she not spoken of them?why had she
permitted her for whom she professed such strong friendship to drift
almost wholly unwarned upon so sad a fate?and why was she now clearly
trying to bring together Burt and the one to whom even he felt that he
had no right to speak in more than a friendly manner?While she was
making such immense sacrifices to be true, she felt that Amy was
maintaining an unfair reticence, if not actually beguiling herself and
Burt into a display of weakness for which they would be condemned--or, at
least, he would be, and love identifies itself with its object.These
thoughts, having once been admitted, grew upon her mind rapidly, for it
is hard to suffer through another and maintain a gentle charity.Therefore she was silent when she took her seat by Amy, and when the
latter gave her a look that was like a caress, she did not return it."You are tired, Gertrude," Amy began gently.You
must stay with me to-night, and I'll watch over you like Sairy Gamp."So far from responding to Amy's playful and friendly words, Miss Hargrove
said, hastily,

"Oh, no, I had better go right on home.I don't feel very well, and shall
be better at home; and I must begin to get ready to-morrow for my return
to the city."Amy would not be repulsed, but, putting her arm around her friend, she
looked into her eyes, and asked:

"Why are you so eager to return to New York?Are you tiring of your
country friends?You certainly told me that you expected to stay till
November.""Fred must go back to school to-morrow," said Gertrude, in a constrained
voice, "and I do not think it is well to leave him alone in the city
house.""You are withdrawing your confidence from me," said Amy, sadly.If you had, I should not be the unhappy girl I am-to-night.Well,
since you wish to know the whole truth you shall.You said you could
trust me implicitly, and I promised to deserve your trust.If you had
said to me that Burt was bound to you when I told you that I was
heart-whole and fancy-free, I should have been on my guard.Is it natural
that I should be indifferent to the man who risked his life to save mine?Why have you left me so long in his society without a hint of warning?I shall not try to snatch happiness from
another."Johnnie's tuneful little voice was piping a song, and the rumble of the
wheels over a stony road prevented Maggie, on the last seat, from hearing
anything."Now you _shall_ stay with me
to-night," she said.See, Burt has
turned, and is coming toward us.I pledge you my word he can never be to
me more than a brother.I do not love him except as a brother, and never
have, and you can snatch no happiness from me, except by treating me with
distrust and going away.""Oh, Amy," began Miss Hargrove, in tones and with a look that gave
evidence of the chaotic bewilderment of her mind.We are not very lonely, thank you, Mr.You look, as far as I
can see you through the dusk, as if you were commiserating us as poor
forlorn creatures, but we have some resources within ourselves."We are the forlorn creatures who have
no resources.I assure you we are very simple,
honest people.""In that case I shall have no fears, but clamber in at once.I feel as if
I had been on a twenty-mile tramp.""What an implied compliment to our exhilarating society!""Indeed there is--a very strong one.I've been so immensely exhilarated
that, in the re-action, I'm almost faint.""Maggie," cried Amy, "do take care of Burt; he's going to faint.""He must wait till we come to the next brook, and then we'll put him in
it.""Webb," said Amy, looking over her shoulder at the young man, who was now
following the carriage, "is there anything the matter with you, also?""Oh, your trouble, whatever it may be, is chronic.Well, well, to think
that we poor women may be the only survivors of this tremendous
expedition.""That would be most natural--the survival of the fittest, you know."Science is uppermost in your mind, as
ever.You ought to live a thousand years, Webb, to see the end of all
your theories.""I fear it wouldn't be the millennium for me, and that I should have more
perplexing theories at its end than now.""That's the way with men--they are never satisfied," remarked Miss
Hargrove.Clifford, this is your expedition, and it's getting so
dark that I shall feel safer if you are driving.""Oh, Gertrude, you have no confidence in me whatever.As if I would break
your neck--or heart either!""You are a very mysterious little woman," was the reply, given in like
manner, "and need hours of explanation."Clifford,
I've much more confidence in you than in Amy.Her talk is so giddy that I
want a sober hand on the reins.""I want one to drive who can see his way, not feel it," was the laughing
response.Amy, too, was laughing silently, as she reined in the horses."What are you
two girls giggling about?""The
idea of two such refined creatures giggling!""Well," exclaimed Webb, "what am I to do?I can't stand up between you
and drive.""Gertrude, you must clamber around and sustain Burt's drooping spirits.""Indeed, Amy, you must know best how to do that," was the reply."As
guest, I claim a little of the society of the commander-in-chief."I'll solve the vexed question," said Burt, much nettled, and leaping
out."Now, Burt, the question isn't vexed, and don't you be," cried Amy,
springing lightly over to the next seat."There are Fred and Alf, too,
with the gun.Let us all get home as soon as possible, for it's nearly
time for supper already.Come, I shall feel much hurt if you don't keep
me company."Burt at once realized the absurdity of showing pique, although he felt
that there was something in the air which he did not understand.He came
back laughing, with much apparent good-nature, and saying, "I thought I'd
soon bring one or the other of you to terms."said Amy, with difficulty restraining a
new burst of merriment.They soon reached the summit, and paused to give the horses a breathing.The young moon hung in the west, and its silver crescent symbolized to
Miss Hargrove the hope that was growing in her heart."Amy," she said,
"don't you remember the song we arranged from 'The Culprit Fay'?We
certainly should sing it here on this mountain.Amy sang, in clear soprano:

  "'The moon looks down on old Cro' Nest,
  She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,
  And seems his huge gray form to throw
  In a silver cone on the wave below.'""Imagine the cone and wave, please," said Miss Hargrove; and then, in an
alto rich with her heart's deep feeling, she sang with Amy:

  "'Ouphe and goblin!Ye that love the moon's soft light,
    Hither--hither wend your way;
    Twine ye in a jocund ring;
    Sing and trip it merrily,
    Hand to hand and wing to wing,
    Round the wild witch-hazel tree.'""If I were a goblin, I'd come, for music like that," cried Burt, as they
started rapidly homeward."You are much too big to suggest a culprit fay," said Amy."But the description of the fay's charmer is your portrait," he replied,
in a low tone:

  "'But well I know her sinless mind
    Is pure as the angel forms above,
    Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,
    Such as a spirit well might love.'""Oh, no; you are mistaken, I'm not meek in the least.Think of the
punishment:

  "'Tied to the hornet's shardy wings,
    Toss'd on the pricks of nettles' stings;'

you know the rest.""What witchery has got into you to-night, Amy?""That last song was so good that I, for one, would be glad of more," cried
Webb."You men must help us, then," said Miss Hargrove, and in a moment the wild,
dim forest was full of melody, the rocks and highlands sending back soft
and unheeded echoes.Burt, meantime, was occupied with disagreeable reflections.Perhaps both
the girls at last understood him, and had been comparing notes, to his
infinite disadvantage.His fickleness and the dilemma he was in may have
become a jest between them.Resentment, except against
himself, was impossible.If Amy understood him, in what other way could
she meet any approach to sentiment on his part than by a laughing scorn?If Miss Hargrove had divined the past, or had received a hint concerning
it, why should she not shun his society?He was half-desperate, and yet
felt that any show of embarrassment or anger would only make him appear
more ridiculous.The longer he thought the more sure he was that the
girls were beginning to guess his position, and that his only course was
a polite indifference to both.But this policy promised to lead through a
thorny path, and to what?In impotent rage at himself he ground his teeth
during the pauses between the stanzas that he was compelled to sing.Such
was the discord in his heart that he felt like uttering notes that would
make "night hideous."He was still more distraught when, on their return, they found Mr.Hargrove's carriage in waiting, and Amy, after a brief conference with
her friend in her room, came down prepared to accompany Miss Hargrove
home after supper.In spite of all his efforts at ease and gayety, his
embarrassment and trouble were evident.He had observed Miss Hargrove's
pallor and her effort to keep up at Fort Putnam, and could not banish the
hope that she sympathized with him; but now the young girl was demurely
radiant.Her color had come again, and the lustre of her beautiful eyes
was dazzling.Yet they avoided his, and she had far more to say to Webb
and the others than to him.Webb, too, was perplexed, for during the day
Amy had been as bewildering to him as to Burt.But he was in no
uncertainty as to his course, which was simply to wait.He, with Burt,
saw the girls to the carriage, and the latter said good-night rather
coldly and stiffly.Alf and Fred parted regretfully, with the promise of
a correspondence which would be as remarkable for its orthography as for
its natural history.CHAPTER LII

BURT'S SORE DILEMMA


Mr.Hargrove greeted Amy cordially, but his questioning eyes rested
oftenest on his daughter.Her expression and manner caused him to pace
his study long and late that night.Hargrove was very polite and a
little stately.She felt that she existed on a plane above Amy.The young girls soon pleaded fatigue, and retired.Once in the seclusion
of their room they forgot all about their innocent fib, and there was not
a trace of weariness in their manner.While Burt was staring at his
dismal, tangled fortune, seeing no solution of his difficulties, a
fateful conference relating to him was taking place.Amy did not look
like a scorner, as with a sister's love and a woman's tact she pleaded
his cause and palliated his course to one incapable of harsh judgment.But she felt that she must be honest with her friend, and that the whole
truth would be best and safest.Her conclusion was: "No man who loved
_you_, and whom you encouraged, would ever change.I know now that I
never had a particle of such feeling as you have for Burt, and can see
that I naturally chilled and quenched his regard for me."Miss Hargrove's dark eyes flashed ominously as she spoke of Burt or of
any man proving faithless after she had given encouragement."But it wasn't possible for me to give him any real encouragement," Amy
persisted."I've never felt as you do, and am not sure that I want to for
a long time."Miss Hargrove almost said, but she suppressed the
words, feeling that since he had not revealed his secret she had no right
to do so.Indeed, as she recalled how sedulously he had guarded it she
was sure he would not thank her for suggesting it to Amy before she was
ready for the knowledge.Impetuous as Miss Hargrove was at times, she had
too fine a nature to be careless of the rights and feelings of others.Moreover, she felt that Webb had been her ally, whether consciously or
not, and he should have his chance with all the help she could give him,
but she was wise enough to know that obtrusion and premature aid are
often disastrous.The decision, after this portentous conference, was: "Mr.Bart must seek
me, and seek very zealously.I know you well enough Amy, to be sure that
you will give him no hints.It's bad enough to love a man before I've
been asked to do so.What an utterly perverse and unmanageable thing
one's heart is!I shall do no angling, however, nor shall I permit any.""You may stand up straight, Gertrude," said Amy, laughing, "but don't
lean over backward."Burt entertained half a dozen wild and half-tragic projects before he
fell asleep late that night, but finally, in utter self-disgust, settled
down on the prosaic and not irrational one of helping through with the
fall work on the farm, and then of seeking some business or profession to
which he could give his whole mind."As to ladies' society," he
concluded, savagely, "I'll shun it hereafter till I'm grown up."Burt always attained a certain kind of peace and the power to sleep after
he had reached an irrevocable decision.During the night the wind veered to the east, and a cold, dismal
rain-storm set in.Dull and dreary indeed the day proved to Burt.He
could not go out and put his resolution into force.He fumed about the
house, restless, yet reticent.He would rather have fought dragons than
keep company with his own thoughts in inaction.All the family supposed
he missed Amy, except Webb, who hoped he missed some one else."Why don't you go over and bring Amy home, Burt?"his mother asked, at
the dinner-table."The house seems empty without her, and everybody is
moping.Even father has fretted over his newspaper, and wished Amy was
here.""Why can't they print an edition of the paper for old men and dark days?""Well," remarked Leonard, leaning back in his chair, and looking
humorously at Maggie, "I'm sorry for you young fellows, but I'm finding
the day serene.""Of course you are," snapped Burt."With an armchair to doze in and a
dinner to look forward to, what more do you wish?As for Webb, he can
always get astride of some scientific hobby, no matter how bad the
weather is.""As for Burt, he can bring Amy home, and then every one will be
satisfied," added his mother, smiling.Thus a new phase of his trial presented itself to poor Burt.He must
either face those two girls after their night's conclave, with all its
possible revelations, or else awaken at once very embarrassing surmises.And in a mood of mingled
recklessness and fear he drove through the storm.When his name was
announced the girls smiled significantly, but went down looking as
unconscious as if they had not spoken of him in six months, and Burt
could not have been more suave, non-committal, and impartially polite if
these ladies had been as remote from his thoughts as one of Webb's
theories.At the same time he intimated that he would be ready to return
when Amy was.At parting the friends gave each other a little look of dismay, and he
caught it from the same telltale mirror that persisted in taking a part
in this drama.though the young fellow, "so they have been exchanging confidences,
and my manner is disconcerting--not what was expected.If I have become a
jest between them it shall be a short-lived one.Miss Hargrove, with all
her city experience, shall find that I'm not so young and verdant but that
I can take a hand in this game also.As for Amy, I now know she never cared
for me, and I don't believe she ever would;" and so he went away with
laughing repartee, and did not see the look of deep disappointment with
which he was followed.Her innocent schemes might not be so
easily accomplished if Burt would be wrong-headed.She was aware of the
dash of recklessness in his character, and feared that under the impulse
of pride he might spoil everything, or, at least, cause much needless
delay.With the fatality of blundering which usually attends upon such
occasions, he did threaten to fulfil her fears, and so successfully that
Amy was in anxiety, and Miss Hargrove grew as pale as she was resolute
not to make the least advance, while poor Webb felt that his suspense
never would end.Burt treated Amy in an easy, fraternal manner.He
engaged actively in the task of gathering and preparing for market the
large crop of apples, and he openly broached the subject of going into a
business of some kind away from home, where, he declared, with a special
meaning for Amy, he was not needed, adding: "It's time I was earning my
salt and settling down to something for life.Webb and Len can take care
of all the land, and I don't believe I was cut out for a farmer."He not only troubled Amy exceedingly, but he perplexed all the family,
for it seemed that he was decidedly taking a new departure.One evening,
a day or two after he had introduced the project of going elsewhere, his
father, to Amy's dismay, suggested that he should go to the far West and
look after a large tract of land which the old gentleman had bought some
years before.It was said that a railroad was to be built through it,
and, if so, the value of the property would be greatly enhanced, and
steps should be taken to get part of it into the market.Burt took hold
of the scheme with eagerness, and was for going as soon as possible.Looking to note the effect of his words upon Amy, he saw that her
expression was not only reproachful, but almost severe.Leonard heartily
approved of the plan.Webb was silent, and in deep despondency, feeling
that if Bart went now nothing would be settled.He saw Amy's aversion to
the project also, and misinterpreted it.She was compelled to admit that the prospects were growing very dark.Burt might soon depart for an indefinite absence, and Miss Hargrove
return to the city.Amy, who had looked upon the mutations in her own
prospects so quietly, was almost feverishly eager to aid her friend.She
feared she had blundered on the mountain ride.Burt's pride had been
wounded, and he had received the impression that his April-like moods had
been discussed satirically.It was certain that he had been very deeply
interested in Gertrude, and that he was throwing away not only his
happiness, but also hers; and Amy felt herself in some degree to blame.Therefore she was bent upon ending the senseless misunderstanding, but
found insurmountable embarrassments on every side.Miss Hargrove was
prouder than Burt.Wild horses could not draw her to the Cliffords', With
a pale, resolute face, she declined even to put herself in the way of
receiving the least advance.Amy would gladly have taken counsel of Webb,
but could not do so without revealing her friend's secret, and also
disclosing mere surmises about Burt, which, although amounting to
conviction in her mind, could not be mentioned.Therefore, from the very
delicacy of the situation, she felt herself helpless.Nature was her
ally, however, and if all that was passing in Burt's mind had been
manifest, the ardent little schemer would not have been so despondent.The best hope of Burt had been that he had checkmated the girls in their
disposition to make jesting comparisons, He would retire with so much
nonchalance as to leave nothing to be said.They would find complete
inaction and silence hard to combat.But the more he thought of it the
less it seemed like an honorable retreat.He had openly wooed one girl,
he had since lost his heart to another, and she had given him a glimpse
of strong regard, if not more.His thoughts were busy with her every word
and glance.How much had his tones and eyes revealed to her?Might she
not think him a heartless flirt if he continued to avoid her and went
away without a word?Would it not be better to be laughed at as one who
did not know his own mind than be despised for deliberate trifling?Amy
had asked him to go and spend an evening with her friend, and he had
pleaded weariness as an excuse.Her incredulous look and rather cool
manner since had not been reassuring.She had that very morning broached
the subject of a chestnutting party for the following day, and he had
promptly said that he was going to the city to make inquiries about
routes to the West."Why, Burt, you can put off your trip to town for a day," said his
mother."If you are to leave us so soon you should make the most of the
days that are left.""That is just what he is doing," Amy remarked, satirically."He has
become absorbed in large business considerations.Those of us who have
not such resources are of no consequence."The old people and Leonard believed that Amy was not pleased with the
idea of Burt's going away, but they felt that she was a little
unreasonable, since the young fellow was rather to be commended for
wishing to take life more seriously.But her words rankled in Burt's
mind.He felt that she understood him better than the others, and that he
was not winning respect from her.In the afternoon he saw her, with Alf
and Johnnie, starting for the chestnut-trees, and although she passed not
far away she gave him only a slight greeting, and did not stop for a
little merry banter, as usual.The young fellow was becoming very
unhappy, and he felt that his position was growing intolerable.That Amy
should be cold toward him, or, indeed, toward any one, was an unheard-of
thing, and he knew that she must feel that there was good reason for her
manner."What are she and
Miss Hargrove thinking about me?"The more he thought upon the past the more awkward and serious appeared
his dilemma, and his long Western journey, which at first he had welcomed
as promising a diversion of excitement and change, now began to appear
like exile.He dreaded to think of the memories he must take with him;
still more he deprecated the thoughts he would leave behind him.His
plight made him so desperate that he suddenly left the orchard where he
was gathering apples, went to the house, put on his riding-suit, and in a
few moments was galloping furiously away on his black horse.With a
renewal of hope Webb watched his proceedings, and with many surmises,
Amy, from a distant hillside, saw him passing at a break-neck pace.CHAPTER LIII

BURT'S RESOLVE


For the first two or three miles Burt rode as if he were trying to leave
care behind him, scarcely heeding what direction he took.When at last he
reined his reeking horse he found himself near the entrance of the lane
over which willows met in a Gothic arch.He yielded to the impulse to visit
the spot which had seen the beginning of so fateful an acquaintance, and
had not gone far when a turn in the road revealed a group whose presence
almost made his heart stand still for a moment.Miss Hargrove had stopped
her horse on the very spot where he had aided her in her awkward
predicament.Her back was toward him, and her great dog was at her side,
looking up into her face, as if in mute sympathy with his fair mistress.She could not be there with bowed head if
she despised him.Her presence seemed in harmony with that glance by
which, when weak and unnerved after escaping from deadly peril, she had
revealed possibly more than gratitude to the one who had rescued her.His
love rose like an irresistible tide, and he resolved that before he left
his home Amy and Miss Hargrove should know the whole truth, whatever
might be the result.Meanwhile he was rapidly approaching the young girl,
and the dog's short bark of recognition was her first intimation of
Hurt's presence.Her impulse was to fly, but in a second she saw the
absurdity of this course, and yet she was greatly embarrassed, and would
rather have been discovered by him at almost any other point of the
globe.She was going to the city on the morrow, and as she had drawn rein
on this spot and realized the bitterness of her disappointment, tears
would come.She wiped them hastily away, but dreaded lest their traces
should be seen.Turning her horse, she met Burt with a smile that her moist eyes belied,
and said: "I'm glad you do not find me in such an awkward plight as when
we first met here.and away like the wind she started homeward.Burt easily kept at her side, but conversation was impossible.At last he
said: "My horse is very tired, Miss Hargrove.At this pace you will soon
be home, and I shall feel that you are seeking to escape from me.Have I
fallen so very low in your estimation?""Why," she exclaimed, in well-feigned surprise, as she checked her horse,
"what have you done that you should fall in my estimation?""I shall tell you before very long," he said, with an expression that
seemed almost tragic.Surely
this brief gallop cannot have so tried your superb beast."Oh, no," he replied, with a grim laugh.I had been riding rapidly before I met you.My horse has been
idle for some days, and I had to run the spirit out of him.Amy wishes to
have a chestnutting party to-morrow.Clifford, but I return to the city tomorrow afternoon,
and was coming over in the morning to say good-by to Amy and your father
and mother.""I am very sorry too," he said, in tones that gave emphasis to his words.She turned upon him a swift, questioning glance, but her eyes instantly
fell before his intense gaze."Oh, well," she said, lightly, "we've had a very pleasant summer, and all
things must come to an end, you know."Then she went on speaking, in a
matter-of-fact way, of the need of looking after Fred, who was alone in
town, and of getting the city house in order, and of her plans for the
winter, adding: "As there is a great deal of fruit on the place, papa
does not feel that he can leave just yet.You know he goes back and forth
often, and so his business does not suffer.But I can just as well go
down now, and nearly all my friends have returned to town.""All your friends, Miss Hargrove?""Amy has promised to visit me soon," she said, hastily."It would seem that I am not down on your list of friends," he began,
gloomily.Clifford, I'm sure papa and I would be glad to have you call
whenever you are in town.""I fear I shall have to disappoint Mr.Hargrove," he said, a little
satirically."I'm going West the last of this month, and may be absent
much of the winter.I expect to look about in that section for some
opening in business.""Indeed," she replied, in tones which were meant to convey but little
interest, yet which had a slight tremor in spite of her efforts."It will
be a very great change for you.""Perhaps you think that constitutes its chief charm."Clifford," she said, "what chance have I had to think about it at
all?(Amy had, however, and
Gertrude had not only thought about it, but dreamed of it, as if she had
been informed that on a certain date the world would end.)"Is it not a
rather sudden plan?"My father has a large tract of land in the West, and it's
time it was looked after.Isn't it natural that I should think of doing
something in life?I fear there is an impression in your mind that I
entertain few thoughts beyond having a good time.""To have a good time in life," she said, smiling at him, "is a very
serious matter, worthy of any one's attention.It would seem that few
accomplish it.""And I greatly fear that I shall share in the ill-success of the
majority."You will soon be
enjoying the excitement of travel and enterprise in the West.""And you the excitement of society and conquest in the city.Conquests,
however, must be almost wearisome to you, Miss Hargrove, you make them so
easily."I certainly should soon weary of conquests were I
making them.Where in
history do we read of a man who was satiated with conquest?"Are you going to the city to-morrow?""Will you forgive me if I come alone?"I suppose Amy will be tired from nutting."He did not reply, but lifted his hat gravely, mounted his horse, and
galloped away as if he were an aid bearing a message that might avert a
battle.Miss Hargrove hastened to her room, and took off her hat with trembling
hands.Burt's pale, resolute face told her that the crisis in her life
had come.If he meant to speak,
why had he not done so?why had he not asked permission to consult her
father?Hargrove, from his library window, saw Burt's formal parting, and
concluded that his fears or hopes--he scarcely knew which were uppermost,
so deep was his love for his daughter, and so painful would it be to see
her unhappy--were not to be fulfilled.By a great effort Gertrude
appeared not very _distraite_ at dinner, nor did she mention Burt,
except in a casual manner, in reply to a question from her mother, but
her father thought he detected a strong and suppressed excitement.She excused herself early from the table, and said she must finish
packing for her departure.CHAPTER LIV

A GENTLE EXORCIST


Burt's black horse was again white before he approached his home.In the
distance he saw Amy returning, the children running on before, Alf
whooping like a small Indian to some playmate who was answering further
away.The gorgeous sunset lighted up the still more brilliant foliage,
and made the scene a fairyland.But Burt had then no more eye for nature
than a man would have who had staked his all on the next throw of the
dice.Amy was alone, and now was his chance to intercept her before she
reached the house.Imagine her surprise as she saw him make his horse
leap the intervening fences, and come galloping toward her."Burt," she cried, as he, in a moment or two, reined up near her, "you
will break your neck!""It wouldn't matter much," he said, grimly."I fear a worse fate than
that."He threw the bridle over a stake in the fence, and the horse was glad to
rest, with drooping head.Then he came and stood beside her, his face
flushed, and his mouth twitching with excitement and strong feeling."Burt," she said, "what is the matter?"I fear your scorn, Amy," he began, impetuously; "I fear I shall lose
your respect forever.But I can't go on any longer detesting myself and
feeling that you and Miss Hargrove despise me.I may seem to you and her
a fickle fool, a man of straw, but you shall both know the truth.I
shan't go away a coward.I can at least be honest, and then you may think
what you please of my weakness and vacillation.You cannot think worse
things than I think myself, but you must not imagine that I am a
cold-blooded, deliberate trifler, for that has never been true.I know
you don't care for me, and never did.""Indeed, Burt, you are mistaken.I do care for you immensely," said Amy,
eagerly clasping his arm with both her hands."Amy, Amy," said Burt, in a low, desperate tone, "think how few short
months have passed since I told you I loved you, and protested I would
wait till I was gray.You have seen me giving my thoughts to another, and
in your mind you expect to see me carried away by a half-dozen more.You
are mistaken, but it will take a long time to prove it.""No, Burt, I understand you better than you think.Gertrude has inspired
in you a very different feeling from the one you had for me.I think you
are loving now with a man's love, and won't get over it very soon, if you
ever do.You have seen, you must have felt, that my love for you was only
that of a sister, and of course you soon began to feel toward me in the
same way.I don't believe I would have married you had you waited an age.Don't fret, I'm not going to break my heart about you.""I should think not, nor will any one else.Oh, Amy, I so despised myself
that I have been half-desperate.""Despised yourself because you love a girl like Gertrude Hargrove!I
never knew a man to do a more natural and sensible thing, whether she
gave you encouragement or not.If I were a man I would make love to her,
rest assured, and she would have to refuse me more than once to be rid of
me."Burt took a long breath of immense relief."You are heavenly kind," he
said."Are you sure you won't despise me?It seems
to me that I have done such an awfully mean thing in making love to you
in my own home, and then in changing.""Fate has been too strong for you, and I
think--I mean--I hope, it has been kind.Bless you, Burt, I could never
get up any such feeling as sways you.I should always be disappointing,
and you would have found out, sooner or later, that your best chance
would be to discover some one more responsive.Since you have been so
frank, I'll be so too.I was scarcely more ready for your words last
spring than Johnnie, but I was simple enough to think that in half a
dozen years or so we might be married if all thought it was best, and my
pride was a little hurt when I saw what--what--well, Gertrude's influence
over you.But I've grown much older the last few months, and know now
that my thoughts were those of a child.My feeling for you is simply that
of a sister, and I don't believe it would ever have changed.I
might eventually have an acute attack also, and then I should be in a
worse predicament than yours.""But you will be my loving sister as long as you live, Amy?You will
believe that I have a little manhood if given a chance to show it?""I believe it now, Burt, and I can make you a hundredfold better sister
than wife.It seems but the other day I was playing with dolls.You have judged yourself too harshly;" and she
looked at him so smilingly and affectionately that he took her in his
arms and kissed her again and again, exclaiming, "You can count on one
brother to the last drop of his blood.Oh, Amy, whatever happens now, I
won't lose courage.Miss Hargrove will have to say no a dozen times
before she is through with me."At this moment Webb, from the top of a tall ladder in the orchard,
happened to glance that way, and saw the embrace.He instantly descended,
threw down his basket of apples, and with it all hope.The coolness between them had been but a misunderstanding, which
apparently had been banished most decidedly.He mechanically took down
his ladder and placed it on the ground, then went to his room to prepare
for supper."Burt," cried Amy, when they were half-way home, "you have forgotten your
horse.""If he were Pegasus, I should have forgotten him to-day."Oh, yes, I'll do anything for you.""Will you tell me if you think Miss
Hargrove--"

"No, I won't tell you anything.After she has refused you half
a dozen times, I may, out of pity, intercede a little.Go get your horse,
smooth your brow, and be sensible, or you'll have Webb and Leonard poking
fun at you.Suppose they have seen you galloping over fences and ditches
like one possessed.""Well, I was possessed, and never was there such a kind, gentle exorcist.I have seen Miss Hargrove to-day; I had just parted from her."How could I, until I had told you?I felt I was bound to you by
all that can bind a man.""Oh, Burt, suppose I had not released you, but played Shylock, what would
you have done?"and her laugh rang out again in intense merriment."I had no fears of that," he replied, ruefully."You are the last one to
practice Mrs.My fear was that you and Miss
Hargrove both would send me West as a precious good riddance.""Well, it was square of you, as Alf says, to come to me first, and I
appreciate it, but I should not have resented the omission.Will you
forgive my curiosity if I ask what is the next move in the campaign?I've
been reading about the war, you know, and I am quite military in my
ideas.""I have Miss Hargrove's permission to call to-night.It wasn't given very
cordially, and she asked me to bring you.""Oh, I told her she would have to forgive me if I came alone.I meant to
have it out to-day, if old Chaos came again."When Amy's renewed laughter
so subsided that he could speak, he resumed: "I'm going over there after
supper, to ask her father for permission to pay my addresses, and if he
won't give it, I shall tell him I will pay them all the same--that I
shall use every effort in my power to win his daughter.I don't want a
dollar of his money, but I'm bound to have the girl if she'll ever listen
to me after knowing all you know."Amy's laugh ceased, and she again clasped her hands on his arm."Dear
Burt," she said, "your course now seems to me manly and straightforward.I saw the strait you were in, but did not think you felt it so keenly.In
going West I feared you were about to run away from it.However Gertrude
may treat you, you have won my respect by your downright truth.She may
do as she pleases, but she can't despise you now.He has learned this afternoon that you are in no state of
mind to take care of him."CHAPTER LV

BURT TELLS HIS LOVE AGAIN


Webb appeared at the supper-table the personification of quiet geniality,
but Amy thought she had never seen him look so hollow-eyed.The long
strain was beginning to tell on him, decidedly, and to-night he felt as
if he had received a mortal blow.But with indomitable courage he hid his
wound, and seemed absorbed in a conversation with Leonard and his father
about the different varieties of apples, and their relative value.Amy
saw that his mother was looking at him anxiously, and she did not wonder.He was growing thin even to gauntness.Burt also was an arrant dissembler, and on rising from the table remarked
casually that he was going over to bid Miss Hargrove good-by, as she
would return to town on the morrow."She'll surely come and see us before she goes," Mrs."It seems to me she hasn't been very sociable of late."She told me she
was coming to say good-by to us all, and she has asked me to visit her.Come, Webb, you look all tired out to-night.I'll
stumble through the dryest scientific treatise you have if I can see you
resting on the sofa.""That's ever so kind of you, Amy, and I appreciate it more than you
imagine, but I'm going out this evening.""Oh, of course, sisters are of no account.What girl are _you_ going
to see?"I am too old and dull to entertain the pretty
creatures."You know one you could entertain if she isn't a pretty
creature, but then she's only a sister who doesn't know much.""I'm sorry--I must go," he said, a little abruptly, for her lovely,
half-laughing, half-reproachful face, turned to his, contained such
mocking promise of happiness that he could not look upon it.His rapid steps as he walked mile after mile indicated
that the matter was pressing indeed; but, although it was late before he
returned, he had spoken to no one.The house was dark and silent except
that a light was burning in Burt's room.And his momentous fortunes the
reader must now follow.Miss Hargrove, with a fluttering heart, heard the rapid feet of his horse
as he rode up the avenue.Truly, he was coming at a lover's pace.The
door-bell rang, she heard him admitted, and expected the maid's tap at
her door to follow.Were the tumultuous throbs of
her heart so loud that she could not hear it?She opened her door slightly; there was no
sound.There below, like a shadow, stood a
saddled horse.Had the stupid girl shown him into
the drawing-room and left him there?Surely the well-trained servant had
never been guilty of such a blunder before.Could it have been some one
else who had come to see her father on business?She stole down the
stairway in a tremor of apprehension, and strolled into the parlor in the
most nonchalant manner imaginable.It was lighted, but empty, and her
expression suddenly became one of troubled perplexity.She returned to
the hall, and started as if she had seen an apparition.There on the rack
hung Burt's hat, as natural as life.Voices reached her ear from her
father's study.She took a few swift steps toward it, then fled to her
room, and stood panting before her mirror, which reflected a young lady
in a costume charmingly ill adapted to "packing.""It was honorable in
him to speak to papa first, and papa would not, could not, answer him
without consulting me.I cannot be treated as a child any longer," she
muttered, with flashing eyes."Papa loves me," she murmured, in swift
alternation of gentle feeling."He could not make my happiness secondary
to a paltry sum of money."Hargrove had greeted him with
no little surprise.The parting of the young people had not promised any
such interview."Have you spoken to my daughter on this subject?"Hargrove asked,
gravely, after the young fellow had rather incoherently made known his
errand."No, sir," replied Burt, "I have not secured your permission.At the same
time," he added, with an ominous flash in his blue eyes, "sincerity
compels me to say that I could not take a final refusal from any lips
except those of your daughter, and not readily from hers.I would not
give up effort to win her until convinced that any amount of patient
endeavor was useless.I should not persecute her, but I would ask her to
reconsider an adverse answer as often as she would permit, and I will try
with all my soul to render myself more worthy of her."Hargrove, severely, "if I should decline this
honor, I should count for nothing.""No, sir, I do not mean that, and I hope I haven't said it, even by
implication.Your consent that I should have a fair field in which to do
my best would receive from me boundless gratitude.What I mean to say is,
that I could not give her up; I should not think it right to do so.This
question is vital to me, and I know of no reason," he added, a little
haughtily, "why I should be refused a privilege which is considered the
right of every gentleman.""I have not in the slightest degree raised the question of your being a
gentleman, Mr.Your course in coming to me before revealing
your regard to my daughter proves that you are one.But you should
realize that you are asking a great deal of me.My child's happiness is
my first and only consideration.You know the condition of life to which
my daughter has been accustomed.It is right and natural that I should
also know something of your prospects, your ability to meet the
obligations into which you wish to enter."After a moment he answered,
with a dignity and an evident sincerity which won golden opinions from
Mr.Hargrove: "I shall not try to mislead you in the least on this point.For my own sake I wish that your daughter were far poorer than I am.I
can say little more than that I could give her a home now and every
comfort of life.I could not now provide for her the luxury to which she
has been accustomed.But I am willing to wait and eager to work.In youth
and health and a fair degree of education I have some capital in addition
to the start in life which my father has promised to his sons.What could
not Miss Hargrove inspire a man to do?"The man of experience smiled in spite of himself at Burt's frank
enthusiasm and naivete.The whole affair was so different from anything
that he had ever looked forward to!Instead of a few formalities between
himself and a wealthy suitor whom his wife, and therefore all the world,
would approve of, here he was listening to a farmer's son, with the
consciousness that he must yield, and not wholly unwilling to do so.Moreover, this preposterous young man, so far from showing any awe of
him, had almost defied him from the start, and had plainly stated that
the father's wealth was the only objection to the daughter.Having seen
the drift of events, Mr.Hargrove had long since informed himself
thoroughly about the Clifford family, and had been made to feel that the
one fact of his wealth, which Burt regretted, was almost his only claim
to superiority.Burt was as transparent as a mountain brook, and quite as
impetuous.The gray-haired man sighed, and felt that he would give all
his wealth in exchange for such youth.He knew his daughter's heart, and
felt that further parleying was vain, although he foresaw no easy task in
reconciling his wife to the match.He was far from being heartbroken
himself, however, for there was such a touch of nature in Burt, and in
the full, strong love waiting to reward the youth, that his own heart was
stirred, and in the depths of his soul he knew that this was better than
giving his child to a jaded millionaire."I have money enough for both,"
he thought."As she said, she is rich enough to follow her heart.It's a
pity if we can't afford an old-fashioned love-match."Hargrove's deep thought and
silence.At last the father arose and gave him his hand, saying: "You have been
honest with me, and that, with an old merchant, counts for a great deal.I also perceive you love my daughter for herself.If she should ever
inform me that you are essential to her happiness I shall not withhold my
consent."Burt seized his hand with a grasp that made it ache, as he said, "Every
power I have, sir, shall be exerted that you may never regret this
kindness.""If you make good that promise, Mr.Clifford, I shall become your friend
should your wooing prove successful.If you will come to the parlor I
will tell Miss Hargrove that you are here."He went up the stairs slowly, feeling that he was crossing the threshold
of a great change.How many thoughts passed through his mind as he took
those few steps!He saw his child a little black-eyed baby in his arms;
she was running before him trundling her hoop; she came to him with
contracted brow and half-tearful eyes, bringing a knotty sum in
fractions, and insisting petulantly that they were very "vulgar" indeed;
she hung on his arm, a shy girl of fifteen, blushingly conscious of the
admiring eyes that followed her; she stood before him again in her first
radiant beauty as a _debutante_, and he had dreamed of the proudest
alliance that the city could offer; she looked into his eyes, a pale,
earnest woman, and said, "Papa, he saved my life at the risk of his own."Clifford had not spoken of that, and Mr.Hargrove had not
thought of it in the interview so crowded with considerations.His heart
relented toward the youth as it had not done before.Well, well, since it
was inevitable, he was glad to be the one who should first bring the
tidings of this bold wooer's purpose."Trurie will never forget this
moment," he mattered, as he knocked at her door, "nor my part in her
little drama."O love, how it craves even the crumbs that fall from the
table of its idol!"Trurie," he began, as he entered, "you had better dress.Bless me, I
thought you were packing!"Clifford said he would call--to bid me good-by, I suppose.""Was that all you supposed, Trurie?""Indeed, papa, I told him I was going to town to-morrow, and he asked if
he might call."I'm sure it's quite natural he should call, and I have been
packing.""Well, I can assure you that he has a very definite object.He has asked
me if he might pay his addresses to you, and in the same breath assured
me that he would in any event.""Oh, papa," she said, hiding her face on his shoulder, "he was not so
unmannerly as that!""Indeed, he went much further, declaring that he would take no refusal
from you, either; or, rather, that he would take it so often as to wear
out your patience, and secure you by proving that resistance was useless.He had one decided fault to find with you, also."Oh, papa, tell me what he did say;" and he felt her heart fluttering
against his side like that of a frightened bird."Why, Trurie, men have offered you love before.""But I never loved before, nor knew what it meant," she whispered.This is all so strange, so sacred to
me.""Well, Trurie, I hope your match may be one of those that are made in
heaven.Your mother will think it anything but worldly wise.However, I
will reconcile her to it, and I'm glad to be the one with whom you will
associate this day.Long after I am gone it may remind you how dear your
happiness was to me, and that I was willing to give up my way for yours.Clifford has been straightforward and manly, if not conventional, and
I've told him that if he could win you and would keep his promise to do
his best for you and by you, I would be his friend, and that, you know,
means much.Of course, it all depends upon whether you accept him.Here is an organ"--with her hand upon her heart--"that
knows better."Oh, no, I can excuse you," he said, with smiling lips but moist eyes."Dear papa, I will, indeed, associate you with this hour and every
pleasant thing in life.You will find that you have won me anew instead
of losing me;" and looking back at him with her old filial love shining
in her eyes, she went slowly away to meet the future under the sweet
constraint of Nature's highest law.If Burt had been impatient in the library, he grew almost desperate in
the parlor.Might not Miss
Hargrove's pride rise in arms against him?Might she not even now be
telling her father of his fickleness, and declaring that she would not
listen to a "twice-told tale"?Every moment of delay seemed ominous, and
many moments passed.The house grew sepulchral in its silence, and the
wind without sighed and moaned as if Nature foreboded and pitied him in
view of the overwhelming misfortune impending.At last he sprang up and
paced the room in his deep perturbation.As he turned toward the entrance
he saw framed in the doorway a picture that appeared like a radiant
vision.Miss Hargrove stood there, looking at him so intently that, for a
second or two, he stood spell-bound.She was dressed in some white,
clinging material, and, with her brilliant eyes, appeared in the
uncertain light too beautiful and wraith-like to be human.She saw her
advantage, and took the initiative instantly.Clifford," she
exclaimed, "do I seem an apparition?""Yes, you do," he replied, coming impetuously toward her.She held out
her hand, proposing that their interview should at least begin at arm's
length.Nevertheless, the soft fire in his eyes and the flush on his
handsome face made her tremble with a delicious apprehension.Even while
at a loss to know just how to manage the preliminaries for a decorous
yielding, she exulted over the flame-like spirit of her lover.Clifford," she cried, "you ought to know that you are not
crushing a ghost's hand."What I meant was that I thought I had seen you before, but
you are a new revelation every time I see you.""Please don't say that, for I must ask you to interpret one to-night.What does Shakespeare say about those who have power?I hope you will use
yours mercifully.Oh, Miss Hargrove, you are so beautiful that I believe
I should lose my reason if you sent me away without hope."Clifford, you are talking wildly," was her faint response.I am almost desperate from fear, for I have a terribly hard
duty to perform."she said, withdrawing her hand, which he relinquished most
reluctantly, dreading that he might never receive it again."Do not assume that attitude, Miss Hargrove, or I shall lose courage
utterly."Clifford," she said, a little satirically, seating herself on
a sofa, "I never imagined you deficient in courage.Is it a terrible duty
to entertain me for a half-hour, and say good-by?"Nothing could be worse than that, if that were all;" and he looked
at her appealingly and in such perplexed distress that she laughed
outright."I am very much in earnest, Miss Hargrove.""You are very enigmatical, Mr.Must I be present while you
perform this terrible duty?""I think you know what I must confess already, and have a world of scorn
in store for me.Whatever the end may be, and my
sense of ill-desert is heavy indeed, I shall begin on the basis of
absolute truth.I've asked your father for the
privilege of winning your love;" and then he hesitated, not knowing how
to go on."No, I fear it will be the best, for he kindly gave his consent, and I
know it would be hard for him to do as much for any man, much more so for
one not wholly to his mind.Miss Hargrove, I must appear awkwardness and
incoherency personified.I shall appear to
you fickle and unmanly.How can I excuse myself to you when I have no
excuse except the downright truth that I love you better than my life,
better than my own soul, better than all the world and everything in it.I never knew what love was until you became unconscious in my arms on the
mountain.I'm only trying to explain
myself; and yet I had thought that I knew, and had spoken words of love
to your friend, Amy Winfield, who is worthy of the love of the best and
noblest man that ever breathed.She did not welcome my words--they only
wounded her--and she has never eared for me except as a true and gentle
sister cares.But I promised to wait till she did care.You fascinated me from the first hour of our meeting.I feel now
that I cherished an unworthy purpose toward you.I thought that, by
attentions to you, I could make Amy care; I thought that you were but a
brilliant society girl; but every hour I spent with you increased my
admiration, my respect; I saw that you were better and stronger than I
was.On the first day we went into camp on the mountain I saw whither my
heart was leading me, and from that hour until to-day I have tried to
conquer my love, feeling that I had no right to give it, that you would
despise it if I did.You can't have any confidence in me now.All my hope
is that you will give me a chance to prove that I am not a fickle wretch.I will accept of any probation, I will submit to any terms.I can't take
an absolute refusal now, for I feel you are seeing me at my worst, and I
know that you could do with me anything you pleased."Her head bowed lower and lower as he poured out these words like a
torrent."Does Amy--have you told her that you cannot keep your promise
to her?""Oh, yes, I told her so a few hours ago--since I met you this afternoon.I was going away to the West, like a coward, to escape from my dilemma,
for I felt you would never listen to me after you knew that I had broken
my word to Amy.I feared that I had already become a by-word between you
for all that was weak and fickle.But after I saw you I could not go till
I spoke.I determined to reveal the whole truth, and if you ever gave me
a chance to retrieve myself, gratitude would be no name for my deep
feeling.She told me in good plain English that she
wanted neither me nor my promise; that she didn't think that she ever
could have loved me, no matter how long I might have waited.But I could
not look into your clear eyes and say, 'I love you,' and know that you
might learn from her or any one that I had said this before.If you won't
trust me, having had the whole truth, then I must bear my hard fate as
best I can.""How long would you be willing to wait for me?"she asked, in tones so
low that he could scarcely catch the words.He bounded to her side, and took her unresisting hand."Oh, Gertrude," he
pleaded, "prove me, give me a chance, let me show that I am not without
manhood and constancy.Believe me, I know the priceless gift I'm asking,
but what else can I do?I have tried for weeks to conquer the feeling you
have inspired, tried with all the help that pride and sense of duty and
honor could give, but it has been utterly useless.I now am free; I have
the right to speak.At last she raised her downcast eyes and averted face to his, and for a
moment he was dazed at their expression.In tones sweet, low, and deep
with her strong emotion, she said, "Burt, how glad I am that you men are
blind!I found out that I loved you before we went to our mountain camp."She sprang up and gave him her other hand as she continued: "Can love
impose such hard conditions as you suggest--months of doubtful waiting
for one who risked his life for me without a second's hesitation?That is
not my nature, Burt.If I have power over you, I shall show it in another
way."She would never forget his look as he listened to these words, nor his
humility as he lowered his head upon her shoulder, and murmured, "I am
not worthy of this."It touched the deepest and tenderest chord in her
heart.His feeling was not the exultation of success, but a gratitude too
deep for words, and a half-conscious appeal that she would use her
woman's power to evoke a better manhood.It was not mere acknowledgment
of her beauty, or the impulse of his passion; it was homage to the best
and noblest part of her nature, the expression of his absolute trust.Never had she received such a tribute, and she valued it more than if
Burt had laid untold wealth at her feet.A great joy is often as sobering as a great sorrow, and they talked long
and earnestly together.Gertrude would not become engaged until she had
told her mother, and shown her the respect that was her due."You must
not be resentful," the young girl said, "if mamma's consent is not easily
won.She has set her heart on an establishment in town, I've set my heart
on you; so there we differ, and you must give me time to reconcile her to
a different programme."The clock on the mantel chimed eleven, and Burt started up, aghast at the
flight of time.Gertrude stole to her father's library, and found that he
was pacing the floor."I should not have left him alone so long
to-night," she thought, with compunction."Papa," she said, "Mr.He looked into his daughter's flushed, happy face, and needed no further
explanation, and with her hands on his arm he went to the drawing-room.Burt said but few and very simple words, and the keen judge of men liked
him beter than if he had been more exuberant.There was evidence of
downright earnestness now that seemed a revelation of a new trait."You spoke of going to the West soon," Mr.Hargrove remarked, as they
lingered in parting."Have you any objection to telling me of your
purpose?"Hargrove's face soon expressed unusual interest."I
must talk with you further about this," he said."I have land in the same
locality, and also an interest in the railroad to which you refer.Perhaps I can make your journey of mutual service.""Oh, papa," cried his daughter, "you are my good genius!"for she well
understood what that mutual service meant.Hargrove said, "Well, well, this Western-land
business puts a new aspect on the affair, and mamma may have little
ground for complaint.It's my impression that the Cliffords will realize
a very respectable fortune out of that land.""Papa," said the young girl, "Burt gave me something better than wealth
to-night--better even than love, in the usual sense of the word.He acted as if he saw in me the power to help him to be a
true man, and what higher compliment can a woman receive?He did not
express it so much by word as by an unconscious manner, that was so
sincere and unpremeditated that it thrilled my very soul.Oh, papa, you
have helped me to be so very happy!"CHAPTER LVI

WEBB'S FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER


Webb's silent entrance had not been so quiet but that Burt heard him.Scarcely had he gained his room before the younger brother knocked, and
followed him in without waiting."Where have you been at this time of
night?""You are infringing on ghostly hours, and are
beginning to look like a ghost;" for Webb had thrown himself into a
chair, and was haggard from the exhaustion of his long conflict.The
light and kindly way in which he answered his brother proved that he was
victor."Webb," said Burt, putting his hand on the elder brother's shoulder, "you
saved my life last winter, and life has become of immense value to me.If
you had not found me, I should have missed a happiness that falls to the
lot of few--a happiness of which all your science can never give you, you
old delver, even an idea.I meant to tell mother and father first, but I
feel to-night how much I owe to your brave, patient search, and I want
your congratulations.""I think you might have told father and mother last night, for I suppose
it's morning now.""I did not get home in time, and did not wish to excite mother, and spoil
her rest.""Well, then, you might have come earlier or gone later.I think not, if you know all about what I didn't know, and
could scarcely believe possible myself, till an hour or two since."I think you might have stayed at home
with Amy to-night, of all times.An accident, Burt, revealed to me your
success, and I do congratulate you most sincerely.You have now the
truest and loveliest girl in the world.""That's true, but what possible accident could have revealed the fact to
you?""Don't think I was spying upon you.From the top of a ladder in the
orchard I saw, as the result of a casual glance, your reward to Amy for
words that must have been very satisfactory."Burt began to laugh as if he could not control himself."What a surprise
I have for you all!""I went where I did last night with Amy's
full knowledge and consent.She never cared a rap for me, but the only
other girl in the world who is her equal does, and her name is Gertrude
Hargrove."Webb gave a great start, and sank into a chair."Don't be so taken aback, old fellow.I suppose you and the rest had set
your hearts on my marrying Amy.You have only to follow Amy's example,
and give me your blessing.Yes, you saw me give Amy a very grateful and
affectionate greeting last evening.She's the dearest little sister that
ever a man had, and that's all she ever wanted to be to me.I felt
infernally mean when I came to her yesterday, for I was in an awkward
strait.I had promised to wait for her till she did care, but she told me
that there was no use in waiting, and I don't believe there would have
been.She would have seen some one in the future who would awaken a very
different feeling from any that I could inspire, and then, if she had
promised herself to me, she would have been in the same predicament that
I was.She is the best and most sensible little girl that ever breathed,
and feels toward me just as she does toward you, only she very justly
thinks you have forgotten more than lever knew.As for Gertrude--Hang it
all!You'll say I'm at my old
tricks, but I'm not.You've seen how circumstances have brought us
together, and I tell you my eye and heart are filled now for all time.She will be over to-morrow, and I want her to receive the greeting she
deserves."The affair seemed of such tremendous importance to Burt that he was not
in the least surprised that Webb was deeply moved, and fortunately he
talked long enough to give his brother time to regain his self-control.Webb did congratulate him in a way that was entirely satisfactory, and
then bundled him out of the room in the most summary manner, saying,
"Because you are a hare-brained lover, you shouldn't keep sane people
awake any longer."It were hard to say, however, who was the less sane
that night, Webb or Burt.The former threw open his window, and gazed at
the moonlit mountains in long, deep ecstasy.Unlike Burt's, his more
intense feeling would find quiet expression.All he knew was that there
was a chance for him--that he had the right to put forth the best effort
of which he was capable--and he thanked God for that.At the same time he
remembered Amy's parable of the rose.He would woo as warily as
earnestly.With Burt's experience before his eyes, he would never stun
her with sudden and violent declarations.His love, like sunshine, would
seek to develop the flower of her love.He was up and out in the October dawn, too happy and excited for sleep.His weariness was gone; his sinews seemed braced with steel as he strode
to a lofty eminence.No hue on the richly tinted leaves nor on the rival
chrysanthemums was brighter than his hope, and the cool, pure air, in
which there was as yet no frostiness, was like exhilarating wine.From
the height he looked down on his home, the loved casket of the more
dearly prized jewel.He viewed the broad acres on which he had toiled,
remembering with a dull wonder that once he had been satisfied with their
material products.Now there was a glamour upon them, and upon all the
landscape.The river gleamed and sparkled; the mountains flamed like the
plumage of some tropical bird.The earth and
his old materiality became the foundation-stones on which his awakened
mind, kindled and made poetic, should rear an airy, yet enduring,
structure of beauty, consecrated to Amy.He had loved nature before, but
it had been to him like a palace in which, as a dull serving-man, he had
employed himself in caring for its furniture and the frames of its
paintings.But he had been touched by a magic wand, and within the frames
glowed ever-changing pictures, and the furniture was seen to be the work
of divine art.The palace was no longer empty, but enshrined a living
presence, a lovely embodiment of Nature's purest and best manifestation.The development of no flower in all the past summer was so clear to him
as that of the girl he loved.He felt as if he had known her thoughts
from childhood.Her young womanhood was like that of the roses he had
shown to her in the dewy June dawn that seemed so long ago.It was still like a bud of his favorite
mossrose, wrapped in its green calyx.Oh, what a wealth of fragrant
beauty would be revealed!But she should
waken in her own time; and if he had not the power to impart the deep,
subtile impulse, then that nearest to her, Nature, should be his bride.They were all at the breakfast-table when he returned, and this plotter
against Amy's peace entered and greeted her with a very quiet
"Good-morning," but he laid beside her plate a four-leaved clover which
he had espied on his way back."Thanks, Webb," she said, with eyes full of merriment; "I foresee an
amazing amount of good luck in this little emblem.Indeed, I feel sure
that startling proofs of it will occur to-day;" and she looked
significantly at Burt, who laughed very consciously."What mischief has Burt been up to, Amy?""He was
ready to explode with suppressed something last evening at supper, and
now he is effervescing in somewhat different style, but quite as
remarkably.You boys needn't think you can hide anything from mother very
long; she knows you too well."Both Webb and Burt, with Amy, began to laugh, and they looked at each
other as if there were a good deal that mother did not know."Webb and Amy have evidently some joke on Burt," remarked Leonard."Webb
was out last night, and I bet a pippin he caught Burt flirting with Miss
Hargrove.""Burt is going to settle down now and be
steady.We'll make him sign a pledge before he goes West, won't we, Amy?""Yes, indeed," gasped Amy, almost beside herself with merriment; "he'll
have to sign one in big capitals.""Burt," said his father, looking at him over his spectacles, "you've been
getting yourself into some scrape as sure as the world.That's right,
Amy; you laugh at him well, and--"

"A truce!""If I'm in a scrape, I don't propose to get
out of it, but rather to make you all share in it.As Amy says, her
four-leaved clover will prove a true prophet, green as it looks.I now
beg off, and shall prove that my scrape has not spoiled my appetite.""Well," said Leonard, "I never could find any four-leaved clovers, but
I've had good luck, haven't I, Maggie?""You had indeed, when you came courting me.""I am satisfied," began Webb, "that I could develop acres of four-leaved
clover.I have counted twenty-odd on
one root.If seed from such a plant were sown, and then seed selected
again from the new plants most characterized by this'sport,' I believe
the trait would become fixed, and we could have a field of four-leaved
clover.New varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers are often thus
developed from chance'sports' or abnormal specimens.""He would turn this ancient symbol of fortune
into a marketable commodity.""Pardon me; I was saying what might be done, not what I proposed to do.I
found this emblem of good chance by chance, and I picked it with the
'wish' attacked to the stem.Thus to the utmost I have honored the
superstition, and you have only to make your wish to carry it out fully.""My wishes are in vain, and all the four-leaved clovers in the world
wouldn't help them.I wish I was a scientific problem, a crop that
required great skill to develop, a rare rose that all the rose-maniacs
were after, a new theory that required a great deal of consideration and
investigation, and accompanied with experiments that needed much
observation, and any number of other t-i-o-n-shuns.Then I shouldn't be
left alone evenings by the great inquiring mind of the family.Burt's
going away, and, as his father says, has got into a scrape; so what's to
become of me?"They all arose from the table amid general laughter, of which Webb and
Burt were equally the objects, and on the faces of those not in the
secret there was much perplexed curiosity.exclaimed Maggie, "if Webb should concentrate his mind
on you as you suggest, it would end by his falling in love with you."This speech was received with shouts of merriment, and Amy felt the color
rushing into her face, but she scouted the possibility."The idea of
Webb's falling in love with any one!""I should as soon expect
to see old Storm King toppling over.""Still waters run--" began Maggie, but a sudden flash from Webb's eyes
checked her."Some still waters don't run at all.Not
for the world would I have Webb incur the dreadful risk that you suggest.""I think I'm almost old enough to take care of myself, sister Amy, and I
promise you to try to be as entertaining as such an old fellow can be.As
to falling in love with you, that happened long ago--the first evening
you came, when you stood in the doorway blushing and frightened at the
crowd of your new relations.""Haven't I got over being afraid of them remarkably?I never was a bit
afraid of you even at first.It took me a long time, however, to find out
how learned you were, and what deep subjects are required to interest
you.Alas, I shall never be a deep subject."Clifford, putting his arm around her, "you have
come like sunshine into the old home, and we old people can't help
wishing you may never go out of it while we are alive.""I'm not a bit jealous, Amy," said Maggie."I think it's time this mutual admiration society broke up," the young
girl said, with tears trembling in her eyes."When I think of it all, and
what a home I've found, I'm just silly enough to cry.I think it's time,
Burt, that you obtained your father's and mother's forgiveness or
blessing, or whatever it is to be.""You are right, Amy, as you always are.and
if you will accompany us, sir (to his father), you shall learn the
meaning of Amy's four-leaved clover.""You needn't think you are going to get Amy without my consent," Leonard
called after him."I've known her longer than any of you--ever since she
was a little girl at the depot."Amy and Webb began laughing so heartily at the speaker that he went away
remarking that he could pick apples if he couldn't solve riddles."Come up to my room, Amy," said Maggie, excitedly."No, no, Mother Eve, I shall go to my own room, and dress for company.""Burt said something more than
good-by to Miss Hargrove last evening."Amy would not answer, and the sound of a mirthful snatch of song died
musically away in the distance.Webb," Maggie resumed, "what did _you_ mean by that ominous
flash from your cavern-like eyes?""It meant that Amy has probably been satisfied with one lover in the
family and its unexpected result.I don't wish our relations embarrassed
by the feeling that she must be on her guard against another.""Oh, I see, you don't wish her to be on her guard.""Dear Maggie, whatever you may see, appear blind.Heaven only knows what
you women don't see."I've suspected you for
some time, but thought Burt and Amy were committed to each other.""Amy does not suspect anything, and she must not.She is not ready for
the knowledge, and may never be.All the help I ask is to keep her
unconscious.I've been expecting you would find me out, for you married
ladies have had an experience which doubles your insight, and I'm glad of
the chance to caution you.Amy is happy in loving me as a brother.She
shall never be unhappy in this home if I can prevent it."Maggie entered heart and soul into Webb's cause, for he was a great
favorite with her.He was kind to her children, and in a quiet way taught
them almost as much as they learned at school.He went to his work with
mind much relieved, for she and his mother were the only ones that he
feared might surmise his feeling, and by manner or remark reveal it to
Amy, thus destroying their unembarrassed relations, and perhaps his
chance to win the girl's heart.CHAPTER LVII

OCTOBER HUES AND HARVESTS


Burt's interview with his parents, their mingled surprise, pleasure, and
disappointment, and their deep sympathy, need not be dwelt upon.Clifford was desirous of first seeing Amy, and satisfying himself that
she did not in the slightest degree feel herself slighted or treated in
bad faith, but his wife, with her low laugh, said: "Rest assured, father,
Burt is right.He has won nothing more from Amy than sisterly love,
though I had hoped that he might in time.We shall keep Amy, and gain a new daughter that we have already learned
to admire and love."Burt's mind was too full of the one great theme to remember what Mr.Hargrove had said about the Western land, and when at last Miss Hargrove
came to say good-by, with a blushing consciousness quite unlike her usual
self-possession, he was enchanted anew, and so were all the household.The old people's reception seemed like a benediction; Amy banished the
faintest trace of doubt by her mirthful ecstasies; and after their
mountain experience there was no ice to break between Gertrude and
Maggie.The former was persuaded to defer her trip to New York until the morrow,
and so Amy would have her nutting expedition after all.When Leonard came
down to dinner, Burt took Gertrude's hand, and said, "Now, Len, this is
your only chance to give your consent.You can't have any dinner till you
do."His swift, deprecating look at Amy's laughing face reassured him."Well,"
he said, slowly, as if trying to comprehend it all, "I do believe I'm
growing old.When _did_ all this take
place?""Your eyesight is not to blame, Leonard," said his wife, with much
superiority."It's because you are only a man.""That's all I ever pretended to be."Then, with a dignity that almost
surprised Gertrude, he, as eldest brother, welcomed her in simple,
heartfelt words.At the dinner-table Miss Hargrove referred to the Western land.Burt laid
down his knife and fork, and exclaimed, "I declare, I forgot all about
it!"Miss Hargrove laughed heartily as she said, "A high tribute to me!"and
then made known her father's statement that the Clifford tract in the
West adjoined his own, that it would soon be very valuable, and that he
was interested in the railroad approaching it."I left him," she
concluded, "poring over his maps, and he told me to say to you, sir" (to
Mr.Clifford), "that he wished to see you soon.""How about the four-leaved clover now?"In the afternoon they started for the chestnut-trees.Webb carried a light
ladder, and both he and Burt had dressed themselves in close-fitting
flannel suits for climbing.The orchard, as they passed through it,
presented a beautiful autumn picture.Great heaps of yellow and red cheeked
apples were upon the ground; other varieties were in barrels, some headed
up and ready for market, while Mr.Clifford was giving the final cooperage
to other barrels as fast as they were filled."Father can still head up a barrel better than any of us," Leonard
remarked to Miss Hargrove."Well, my dear," said the old gentleman, "I've had over half a century's
experience.""It's time I obtained some idea of rural affairs," said Gertrude to Webb."There seem to be many different kinds of apples here."Yes, as easily as you know different dress fabrics at Arnold's.Those
umbrella-shaped trees are Rhode Island greenings; those that are rather
long and slender branching are yellow bell-flowers; and those with short
and stubby branches and twigs are the old-fashioned dominies.Don't you see how green the fruit is?It will not be
in perfection till next March.Not only a summer, but an autumn and a
winter are required to perfect that superb apple, but then it becomes one
of Nature's triumphs.Some of those heaps on the ground will furnish
cider and vinegar.Nuts, cider, and a wood fire are among the privations
of a farmer's life.""Farming, as you carry it on, appears to me a fine art.How very full
some of the trees are!and others look as if they had been half picked
over."The largest and ripest apples are taken
off first, and the rest of the fruit improves wonderfully in two or three
weeks.By this course we greatly increase both the quality and the bulk
of the crop.""You are very happy in your calling, Webb.How strange it seems for me to
be addressing you as Webb!""It does not seem so strange to me; nor does it seem strange that I am
talking to you in this way.I soon recognized that you were one of those
fortunate beings in whom city life had not quenched nature."They had fallen a little behind the others, and were out of ear-shot."I think," she said, hesitatingly and shyly, "that I had an ally in you
all along."He laughed and replied, "At one time I was very dubious over my
expedition to Fort Putnam.""I imagine that in suggesting that expedition you put in two words for
yourself.""I wish you might be as happy as I am.I'm not blind either, and I wonder
that Amy is so unconscious.""I hope she will remain so until she awakens as naturally as from sleep.She has never had a brother, and as such I try to act toward her.My one
thought is her happiness, and, perhaps, I can secure it in no other way.I feared long since that you had guessed my secret, and am grateful that
you have not suggested it to Amy.Few would have shown so much delicacy
and consideration.""I'm not sure that you are right, Webb.If Amy knew of your feeling, it
would influence her powerfully."Yes, it was necessary that she should misunderstand me, and think of me
as absorbed in things remote from her life.The knowledge you suggest
might make her very sad, for there never was a gentler-hearted girl.Please use it to prevent the constraint which might
arise between us."Burt now joined them with much pretended jealousy, and they soon reached
the trees, which, under the young men's vigorous blows, rained down the
prickly burrs, downy chestnuts, and golden leaves.Blue jays screamed
indignantly from the mountain-side, and squirrels barked their protest at
the inroads made upon their winter stores.As the night approached the
air grew chilly, and Webb remarked that frost was coming at last.He
hastened home before the others to cover up certain plants that might be
sheltered through the first cold snap.The tenderer ones had long since
been taken up and prepared for winter blooming.To Amy's inquiry where Johnnie was, Maggie had replied that she had gone
nutting by previous engagement with Mr.Alvord, and as the party returned
in the glowing evening they met the oddly assorted friends with their
baskets well filled.In the eyes of the recluse there was a gentler
expression, proving that Johnnie's and Nature's ministry had not been
wholly in vain.He glanced swiftly from Burt to Miss Hargrove, then at
Amy, and a faint suggestion of a smile hovered about his mouth.He was
about to leave them abruptly when Johnnie interposed, pleading: "Mr.Alvord, don't go home till I pick you some of your favorite heart's-ease,
as you call my <DW29>s.They have grown to be as large and beautiful as
they were last spring.Do you know, in the hot weather they were almost
as small as johnny-jumpers?but I wouldn't let 'em be called by that
name.""They will ever be heart's-ease to me, Johnnie-doubly so when you give
them," and he followed her to the garden.In the evening a great pitcher of cider fresh from the press, flanked by
dishes of golden fall pippins and grapes, was placed on the table.The
young people roasted chestnuts on hickory coals, and every one, even to
the invalid, seemed to glow with a kindred warmth and happiness.The city
belle contrasted the true home-atmosphere with the grand air of a city
house, and thanked God for her choice.At an early hour she said good-by
for a brief time and departed with Burt.He was greeted with stately
courtesy by Mrs.Hargrove herself, whom her husband and the prospective
value of the Western land had reconciled to the momentous event.Burt and
Gertrude were formally engaged, and he declared his intention of
accompanying her to the city to procure the significant diamond.After the culminating scenes of Burt's little drama, life went on very
serenely and quietly at the Clifford home.Out of school hours Alf,
Johnnie, and Ned vied with the squirrels in gathering their hoard of
various nuts.The boughs in the orchard grew lighter daily.Frost came as
Webb had predicted, and dahlias, salvias, and other flowers, that had
flamed and glowed till almost the middle of October, turned black in one
morning's sun.The butternut-trees had lost their foliage, and countless
leaves were fluttering down in every breeze like many-hued gems.The
richer bronzed colors of the oak were predominating in the landscape, and
only the apple, cherry, and willow trees about the house kept up the
green suggestion of summer.CHAPTER LVIII

THE MOONLIGHT OMEN


Webb permitted no marked change in his manner.He toiled steadily with
Leonard in gathering the fall produce and in preparing for winter, but
Amy noticed that his old preoccupied look was passing away.Daily he
appeared to grow more genial and to have more time and thought for her.With increasing wonder she learned the richness and fulness of his mind.In the evenings he read aloud to them all with his strong, musical
intonation, in which the author's thought was emphasized so clearly that
it seemed to have double the force that it possessed when she read the
same words herself.He found time for occasional rambles and horseback
excursions, and was so companionable during long rainy days that they
seemed to her the brightest of the week.Maggie smiled to herself and saw
that Webb's spell was working.He was making himself so quietly and
unobtrusively essential to Amy that she would find half of her life gone
if she were separated from him.Gertrude returned for a short time, and then went to the city for the
winter.He was much in New York, and
often with Mr.Hargrove, from whom he was receiving instructions in
regard to his Western expedition.That gentleman's opinion of Burt's
business capacity grew more favorable daily, for the young fellow now
proposed to show that he meant to take life in earnest."If this lasts he
will make a trusty young lieutenant," the merchant thought, "and I can
make his fortune while furthering mine."Burt had plenty of brains and
good executive ability to carry out the wiser counsels of others, while
his easy, vivacious manner won him friends and acceptance everywhere.It was arranged, after his departure, that Amy should visit her friend in
the city, and Webb looked forward to her absence with dread and
self-depreciation, fearing that he should suffer by contrast with the
brilliant men of society, and that the quiet country life would seem
dull, indeed, thereafter.Before Amy went on this visit there came an Indian summer morning in
November, that by its soft, dreamy beauty wooed every one out of doors."Amy," said Webb, after dinner, "suppose we drive over to West Point and
return by moonlight."She was delighted with the idea, and they were soon
slowly ascending the mountain.He felt that this was his special
opportunity, not to break her trustful unconsciousness, but to reveal his
power to interest her and make impressions that should be enduring.He
exerted every faculty to please, recalling poetic and legendary allusions
connected with the trees, plants, and scenes by which they were passing."Oh, Webb, how you idealize nature!""You make every object
suggest something fanciful, beautiful, or entertaining.How have you
learned to do it?""As I told you last Easter Sunday--how long ago it seems--if I have any
power for such idealization it is largely through your influence.My
knowledge was much like the trees as they then appeared.I was prepared
for better things, but the time for them had not yet come.I had studied
the material world in a material sort of way, employing my mind with
facts that were like the bare branches and twigs.You awakened in me a
sense of the beautiful side of nature.Who can
explain the rapid development of foliage and flowers when all is ready?""But, Webb, you appeared, during the summer, to go back to your old
materiality worse than ever.You made me feel that I had no power to do
anything for you.You treated me as if I were your very little sister who
would have to go to school a few years before I could be your companion.""Those were busy days," he replied, laughing."Besides," he added,
hesitatingly, "Burt was at one time inclined to be jealous.Of course, it
was very absurd in him, but I suppose lovers are always a little absurd."I saw whither Burt was drifting long
ago--at the time of the great flood which swept away things of more value
than my silly expectations.What an unsophisticated little goose I was!I
suppose Johnnie expects to be married some day, and in much the same way
I looked forward to woman's fate; and since you all seemed to wish that
it should be Burt, I thought, 'Why not?'Wasn't it lucky for Burt, and,
indeed, for all of you, that I was not a grown-up and sentimental young
woman?Hargrove, by uniting his interests with yours in the West,
will make your fortunes, and Burt will bring you a lovely sister.It
pleases me to see how Gertrude is learning to like you.I used to be
provoked with her at first, because she didn't appreciate you.Do you
know, I think you ought to write?You could make people fall in love with
nature.Americans don't care half as much for out-door life and pursuits
as the English.It seems to me that city life cannot compare with that of
the country.""You may think differently after you have been a few weeks in Gertrude's
elegant home."They had paused again on the brow of Cro' Nest, and were looking out on
the wide landscape."No, Webb," she said; "her home, no doubt, is
elegant, but it is artificial.This is simple and grand, and to-day, seen
through the soft haze, is lovely to me beyond all words.I honestly half
regret that I am going to town.Of course, I shall enjoy myself--I always
do with Gertrude--but the last few quiet weeks have been so happy and
satisfying that I dread any change.""Think of the awful vacuum that your absence will make in the old home!""Well, I'm a little glad; I want to be missed.But I shall write to you
and tell you of all the frivolous things we are doing.Besides, you must
come to see me as often as you can."They saw evening parade, the moon rising meanwhile over Sugarloaf
Mountain, and filling the early twilight with a soft radiance.The music
seemed enchanting, for their hearts were attuned to it.As the long line
of cadets shifted their guns from "carry arms" to "shoulder arms" with
instantaneous action, Webb said that the muskets sent out a shivering
sound like that of a tree almost ready to fall under the last blows of an
axe.Webb felt that should he exist millions of ages he should never forget the
ride homeward.The moon looked through the haze like a veiled beauty, and
in its softened light Amy's pure, sweet profile was endowed with ethereal
beauty.The beech trees, with their bleached leaves still clinging to them,
were almost spectral, and the oaks in their bronzed foliage stood like
black giants by the roadside.There were suggestive vistas of light and
shadow that were full of mystery, making it easy to believe that on a night
like this the mountain was haunted by creatures as strange as the fancy
could shape.The supreme gift of a
boundless love overflowed his heart to his very lips.She was so near, and
the spell of her loveliness so strong, that at times he felt that he must
give it expression, but he ever restrained himself.His words might bring
pain and consternation to the peaceful face.She was alone with him, and
there would be no escape should he speak now.No; he had resolved to wait
till her heart awoke by its own impulses, and he would keep his purpose
even through the witchery of that moonlight drive."How strangely isolated
we are," he thought, "that such feeling as mine can fill my very soul with
its immense desire, and she not be aware of anything but my quiet,
fraternal manner!"As they were descending the home <DW72> of the mountain they witnessed a
rare and beautiful sight.A few light clouds had gathered around the
moon, and these at last opened in a rift.The rays of light through the
misty atmosphere created the perfect colors of a rainbow, and this
phenomenon took the remarkable form of a shield, its base resting upon
one cloud, and its point extending into a little opening in the cloud
above."Was there ever anything so
strange and lovely?"Webb checked his horse, and they looked at the vision with wonder."I
never saw anything to equal that," said Webb.she asked, turning a little from him that she
might look upward, and leaning on his shoulder with the unconsciousness
of a child."Let us make it one, dear sister Amy," he said, drawing her nearer to
him."Let it remind you, as you recall it, that as far as I can I will
ever shield you from every evil of life."As he spoke the rainbow colors
became wonderfully distinct, and then faded slowly away.Her head drooped
lower on his shoulder, and she said, dreamily:

"It seems to me that I never was so happy before in my life as I am now.You are so different, and can be so much to me, now that your old absurd
constraint is gone.Oh, Webb, you used to make me so unhappy!You made me
feel that you had found me out--how little I knew, and that it was a bore
to have to talk with me and explain.I went everywhere with papa, and he always appeared to think
of me as a little girl.And then during the last year or two of his life
he was so ill that I did not do much else than watch over him with fear
and trembling, and try to nurse him and beguile the hours that were so
full of pain and weakness.But I'm not contented to be ignorant, and you
can teach me so much.I fairly thrill with excitement and feeling
sometimes when you are reading a fine or beautiful thing.If I can feel
that way I can't be stupid, can I?""Think how much faster I could learn this winter if you would direct my
reading, and explain what is obscure!""I will very gladly do anything you wish.There is a stupidity of heart which is
far worse than that of the mind, a selfish callousness in regard to
others and their rights and feelings, which mars the beauty of some women
worse than physical deformity.From the day you entered our home as a
stranger, graceful tact, sincerity, and the impulse of ministry have
characterized your life.Can you imagine that mere cleverness, trained
mental acuteness, and a knowledge of facts can take the place of these
traits?No man can love unless he imagines that a woman has these
qualities, and bitter will be his disappointment if he finds them
wanting."Her laugh rang out musically on the still air."I believe you have constructed an ideally perfect
creature out of nature, and that you hold trysts with her on moonlight
nights, you go out to walk so often alone.Well, well, I won't be jealous
of such a sister-in-law, but I want to keep you a little while longer
before you follow Burt's example.""I shall never give you a sister-in-law, Amy.""You don't know what you'll do.If you ever love, it will be for always; and I don't
like to think of it.I'd like to keep you just as you are.Now that you
see how selfish I am, where is woman's highest charm?"Webb laughed, and urged his horse into a sharp trot."I am unchangeable
in my opinions too, as far as you are concerned," he remarked."She is
not ready yet," was his silent thought.When she came down to the late supper her eyes were shining with
happiness, and Maggie thought the decisive hour had come; but in answer
to a question about the drive, Amy said, "I couldn't have believed that
so much enjoyment was to be had in one afternoon.Webb is a brother worth
having, and I'm sorry I'm going to New York.""Oh, you are excellent, as far as you go, but you are so wrapped up in
Maggie that you are not of much account; and as for Burt, he is more over
head and ears than you are.Even if a woman was in love, I should think
she would like a man to be sensible."you don't know what you are talking About," said Maggie.I suppose it is a kind of disease, and that all are more
or less out of their heads.""We've been out of our heads a good many years, mother, haven't we?""Well," said Leonard, "I just hope Amy will catch the disease, and have
it very bad some day."When I do, I'll send for Dr.A few days later Webb took her to New York, and left her with her friend."Don't be persuaded into staying very long," he found opportunity to say,
in a low tone."Indeed I won't; I'm homesick already;" and she looked after him very
wistfully.Gertrude looked so hurt and disappointed
when she spoke of returning, and had planned so much, that days
lengthened into weeks.CHAPTER LIX

THE HOSE REVEALS ITS HEART


Webb returned to a region that was haunted.Wherever he went, a presence
was there before him.In every room, on the lawn, in the garden, in lanes
no longer shaded, but carpeted with brown, rustling leaves, on mountain
roads, he saw Amy with almost the vividness of actual vision, as he had
seen her in these places from the time of her first coming.At church he
created her form in her accustomed seat, and his worship was a little
confused.She had asked him to write, and he made home life and the
varying aspects of nature real to her.His letters, however, were so
impersonal that she could read the greater part of them to Gertrude, who
had resolved to be pleased out of good-will to Webb, and with the
intention of aiding his cause.But she soon found herself expressing
genuine wonder and delight at their simple, vigorous diction, their
subtile humor, and the fine poetic images they often suggested."Oh,
Amy," she said, "I couldn't have believed it.I don't think he himself is
aware of his power of expression.""He has read and observed so much," Amy replied, "that he has much to
express.""It's more than that," said Gertrude; "there are touches here and there
which mere knowledge can't account for.They have a delicacy and beauty
which seem the result of woman's influence, and I believe it is yours.I
should think you would be proud of him.""I am," she answered, with exultation and heightened color, "but it seems
absurd to suppose that such a little ignoramus as I am can help him
much."Meanwhile, to all appearance, Webb maintained the even tenor of his way.He had been so long schooled in patience that he waited and hoped on in
silence as before, and busied himself incessantly.The last of the corn
was husked, and the golden treasure stored.The stalks were stacked near
the barn for winter use, and all the labors of the year were rounded out
and completed.Twice he went to the city to see Amy, and on one of these
occasions he was a guest at a large party given in her honor.During much
of the evening he was dazzled by her beauty, and dazed by her
surroundings.Her father had had her instructed carefully in dancing, and
she and Burt had often waltzed together, but he could scarcely believe
his eyes as she appeared on the floor unsurpassed in beauty and grace,
her favor sought by all.Was that the simple girl who on the shaggy sides
of Storm King had leaned against his shoulder?Miss Hargrove gave him little time for such musings.She, as hostess,
often took his arm and made him useful.The ladies found him reserved
rather than shy, but he was not long among the more mature and thoughtful
men present before a knot gathered around him, and some of Mr.Hargrove's
more intimate friends ventured to say, "There seems to be plenty of
brains in the family into which your daughter is to enter."After an hour or two had passed, and Amy had not had a chance to speak to
him, he began to look so disconsolate that she came and whispered,
"What's the matter, old fellow?""Oh, Amy," he replied, discontentedly, "I wish we were back on Storm
King."So do I," she said, "and so we will be many a time again.But you are
not out of place here.I heard one lady remarking how'reserved and
_distingue_ you were, and another," she added, with a flash of her
ever-ready mirthfulness, "said you were 'deliciously homely.'I was just
delighted with that compliment," and she flitted away to join her partner
in the dance.Webb brightened up amazingly after this, and before he
departed in the "wee sma' hours," when the rooms were empty, Gertrude
gave him a chance for a brief, quiet talk, which proved that Amy's heart
was still in the Highlands, even if he did not yet possess it.Burt would not return till late in December; but Amy came home about the
middle of the month, and received an ovation that was enough "to turn any
one's head," she declared.Their old quiet life was resumed, and Webb
watched keenly for any discontent with it."I've had my little fling," she said, "and I suppose it was
time I saw more of the world and society, but oh, what a refuge and haven
of rest the old place is!Gertrude is lovely, her father very gallant and
polite, but Mrs.Hargrove's stateliness oppresses me, and in society I
felt that I had to take a grain of salt with everything said to me.Gertrude showed her sense in preferring a home.I was in some superb
houses in the city that did not seem like homes."Webb, in his solicitude that the country-house should not appear dull,
found time to go out with her on pleasant days, and to interest her
deeply in a course of reading.It was a season of leisure; but his mother
began to smile to herself as she saw how absorbed he was in his pupil.The nights grew colder, the stars gained a frosty glitter, the ground was
rock-like, and the ponds were covered with a glare of black ice.Amy was
eager to learn to skate, and Webb found his duty of instructor
delightful.Little danger of her falling, although, with a beginner's
awkwardness, she essayed to do so often; strong arms were ever near and
ready, and any one would have been glad to catch Amy in such peril.They were now looking forward to Burt's return and the holiday season,
which Gertrude would spend with them.Not merely the shops, but busy and stealthy fingers, would furnish the
gifts.Webb had bought his present for Amy, but had also burned the
midnight oil in the preparation of another--a paper for a magazine, and
it had been accepted.He had planned and composed it while at work
stripping the husks from the yellow corn, superintending the wood teams
and the choppers in the mountain, and aiding in cutting from an adjacent
pond the crystal blocks of ice--the stored coolness for the coming
summer.Then while others thought him sleeping he wrote and rewrote the
thoughts he had harvested during the day.One of his most delightful tasks, however, was in aiding Amy to embower
the old house in wreaths and festoons of evergreens.The rooms grew into
aromatic bowers.Autumn leaves and ferns gave to the heavier decorations
a light, airy beauty which he had never seen before.Grace itself Amy
appeared as she mounted the step-ladder and reached here and there,
twining and coaxing everything into harmony.What was the effect of all this companionship on her mind?She least of
all could have answered: she did not analyze.She was being carried forward on a shining tide of happiness, and
yet its motion was so even, quiet, and strong that there was nothing to
disturb her maidenly serenity.If Webb had been any one but Webb, and if
she had been in the habit of regarding all men as possible admirers, she
would have understood herself long before this.If she had been brought
up with brothers in her own home she would have known that she welcomed
this quiet brother with a gladness that had a deeper root than sisterly
affection.But the fact that he was Webb, the quiet, self-controlled man
who had called her sister Amy for a year, made his presence, his deep
sympathy with her and for her, seem natural.His approaches had been so
gradual that he was stealing into her heart as spring enters a flower.You can never name the first hour of its presence; you take no note of
the imperceptible yet steady development.The process is quiet, yet vital
and sure, and at last there comes an hour when the bud is ready to open.That time was near, and Webb hoped that it was.His tones were now and
then so tender and gentle that she looked at him a little wonderingly,
but his manner was quiet and far removed from that of the impetuous Burt.There was a warmth in it, however, like the increasing power of the sun,
and in human hearts bleak December can be the spring-time as truly as
May.It was the twenty-third--one of the stormiest days of a stormy month.The
snowflakes were whirling without, and making many a circle in the gale
before joining their innumerable comrades that whitened the ground.The
wind sighed and soughed about the old house as it had done a year before,
but Webb and Amy were armed against its mournfulness.They were in the
parlor, on whose wide hearth glowed an ample fire.Burt and Gertrude were
expected on the evening train."Gertie is coming home through the snow just as I did," said Amy,
fastening a spray of mistletoe that a friend had sent her from England to
the chandelier; "and the same old warm welcome awaits her.""What a marvellous year it has been!"Burt is engaged to one of whose
existence he did not know a year ago.He has been out West, and found
that you have land that will make you all rich.""Are these the greatest marvels of the year, Amy?"I didn't know you a year ago to-day, and now
I seem to have known you always, you great patient, homely old
fellow--'deliciously homely.'"The eyes of scores of young fellows looked at you that evening as if you
were deliciously handsome.""And you looked at me one time as if you hadn't a friend in the world,
and you wanted to be back in your native wilds.""Not without you, Amy; and you said you wished you were looking at the
rainbow shield with me again.""Oh, I didn't say all that; and then I saw you needed heartening up a
little."You were dancing with a terrible swell, worth, it was
said, half a million, who was devouring you with his eyes.""I'm all here, thank you, and you look as if you were doing some
devouring yourself."Yes, some color, but it's just as Nature arranged it, and you know
Nature's best work always fascinates me."There, don't you think that is arranged
well?"and she stood beneath the mistletoe looking up critically at it."Let me see if it is," and he advanced to her side."This is the only
test," he said, and quick as a flash he encircled her with his arm and
pressed a kiss upon her lips.She sprang aloof and looked at him with dilating eyes.He had often
kissed her before, and she had thought nothing more of it than of a
brother's salute.Was it a subtile, mysterious power in the mistletoe
itself with which it had been endowed by ages of superstition?Was that
kiss like the final ray of the Jane sun that opens the heart of the rose
when at last it is ready to expand?She looked at him wonderingly,
tremblingly, the color of the rose mounting higher and higher, and
deepening as if the blood were coming from the depths of her heart.In answer to her wondering, questioning look, he only bent
full upon her his dark eyes that had held hers once before in a moment of
terror.She saw his secret in their depths at last, the devotion, the
love, which she herself had unsuspectingly said would "last always."She
took a faltering step toward him, then covered her burning face with her
hands."Amy," he said, taking her gently in his arms, "do you understand me now?Dear, blind little girl, I have been worshipping all these months, and
you have not known it.""I--I thought you were in love with nature," she whispered."So I am, and you are nature in its sweetest and highest embodiment.Every beautiful thing in nature has long suggested you to me.It seems to me now that I
have loved you almost from the first hour I saw you.I have known that I
loved you ever since that June evening when you left me in the rose
garden.Have I not proved that I can be patient and wait?"She only pressed her burning face closer upon his shoulder."It's all
growing clear now," she again whispered."I can be 'only your brother,' if you so wish," he said, gravely."Your
happiness is my first thought."She looked up at him shyly, tears in her eyes, and a smile hovering about
her tremulous lips."I don't think I understood myself any better than I
did you.I never had a brother, and--and--I don't believe I loved you
just right for a brother;" and her face was hidden again.His eyes went up to heaven, as if he meant that his mating should be
recognized there.Then gently stroking her brown hair, he asked, "Then I
shan't have to wait, Amy?"cried Webb, lifting the dewy, flower-like
face and kissing it again and again."Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn't know," began Mr.Clifford from the
doorway, and was about to make a hasty and excited retreat."A year ago you received this dear girl as
your daughter.She has consented to make the tie closer still if
possible."The old gentleman took Amy in his arms for a moment, and then said, "This
is too good to keep to myself for a moment," and he hastened the
blushing, laughing girl to his wife, and exclaimed, "See what I've
brought you for a Christmas present.See what that sly, silent Webb has
been up to.He has been making love to our Amy right under our noses, and
we didn't know it.""_You_ didn't know it, father; mother's eyes are not so blind.Amy,
darling, I've been hoping and praying for this.You have made a good
choice, my dear, if it is his mother that says it.Webb will never
change, and he will always be as gentle and good to you as he has been to
me.""Well, well, well," said Mr.Clifford, "our cup is running over, sure
enough.Maggie, come here," he called, as he heard her step in the hall.I once felt a little like grumbling because we
hadn't a daughter, and now I have three, and the best and prettiest in
the land."Didn't I, Webb--as long ago as last October, too?""Oh, Webb, you ought to have told me first," said Amy, reproachfully,
when they were alone."I did not tell Maggie; she saw," Webb answered.Then, taking a rosebud
which she had been wearing, he pushed open the petals with his finger,
and asked, "Who told me that 'this is no way for a flower to bloom'?I've
watched and waited till your heart was ready, Amy."And so the time flew
in mutual confidences, and the past grew clear when illumined by love.said Amy, with a mingled sigh and laugh."There you were
growing as gaunt as a scarecrow, and I loving you all the time.If you had looked at Gertrude as Burt did I should
have found myself out long ago.Why hadn't you the sense to employ Burt's
tactics?""Because I had resolved that nature should be my sole ally.Was not my
kiss under the mistletoe a better way of awakening my sleeping beauty
than a stab of jealousy?""Yes, Webb, dear, patient Webb.The rainbow shield was a true omen, and I
am sheltered indeed."CHAPTER LX

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS


Leonard had long since gone to the depot, and now the chimes of his
returning bells announced that Burt and Gertrude were near.To them both
it was in truth a coming home.Gertrude rushed in, followed by the
exultant Burt, her brilliant eyes and tropical beauty rendered tenfold
more effective by the wintry twilight without; and she received a welcome
that accorded with her nature.She was hardly in Amy's room, which she
was to share, before she looked in eager scrutiny at her friend.Oh, you little
wild-flower, you've found out that he is saying his prayers to you at
last, have you?Evidently he hasn't said them in vain.Oh, Amy darling, I was true to you and didn't
lose Burt either."Maggie had provided a feast, and Leonard beamed on the table and on every
one, when something in Webb and Amy's manner caught his attention."This
occasion," he began, "reminds me of a somewhat similar one a year ago
to-morrow night.It is my good fortune to bring lovely women into this
household.My first and best effort was made when I brought Maggie.Then
I picked up a little girl at the depot, and she grew into a tall, lovely
creature on the way home, didn't she, Johnnie?And now to-night I've
brought in a princess from the snow, and one of these days poor Webb will
be captured by a female of the MacStinger type, for he will never muster
up courage enough--What on earth are you all laughing about?""Thank you," said Amy, looking like a peony."You had better put your head under Maggie's wing and subside," Webb
added.Then, putting his arm about Amy, he asked, "Is this a female of
the MacStinger type?""Well," said he, at last, "when
_did_ this happen?When I was
courting, the whole neighborhood was talking about it, and knew I was
accepted long before I did.Did you see all this going on, Maggie?""Now, I don't believe Amy saw it herself," cried Leonard, half
desperately, and laughter broke out anew."Oh, Amy, I'm so glad!"said Burt, and he gave her the counterpart of the
embrace that had turned the bright October evening black to Webb."To think that Webb should have got such a prize!""Well, well, the boys in this family are in luck.""It will be my turn next," cried Johnnie."No, sir; I'm the oldest," Alf protested."Let's have supper," Ned remarked, removing his thumb from his mouth."Score one for Ned," said Burt."There is at least one member of the
family whose head is not turned by all these marvellous events."Can the sunshine and fragrance of a June day be photographed?No more can
the light and gladness of that long, happy evening be portrayed.Clifford held Gertrude's hand as she had Amy's when receiving her as a
daughter.The beautiful girl, whose unmistakable metropolitan air was
blended with gentle womanly grace, had a strong fascination for the
invalid.She kindled the imagination of the recluse, and gave her a
glimpse into a world she had never known."Webb," said Amy, as they were parting for the night, "I can see a sad,
pale orphan girl clad in mourning.I can see you kissing her for the
first time.I had a strange little thrill at heart
then, and you said, 'Come to me, Amy, when you are in trouble.'There is
one thing that troubles me to-night.All whom I so dearly love know of my
happiness but papa."Tell it to him, Amy," he answered, gently, "and tell it to God."There were bustle and renewed mystery on the following day.Astonishing-looking packages were smuggled from one room to another.Ned created a succession of panics, and at last the ubiquitous and
garrulous little urchin had to be tied into a chair.Johnnie and Alf
were in the seventh heaven of anticipation, and when Webb brought Amy
a check for fifty dollars, and told her that it was the proceeds of
his first crop from his brains, and that she must spend the money, she
went into Mr.Clifford's room waving it as if it were a trophy such as
no knight had ever brought to his lady-love."Of course, I'll spend it," she cried.It
shall go into books that we can read together.What's that agricultural
jargon of yours, Webb, about returning as much as possible to the soil?We'll return this to the soil," she said, kissing his forehead, "although
I think it is too rich for me already."In the afternoon she and Webb, with a sleigh well laden, drove into the
mountains on a visit to Lumley.He had repaired the rough, rocky lane
leading through the wood to what was no longer a wretched hovel.The
inmates had been expecting this visit, and Lumley rushed bareheaded
out-of-doors the moment he heard the bells.Although he had swept a path
from his door again and again, the high wind would almost instantly drift
in the snow.Poor Lumley had never heard of Sir Walter Raleigh or Queen
Elizabeth, but he had given his homage to a better queen, and with loyal
impulse he instantly threw off his coat, and laid it on the snow, that
Amy might walk dry-shod into the single room that formed his home.She
and Webb smiled significantly at each other, and then the young girl put
her hand into that of the mountaineer as he helped her from the sleigh,
and said "Merry Christmas!"with a smile that brought tears into the eyes
of the grateful man."Yer making no empty wish, Miss Amy.I never thought sich a Christmas 'ud
ever come to me or mine.But come in, come in out of the cold wind, an'
see how you've changed everything.Webb, and I'll tie
an' blanket your hoss.Lord, to think that sich a May blossom 'ud go into
my hut!"Lumley, neatly clad in some dark woollen material,
made a queer, old-fashioned courtesy that her husband had had her
practice for the occasion.But the baby, now grown into a plump, healthy
child, greeted her benefactress with nature's own grace, crowing,
laughing, and calling, "Pitty lady; nice lady," with exuberant welcome.The inmates did not now depend for precarious warmth upon two logs,
reaching across a dirty floor and pushed together, but a neat box,
painted green, was filled with billets of wood.The carpeted floor was
scrupulously clean, and so was the bright new furniture.A few evergreen
wreaths hung on the walls with the pictures that Amy had given, and on
the mantel was her photograph--poor Lumley's patron saint.Webb brought in his armful of gifts, and Amy took the child on her lap
and opened a volume of dear old "Mother Goose," profusely illustrated in
 prints--that classic that appeals alike to the hearts of
children, whether in mountain hovels or city palaces.The man looked on
as if dazed.Webb," he said, in his loud whisper, "I once saw a
picter of the Virgin and Child.Oh, golly, how she favors it!"Lumley," Amy began, "I think your housekeeping does you much
credit.I've not seen a neater room anywhere.""Well, mum, my ole man's turned over a new leaf sure nuff.There's no
livin' with him unless everythink is jesso, an, I guess it's better so,
too.Ef I let things git slack, he gits mighty savage.""You must try to be patient, Mr.You've made great changes for
the better, but you must remember that old ways can't be broken up in a
moment.""Lor' bless yer, Miss Amy, there's no think like breakin' off short,
there's nothink like turnin' the corner sharp, and fightin' the devil
tooth and nail.It's an awful tussle at first, an' I thought I was goin'
to knuckle under more'n once.So I would ef it hadn't 'a ben fer you, but
you give me this little ban', Miss Amy, an' looked at me as if I wa'n't a
beast, an' it's ben a liftin' me up ever sence.Oh, I've had good folks
talk at me an' lecter, an' I ben in jail, but it all on'y made me mad.The best on 'em wouldn't 'a teched me no more than they would a rattler,
sich as we killed on the mountain.But you guv me yer han', Miss Amy, an'
thar's mine on it agin; I'm goin' to be a _man_."She took the great horny palm in both her hands."You make me very
happy," she said, simply, looking at him above the head of his child,
"and I'm sure your wife is going to help you.I shall enjoy the holidays
far more for this visit.You've told us good news, and we've got good
news for you and your wife."Yes, Lumley," said Webb, clapping the man on the shoulder, "famous news.This little girl has been helping me just as much as she has you, and she
has promised to help me through life.One of these days we shall have a
home of our own, and you shall have a cottage near it, and the little
girl here that you've named Amy shall go to school and have a better
chance than you and your wife have had."exclaimed the man, almost breaking out into a
hornpipe."The Lord on'y knows what will happen ef things once git a
goin' right!Webb, thar's my han' agin'.Ef yer'd gone ter heaven fer
her, yer couldn't 'a got sich a gell.Well, well, give me a chance on yer
place, an' I'll work fer yer all the time, even nights an' Sundays."The child dropped her books and toys,
and clung to Amy."She knows yer; she knows all about yer," said the
delighted father."Well, ef yer must go, yer'll take suthin' with us;"
and from a great pitcher of milk he filled several goblets, and they all
drank to the health of little Amy."Yer'll fin' half-dozen pa'triges
under the seat, Miss Amy," he said, as they drove away."I was bound I'd
have some kind of a present fer yer."She waved her hand back to him, and saw him standing bareheaded in the
cutting wind, looking after her."Poor old Lumley was right," said Webb, drawing her to him; "I do feel as
if I had received my little girl from heaven.We will give those people a
chance, and try to turn the law of heredity in the right direction."Alvord sat over his lonely hearth,
his face buried in his hands.The day had been terribly long and
torturing; memory had presented, like mocking spectres, his past and what
it might have been.A sense of loneliness, a horror of great darkness,
overwhelmed him.Nature had grown cold and forbidding, and was losing its
power to solace.Johnnie, absorbed in her Christmas preparations, had not
been to see him for a long time.He had gone to inquire after her on the
previous evening, and through the lighted window of the Clifford home had
seen a picture that had made his own abode appear desolate indeed.In
despairing bitterness he had turned away, feeling that that happy home
was no more a place for him than was heaven.He had wandered out into the
storm for hours, like a lost spirit, and at last had returned and slept
in utter exhaustion.On the morning preceding Christmas memory awoke with
him, and as night approached he was sinking into sullen, dreary apathy.There was a light tap at the door, but he did not hear it.A child's face
peered in at his window, and Johnnie saw him cowering over his dying
fire.She had grown accustomed to his moods, and had learned to be
fearless, for she had banished his evil spells before.Therefore she
entered softly, laid down her bundles and stood beside him.she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.He started up,
and at the same moment a flickering blaze rose on the hearth, and
revealed the sunny-haired child standing beside him.If an angel had
come, the effect could not have been greater.Like all who are morbid, he
was largely under the dominion of imagination; and Johnnie, with her
fearless, gentle, commiserating eyes, had for him the potency of a
supernatural visitor.But the healthful, unconscious child had a better
power.Her words and touch brought saneness as well as hope.Alvord," she cried, "were you asleep?your fire is going
out, and your lamp is not lighted, and there is nothing ready for your
supper.What a queer man you are, for one who is so kind!Mamma said I
might come and spend a little of Christmas-eve with you, and bring my
gifts, and then that you would bring me home.I know how to fix up your
fire and light your lamp.and she bustled around, the embodiment of beautiful life.he said, taking her sweet face in his hands, and looking
into her clear eyes, "Heaven must have sent you.I was so lonely and sad
that I wished I had never lived."See what I've brought you,"
and she opened a book with the angels' song of "peace and good-will"
illustrated."Mamma says that whoever believes that ought to be happy,"
said the child."Yes, it's true for those who are like you and your mother."She leaned against him, and looked over his shoulder at the pictures.Alvord, mamma said the song was for you, too.Of course, mamma's
right.What else did He come for but to help people who are in trouble?I
read stories about Him every Sunday to mamma, and He was always helping
people who were in trouble, and who had done wrong.That's why we are
always glad on Christmas.You look at the book while I set your table."He did look at it till his eyes were blinded with tears, and like a sweet
refrain came the words.Half an hour later Leonard, with a kindly impulse, thought he would go to
take by the hand Johnnie's strange friend, and see how the little girl
was getting on.The scene within, as he passed the window, checked his
steps.Alvord's table, pouring tea for
him, chattering meanwhile with a child's freedom, and the hermit was
looking at her with such a smile on his haggard face as Leonard had never
seen there.He walked quietly home, deferring his call till the morrow,
feeling that Johnnie's spell must not be broken.Alvord put Johnnie down at her home, for he had
insisted on carrying her through the snow, and for the first time kissed
her, as he said:

"Good-by.You, to-night, have been like one of the angels that brought
the tidings of 'peace and good-will.'""I'm sorry for him, mamma!"said the little girl, after telling her
story, "for he's very lonely, and he's such a queer, nice man.Isn't it
funny that he should be so old, and yet not know why we keep Christmas?"Amy sang again the Christmas hymn that her own father and the father who
had adopted her had loved so many years before.Clifford, as he was fondly bidding her good-night, "how sweetly you have
fulfilled the hopes you raised one year ago!"Clifford had gone to her room, leaning on the arm of Gertrude.As
the invalid kissed her in parting, she said:

"You have beautiful eyes, my dear, and they have seen far more of the
world than mine, but, thank God, they are clear and true.Keep them so,
my child, that I may welcome you again to a better home than this."Once more "the old house stood silent and dark in the pallid landscape."The winds were hushed, as if the peace within had been breathed into the
very heart of Nature, and she, too, could rest in her wintry sleep.The
moon was obscured by a veil of clouds, and the outlines of the trees were
faint upon the snow.A shadowy form drew near; a man paused, and looked
upon the dwelling."If the angels' song could be heard anywhere to-night,
it should be over that home," Mr.Alvord murmured; but, even to his
morbid fancy, the deep silence of the night remained unbroken.He
returned to his home, and sat down in the firelight.A golden-haired
child again leaned upon his shoulder, and asked, "What else did He come
for but to help people who are in trouble, and who have done wrong?"Was it a voice deep in his own soul that was longing to
escape from evil?or was it a harmony far away in the sky, that whispered
of peace at last?That message from heaven is clearest where the need is
greatest.Hargrove's home was almost a palace, but its stately rooms were
desolate on Christmas-eve.He wandered restlessly through their
magnificence.He paid no heed to the costly furniture and costlier works
of art."Trurie was right," he muttered."What power have these things to
satisfy when the supreme need of the heart is unsatisfied?It seems as if
I could not sleep to-night without seeing her.There is no use in
disguising the truth that I'm losing her.Even on Christmas-eve she is
absent.It's late, and since I cannot see her, I'll see her gift;" and he
went to her room, where she had told him to look for her remembrance.To his surprise, he found that, according to her secret instructions, it
was lighted.He entered the dainty apartment, and saw the glow of autumn
leaves and the airy grace of ferns around the pictures and windows.He
started, for he almost saw herself, so true was the life-size and
lifelike portrait that smiled upon him.Beneath it were the words, "Merry
Christmas, papa!You have not lost me; you have only made me happy."The moon is again rising over old Storm King; the crystals that cover the
white fields and meadows are beginning to flash in its rays; the great
pine by the Clifford home is sighing and moaning.What heavy secret has
the old tree that it can sigh with such a group near as is now gathered
beneath it?Burt's black horse rears high as he reins him in, that
Gertrude may spring into the cutter, then speeds away like a shadow
through the moonlight Webb's steed is strong and quiet, like himself, and
as tireless.Amy steps to Webb's side, feeling it to be her place in very
truth.Sable Abram draws up next, with the great family sleigh, and in a
moment Alf is perched beside him.Then Leonard half smothers Johnnie and
Ned under the robes, and Maggie, about to pick her way through the snow,
finds herself taken up in strong arms, like one of the children, and is
with them.The chime of bells dies away in the distance.Wedding-bells
will be their echo.*       *       *       *       *

The merry Christmas-day has passed.Barkdale, and other friends have come and gone with their greetings;
the old people are left alone beside their cheery fire."Here we are, mother, all by ourselves, just as we were once before on
Christmas night, when you were as fair and blooming as Amy or Gertrude.Well, my dear, the long journey seems short to-night.I suppose the
reason is that you have been such good company.""Dear old father, the journey would have been long and weary indeed, had
I not had your strong arm to lean upon, and a love that didn't fade with
my roses.There is only one short journey before us now, father, and then
we shall know fully the meaning of the 'good tidings of great joy'
forever."To facilitate the process,
the monitor shunting engines are provided with a foot-board in front
and behind, just above the track, upon which the yard hands jump,
and are carried about from switch to switch, thus saving the time
they would occupy if they had to walk.A simpler arrangement could
not be imagined; anyone could devise it.The only wonder is that
even a considerable traffic can be conducted safely in reliance upon
it.Turning from Beach to Cannon street, it is apparent that the
train movement which has there to be accommodated would fall into
inextricable confusion if it was attempted to manage it in the way
which has been described.The number of trains is so great and
the movement so rapid and intricate, that not even a regiment of
employés stationed here and there at the signals and switches could
keep things in motion.From time to time they would block, and then
the whole vast machine would be brought to a standstill until order
could be re-established.The difficulty is overcome in a very simple
way, by means of an equally simple apparatus.The control over
the numerous switches and corresponding signals, instead of being
divided up among many men stationed at many points, is concentrated
in the hands of two men occupying a single gallery, which is
elevated across the tracks in front of the station and commanding
the approaches to it, much as the pilot-house of an American steamer
commands a view of the course before it.From this gallery, by means
of what is known as the interlocking system, every switch and signal
in the yard below is moved; and to such a point of perfection has
the apparatus been carried, that any disaster from the misplacement
of a switch or the display of a wrong signal is rendered impossible.Of this Cannon street apparatus Barry says, "there are here nearly
seventy point and signal levers concentrated in one signal house;
the number of combinations which would be possible if all the
signal and point levers were not interlocked can be expressed only
by millions.Of these only 808 combinations are safe, and by the
interlocking apparatus these 808 combinations are rendered possible,
and all the others impossible."[17]

  [17] _Railway Appliances_, p.It is not proposed to enter at any length into the mechanical
details of this appliance, which, however, must be considered as one
of the three or four great inventions which have marked epochs in
the history of railroad traffic.[18] As, however, it is but little
known in America, and will inevitably within the next few years find
here the widest field for its increased use, a slight sketch of its
gradual development and of its leading mechanical features may not
be out of place.Prior to the year 1846 the switches and signals
on the English roads were worked in the same way that they are now
commonly worked in this country.As a train drew near to a junction,
for instance, the switchman stationed there made the proper track
connection and then displayed the signal which indicated what tracks
were opened and what closed, and which line had the right of way;
and the engine-drivers acted accordingly.As the number of trains
increased and the movement at the junctions became more complicated,
the danger of the wrong switches being thrown or the wrong signals
displayed, increased also.Mistakes from time to time would happen,
even when only the most careful and experienced men were employed;
and mistakes in these matters led to serious consequences.It,
therefore, became the practice, instead of having the switch or
signal lever at the point where the switch or signal itself was, as
is still almost universally the case in this country, to connect
them by rods or wires with their levers, which were concentrated
at some convenient point for working, and placed under the control
of one man instead of several.So far as it went this change was
an improvement, but no provision yet existed against the danger of
mistake in throwing switches and displaying signals.The blunder of
first making one combination of tracks and then showing the signal
for another was less liable to happen after the concentration of
the levers under one hand than before, but it still might happen at
any time, and certainly would happen at some time.If all danger of
accident from human fallibility was ever to be eliminated a far more
complicated mechanical apparatus must be devised.In response to
this need the system of interlocking was gradually developed, though
not until about the year 1856 was it brought to any considerable
degree of perfection.The whole object of this system is to
render it impossible for a switchman, whether because he is weary
or agitated or actually malicious or only inexperienced, to give
contrary signals, or to break his line in one way and to give the
signal for its being broken in another way.To bring this about the
levers are concentrated in a cabin or gallery, and placed side by
side in a frame, their lower ends connecting with the switch-points
and signals by means of rods and wires.Beneath this frame are one
or more long bars, extending its entire length under it and parallel
with it.These are called locking bars; for, being moved to the
right or left by the action of the levers they hold these levers in
certain designated positions, nor do they permit them to occupy any
other.In this way what is termed the interlocking is effected.The
apparatus, though complicated, is simplicity itself compared with
a clock or a locomotive.The complication, also, such as it is,
arises from the fact that each situation is a problem by itself, and
as such has to be studied out and provided for separately.This,
however, is a difficulty affecting the manufacturer rather than the
operator.To the latter the apparatus presents no difficulty which
a fairly intelligent mechanic cannot easily master; while for the
former the highly complicated nature of the problem may, perhaps,
best be inferred from the example given by Mr.Barry, the simplest
that can offer, that of an ordinary junction where a double-track
branch-road connects with its double-track main line.There would
in this case be of necessity two switch levers and four signal
levers, which would admit of sixty-four possible combinations."The
signal might be arranged in any of sixteen ways, and the points
might occupy any of four positions, irrespective of the position
of the signals.Of the sixty-four combinations thus possible
only thirteen are safe, and the rest are such as might lure an
engine-driver into danger."[18] A sufficiently popular description of this apparatus also,
  illustrated by cuts, will be found in Barry's excellent little
  treatise on _Railway Appliances_, already referred to, published by
  Longmans & Co.as one of their series of text-books of science.Originally the locking bar was worked through the direct action of
certain locks, as they were called, between which the levers when
moved played to and fro.These locks were mere bars or plates of
iron, some with inclined sides, and others with sides indented or
notched.At one end they were secured on a pivot to a fixed bar
opposite to and parallel with the movable locking bar, while their
other ends were made fast to the locking bar; whence it necessarily
followed that, as certain of the levers were pushed to and fro
between them, the action of these levers on the inclined sides of
the locks could by a skilful combination be made to throw other
levers into the notches and indentations of other locks, thus
securing them in certain positions, and making it impossible for
them to be in any other positions.The apparatus which has been described, though a great improvement
on anything which had preceded it, was still but a clumsy affair,
and naturally the friction of the levers on the locks was so great
that they soon became worn, and when worn they could not be relied
upon to move the switch-points with the necessary accuracy.The new
appliance of safety had, therefore, as is often the case, introduced
a new and very considerable danger of its own.The signals and
switches, it was true, could no longer disagree, but the points
themselves were sometimes not properly set, or, owing to the great
exertion required to work it, the interlocking gear was strained.This difficulty resulted in the next and last improvement, which
was a genuine triumph of mechanical ingenuity.To insure the proper
length of stroke being made in moving the lever--that is to make
it certain in each case that the switch points were brought into
exactly the proper position--two notches were provided in the slot,
or quadrant, as it is called, in which the lever moved, and, when
it was thrown squarely home, and not until then, a spring catch
caught in one or other of these notches.This spring was worked by
a clasp at the handle of the lever, and the whole was called the
spring catch-rod.By a singularly ingenious contrivance, the process
of interlocking was transferred from the action of the levers and
the keys to these spring catch-rods, which were made to work upon
each other, and thus to become the medium through which the whole
process is effected.The result of this improvement was that, as
the switchman cannot move any lever until the spring-catch rod is
fastened, except for a particular movement, he cannot, do what he
will, even begin any other movement than that one, as the levers
cannot be started.On the other hand, it may be said that, by means
of this improvement, the mere "intention of the signal-man to move
any lever, expressed by his grasping the lever and so raising the
spring catch-rod, independently of his putting his intention in
force, actuates all the necessary locking.[19]"

  [19] In regard to the interlocking system as then in use in England,
  Captain Tyler in his report as head of the railway inspecting
  department of the Board of Trade, used the following language in
  his report on the accidents during 1870."When the apparatus is
  properly constructed and efficiently maintained, the signalman
  cannot make a mistake in the working of his points and signals which
  shall lead to accident or collision, except only by first lowering
  his signal and switching his train forward, then putting up his
  signal again as it approaches, and altering the points as the driver
  comes up to, or while he is passing over them.Such a mistake was
  actually made in one of the cases above quoted.It is, of course,
  impossible to provide completely for cases of this description; but
  the locking apparatus, as now applied, is already of enormous value
  in preventing accidents; and it will have a still greater effect
  on the general safety of railway travelling as it becomes more
  extensively applied on the older lines.Without it, a signalman in
  constantly working points and signals is almost certain sooner or
  later to make a mistake, and to cause an accident of a more or less
  serious character; and it is inexcusable in any railway company to
  allow its mail or express trains to run at high speed through facing
  points which are not interlocked efficiently with the signals, by
  which alone the engine-drivers in approaching them can be guided.There is however, very much yet to be effected in different parts of
  the country in this respect.And it is worth while to record here,
  in illustration of the difficulties that are sometimes met with by
  the inspecting officers, that the Midland Railway Company formally
  protested in June, 1866, against being compelled to apply such
  apparatus before receiving sanction for the opening of new lines
  of railway.They stated that in complying with the requirements in
  this respect of the Board of Trade, they '_were acting in direct
  opposition to their own convictions, and they must, so far as lay in
  their power, decline the responsibility of the locking system_.'"To still further perfect the appliance a simple mechanism has
  since 1870 been attached to the rod actuating the switch-bolt,
  which prevents the signal-man from shifting the switch under a
  passing train in the manner suggested by Captain Tyler in the above
  extract.In fact it is no exaggeration to say that the interlocking
  system has now been so studied, and every possible contingency so
  thoroughly provided for, that in using it accidents can only occur
  through a wilful intention to bring them about.In spite of any theoretical or fanciful objections which may be
urged against it, this appliance will be found an indispensable
adjunct to any really heavy junction or terminal train movement.For
the elevated railroads of New York, for instance, its early adoption
proved a necessity.As for questions of temperature, climate,
etc., as affecting the long connecting rods and wires which are an
essential part of the system, objections based upon them are purely
imaginary.Difficulties from this source were long since met and
overcome by very simple compensating arrangements, and in practice
occasion no inconvenience.That rods may break, and that wires are
at all times liable to get out of gear, every one knows; and yet
this fact is urged as a novel objection to each new mechanical
improvement.That a broken or disordered apparatus will always
occasion a serious disturbance to any heavy train movement, may also
be admitted.The fact none the less remains that in practice, and
daily subjected through long periods of time to incomparably the
heaviest train movement known to railroad experience, the rods of
the interlocking apparatus do not break, nor do its wires get out
of gear; while by means of it, and of it alone, this train movement
goes unceasingly on never knowing any serious disturbance.[20]

  [20] "As an instance of the possibility of preventing the mistakes
  so often made by signal men with conflicting signals or with facing
  points I have shown the traffic for a single day, and at certain
  hours of that day, at the Cannon Street station of the South Eastern
  Railway, already referred to as one of the _no-accident_ lines of
  the year.The traffic of that station, with trains continually
  crossing one another, by daylight and in darkness, in fog or in
  sunshine, amounts to more than 130 trains in three hours in the
  morning, and a similar number in the evening; and, altogether, to
  652 trains, conveying more than 35,000 passengers in the day as
  a winter, or 40,000 passengers a day as a summer average.It is
  probably not too much to say, that without the signal and point
  arrangements which have there been supplied, and the system of
  interlocking which has there been so carefully carried out, the
  signalmen could not carry on their duties _for one hour without
  accident_."_Captain Tyler's report on accidents for 1870, p.35._

It is not, however, alone in connection with terminal stations and
junctions that the interlocking apparatus is of value.It is also
the scientific substitute for the law or regulation compelling
trains to stop as a measure of precaution when they approach
grade-crossings or draw-bridges.It is difficult indeed to pass from
the consideration of this fine result of science and to speak with
patience of the existing American substitute for it.If the former
is a feature in the block system, the latter is a signal example of
the block-head system.As a device to avoid danger it is a standing
disgrace to American ingenuity; and, fortunately, as stopping is
compatible only with a very light traffic, so soon as the passage
of trains becomes incessant a substitute for it has got to be
devised.In this country, as in England, that substitute will be
found in the interlocking apparatus.By means of it the draw-bridge,
for instance, can be so connected with the danger signals--which
may, if desired, be gates closing across the railroad tracks--that
the one cannot be opened except by closing the other.This is the
method adopted in Great Britain not only at draws in bridges, but
frequently also in the case of gates at level road crossings.It
has already been noticed that in Great Britain accidents at draws
in bridges seem to be unknown.Certainly not one has been reported
during the last nine years.The security afforded in this case
by interlocking would, indeed, seem to be absolute; as, if the
apparatus is out of order, either the gates or the bridge would be
closed, and could not be opened until it was repaired.So also as
respects the grade-crossing of one railroad by another.Bringing
all trains to a complete stop when approaching these crossings
is a precaution quite generally observed in America, either as a
matter of statute law or running regulation; and yet during the six
years 1873-8 no less than 104 collisions were reported at these
crossings.In Great Britain during the nine years 1870-8 but nine
cases of accidents of this description were reported, and in both
the years 1877 and 1878 under the head of "Accidents or Collisions
on Level Crossings of Railways," the chief inspector of the Board
of Trade tersely stated that,--"No accident was inquired into under
this head.[21]" The interlocking system there affords the most
perfect protection which can be devised against a most dangerous
practice in railroad construction to which Americans are almost
recklessly addicted.It is, also, matter of daily experience that
the interlocking system does afford a perfect practical safeguard
in this case.Every junction of a branch with a double track
road involves a grade-crossing, and a grade-crossing of the most
dangerous character.On the Metropolitan Elevated railroad of New
York, at 53d street, there is one of these junctions, where, all
day long, trains are crossing at grade at the rate of some twenty
miles an hour.These trains never stop, except when signalled so
to do.The interlocking apparatus, however, makes it impossible
that one track should be open except when the other is closed.An
accident, therefore, can happen only through the wilful carelessness
of the engineer in charge of a train;--and in the face of wilful
carelessness laws are of no more avail than signals.If a man in
control of a locomotive wishes to bring on a collision he can always
do it.Unless he wishes to, however, the interlocking apparatus
not only can prevent him from so doing, but as a matter of fact
always does.The same rule which holds good at junctions would hold
good at level crossings.There is no essential difference between
the two.By means of the interlocking apparatus the crossing can
be so blocked at any desired distance from it in such a way that
when one track is open the other must be closed;--unless, indeed,
the apparatus is out of order, and then both would be closed.The precaution in this case, also, is absolute.Unlike the rule
as to stopping, it does not depend on the caution or judgment of
individuals;--there are the signals and the obstructions, and
if they are not displayed on one road they are on the other.So
superior is this apparatus in every respect--as regards safety as
well as convenience--to the precaution of coming to a stop, that, as
an inducement to introduce an almost perfect scientific appliance,
it would be very desirable that states like Massachusetts and
Connecticut compelling the stop, should except from the operation
of the law all draw-bridges or grade-crossings at which suitable
interlocking apparatus is provided.Surely it is not unreasonable
that in this case science should have a chance to assert itself.[21] "As affecting the safe working of railways, the level crossing
  of one railway by another is a matter of very serious import.Even when signalled on the most approved principles, they are a
  source of danger, and, if possible, should always be avoided.At
  junctions of branch or other railways the practice has been adopted
  by some companies in special cases, to carry the off line under or
  over the main line by a bridge.This course should generally be
  adopted in the case of railways on which the traffic is large, and
  more expressly where express and fast trains are run."_Report on
  Accidents on Railways of the United Kingdom during 1877, p.35._

In any event, however, the general introduction of the interlocking
apparatus into the American railroad system may be regarded as a
mere question of the value of land and concentration of traffic.So long as every road terminating in our larger cities indulges,
at whatever unnecessary cost to its stockholders, in independent
station buildings far removed from business centres, the train
movement can most economically be conducted as it now is.The
expense of the interlocking apparatus is avoided by the very simple
process of incurring the many fold heavier expense of several
station buildings and vast disconnected station grounds.If,
however, in the city of Boston, for instance, the time should come
when the financial and engineering audacity of the great English
companies shall be imitated,--when some leading railroad company
shall fix its central passenger station on Tremont street opposite
the head of Court street, just as in London the South Eastern
established itself on Cannon street, and then this company carrying
its road from Pemberton Square by a tunnel under Beacon Hill and the
State-house should at the crossing of the Charles radiate out so as
to afford all other roads an access for their trains to the same
terminal point, thus concentrating there the whole daily movement of
that busy population which makes of Boston its daily counting-room
and market-place,--then, when this is attempted, the time will have
come for utilizing to its utmost capacity every available inch of
space to render possible the incessant passage of trains.Then also
will it at last be realized that it is far cheaper to use a costly
and intricate apparatus which enables two companies to be run into
one convenient station, than it is to build a separate station, even
at an inconvenient point, to accommodate each company.In March, 1825, there appeared in the pages of the _Quarterly
Review_ an article in which the writer discussed that railway
system, the first vague anticipation of which was then just
beginning to make the world restless.He did this, too, in a very
intelligent and progressive spirit, but unfortunately secured for
his article a permanence of interest he little expected by the
use of one striking illustration.He was peculiarly anxious to
draw a distinct line of demarcation between his own very rational
anticipations and the visionary dreams of those enthusiasts who
were boring the world to death over the impossibilities which they
claimed that the new invention was to work.Among these he referred
to the proposition that passengers would be "whirled at the rate
of eighteen or twenty miles an hour by means of a high pressure
engine," and then contemptuously added,--"We should as soon expect
the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be fired off upon one
of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as trust themselves to the mercy
of such a machine, going at such a rate; their property perhaps they
may trust."Under the circumstances, the criticism was a perfectly reasonable
one.The danger involved in going at such a rate of speed and the
impossibility of stopping in time to avoid a sudden danger, would
naturally suggest themselves to any one as insuperable objections
to the new system for any practical use.Some means of preserving
a sudden and powerful control over a movement of such unheard of
rapidity would almost as a matter of course be looked upon as a
condition precedent.Yet it is a most noticeable fact in the history
of railroad development that the improvement in appliances for
controlling speed by no means kept pace with the increased rate of
speed attained.Indeed, so far as the possibility of rapid motion
is concerned, there is no reason to suppose that the _Rocket_
could not have held its own very respectably by the side of a
passenger locomotive of the present day.It will be remembered
that on the occasion of the Manchester & Liverpool opening, Mr.Huskisson after receiving his fatal injury was carried seventeen
miles in twenty-five minutes.Since then the details of locomotive
construction have been simplified and improved upon, but no great
change has been or probably will be effected in the matter of
velocity;--as respects that the maximum was practically reached
at once.Yet down to the year 1870 the brake system remained very
much what it was in 1830.Improvements in detail were effected,
but the essential principles were the same.In case of any sudden
emergency, the men in charge of the locomotive had no direct control
over the vehicles in the train; they communicated with them by the
whistle, and when the signal was heard the brakes were applied as
soon as might be.When a train is moving at the rate of forty miles
an hour, by no means a great speed for it while in full motion, it
passes over fifty-eight feet each second;--at sixty miles an hour it
passes over eighty-eight feet.Under these circumstances, supposing
an engine driver to become suddenly aware of an obstruction on the
track, as was the case at Revere, or of something wrong in the train
behind him, as at Shipton, he had first himself to signal danger,
and to this signal the brakemen throughout the train had to respond.Each operation required time, and every second of time represented
many feet of space.It was small matter for surprise, therefore,
that when in 1875 they experimented scientifically in England, it
was ascertained that a train of a locomotive and thirteen cars
moving at a speed of forty-five miles an hour could not be brought
to a stand in less than one minute, or before it had traversed a
distance of half a mile.The same result it will be remembered was
arrived at by practical experience in America, where both at Angola
and at Port Jervis,[22] it was found impossible to stop the trains
in less than half-a-mile, though in each case two derailed cars were
dragging and plunging along at the end of them.[22] _Ante_, pp.The need of a continuous train-brake, operated from the locomotive
and under the immediate control of the engine-driver, had been
emphasized through years by the almost regular recurrence of
accidents of the most appalling character.In answer to this need
almost innumerable appliances had been patented and experimented
with both in Europe and in America.Prior to 1869, however,
these had been almost exclusively what are known as emergency
brakes;--that is, although the trains were equipped with them and
they were operated from the locomotives, they were not relied upon
for ordinary use, but were held in reserve, as it were, against
special exigencies.The Hudson River railroad train at the Hamburg
accident was thus equipped.Practically, appliances which in the
operation of railroads are reserved for emergencies are usually
found of little value when the emergency occurs.Accordingly no
continuous brake had, prior to the development of Westinghouse's
invention, worked its way into general use.Patent brakes had
become a proverb as well as a terror among railroad mechanics,
and they had ceased to believe that any really desirable thing of
the sort would ever be perfected.Westinghouse, therefore, had a
most unbelieving audience to encounter, and his invention had to
fight hard for all the favor it won; nor did his experience with
master mechanics differ, probably, much from Miller's.His first
patents were taken out in 1869, and he early secured the powerful
aid of the Pennsylvania road for his invention.The Pullman Car
Company, also, always anxious to avail themselves of every appliance
of safety as well as of comfort, speedily saw the merits of the
new brake and adopted it; but, as they merely furnished cars and
had nothing to do with the locomotives that pulled them, their
support was not so effective as that of the great railroad company.Naturally enough, also, great hesitation was felt in adopting so
complicated an appliance.It added yet another whole apparatus to
a thing which was already overburdened with machinery.There was,
also, something in the delicacy and precision of the parts of this
new contrivance,--in its air-pump and reservoirs and long connecting
tubes with their numerous valves,--which was peculiarly distasteful
to the average practical railroad mechanic.It was true that the
idea of transmitting power by means of compressed air was by no
means new,--that thousands of drills were being daily driven by
it wherever tunnelling was going on or miners were at work,--yet
the application of this familiar power to the wheels of a railroad
train seemed no less novel than it was bold.It was, in the first
place, evident that the new apparatus would not stand the banging
and hammering to which the old-fashioned hand-brake might safely
be subjected; not indeed without deranging that simple appliance,
but without incurring any very heavy bill for repairs in so doing.Accordingly the new brake was at first carelessly examined and
patronizingly pushed aside as a pretty toy,--nice in theory no
doubt, but wholly unfitted for rough, every-day use.As it was
tersely expressed during a discussion before the Society of Arts
in London, as recently as May, 1877,--"It was no use bringing out
a brake which could not be managed by ordinary officials,--which
was so wonderfully clever that those who had to use it could not
understand it."A line of argument by the way, which, as has been
already pointed out, may with far greater force be applied to the
locomotive itself; and, indeed, unquestionably was so applied
about half a century ago by men of the same calibre who apply it
now, to the intense weariness and discouragement no doubt of the
late George Stephenson.Whether sound or otherwise, however, few
more effective arguments against an appliance can be advanced; and
against the Westinghouse brake it was advanced so effectively,
that even as late as 1871, although largely in use on western
roads, it had found its way into Massachusetts only as an ingenious
device of doubtful merit.It was in August, 1871, that the Revere
disaster occurred, and the Revere disaster, as has been seen,
would unquestionably have been averted had the colliding train
been provided with proper brake power.This at last called serious
attention there to the new appliance.Even then, however, the mere
suggestion of something better being in existence than the venerable
hand-brakes in familiar use did not pass without a vigorous protest;
and at the meeting of railroad officials, which has already been
referred to as having been called by the state commissioners
after the accident, one prominent gentleman, when asked if the
road under his charge was equipped with the most approved brake,
indignantly replied that it was,--that it was equipped with the
good, old-fashioned hand-brake;--and he then proceeded to vehemently
stake his professional reputation on the absolute superiority of
that ancient but somewhat crude appliance over anything else of the
sort in existence.Nevertheless, on this occasion also, the great
dynamic force which is ever latent in first-class railroad accidents
again asserted itself.Even the most opinionated of professional
railroad men, emphatically as he might in public deny it, quietly
yielded as soon as might be.In a surprisingly short time after the
exhibition of ignorance which has been referred to, the railroads in
Massachusetts, as it has already been shown, were all equipped with
train-brakes.[23]

  [23] Page 157.In its present improved shape it is safe to say that in all those
requisites which the highest authorities known on the subject have
laid down as essential to a model train brake, the Westinghouse
stands easily first among the many inventions of the kind.It is
now a much more perfect appliance than it was in 1871, for it was
then simply atmospheric and continuous in its action, whereas it
has since been made automatic and self-regulating.So far as its
fundamental principle is concerned, that is too generally understood
to call for explanation.By means of an air-pump, attached to the
boiler of the locomotive and controlled by the engine-driver, an
atmospheric force is brought to bear, through tubes running under
the cars, upon the break blocks, pressing them against the wheels.The hand of the engine-driver is in fact on every wheel in the
train.This application of power, though unquestionably ingenious
and, like all good things, most simple and obvious when once
pointed out, was originally open to one great objection, which was
persistently and with great force urged against it.The parts of the
apparatus were all delicate, and some injury or derangement of them
was always possible, and sometimes inevitable.The chief advantage
claimed for the brake was, however, that complete dependence could
be placed upon it in the regular movement of trains.It was obvious,
therefore, that if such dependence was placed upon it and any
derangement did occur, the first intimation those in charge of the
train would have that something was wrong might well come in the
shape of a failure of the brake to act, and a subsequent disaster.Both in Massachusetts and in Connecticut, at the crossing of one
railroad by another at the same level in the former state and in the
approach to draws in bridges in the latter, a number of cases of
this failure of the original Westinghouse non-automatic brake to act
did in point of fact occur.Fortunately they, none of them, resulted
in disaster.This, however, was mere good luck, as was illustrated
in the case of the accident of November 11, 1876, at the Communipaw
Ferry on the New Jersey Central.The train was there equipped with
the ordinary train brake.It reached Jersey City on time shortly
after 4 P.M., but, instead of slacking up, it ran directly through
the station and freight offices, carrying away the walls and
supports, and the locomotive then plunged into the river beyond.The baggage and smoking car followed but fortunately lodged on the
locomotive, thus blocking the remainder of the train.Fortunately no
one was killed, and no passengers were seriously injured.Again, on the Metropolitan Elevated railroad in New York city, on
the evening of June 23, 1879, one of the trains was delayed for a
few moments at the Franklin street station.Meanwhile the next train
came along, and, though the engine-driver of this following train
saw the danger signals and endeavored to stop in time, he found his
brake out of order, and a collision ensued resulting in the injury
of one employé and the severe shattering of a passenger coach and
locomotive.It was only a piece of good fortune that the first
of these accidents did not result in a repetition of the Norwalk
disaster and the second in that of Revere.It so chanced that it was the Smith vacuum brake which failed to
work at Communipaw, and the Eames vacuum which failed to work at
Franklin street.It might just
as well have been the original Westinghouse.The difficulty lay, not
in the maker's name, but in the imperfect action of the brake; and
such significant intimations are not to be disregarded.The chances
are naturally large that the failure of the continuous brake to act
will not at once occur under just those circumstances which will
entail a serious disaster and heavy loss of life; that, however, if
such intimations as these are disregarded, it will sooner or later
so occur does not admit of doubt.But the possibility that upon some given occasion it might fail to
work was not the only defect in the original Westinghouse; it might
well be in perfect order and in full action even, and then suddenly,
as the result of derailment or separation of parts, the apparatus
might be broken, and at once the shoes would drop from the wheels,
and the vehicles of the disabled train would either press forward,
or, on an incline, stop and run backwards until their unchecked
momentum was exhausted.This appears to have been the case at
Wollaston, and contributed some of its most disastrous features to
that accident.To obviate these defects Westinghouse in 1872 invented what he
termed a triple valve attachment, by means of which, if the
thing can be so expressed, his brake was made to always stand at
danger.That is, in case of any derangement of its parts, it was
automatically applied and the train stopped.The action of the brake
was thus made to give notice of anything wrong anywhere in the
train.A noticeable case of this occurred on the Midland railway in
England, when on the November 22, 1876, as the Scotch express was
approaching the Heeley station, at a speed of some sixty miles an
hour, the hind-guard felt the automatic brake suddenly self-applied.The forward truck of a Pullman car in the middle of the train had
left the rails; the front part of the train broke the couplings
and went on, while the rear carriages, acted upon by the automatic
brakes, came to a stand immediately behind the Pullman, which
finally rested on its side across the opposite track.On the other hand, as the Scotch express on the
North Eastern road was approaching Morpeth, on March 25, 1877, at
a speed of some twenty-five miles an hour, the locomotive for some
reason left the track.The train was not equipped with an automatic
brake, and the carriages in it accordingly pressed forward upon
each other until three of them were so utterly destroyed as to be
indistinguishable.Five passengers lost their lives; the remains of
one of whom, together with the wheels of a carriage, were afterwards
taken out from the tank of the tender, into which they had been
driven by the force of the shock.The theoretical objection to the automatic brake is obvious.In
case of any derangement of its machinery it applies itself, and,
should these derangements be of frequent occurrence, the consequent
stoppage of trains would prove a great annoyance, if not a source
of serious danger.This objection is not sustained by practical
experience.The triple valve, so called, is the only complicated
portion of the automatic brake, and this valve is well protected
and not liable to get out of order.[24] Should it become deranged
it will stop the working of the brake on that car alone to which it
belongs; and it will become deranged so as to set the brake only
from causes which would render the non-automatic brake inoperative.When anything of this sort occurs, it stops the train until the
defect is remedied.The returns made to the English Board of
Trade enable us to know just how frequently in actual and regular
service these stoppages occur, and what they amount to.Take, for
instance, the North Eastern and the Caledonian railways.During the last six months of 1878 the first
ran 138,000 train miles with it, in the course of which there
were eight delays or stoppages of some three to five minutes each
occasioned by the action of the triple-valve; being in round numbers
one occasion of delay in 17,000 miles of train movement.On the
Caledonian railway, during the same period, four brake failures, due
to the action of the triple-valve, were reported in runs aggregating
over 62,000 miles, being about one failure to 15,000 miles.These
failures moreover occasioned delays of only a few minutes each, and,
where the cause of the difficulty was not so immediately apparent
that it could at once be remedied, the brake-tubes of the vehicle
on which the difficulty occurred were disconnected, and the trains
went on.[25] One of these stoppages, however, resulted in a serious
accident.As a train on the Caledonian road was approaching the
Wemyss Bay junction on December 14th, in a dense fog, the engine
driver, seeing the signals at danger, undertook to apply his brake
slightly, when it went full on, stopping the train between the
distant and home signals, as they are called in the English block
system.After the danger signal was lowered, but before the brake
could be released, the signal-man allowed a following train to enter
upon the same block section, and a collision followed in which some
thirteen passengers were slightly injured.This accident, however,
as the inspecting officer of the Board of Trade very properly found,
was due not at all to the automatic brake, but to "carelessness
on the part of the signal-man, who disregarded the rules for the
working of the block telegraph instruments," and to the driver
of the colliding train, who "disobeyed the company's running
regulations."It gives an American, however, a realizing sense of
one of the difficulties under which those crowded British lines are
operated, to read that in this case the fog was "so thick that the
tail-lamp was not visible from an approaching train for more than a
few yards."[24] Speaking of the modifications introduced into his brake by
  Westinghouse since 1874, Mr.Thomas E. Harrison, civil engineer
  of the North Eastern Railway Company in a communication to the
  directors of that company of April 24, 1879, recommending the
  adoption by it of the Westinghouse, and subsequently ordered to
  be printed for the use of Parliament, thus referred to the triple
  valve: "As the most important [of these modifications] I will
  particularly draw your attention to the "triple-valve" which has
  been made a regular bugbear by the opponents of the system, and has
  been called complicated, delicate, and liable to get out of order,
  etc.* * * It is, in fact, as simple a piece of mechanism as well
  can be imagined, certain in its action, of durable materials, easily
  accessible to an ordinary workman for examination or cleaning, and
  there is nothing about it that can justify the term complication; on
  the contrary, it is a model of ingenuity and simplicity."[25] During the six months ending June 30, 1879, some 300 stops due
  to some derangement of the apparatus of the Westinghouse brake were
  reported by ten companies in runs aggregating about two million
  miles.Being one stop to 6,600 miles run.Very many of these stops
  were obviously due to the want of familiarity of the employés with
  an apparatus new to them, but as a rule the delays occasioned did
  not exceed a very few minutes; of 82 stoppages, for instance,
  reported on the London, Brighton & South Coast road, the two longest
  were ten minutes each and the remainder averaged some three or four
  minutes.After the application of the triple valve had made it automatic,
there remained but one further improvement necessary to render
the Westinghouse a well-nigh perfect brake.A superabundance of
self-acting power had been secured, but no provision was yet made
for graduating the use of that power so that it should be applied
in the exact degree, neither more nor less, which would soonest
stop the train.This for two reasons is mechanically a matter of
no little importance.As is well known a too severe application of
brakes, no matter of what kind they are, causes the wheels to stand
still and slide upon the rails.This is not only very injurious to
rolling stock, the wheels of which are flattened at the points which
slide, but, as has long been practically well-known to those whose
business it is to run locomotives, when once the wheels begin to
slide the retarding power of the brakes is seriously diminished.In order, therefore, to secure the maximum of retarding power, the
pressure of the brake-blocks on the revolving wheels should be very
great when first applied, and just sufficient not to slide them; and
should then be diminished, _pari passu_ with the momentum of the
train, until it wholly stops.Familiar as all this has long been
to engine-drivers and practical railroad mechanics, yet it has not
been conceded in the results of many scientific inquiries.In the
report of one of the Royal Commissions on Accidents, for instance,
it was asserted that the momentum of a train was retarded more by
the action of sliding than of slowly revolving wheels; and again,
as recently as in May, 1877, in a scientific discussion in London
at one of the meetings of the Society of Arts, a gentleman, with
the letters C. E. appended to his name, ventured the surprising
assertion that "no brake could do more than skid the wheels of
a train, and all continuous brakes professed to do this, and he
believed did so about equally well."Now, what it is here asserted
no brake can do is exactly what the perfect brake will be made to
do,--and what Westinghouse's latest improvement, it is claimed,
enables his brake to do.It much more than "skids the wheels," by
measuring out exactly that degree of power necessary to hold the
wheels just short of the skidding point, and in this way always
exerts the maximum retarding force.This is brought about by means
of a contrivance which allows the air to leak out of the brake
cylinders so as to exactly proportion the pressure of the blocks
on the wheels to the speed with which the latter are revolving.In other, and more scientific, language the force with which the
brake-blocks are pressed upon the wheels is made to adjust itself
automatically as the "coefficient of dynamic friction augments with
the reduction of train speed."It hardly needs to be said that in
this way the power of the brake is enormously increased.In America the superiority of the Westinghouse over any other
description of train-brake has long been established through that
large preponderance of use which in such matters constitutes the
final and irreversible verdict.[26] In Europe, however, and
especially in Great Britain, ever since the Shipton-on-Cherwell
accident in 1874, the battle of the brakes, as it may not
inappropriately be called, has waxed hotter and hotter; and not only
has this battle been extremely interesting in a scientific way, but
it has been highly characteristic, and at times enlivened by touches
of human nature which were exceedingly amusing.[26] In Massachusetts, for instance, where no official pressure
  in favor of any particular brake was brought to bear, out of 473
  locomotives equipped with train-brakes 361 have the Westinghouse,
  which is also applied to 1,363 out of 1,669 cars.Of these, however,
  79 locomotives and 358 cars are equipped with both the atmospheric
  and the vacuum brakes.The English battle of the brakes may be said to have fairly opened
with the official report from Captain Tyler on the Shipton accident,
in reference to which he expressed the opinion, which has already
been quoted in describing the accident, that "if the train had
been fitted with continuous brakes throughout its whole length
there is no reason why it should not have been brought to rest
without any casuality."The Royal Commission on railroad accidents
then took the matter up and called for a series of scientifically
conducted experiments.These took place under the supervision of
two engineers appointed by the Commission, who were aided by a
detail of officers and men from the royal engineers.Eight brakes
competed, and a train, consisting of a locomotive and thirteen
cars, was specially prepared for each.With these trains some
seventy runs were made, and their results recorded and tabulated;
the experiments were continued through six consecutive working
days.Of the brakes experimented with three were American in their
origin,--Westinghouse's automatic and vacuum, and Smith's vacuum.The remainder were English, and were steam, hydraulic, and air
brakes; among them also was one simple emergency brake.The result
of the trials was a very decided victory for the Westinghouse
automatic, and upon its performances the Commission based its
conclusion that trains ought to be so equipped that in cases of
emergency they could be brought to rest, when travelling on level
ground at 50 miles an hour, within a distance of 275 yards; with
an allowance of distance in cases of speed greater or less than
50 miles nearly proportioned to its square.These allowances they
tabulated as follows:--

  At 60 miles per hour, stopping distance within 400 yards.
  "55        "            "           "        340   "
  "  50        "            "           "        275   "
  "  45        "            "           "        220   "
  "  40        "            "           "        180   "
  "  35        "            "           "        135   "
  "  30        "            "           "        100   "

To appreciate the enormous advance in what may be called stopping
power which these experiments revealed, it should be added that
the first series of experiments made at Newark were with trains
equipped only with the hand-brake.The average speed in these
experiments was 47 miles, and with the train-brake, according to the
foregoing tabulation, the stop should have been made in about 250
yards; in reality it was made in a little less than five times that
distance, or 1120 yards; in other words the experiments showed that
the improved appliances had more than quadrupled the control over
trains.It has already been noticed that in the cases of the Angola
and the Port Jervis disasters, as well as in that at Shipton, the
trains ran some 2,700 feet before they could be stopped.Under the
English tabulations above given, in the results of which certain
recent improvements do not enter, a train running into the 42d
Street Station in New York, at a speed of forty-five miles an hour
when under the entrance arches, would be stopped before it reached
the buffers at the end of the covered tracks.The Royal Commission experiments were followed in May and June,
1877, by yet others set on foot by the North Eastern Railway
Company for the purpose of making a competitive test of the
Westinghouse automatic and the Smith's vacuum brakes.At this trial
also the average stop at a speed of 50 miles an hour was effected
in 15 seconds, and within a distance of 650 feet.Other series
of experiments with similar results were, about the same time,
conducted under the auspices of the Belgian and German governments,
of which elaborate official reports were made.The result was that
at last, under date of August 30, 1877, the Board of Trade issued
a circular to the railway companies in which it called attention to
the fact that, notwithstanding all the discussion which had taken
place and the elaborate official trials which the government had set
on foot, there had "apparently been no attempt on the part of the
various companies to take the first step of agreeing upon what are
the requirements which, in their opinion, are essential to a good
continuous brake."In other words, the Board found that, instead of
becoming better, matters were rapidly becoming worse.Each company
was equipping its rolling stock with that appliance in which its
officers happened to be interested as owners or inventors, and when
carriages thus equipped passed from the tracks of one road onto
those of another the result was a return to the old hand-brake
system in a condition of impaired efficiency.The Board accordingly
now proceeded to narrow down the field of selection by specifying
the following as what it considered the essentials of a good
continuous brake:--

     _a._ "The brakes to be efficient in stopping trains,
     instantaneous in their actions, and capable of being applied
     without difficulty by engine-drivers or guards._b._ "In case of accident, to be instantaneously self-acting._c._ "The brakes to be put on and taken off (with facility) on
     the engine and on every vehicle of a train._d._ "The brakes to be regularly used in daily working._e._ "The materials employed to be of a durable character, so as
     to be easily maintained and kept in order."These requirements pointed about as directly as they could to the
Westinghouse, to the exclusion of all competing brakes.Not more
than one other complied with them in all respects, and many made
no pretence of complying at all.Then followed what may be termed
the battle royal of the brakes, which as yet shows no signs of
drawing to a close.As the avowed object of the Board of Trade was
to introduce, one brake, to the necessary exclusion of all others,
throughout the railroad system of Great Britain, the magnitude of
the prize was not easy to over-estimate.The weight of scientific
and official authority was decidedly in favor of the Westinghouse
automatic, but among the railroad men the Smith vacuum found
the largest number of adherents.It failed to meet three of the
requirements of the Board of Trade, in that it was neither automatic
nor instantaneous in its action, while the materials employed in
it were not of a durable character.It was, on the other hand, a
brake of unquestioned excellence, while it commended itself to the
judgment of the average railroad official by its simplicity, and to
that of the average railroad director by its apparent cheapness.Any
one could understand it, and its first cost was temptingly small.The real struggle in Great Britain, therefore, has been, and now
is, between these two brakes; and the fact that both of them are
American has been made to enter largely into it, and in a way also
which at times lent to the discussion an element of broad humor.For instance, the energetic agent of the Smith vacuum, feeling
himself aggrieved by some statement which appeared in the _Times_,
responded thereto in a circular, in the composition of which he
certainly evinced more zeal than either judgment or literary skill.This circular and its author were then referred to by the editors
of _Engineering_, a London scientific journal, in the following
slightly _de haut en bas_ style:--

     "It is not a little remarkable, and it is a fact not harmonious
     with the feelings of English engineers, that the two brakes
     recommending themselves for adoption are of American origin.* * * Now we cannot wonder, considering what our past experience
     has been in many of our dealings with Americans, that this
     feeling of distrust and prejudice exists.It is not merely
     sentimental, it is founded on many and untoward and costly
     experiences of the past, and the fear of similar experiences in
     the future.And when we see the representative of one of these
     systems adopting the traditional policy of his country, and
     meeting criticism with abuse--abuse of men pre-eminent in the
     profession, and journals which he apparently forgets are neither
     American nor venal--we do not wonder that our railway engineers
     feel a repugnance to commit themselves."The superiority of the British over the American controversialist,
as respects courtesy and restraint in language, being thus
satisfactorily established, it only remained to illustrate it.This, however, had already been done in the previous May; for at
that time it chanced that Captain Tyler, having retired from his
position at the head of the railway inspectors department of the
Board of Trade, was considering an offer which Mr.Westinghouse had
made him to associate himself with the company owning the brakes
known by that name.Before accepting this offer, Captain Tyler
took advantage of a meeting of the Society of Arts to publicly
give notice that he was considering it.This he did in a really
admirable paper on the whole subject of continuous brakes, at the
close of which a general discussion was invited and took place, and
in the course of it the innate superiority of the British over any
other kind of controversialist, so far at least as courtesy and a
delicate refraining from imputations is concerned, received pointed
illustration.Houghton, C. E., took
occasion to refer to the paper he had read as "an elaborate puff
to the Westinghouse brake, with which he [Tyler] was, as he told,
connected, or about to be."Steele proceeded to say
that:--

     "On receiving the invitation to be present at the meeting, he
     had been somewhat afraid that Captain Tyler was going to lose
     his fine character for impartiality by throwing in his lot with
     the brake-tinkers, but it came out that not only was he going to
     do that, but actually going to be a partner in a concern.* * *
     The speaker then proceeded to discuss the Westinghouse brake,
     which he called the Westinghouse and Tyler brake, designating
     it as a jack-in-the-box, a rattle trap, to please and decoy,
     and not an invention at all.No engineer had a hand in its
     manufacture.It was the discovery of some Philadelphia barber
     or some such thing.This was
     a brake which had all sorts of pretensions.It had not worked
     well, but whenever there was any row about its not working
     well, they got the papers to praise it up, and that was how the
     papers were under the thumb, and would not speak of any other.* * * He thought it would not do for railway companies to take
     a bad brake, and Captain Tyler and Mr.Westinghouse be able
     to make their fortunes by floating a limited company for its
     introduction.They had heard of Emma mines and Lisbon tramways,
     and such like, and he felt it would not be well to stand by and
     allow this to be done."All of which was not only to the point, but finely calculated to
show the American inventors and agents who were present the nice and
mutually respectful manner in which such discussions were carried on
by all Englishmen.Though the avowed adhesion of Sir Henry Tyler to the Westinghouse
was a most important move in the war of the brakes, it did not
prove a decisive one.The complete control of the field was too
valuable a property to be yielded in deference to that, or any other
name without a struggle; and, so to speak, there were altogether
too many ins and outs to the conflict.Back door influences had
everywhere to be encountered.The North Western, for instance, is
the most important of the railway companies of the United Kingdom.The locomotive superintendent of that company was the part inventor
and proprietor of an emergency brake which had been extensively
adopted by it on its rolling stock, but which wholly failed to meet
the requirements laid down in its circular by the Board of Trade.Immediately after issuing that circular the Board of Trade called
the attention of the company to this fact in connection with an
accident which had recently occurred, and in very emphatic language
pointed out that the brakes in question could not "in any reasonable
sense of the word be called continuous brakes," and that it was
clear that the circular requirements were "not complied with by the
brake-system of the London & North Western Railway Company;" in case
that company persisted in the use of that brake, the secretary of
the Board went on to say, "in the event of a casualty occurring,
which an efficient system of brakes might have prevented, a heavy
personal responsibility will rest upon those who are answerable for
such neglect."This was certainly language tolerably direct in its
import.As such it was calculated to cause those to whom it was
addressed to pause in their action.The company, however, treated it
with a superb disregard, all the more contemptuous because veiled
in language of deferential civility.They then quietly went on
applying their locomotive superintendent's emergency brake to their
equipment, until on the 30th of June, 1879, they returned no less
than 2,052 carriages fitted with it; that being by far the largest
number returned by any one company in the United Kingdom.A more direct challenge to the Board of Trade and to Parliament
could not easily have been devised.To appreciate how direct it
was, it is necessary to bear in mind that in its circular of August
30, 1877, in which the requirements of a satisfactory train-brake
were laid down, the Board of Trade threw out to the companies
the very significant hint, that they "would do well to reflect
that if a doubt should arise that from a conflict of interest or
opinion, or from any other cause, they [the companies] are not
exerting themselves, it is obvious that they will call down upon
themselves an interference which the Board of Trade, no less than
the companies, desire to avoid."In his general report on the
accidents of the year 1877, the successor of Captain Tyler expressed
the opinion that "sufficient information and experience would now
appear to be available, and the time is approaching when the railway
companies may fairly be expected to come to a decision as to which
of the systems of continuous brakes is best calculated to fulfil the
requisite conditions, and is most worthy of general adoption."At
the close of another year, however, the official returns seemed to
indicate that, while but a sixth part of the passenger locomotives
and a fifth part of the carriages in use on the railroads of the
United Kingdom were yet equipped with continuous brakes at all, a
concurrence of opinion in favor of any one system was more remote
than ever.During the six months ending December 31, 1878, but 127
additional locomotives out of about 4000, and 1,200 additional
carriages out of some 32,000 were equipped; of which 70 locomotives
and 530 carriages had been equipped with the Smith vacuum, which in
three most important respects failed to comply with the Board of
Trade requirements.Under these circumstances the Board of Trade
was obviously called upon either to withdraw from the position it
had taken, or to invite that "interference" in its support to which
in its circular of August, 1877 it had so portentously referred.It
decided to do the latter, and in March, 1879 the government gave an
intimation in the House of Lords that early Parliamentary action was
contemplated.As it is expressed, the railway companies are to "be
relieved of their indecision."In Great Britain, therefore, the long battle of the brakes would
seem to be drawing to its close.The final struggle, however,
will be a spirited one, and one which Americans will watch with
considerable interest,--for it is in fact a struggle between two
American brakes, the Westinghouse and the Smith vacuum.Of the
907 locomotives hitherto equipped with the continuous brakes no
less than 819 are equipped with one or the other of these American
patents, besides over 4,464 of the 9,919 passenger carriages.The
remaining 3,857 locomotives and 30,000 carriages are the prize of
victory.As the score now stands the vacuum brake is in almost
exactly twice the use of its more scientific rival.The weight
of authority and experience, and the requirements of the Board of
Trade, are, however, on the opposite side.As deduced from the European scientific tests and the official
returns, the balance of advantages would seem to be as follows:--In
favor of the vacuum are its superficial simplicity, and possible
economy in first cost:--In favor of the Westinghouse automatic are
its superior quickness in application, the greater rapidity in
its stopping power, the more durable nature of its materials, the
smaller cost in renewal, its less liability to derangement, and
above all its self-acting adjustment.The last is the point upon
which the final issue of the struggle must probably turn.The use
of any train-brake which is not automatic in its action, as has
already been pointed out, involves in the long run disaster,--and
ultimate serious disaster.The mere fact that the brake is generally
so reliable,--that ninety-nine times out of the hundred it works
perfectly,--simply makes disaster certain by the fatal confidence
it inspires.Ninety-nine times in a hundred the brake proves
reliable;--nine times in the remaining ten of the thousand, in which
it fails, a lucky chance averts disaster;--but the thousandth time
will assuredly come, as it did at Communipaw and on the New York
Elevated railway, and, much the worst of all yet, at Wollaston.Soon or late the use of non-automatic continuous brakes will most
assuredly, if they are not sooner abandoned, be put an end to
by the occurrence of some not-to-be forgotten catastrophe of the
first magnitude, distinctly traceable to that cause.Meanwhile that
automatic brakes are complicated and sometimes cause inconvenience
in their operation is most indisputable.This is an objection, also,
to which they are open in common with most of the riper results of
human ingenuity;--but, though sun-dials are charmingly simple, we do
not, therefore, discard chronometers in their favor; neither do we
insist on cutting our harvests with the scythe, because every man
who may be called upon to drive a mowing machine may not know how
to put one together.But what Sir Henry Tyler has said in respect
to this oldest and most fallacious, as well as most wearisome, of
objections covers the whole ground and cannot be improved upon.After referring to the fact that simplicity in construction and
simplicity in working were two different things, and that, almost
invariably, a certain degree of complication in construction is
necessary to secure simplicity in working,--after pointing this out
he went on to add that,--

     "Simplicity as regards the application of railway brakes is
     not obtained by the system now more commonly employed of
     brake-handles to be turned by different men in different
     parts of the train; but is obtained when, by more complicated
     construction an engine-driver is able easily in an instant to
     apply ample brake-power at pleasure with more or less force
     to every wheel of his train; is obtained when, every time an
     engine-driver starts, or attempts to start his train, the brake
     itself informs him if it is out of order; and is still more
     obtained when, on the occasion of an accident and the separation
     of a coupling, the brakes will unfailingly apply themselves on
     every wheel of the train without the action of the engine-driver
     or guards, [brakemen], and before even they have time to realize
     the necessity for it.This is true simplicity in such a case,
     and that system of continuous brakes which best accomplishes
     such results in the shortest space of time is so far preferable
     to all others."THE RAILROAD JOURNEY RESULTING IN DEATH.One day in May, 1847, as the Queen of Belgium was going from
Verviers to Brussels by rail, the train in which she was journeying
came into collision with another train going in the opposite
direction.There was naturally something of a panic, and, as
royalty was not then accustomed to being knocked about with
railroad equality, some of her suite urged the queen to leave the
train and to finish her journey by carriage.The contemporaneous
court reporter then went on to say, in that language which is
so peculiarly his own,--"But her Majesty, as courageously as
discreetly, declined to set that example of timidity, and she
proceeded to Brussels by the railway."In those days a very
exaggerated idea was universally entertained of the great danger
incident to travel by rail.Even then, however, had her Majesty, who
was doubtless a very sensible woman, happened to be familiar with
the statistics of injuries received by those traveling respectively
by rail and by carriage, she certainly never on any plea of danger
would have been induced to abandon her railroad train in order to
trust herself behind horse-flesh.By pursuing the course urged
upon her, the queen would have multiplied her chances of accident
some sixty fold.Strange as the statement sounds even now, such
would seem to have been the fact.In proportion to the whole number
carried, the accidents to passengers in "the good old days of
stage-coaches" were, as compared to the present time of the railroad
dispensation, about as sixty to one.This result, it is true, cannot
be verified in the experience either of England or of this country,
for neither the English nor we possess any statistics in relation
to the earlier period; but they have such statistics in France,
stretching over the space of more than forty years, and as reliable
as statistics ever are.If these French statistics hold true in New
England,--and considering the character of our roads, conveyances,
and climate, their showing is more likely to be in our favor than
against us,--if they simply hold true, leaving us to assume that
stage-coach traveling was no less safe in Massachusetts than in
France, then it would follow that to make the dangers of the rail
of the present day equal to those of the highway of half a century
back, some eighty passengers should annually be killed and some
eleven hundred injured within the limits of Massachusetts alone.These figures, however, represent rather more than fifty times the
actual average, and from them it would seem to be not unfair to
conclude that, notwithstanding the great increase of population and
the yet greater increase in travel during the last half-century,
there were literally more persons killed and injured each year in
Massachusetts fifty years ago through accidents to stage-coaches
than there are now through accidents to railroad trains.The first impression of nine out of ten persons in no way connected
with the operations of railroads would probably be found to be
the exact opposite to this.A vague but deeply rooted conviction
commonly prevails that the railroad has created a new danger;
that because of it the average human being's hold on life is more
precarious than it was.The first point-blank, bald statement to the
contrary would accordingly strike people in the light not only of a
paradox, but of a somewhat foolish one.Investigation, nevertheless,
bears it out.The fact is that when a railroad accident comes, it is
apt to come in such a way as to leave no doubt whatever in relation
to it.It is heralded like a battle or an earthquake; it fills
columns of the daily press with the largest capitals and the most
harrowing details, and thus it makes a deep and lasting impression
on the minds of many people.When a multitude of persons, traveling
as almost every man now daily travels himself, meet death in such
sudden and such awful shape, the event smites the imagination.People seeing it and thinking of it, and hearing and reading of
it, and of it only, forget of how infrequent occurrence it is.It
was not so in the olden time.Every one rode behind horses,--if not
in public then in private conveyances,--and when disaster came it
involved but few persons and was rarely accompanied by circumstances
which either struck the imagination or attracted any great public
notice.In the first place, the modern newspaper, with its perfect
machinery for sensational exaggeration, did not then exist,--having
itself only recently come in the train of the locomotive;--and, in
the next place, the circle of those included in the consequences of
any disaster was necessarily small.For
weeks and months the vast machinery moves along, doing its work
quickly, swiftly, safely; no one pays any attention to it, while
millions daily make use of it.It is as much a necessity of their
lives as the food they eat and the air they breathe.Suddenly,
somehow, and somewhere,--at Versailles, at Norwalk, at Abergele, at
New Hamburg, or at Revere,--at some hitherto unfamiliar point upon
an insignificant thread of the intricate iron web, an obstruction is
encountered, a jar, as it were, is felt, and instantly, with time
for hardly an ejaculation or a thought, a multitude of human beings
are hurled into eternity.It is no cause for surprise that such an
event makes the community in which it happens catch its breadth;
neither is it unnatural that people should think more of the few who
are killed, of whom they hear so much, than of the myriads who are
carried in safety and of whom they hear nothing.Yet it is well to
bear in mind that there are two sides to that question also, and in
no way could this fact be more forcibly brought to our notice than
by the assertion, borne out by all the statistics we possess, that,
irrespective of the vast increase in the number of those who travel,
a greater number of passengers in stage-coaches were formerly
each year killed or injured by accidents to which they in no way
contributed through their own carelessness, than are now killed
under the same conditions in our railroad cars.In other words, the
introduction of the modern railroad, so far from proportionately
increasing the dangers of traveling, has absolutely diminished them.It is not, after all, the dangers but the safety of the modern
railroad which should excite our special wonder.What is the average length of the railroad journey resulting in
death by accident to a prudent traveler?--What is the average length
of one resulting in some personal injury to him?--These are two
questions which interest every one.Few persons, probably, start
upon any considerable journey, implying days and nights on the
rail, without almost unconsciously taking into some consideration
the risks of accident.Visions of collision, derailment, plunging
through bridges, will rise unbidden.Even the old traveler who
has enjoyed a long immunity is apt at times, with some little
apprehension, to call to mind the musty adage of the pitcher and
the well, and to ask himself how much longer it will be safe for
him to rely on his good luck.A hundred thousand miles, perhaps,
and no accident yet!--Surely, on every doctrine of chances, he
now owes to fate an arm or a leg;--perhaps a life.The statistics
of a long series of years enable us, however, to approximate with
a tolerable degree of precision to an answer to these questions,
and the answer is simply astounding;--so astounding, in fact,
that, before undertaking to give it, the question itself ought to
be stated with all possible precision.It is this:--Taking all
persons who as passengers travel by rail,--and this includes all
dwellers in civilized countries,--what number of journeys of the
average length are safely accomplished, to each one which results
in the death or injury of a passenger from some cause over which he
had no control?--The cases of death or injury must be confined to
passengers, and to those of them only who expose themselves to no
unnecessary risk.When approaching a question of this sort, statisticians are apt to
assume for their answers an appearance of mathematical accuracy.It is needless to say that this is a mere affectation.The best
results which can be arrived at are, after all, mere approximations,
and they also vary greatly year by year.The body of facts from
which conclusions are to be deduced must cover not only a definite
area of space, but also a considerable lapse of time.Even Great
Britain, with its 17,000 miles of track and its hundreds of millions
of annual passenger journeys, shows results which, one year with
another, vary strangely.For instance, during the four years
anterior to 1874, but one passenger was killed, upon an average, to
each 11,000,000 carried; while in 1874 the proportion, under the
influence of a succession of disasters, suddenly doubled, rising to
one in every 5,500,000; and then again in 1877, a year of peculiar
exemption, it fell off to one in every 50,000,000.The percentage of
fatal casualties to the whole number carried was in 1847-9 five fold
what it was in 1878.If such fluctuations reveal themselves in the
statistics of Great Britain, those met with in the narrower field of
a single state in this country might well seem at first glance to
set all computation at defiance.During the ten years, for example,
between 1861 and 1870, about 200,000,000 passengers were returned
as carried on the Massachusetts roads, with 135 cases of injury to
individuals.Then came the year of the Revere disaster, and out of
26,000,000 carried, no less than 115 were killed or injured.Seven
years of comparative immunity then ensued, during which, out of
240,000,000 carried, but two were killed and forty-five injured.In other words, through a period of ten years the casualties were
approximately as one to 1,500,000; then during a single year they
rose to one in 250,000, or a seven-fold increase; and then through
a period of seven years they diminished to one in 3,400,000, a
decrease of about ninety per cent.Taking, however, the very worst of years,--the year of the
Revere disaster, which stands unparalleled in the history of
Massachusetts,--it will yet be found that the answer to the question
as to the length of the average railroad journey resulting in death
or in injury will be expressed, not in thousands nor in hundreds
of thousands of miles, but in millions.During that year some
26,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the limits of the
state, and each journey averaged a distance of about 13 miles.It
would seem, therefore, that, even in that year, the average journey
resulting in death was 11,000,000 miles, while that resulting either
in death or personal injury was not less than 3,300,000.The year 1871, however, represented by no means a fair average.On the contrary, it indicated what may fairly be considered an
excessive degree of danger, exciting nervous apprehensions in the
breasts of those even who were not constitutionally timid.To reach
what may be considered a normal average, therefore, it would be
more proper to include a longer period in the computation.Take,
for instance, the nine years, 1871-79, during which alone has
any effort been made to reach statistical accuracy in respect to
Massachusetts railroad accidents.During those nine years, speaking
in round numbers and making no pretence at anything beyond a
general approximation, some 303,000,000 passenger journeys of 13
miles each have been made on the railroads and within the state.Of these 51 have resulted in death and 308 in injuries to persons
from causes over which they had no control.The average distance,
therefore, traveled by all, before death happened to any one, was
about 80,000,000 miles, and that travelled before any one was either
injured or killed was about 10,800,000.The Revere disaster of 1871, however, as has been seen, brought
about important changes in the methods of operating the railroads
of Massachusetts.Consequently the danger incident to railroad
traveling was materially reduced; and in the next eight years
(1872-9) some 274,000,000 passenger journeys were made within the
limits of the state.The Wollaston disaster of October, 1878, was
included in this period, during which 223 persons were injured and
21 were killed.The average journey for these years resulting in any
injury to a passenger was close upon 15,000,000 miles, while that
resulting in death was 170,000,000.But it may fairly be asked,--What, after all, do these figures
mean?--They are, indeed, so large as to exceed comprehension; for,
after certain comparatively narrow limits are passed the practical
infinite is approached, and the mere adding of a few more ciphers
after a numeral conveys no new idea.On the contrary, the piling up
of figures rather tends to weaken than to strengthen a statement,
for to many it suggests an idea of ridiculous exaggeration.Indeed,
when a few years ago a somewhat similar statement to that just made
was advanced in an official report, a critic undertook to expose
the fallacy of it in the columns of a daily paper by referring to a
case within the writer's own observation in which a family of three
persons had been killed on their very first journey in a railroad
car.It is not, of course, necessary to waste time over such a
criticism as this.Railroad accidents continually take place, and
in consequence of them people are killed and injured, and of these
there may well be some who are then making their first journey by
rail; but in estimating the dangers of railroad traveling the much
larger number who are not killed or injured at all must likewise be
taken into consideration.Any person as he may be reading this page
in a railroad car may be killed or injured through some accident,
even while his eye is glancing over the figures which show how
infinitesimal his danger is; but the chances are none the less as a
million to one that any particular reader will go down to his grave
uninjured by any accident on the rail, unless it be occasioned by
his or her own carelessness.Admitting, therefore, that ill luck or hard fortune must fall to
the lot of certain unascertainable persons, yet the chances of
incurring that ill fortune are so small that they are not materially
increased by any amount of traveling which can be accomplished
within the limits of a human life.So far from exhausting a fair
average immunity from accident by constant traveling, the statistics
of Massachusetts during the last eight years would seem to indicate
that if any given person were born upon a railroad car, and remained
upon it traveling 500 miles a day all his life, he would, with
average good fortune, be somewhat over 80 years of age before he
would be involved in any accident resulting in his death or personal
injury, while he would attain the highly respectable age of 930
years before being killed.Even supposing that the most exceptional
average of the Revere year became usual, a man who was killed by
an accident at 70 years of age should, unless he were fairly to be
accounted unlucky, have accomplished a journey of some 440 miles
every day of his life, Sundays included, from the time of his birth
to that of his death; while even to have brought him within the
fair liability of any injury at all, his daily journey should have
been some 120 miles.Under the conditions of the last eight years
his average daily journey through the three score years and ten to
entitle him to be killed in an accident at the end of them would be
about 600 miles.THE RAILROAD DEATH RATE.In connection with the statistics of railroad casualties it is not
without interest to examine the general vital statistics of some
considerable city, for they show clearly enough what a large degree
of literal truth there was in the half jocose proposition attributed
to John Bright, that the safest place in which a man could put
himself was inside a first-class railroad carriage of a train in
full motion.Take the statistics of Boston, for instance, for the
year 1878.During the four years 1875-8, it will be remembered, a
single passenger only was killed on the railroads of Massachusetts
in consequence of an accident to which he by his own carelessness
in no way contributed.[27] The average number of persons annually
injured, not fatally, during those years was about five.[27] This period did not include the Wollaston disaster, as the
  Massachusetts railroad year closes on the last day of September.The
  Wollaston disaster occurred on the 8th of October, 1878, and was
  accordingly included in the next railroad year.Yet during the year 1878, excluding all cases of mere injury of
which no account was made, no less than 53 persons came to their
deaths in Boston from falling down stairs, and 37 more from falling
out of windows; seven were scalded to death in 1878 alone.In the
year 1874 seventeen were killed by being run over by teams in
the streets, while the pastime of coasting was carried on at a
cost of ten lives more.During the five years 1874-8 there were
more persons murdered in the city of Boston alone than lost their
lives as passengers through the negligence of all the railroad
corporations in the whole state of Massachusetts during the nine
years 1871-8; though in those nine years were included both the
Revere and the Wollaston disasters, the former of which resulted
in the death of 29, and the latter of 21 persons.Neither are the
comparative results here stated in any respect novel or peculiar
to Massachusetts.Years ago it was officially announced in France
that people were less safe in their own houses than while traveling
on the railroads; and, in support of this somewhat startling
proposition, statistics were produced showing fourteen cases of
death of persons remaining at home and there falling over carpets,
or, in the case of females, having their garments catch fire, to ten
deaths on the rail.Even the game of cricket counted eight victims
to the railroad's ten.It will not, of course, be inferred that the cases of death or
injury to passengers from causes beyond their control include
by any means all the casualties involved in the operation of the
railroad system.On the contrary, they include but a very small
portion of them.The experience of the Massachusetts roads during
the seven years between September 30, 1871, and September 30,
1878, may again be cited in reference to this point.During that
time there were but 52 cases of injury to passengers from causes
over which they had no control, but in connection with the entire
working of the railroad system no less than 1,900 cases of injury
were reported, of which 1,008 were fatal; an average of 144 deaths a
year.Of these cases, naturally, a large proportion were employés,
whose occupation not only involves much necessary risk, but whose
familiarity with risk causes them always to incur it even in the
most unnecessary and foolhardy manner.During the seven years 293
of them were killed and 375 were reported as injured.Nor is it
supposed that the list included by any means all the cases of injury
which occurred.About one half of the accidents to employés are
occasioned by their falling from the trains when in motion, usually
from freight trains and in cold weather, and from being crushed
between cars while engaged in coupling them together.From this last
cause alone an average of 27 casualties are annually reported.One
fact, however, will sufficiently illustrate how very difficult it is
to protect this class of men from danger, or rather from themselves.As is well known, on freight trains they are obliged to ride on the
tops of the cars; but these are built so high that their roofs come
dangerously near the bottoms of the highway bridges, which cross
the track sometimes in close proximity to each other.Accordingly
many unfortunate brakemen were killed by being knocked off the
trains as they passed under these bridges.With a view to affording
the utmost possible protection against this form of accident, a
statute was passed by the Massachusetts legislature compelling the
corporations to erect guards at a suitable distance from every
overhead bridge which was less than eighteen feet in the clear
above the track.These guards were so arranged as to swing lightly
across the tops of the cars, giving any one standing upon them a
sharp rap, warning him of the danger he was in.This warning rap,
however, so annoyed the brakemen that the guards were on a number of
the roads systematically destroyed as often as they were put up; so
that at last another law had to be passed, making their destruction
a criminal offense.The brakemen themselves resisted the attempt
to divest their perilous occupation of one of its most insidious
dangers.In this respect, however, brakemen differ in no degree from the
rest of the community.On all hands railroad accidents seem to
be systematically encouraged, and the wonder is that the list of
casualties is not larger.In Massachusetts, for instance, even in
the most crowded portions of the largest cities and towns, not
only do the railroads cross the highways at grade, but whenever new
thoroughfares are laid out the people of the neighborhood almost
invariably insist upon their crossing the railroads at a grade
and not otherwise.Not but that, upon theory and in the abstract,
every one is opposed to grade-crossings; but those most directly
concerned always claim that their particular crossing is exceptional
in character.In vain do corporations protest and public officials
argue; when the concrete case arises all neighborhoods become alike
and strenuously insist on their right to incur everlasting danger
rather than to have the level of their street broken.During the
last seven years to September 30, 1878, 191 persons have been
injured, and 98 of them fatally injured, at these crossings in
Massachusetts, and it is certain as fate that the number is destined
to annually increase.What the result in a remote future will be, it
is not now easy to forecast.One thing only would seem certain: the
time will come when the two classes of traffic thus recklessly made
to cross each other will at many points have to be separated, no
matter at what cost to the community which now challenges the danger
it will then find itself compelled to avoid.The heaviest and most regular cause of death and injury involved
in the operation of the railroad system yet remains to be referred
to; and again it is recklessness which is at the root of it, and
this time recklessness in direct violation of law.The railroad
tracks are everywhere favorite promenades, and apparently even
resting-places, especially for those who are more or less drunk.In Great Britain physical demolition by a railroad train is also a
somewhat favorite method of committing suicide, and that, too, in
the most deliberate and cool-blooded manner.Cases have not been
uncommon in which persons have been seen to coolly lay themselves
down in front of an advancing train, and very neatly effect their
own decapitation by placing their necks across the rail.In England
alone, during the last seven years, there have been no less than 280
cases of death reported under the head of suicides, or an average
of 40 each year, the number in 1878 rising to 60.In America these
cases are not returned in a class by themselves.Under the general
head of accidents to trespassers, however, that is, accidents to
men, women and children, especially the latter, illegally lying,
walking, or playing on the tracks or riding upon the cars,--under
this head are regularly classified more than one third of all
the casualties incident to working the Massachusetts railroads.During the last seven years these have amounted to an aggregate
of 724 cases of injury, no less than 494 of which were fatal.Of
course, very many other cases of this description, which were not
fatal, were never reported.And here again the recklessness of the
public has received further illustration, and this time in a very
unpleasant way.Certain corporations operating roads terminating
in Boston endeavored at one time to diminish this slaughter by
enforcing the laws against walking on railroad tracks.A few
trespassers were arrested and fined, and then the resentment of
those whose wonted privileges were thus interfered with began to
make itself felt.Obstructions were found placed in the way of night
trains.The mere attempt to keep people from risking their lives
by getting in the way of locomotives placed whole trains full of
passengers in imminent jeopardy.Undoubtedly, however, by far the most effective means of keeping
railroad tracks from becoming foot-paths, and thus at once putting
an end to the largest item in the grand total of the expenditure
of life incident to the operation of railroads, is that secured
by the Pennsylvania railroad as an unintentional corollary to its
method of ballasting.That superb organization, every detail of
whose wonderful system is a fit subject for study to all interested
in the operation of railroads, has a roadway peculiar to itself.A principal feature in this is a surface of broken stone ballast,
covering not only the space between the rails, but also the interval
between the tracks as well as the road-bed on the outside of each
track for a distance of some three feet.It resembles nothing so
much as a newly macadamized highway.That, too, is its permanent
condition.To walk on the sharp and uneven edges of this broken
stone is possible, with a sufficient expenditure of patience and
shoe-leather; but certainly no human being would ever walk there
from preference, or if any other path could be found.Not only is
it in itself, as a system of ballasting, looked upon as better than
any other, but it confounds the tramp.Its systematic adoption in
crowded, suburban neighborhoods would, therefore, answer a double
purpose.It would secure to the corporations permanent road-beds
exclusively for their own use, and obviate the necessity of arrests
or futile threats to enforce the penalties of the law against
trespassers.It seems singular that this most obvious and effective
way of putting a stop to what is both a nuisance and a danger has
not yet been resorted to by men familiar with the use of spikes and
broken glass on the tops of fences and walls.Meanwhile, taken even in its largest aggregate, the loss of life
incident to the working of the railroad system is not excessive, nor
is it out of proportion to what might reasonably be expected.It is
to be constantly borne in mind, not only that the railroad performs
a great function in modern life, but that it also and of necessity
performs it in a very dangerous way.A practically irresistible
force crashing through the busy hive of modern civilization at a
wild rate of speed, going hither and thither, across highways and
by-ways and along a path which is in itself a thoroughfare,--such an
agency cannot be expected to work incessantly and yet never to come
in contact with the human frame.Naturally, however, it might be a
very car of Juggernaut.Is it so in fact?--To demonstrate that it
is not, it is but necessary again to recur to the comparison between
the statistics of railroad accidents and those which necessarily
occur in the experience of all considerable cities.Take again those
of Boston and of the railroad system of Massachusetts.These for the
purpose of illustration are as good as any, and in their results
would only be confirmed in the experience of Paris as compared with
the railroad system of France, or in that of London as compared with
the railroad system of Great Britain.During the eight years between
September 30, 1870, and September 30, 1878, the entire railroad
system of Massachusetts was operated at a cost of 1,165 lives, apart
from all cases of injury which did not prove fatal.The returns in
this respect also may be accepted as reasonably accurate, as the
deaths were all returned, though the cases of merely personal injury
probably were not.During the ten
years, 1868-78, 2,587 cases of death from accidental causes, or 259
a year, were recorded as having taken place in the city of Boston.In other words, the annual average of deaths by accident in the city
of Boston alone exceeds that consequent on running all the railroads
of the state by eighty per cent.Unless, therefore, the railroad
system is to be considered as an exception to all other functions of
modern life, and as such is to be expected to do its work without
injury to life or limb, this showing does not constitute a very
heavy indictment against it.AMERICAN AS COMPARED WITH FOREIGN RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.Up to this point, the statistics and experience of Massachusetts
only have been referred to.This is owing to the fact that the
railroad returns of that state are more carefully prepared and
tabulated than are those of any other state, and afford, therefore,
more satisfactory data from which to draw conclusions.The
territorial area from which the statistics are in this case derived
is very limited, and it yet remains to compare the results deduced
from them with those derived from the similar experience of other
communities.This, however, is not an easy thing to do; and, while
it is difficult enough as respects Europe, it is even more difficult
as respects America taken as a whole.This last fact is especially
unfortunate in view of the circumstance that, in regard to railway
accidents, the United States, whether deservedly or not, enjoy a
most undesirable reputation.Foreign authorities have a way of
referring to our "well-known national disregard of human life," with
a sort of complacency, at once patronizing and contemptuous, which
is the reverse of pleasing.Judging by the tone of their comments,
the natural inference would be that railroad disasters of the worst
description were in America matters of such frequent occurrence
as to excite scarcely any remark.As will presently be made very
apparent, this impression, for it is only an impression, can, so
far as the country as a whole is concerned, neither be proved nor
disproved, from the absence of sufficient data from which to argue.As respects Massachusetts, however, and the same statement may
perhaps be made of the whole belt of states north of the Potomac and
the Ohio, there is no basis for it.There is no reason to suppose
that railroad traveling is throughout that region accompanied by any
peculiar or unusual degree of danger.The great difficulty, just referred to, in comparing the results
deduced from equally complete statistics of different countries,
lies in the variety of the arbitrary rules under which the
computations in making them up are effected.As an example in
point, take the railroad returns of Great Britain and those of
Massachusetts.They are in each case prepared with a great deal
of care, and the results deduced from them may fairly be accepted
as approximately correct.As respects accidents, the number of
cases of death and of personal injury are annually reported, and
with tolerable completeness, though in the latter respect there is
probably in both cases room for improvement.The whole comparison
turns, however, on the way in which the entire number of passengers
annually carried is computed.In Great Britain, for instance, in
1878, these were returned, using round numbers only, at 565,000,000,
and in Massachusetts at 34,000,000.By dividing these totals by
the number of cases of death and injury reported as occurring
to passengers from causes beyond their control, we shall arrive
apparently at a fair comparative showing as to the relative safety
of railroad traveling in the two communities.The result for that
particular year would have been that while in Great Britain one
passenger in each 23,500,000 was killed, and one in each 481,600
injured from causes beyond their control, in Massachusetts none
were killed and only one in each 14,000,000 was in any way injured.Unfortunately, however, a closer examination reveals a very great
error in the computation, affecting every comparative result drawn
from it.In the English returns no allowance whatever is made
for the very large number of journeys made by season-ticket or
commutation passengers, while in Massachusetts, on the contrary,
each person of this class enters into the grand total as making two
trips each day, 156 trips on each quarterly ticket, and 626 trips on
each annual.Now in 1878 more than 418,000 holders of season tickets
were returned by the railway companies of Great Britain.How many
of these were quarterly and how many were annual travelers, does not
appear.If they were all annual travelers, no less than 261,000,000
journeys should be added to the 565,000,000 in the returns, in order
to arrive at an equal basis for a comparison between the foreign
and the American roads: this method, however, would be manifestly
inaccurate, so it only remains, in the absence of all reliable data,
and for the purpose of comparison solely, to strike out from the
Massachusetts returns the 8,320,727 season-ticket passages, which at
once reduces by over 3,000,000 the number of journeys to each case
of injury.As season-ticket passengers do travel and are exposed to
danger in the same degree as trip-ticket passengers, no result is
approximately accurate which leaves them out of the computation.At
present, however, the question relates not to the positive danger or
safety of traveling by rail, but to its relative danger in different
communities.Allowance for this discrepancy can, however, be made by adding to
the English official results an additional nineteen per cent., that,
according to the returns of 1877 and 1878, being the proportion
of the season-ticket to other passengers on the roads of Great
Britain.Taking then the Board of Trade returns for the eight
years 1870-7, it will be found that during this period about one
passenger in each 14,500,000 carried in that country has been killed
in railroad accidents, and about one in each 436,000 injured.This may be assumed as a fair average for purpose of comparison,
though it ought to be said that in Great Britain the percentage of
casualties to passengers shows a decided tendency to decrease, and
during the years 1877-8 the percentages of killed fell from one in
15,000,000 to one in 38,000,000 and those of injured from one in
436,000 to one in 766,000.The aggregates from which these results
are deduced are so enormous, rising into the thousands of millions,
that a certain degree of reliance can be placed on them.In the
case of Massachusetts, however, the entire period during which the
statistics are entitled to the slightest weight includes only eight
years, 1872-9, and offers an aggregate of but 274,000,000 journeys,
or but about forty per cent.of those included in the British
returns of the single year 1878.During these years the killed in
Massachusetts were one in each 13,000,000 and the injured one in
each 1,230,000;--or, while the killed in the two cases were very
nearly in the same proportion,--respectively one in 14.5, and one in
13, speaking in millions,--the British injured were really three to
one of the Massachusetts.The equality as respects the killed in this comparison, and the
marked discrepancy as respects the injured is calculated at first
sight to throw doubts on the fullness of the Massachusetts returns.There seems no good reason why the injured should in the one case
be so much more numerous than in the other.This, however, is
susceptible on closer examination of a very simple and satisfactory
explanation.In case of accident the danger of sustaining slight
personal injury is not so great in Massachusetts as in Great
Britain.This is due to the heavier and more solid construction
of the American passenger coaches, and their different interior
arrangement.This fact, and the real cause of the large number of
slightly injured,--"shaken" they call it,--in the English railroad
accidents is made very apparent in the following extract from Mr.Calcroft's report for 1877;--

     "It is no doubt a fact that collisions and other accidents to
     railway trains are attended with less serious consequences
     in proportion to the solidity of construction of passenger
     carriages.The accomodation and internal arrangements of
     third-class carriages, however, especially those used in
     ordinary trains, are defective as regards safety and comfort,
     as compared with many carriages of the same class on foreign
     railways.The first-class passenger, except when thrown against
     his opposite companion, or when some luggage falls upon him, is
     generally saved from severe contusion by the well-stuffed or
     padded linings of the carriages; whilst the second-class and
     third-class passenger is generally thrown with violence against
     the hard wood-work.If the second and third-class carriages
     had a high padded back lining, extending above the head of the
     passenger, it would probably tend to lesson the danger to life
     and limb which, as the returns of accidents show, passengers
     in carriages of this class are much exposed to in train
     accidents."[28]

 [28] _General Report to the Board of Trade upon the accidents which
  have occurred on the Railways of the United Kingdom during the year
  1877, p.37._

In 1878 the passenger journeys made in the second and third class
carriages of the United Kingdom were thirteen to one of those made
in first class carriages;--or, expressed in millions, there were
but 41 of the latter to 523 of the former.There can be very little
question indeed that if, during the last ten years, thirteen out
of fourteen of the passengers on Massachusetts railroads had been
carried in narrow compartments with wooden seats and unlined sides
the number of those returned as slightly injured in the numerous
accidents which occurred would have been at least three-fold larger
than it was.If it had not been ten-fold larger it would have been
surprising.The foregoing comparison, relates however, simply to passengers
killed in accidents for which they are in no degree responsible.When, however, the question reverts to the general cost in life
and limb at which the railroad systems are worked and the railroad
traffic is carried on to the entire communities served, the
comparison is less favorable to Massachusetts.Taking the eight
years of 1871-8, the British returns include 30,641 cases of injury,
and 9,113 of death; while those of Massachusetts for the same
years included 1,165 deaths, with only 1,044 cases of injury; in
the one case a total of 39,745 casualties, as compared with 2,209
the other.It will, however be noticed that while in the British
returns the cases of injury are nearly three-fold those of death, in
the Massachusetts returns the deaths exceed the cases of injury.This fact in the present case cannot but throw grave suspicion
on the completeness of the Massachusetts returns.As a matter of
practical experience it is well known that cases of injury almost
invariably exceed those of death, and the returns in which the
disproportion is greatest, if no sufficient explanation presents
itself, are probably the most full and reliable.Taking, therefore,
the deaths in the two cases as the better basis for comparison, it
will be found that the roads of Great Britain in the grand result
accomplished seventeen-fold the work of those of Massachusetts with
less than eight times as many casualties; had the proportion between
the results accomplished and the fatal injuries inflicted been
maintained, but 536 deaths instead of 1,165 would have appeared in
the Massachusetts returns.The reason of this difference in result
is worth looking for, and fortunately the statistical tables are
in both cases carried sufficiently into detail to make an analysis
possible; and this analysis, when made, seems to indicate very
clearly that while, for those directly connected with the railroads,
either as passengers or as employés, the Massachusetts system
in its working involves relatively a less degree of danger than
that of Great Britain, yet for the outside community it involves
very much more.Take, for instance, the two heads of accidents
at grade-crossings and accidents to trespassers, which have been
already referred to.In Great Britain highway grade-crossings
are discouraged.The results of the policy pursued may in each case be read
with sufficient distinctness in the bills of mortality.During the
years 1872-7, of 1,929 casualties to persons on the railroads of
Massachusetts, no less than 200 occurred at highway grade crossings.Had the accidents of this description in Great Britain been equally
numerous in proportion to the larger volume of the traffic of that
country, they would have resulted in over 3,000 cases of death or
personal injury; they did in fact result in 586 such cases.In
Massachusetts, again, to walk at will on any part of a railroad
track is looked upon as a sort of prescriptive and inalienable
right of every member of the community, irrespective of age, sex,
color, or previous condition of servitude.Accordingly, during the
six years referred to, this right was exercised at the cost of life
or limb to 591 persons,--one in four of all the casualties which
occurred in connection with the railroad system.In Great Britain
the custom of using the tracks of railroads as a foot-path seems to
exist, but, so far from being regarded as a right, it is practiced
in perpetual terror of the law.Accordingly, instead of some 9,000
cases of death or injury from this cause during these six years,
which would have been the proportion under like conditions in
Massachusetts, the returns showed only 2,379.These two are among
the most constant and fruitful causes of accident in connection with
the railroad system of America.In great Britain their proportion
to the whole number of casualties which take place is scarcely a
seventh part of what it is in Massachusetts.Here they constitute
very nearly fifty per cent.of all the accidents which occur; there
they constitute but a little over seven.There is in this comparison
a good deal of solid food for legislative thought, if American
legislators would but take it in; for this is one matter the public
policy in regard to which can only be fixed by law.When we pass from Great Britain to the continental countries of
Europe, the difficulties in the way of any fair comparison of
results become greater and greater.The statistics do not enter
sufficiently into detail, nor is the basis of computation apparent.It is generally conceded that, where a due degree of caution is
exercised by the passenger, railroad traveling in continental
countries is attended with a much less degree of danger than in
England.When we come to the returns, they hardly bear out this
conclusion; at least to the degree commonly supposed.Nowhere is human life more carefully guarded than in
that country; yet their returns show that of 866,000,000 passengers
transported on the French railroads during the eleven years 1859-69,
no less than 65 were killed and 1,285 injured from causes beyond
their control; or one in each 13,000,000 killed as compared with one
in 10,700,000 in Great Britain; and one in every 674,000 injured
as compared with one in each 330,000 in the other country.During
the single year 1859, about 111,000,000 passengers were carried
on the French lines, at a general cost to the community of 2,416
casualties, of which 295 were fatal.In Massachusetts, during the
four years 1871-74, about 95,000,000 passengers were carried, at
a reported cost of 1,158 casualties.This showing might well be
considered favorable to Massachusetts did not the single fact that
her returns included more than twice as many deaths as the French,
with only a quarter as many injuries, make it at once apparent that
the statistics were at fault.Under these circumstances comparison
could only be made between the numbers of deaths reported; which
would indicate that, in proportion to the work done, the railroad
operations of Massachusetts involved about twice and a half more
cases of injury to life and limb than those of the French service.As respects Great Britain the comparison is much more favorable, the
returns showing an almost exactly equal general death-rate in the
two countries in proportion to their volumes of traffic; the volume
of Great Britain being about four times that of France, while its
death-rate by railroad accidents was as 1,100 to 295.With the exception of Belgium, however, in which country the
returns cover only the lines operated by the state, the basis
hardly exists for a useful comparison between the dangers of injury
from accident on the continental railroads and on those of Great
Britain and America.The several systems are operated on wholly
different principles, to meet the needs of communities between
whose modes of life and thought little similarity exists.The
continental trains are far less crowded than either the English or
the American, and, when accidents occur, fewer persons are involved
in them.The movement, also, goes on under much stricter regulation
and at lower rates of speed, so that there is a grain of truth in
the English sarcasm that on a German railway "it almost seems as
if beer-drinking at the stations were the principal business, and
traveling a mere accessory."Limiting, therefore, the comparison to the railroads of Great
Britain, it remains to be seen whether the evil reputation of the
American roads as respects accidents is wholly deserved.Is it
indeed true that the danger to a passenger's life and limbs is so
much greater in this country than elsewhere?--Locally, and so far
as Massachusetts at least is concerned, it certainly is not.How
is it with the country taken as a whole?--The lack of all reliable
statistics as respects this wide field of inquiry has already been
referred to.We do not know with
accuracy even the number of miles of road operated; much less the
number of passengers annually carried.As respects accidents, and
the deaths and injuries resulting therefrom, some information may be
gathered from a careful and very valuable, because the only record
which has been preserved during the last six years in the columns of
the _Railroad Gazette_.It makes, of course, no pretence at either
official accuracy or fullness, but it is as complete probably as
circumstances will permit of its being made.During the five years
1874-8 there have been included in this record 4,846 accidents,
resulting in 1,160 deaths and 4,650 cases of injury;--being an
average of 969 accidents a year, resulting in 232 deaths and 930
cases of injury.These it will be remembered are casualties directly
resulting either to passengers or employés from train accidents.No account is taken of injuries sustained by employés in the
ordinary operation of the roads, or by members of the community
not passengers.In Massachusetts the accidents to passengers and
employés constitute one-half of the whole, but a very small portion
of the injuries reported as sustained by either passengers or
employés are the consequence of train accidents,--not one in three
in the case of passengers or one in seven in that of employés.In
fact, of the 2,350 accidents to persons reported in Massachusetts
in the nine years 1870-8, but 271, or less than twelve per cent.,
belonged to the class alone included in the reports of the _Railroad
Gazette_.In England during the four years 1874-7 the proportion
was larger, being about twenty-five instead of twelve per cent.For
America at large the Massachusetts proportion is undoubtedly the
most nearly correct, and the probabilities would seem to be that
the annual average of injuries to persons incident to operating the
railroads of the United States is not less than 10,000, of which at
least 1,200 are due to train accidents.Of these about two-thirds
may be set down as sustained by passengers, or, approximately, 800 a
year.It remains to be ascertained what proportion this number bears to
the whole number carried.There are no reliable statistics on this
head any more than on the other.Nothing but an approximation of
the most general character is possible.The number of passengers
annually carried on the roads of a few of the states is reported
with more or less accuracy, and averaging these the result would
seem to indicate that there are certainly not more than 350,000,000
passengers annually carried on the roads of all the states.There
is something barbarous about such an approximation, and it is
disgraceful that at this late day we should in America be forced
to estimate the passenger movement on our railroads in much the
same way that we guess at the population of Africa.We are in this respect far in the rear of civilized
communities.Taking, however, 350,000,000 as a fair approximation
to our present annual passenger movement, it will be observed that
it is as nearly as may be half that of Great Britain.In Great
Britain, in 1878, there were 1,200 injuries to passengers from
accidents to trains, and 675 in 1877.The average of the last eight
years has been 1,226.If, therefore, the approximation of 800 a
year for America is at all near the truth, the percentage would seem
to be considerably larger than that arrived at from the statistics
of Great Britain.Meanwhile it is to be noted that while in Great
Britain about 25 cases of injury are reported to each one of death,
in America but four cases are reported to each death--a discrepancy
which is extremely suggestive.Perhaps, however, the most valuable
conclusion to be drawn from these figures is that in America we as
yet are absolutely without any reliable railroad statistics on this
subject at all.Taken as a whole, however, and under the most favorable showing,
it would seem to be a matter of fair inference that the dangers
incident to railroad traveling are materially greater in the United
States than in any country of Europe.How much greater is a question
wholly impossible to answer.So that when a statistical writer
undertakes to show, as one eminent European authority has done, that
in a given year on the American roads one passenger in every 286,179
was killed, and one in every 90,737 was injured, it is charitable
to suppose that in regard to America only is he indebted to his
imagination for his figures.Neither is it possible to analyze with any satisfactory degree of
precision the nature of the accidents in the two countries, with
a view to drawing inferences from them.Without attempting to do
so it maybe said that the English Board of Trade reports for the
last five years, 1874-8, include inquiries into 755 out of 11,585
accidents, the total number of every description reported as having
taken place.Meanwhile the _Railroad Gazette_ contains mention of
4,846 reported train accidents which occurred in America during
the same five years.Of these accidents, 1,310 in America and 81
in Great Britain were due to causes which were either unexplained
or of a miscellaneous character, or are not common to the systems
of the two countries.In so far as the remainder admitted of
classification, it was somewhat as follows:--

  [29] During these five years there were in Great Britain four cases
  of collision between locomotives or trains at level crossings of one
  railroad by another; in America there were 79.The probable cause of
  this discrepancy has already been referred to (_ante pp.The above record, though almost valueless for any purpose of exact
comparison, reveals, it will be noticed, one salient fact.Out of
755 English accidents, no less than 406 came under the head of
collisions--whether head collisions, rear collisions, or collisions
on sidings or at junctions.In other words, to collisions of some
sort between trains were due considerably more than half (54 per
cent.)of the accidents which took place in Great Britain, while
only 88, or less than 13 per cent.of the whole, were due to
derailments from all causes.In America on the other hand, while
of the 3,763 accidents recorded, 1,324, or but one-third part (35
per cent.)were due to collisions, no less than 586, or 24 per
cent., were classed under the head of derailments, due to defects
in the permanent way.During the the six years 1873-8 there were
in all 1698 cases of collision of every description between trains
reported as occurring in America to 1495 in the United Kingdom; but
while in America the derailments amounted to no less than 4016, or
more than twice the collisions, in the United Kingdom they were
but 817, or a little more than half their number.It has already
been noticed that the most disastrous accidents in America are apt
to occur on bridges, and Ashtabula and Tariffville at once suggest
themselves.Under the heading
of "Failures of Tunnels, Bridges, Viaducts or Culverts," there
were returned in that country during the six years 1873-8 only 29
accidents in all; while during the same time in America, under the
heads of broken bridges or tressels and open draws, the _Gazette_
recorded no less than 165.These figures curiously illustrate the
different manner in which the railroads of the two countries have
been constructed, and the different circumstances under which they
are operated.The English collisions are distinctly traceable to
constant overcrowding; the American derailments and bridge accidents
to inferior construction of our road-beds.Finally, what of late years has been done to diminish the dangers
of the rail?--What more can be done?--Few persons realize what a
tremendous pressure in this respect is constantly bearing down upon
those whose business it is to operate railroads.A great accident is
not only a terrible blow to the pride and prestige of a corporation,
not only does it practically ruin the unfortunate officials involved
in it, but it entails also portentous financial consequences.Juries
proverbially have little mercy for railroad corporations, and, when
a disaster comes, these have practically no choice but to follow the
scriptural injunction to settle with their adversaries quickly.The
Revere catastrophe, for instance, cost the railroad company liable
on account of it over half a million of dollars; the Ashtabula
accident over $600,000; the Wollaston over $300,000.A few years ago
in England a jury awarded a sum of $65,000 for damages sustained
through the death of a single individual.During the five years,
1867-71, the railroad corporations of Great Britain paid out over
$11,000,000 in compensation for damages occasioned by accidents.In
view, merely, of such money consequences of disaster, it would be
most unnatural did not each new accident lead to the adoption of
better appliances to prevent its recurrence.[30]

  [30] The other side of this proposition has been argued with
  much force by Mr.William Galt in his report as one of the Royal
  Commission of 1874 on Railway Accidents.Galt's individual
  report bears date February 5, 1877, and in it he asserts that, as
  a matter of actual experience, the principle of self-interest on
  the part of the railway companies has proved a wholly insufficient
  safeguard against accidents.However it may be in theory, he
  contends that, taking into consideration the great cost of the
  appliances necessary to insure safety to the public on the one side,
  and the amount of damages incident to a certain degree of risk on
  the other side, the possible saving in expenditure to the companies
  by assuming the risk far exceeds the loss incurred by an occasional
  accident.The companies become, in a word, insurers of their
  passengers,--the premium being found in the economies effected by
  not adopting improved appliances of recognized value, and the losses
  being the damages incurred in case of accident.He treats the whole
  subject at great length and with much knowledge and ability.His
  report is a most valuable compendium for those who are in favor of a
  closer government supervision over railroads as a means of securing
  an increased safety from accident.To return, however, to the subject of railroad accidents, and the
final conclusion to be drawn from the statistics which have been
presented.That conclusion briefly stated is that the charges of
recklessness and indifference so generally and so widely advanced
against those managing the railroads cannot for an instant be
sustained.After all, as was said in the beginning of the present
volume, it is not the danger but the safety of the railroad which
should excite our special wonder.If any one doubts this, it is
very easy to satisfy himself of the fact,--that is, if by nature
he is gifted with the slightest spark of imagination.It is but
necessary to stand once on the platform of a way-station and to
look at an express train dashing by.There are few sights finer;
few better calculated to quicken the pulse.The glare of the head-light, the rush and throb of the
locomotive,--the connecting rod and driving-wheels of which seem
instinct with nervous life,--the flashing lamps in the cars, and
the final whirl of dust in which the red tail-lights vanish almost
as soon as they are seen,--all this is well calculated to excite
our admiration; but the special and unending cause for wonder is
how, in case of accident, anything whatever is left of the train.As it plunges into the darkness it would seem to be inevitable
that something must happen, and that, whatever happens, it must
necessarily involve both the train and every one in it in utter
and irremediable destruction.Here is a body weighing in the
neighborhood of two hundred tons, moving over the face of the earth
at a speed of sixty feet a second and held to its course only by two
slender lines of iron rails;--and yet it is safe!--We have seen how
when, half a century ago, the possibility of something remotely like
this was first discussed, a writer in the _British Quarterly_ earned
for himself a lasting fame by using the expression that "We should
as soon expect people to suffer themselves to be fired off upon
one of Congreve's _ricochet_ rockets, as to trust themselves to the
mercy of such a machine, going at such a rate;"--while Lord Brougham
exclaimed that "the folly of seven hundred people going fifteen
miles an hour, in six trains, exceeds belief."At the time they
wrote, the chances were ninety-nine in a hundred that both reviewer
and correspondent were right; and yet, because reality, not for the
first nor the last time, saw fit to outstrip the wildest flights of
imagination, the former at least blundered, by being prudent, into
an immortality of ridicule.The thing, however, is still none the
less a miracle because it is with us matter of daily observation.That, indeed, is the most miraculous part of it.At all hours of the
day and of the night, during every season of the year, this movement
is going on.It depends for its even action
on every conceivable contingency, from the disciplined vigilance
of thousands of employés to the condition of the atmosphere, the
heat of an axle, or the strength of a nail.The vast machine is in
constant motion, and the derangement of a single one of a myriad of
conditions may at any moment occasion one of those inequalities of
movement which are known as accidents.Yet at the end of the year,
of the hundreds of millions of passengers fewer have lost their
lives through these accidents than have been murdered in cold blood.Not without reason, therefore, has it been asserted that, viewing
at once the speed, the certainty, and the safety with which the
intricate movement of modern life is carried on, there is no more
creditable monument to human care, human skill, and human foresight
than the statistics of railroad accidents.Abergele, accident at, 72.Accidents, railroad, about stations, 166.

Transcriber's note: The following has been moved from the beginning
of the book to the end.=By the same Author.=


=Railroads and Railroad Questions.= 12mo, cloth, $1 25.The volume
treats of "The Genesis of the Railroad System," "Accidents," and
the "Present Railroad Problem."The author has made himself the
acknowledged authority on this group of subjects.If his book goes
only to those who are interested in the ownership, the use, or the
administration of railroads, it is sure of a large circle of readers.--_Railway World._

"Characterized by broad, progressive, liberal ideas."--_Railway
Review._

"The entire conclusions are of great value."--_N.Y."Who art thou, and what
monstrous burden is this thou carriest so lightly?"said the boy, speaking in an awestruck whisper, "speak not so
loud, friend!The sentinel recoiled, and stared in dismay at the dark bundle."His Celestial Majesty," replied Chop-Chin, "threw it in anger at his
Putter-on-of-Slippers yesterday, and broke one of its legs.All day my
master, the Chief Cabinet-maker, has been at work on it, and now he has
sent me with it by nightfall, that no profane eye may see clearly even
the outer covering of the sacred object.""Pass in," said the sentinel, opening the gate."But tell me, knowest
thou how it will fare with the Putter-on-of-Slippers?He is cousin to my
stepfather's aunt by marriage, and I would not that aught of ill should
befall so near a relative."I know not," said the boy, hastening forward."I fear it may go
hard with him."The sentinel shook his head sadly, and resumed his walk; while Chop-Chin
crept softly through the court-yard, keeping close to the wall, and
feeling as he went along for a certain little door he knew of, which led
by a staircase cut in the thickness of the wall to a certain unused
closet, near the Celestial Bed-chamber.While all this was going on, the Emperor of China, the great and mighty
Wah-Song, was going to bed.He had sipped his night-draught of hot wine
mingled with honey and spices, sitting on the edge of the Celestial Bed,
with the Celestial Nightcap of cloth-of-silver tied comfortably under
his chin, and the Celestial Dressing-gown wrapped around him.He had
scolded the Chief Pillow-thumper because the pillows were not fat
enough, and because there were only ten of them instead of twelve.He
had boxed the ears of the Tyer-of-the-Strings-of-the-Nightcap, and had
thrown his golden goblet at the Principal Pourer, who brought him the
wine.And when all these things were done, his Celestial Majesty
Wah-Song got into bed, and was tucked in by the Finishing Toucher, who
got his nose well tweaked by way of thanks.Then the taper of perfumed
wax was lighted, and the shade of alabaster put over it, and then the
other lights were extinguished; and then the attendants all crawled out
backwards on their hands and knees, and shut the door after them; and
then His Celestial Majesty went to sleep.[Illustration: At last the Emperor began to dream.He heard an awful
voice, the voice of the Golden Dragon.Peacefully the Emperor slept,--one hour, two hours, three
hours,--discoursing eloquently the while in the common language of
mankind,--the language of the nose.At last he began to dream,--a
dreadful dream.He was in the Golden Temple, praying before the Jewelled
Shrine.He heard an awful voice,--the voice of the Golden Dragon.It
called his name; it glared upon him with its ruby eyes; it lifted its
crowned head, and stretched its long talons toward him.The
Emperor tried to scream, but he could make no sound.Once more the
dreadful voice was heard:--

"Wah-Song!The Emperor sprang up in bed, and looked about him with eyes wild with
terror.what was that?--that glittering form standing at the foot of
his bed; that crowned head raised high as if in anger; those glaring
red eyes fixed menacingly upon him!With one long howl of terror and anguish, His Celestial Majesty Wah-Song
rolled off the bed and under it, in one single motion, and lay there
flat on his face, with his hands clasped over his head.Quaking in every
limb, his teeth chattering, and a cold sweat pouring from him, he
listened as the awful voice spoke again.said the Golden Dragon, "thou hast summoned me, and I am
here!""I--I--I sum-summon thee, most Golden and Holy Dragon?""May I be b-b-bastinadoed if I did!"said the Dragon, sternly, "and venture not to speak save when
I ask thee a question.Yesterday morning, in consequence of thine own
caprice in going out unannounced, thy silly shoes and thy pusillanimous
petticoat became wet.For this nothing, thou has condemned to death my
faithful servant Ly-Chee, who has brought me fresh melons every Tuesday
afternoon for thirty years.When others, less inhuman than thou,
interceded for his life, thou madest reply, 'We swear, that unless the
Golden Dragon himself come down from his altar and beg for this man's
life, he shall die!'"The Emperor groaned, and clawed the carpet in his anguish."Therefore, Wah-Song," continued the Dragon, "I AM HERE!I come not to
beg, but to command.I--I--didn't know he brought thee melons.I brought thee two dozen
pineapples myself, the other day," he added piteously."Thou didst,
_slave!_ and they were half-rotten.and he gave a little jump on
the floor, making his glittering tail wave, and his flaming eyes glared
yet more fiercely at the unfortunate Wah-Song, who clung yet more
closely to the carpet, and drummed on it with his heels in an extremity
of fear."Listen, now," said the Fiery Idol, "to my commands.Before day-break
thou wilt send a free pardon to Ly-Chee, who now lies in the prison of
the condemned, expecting to die at sunrise.""Moreover," continued the Dragon, "thou wilt send him, by a trusty
messenger, twenty bags of goodly ducats, one for every hour that he has
spent in prison."The Emperor moaned feebly, for he loved his goodly ducats."Furthermore, thou wilt make Ly-Chee thy Chief Sweeper for life, with
six brooms of gilded straw, with ivory handles, as his yearly
perquisite, besides three dozen pairs of scrubbing-shoes; and his son,
Chop-Chin, shalt thou appoint as Second Sweeper, to help his father."The Emperor moaned again, but very faintly, for he dared not make any
objection."Obey them strictly and
speedily, and thine offence may be pardoned.Neglect them, even in the
smallest particular, and--Ha!Wurra-_wurra_-G-R-R-R-R-R-R!"and
here the Dragon opened his great red mouth, and uttered so fearful a
growl that the miserable Emperor lost hold of such little wits as had
remained to him, and fainted dead away.Ten minutes later, the sentinel at the gate was amazed at the sight of
the Chief Cabinet-maker's apprentice, reappearing suddenly before him,
with his monstrous burden still in his arms.The boy's hair was
dishevelled, and his face was very pale.In truth, it had been very hard
work to get in and out of the hollow golden monster, and Chop-Chin was
well-nigh exhausted by his efforts, and the great excitement which had
nerved him to carry out his bold venture.said Chop-Chin, "alas!Was it my fault that
the mended leg was a hair-breadth shorter than the others?Good soldier,
I have been most grievously belabored, even with the Sacred Footstool
itself, which, although it be a great honor, is nevertheless a painful
one.And now must I take it back to my master, for it broke again the
last time His Celestial Majesty brought it down on my head.Wherefore
let me pass, good sentinel, for I can hardly stand for weariness.""And yet--stay a
moment!thinkest thou that aught would be amiss if I were to take just
one peep at the Celestial Footstool?Often have I heard of its
marvellous workmanship, and its tracery of pearl and ebony.Do but lift
one corner of the mantle, good youth, and let me see at least a leg of
the wonder.""Knowest
thou not that the penalty is four hundred lashes?Not a single glance
have I ventured to cast at it, for they say its color changes if any
profane eye rest upon its polished surface.""Pass on, then, in the name of the Dragon!"said the sentinel, opening
the gate; and bidding him a hasty good-night, Chop-Chin hurried away
into the darkness.*       *       *       *       *

Now, while all this was going on, it chanced that the four priests of
the First Order of the Saki-Pan awoke from their slumber.What their
feelings were when they lifted their eyes and saw that the Golden Dragon
was gone, is beyond my power to tell.Their terror was so extreme that
they did not dare to move, but after the first horrified glance at the
bare altar flung themselves flat on their faces again, and howled and
moaned in their anguish.they cried, in a doleful chant of misery."Yea, verily slept
we.we know not why;
     Wow!Thou raisedst the paw of strength and the
hind-feet of swiftness.Because we slept, thou hast gone away, and we
are desolate, awaiting the speedily-advancing death.Punka-wunka-woggle!Punka-wunka-wogg!"While thus the wretched priests lay on the golden floor, bewailing their
sin and its dreadful consequences, there fell suddenly on their ears a
loud and heavy sound.It was at some distance,--a heavy clang, as of
some one striking on metal.And now came
other sounds,--the opening and shutting of gates, the tread of hasty
feet, the sound of hurried voices, and finally a loud knocking at the
door of the Temple itself."Open, most holy Priests of the Saki-Pan!""We have
strange and fearful news!The unhappy priests hurried to the door, and flung it open with
trembling hands.Without stood all the guards of all the gates, the
white and the steel-clad soldiers clustering about the four black-clad
guardians of the outer gate.said the chief priest in great agitation, "what is your
errand?"said the black guards, trembling with excitement, "we heard
a great knocking at the gate."cried the priest, "I know it.said the guards, "we were affrighted, so great was the
noise; so we opened the gate but a little way, and peeped through; and
we saw--we saw--" They paused, and gasped for breath.shrieked the priest, "_what_ did you see?""He
is sitting up--on his hind-legs--with his mouth open!and he knocked--he
knocked--"

But the priests of the Saki-Pan waited to hear no more.Rushing through
the court-yards, they flung wide open the great bronze gates.They
caught up the Golden Dragon, they raised it high on their shoulders, and
with shouts of rejoicing they bore it back to the Temple, while the
guards prostrated themselves before it."He walked abroad, for the glory and
welfare of his subjects.He cast upon the city the eye of beneficence;
he waved over it the plenipotentiary tail!Glory to the Holy Dragon, and happiness and peace to the city and the
people!"*       *       *       *       *

But in the house of Ly-Chee all was sunshine and rejoicing.At daybreak
a procession had come down the little street,--a troop of soldiers in
the imperial uniform, with music sounding before them, and gay banners
flaunting in the morning air.In the midst of the troop rode Ly-Chee, on
a splendid black horse.He was dressed in a robe of crimson satin
embroidered with gold, and round his neck hung strings of jewels most
glorious to see.Behind him walked twenty slaves, each carrying a fat
bag of golden ducats; and after the troop came more slaves, bearing
gilded brooms with ivory handles and scrubbing-shoes of the finest
quality.And all the soldiers and all the slaves cried aloud,
continually:--

"Honor to Ly-Chee, the Chief-Sweeper of the court-yard!Honor and peace
to him and all his house!"The procession stopped before the little house, and the good sweeper,
stupefied still with astonishment at his wonderful good fortune,
dismounted and clasped his wife and children in his arms.And they wept
together for joy, and the soldiers and the slaves and all the people
wept with them.But the Celestial Emperor, Wah-Song, lay in bed for two weeks, speaking
to no man, and eating nothing but water-gruel.And when he arose, at the
end of that time, behold!he was as meek as a six-years old child.THE grandmother's story was received with great approbation, and the
different members of the family commented on it, each after his fashion."I should like to have been Chop-Chin!"Only think, <DW53>, of talking to the Emperor in that way,
and scolding him as if he were a little boy.""Well, I never saw an Emperor," said the raccoon; "but I certainly
should not wish to talk to one, if they are all such wretched creatures
as Wah-Song._I_ should like to have been the Finishing-Toucher; then if
he had pulled _my_ nose--hum!"Dear Madam," said the bear, who had been staring meditatively into the
fire, "there is one thing in the story that I do not understand; that
is--well--you spoke of the boy's having a pig-tail.""A Chinese pig-tail, you know.""A Chinese pig's tail it would naturally
be.Now, I confess I do not see _how_ a pig's tail could be worn on the
head, or how it could be unbraided; that is, if the Chinese pigs have
tails like that of our friend in the sty yonder."Toto laughed aloud at this, and even the grandmother could not help
smiling a very little; but she gently told Bruin what a Chinaman's
pig-tail was, and how he wore it.Meantime, Miss Mary, the parrot,
looked on with an air of dignified amusement."My respected father," she said presently, "spent some years in China.It is a fine country, though too far from Africa for my taste.""Tell us about your father, Miss Mary!""Fine
old bird he must have been, eh?"replied the parrot, with some emotion.His beak, which I am said to have inherited, was the envy of every
parrot in Central Africa.He could whistle in nine languages, and his
tail--but as the famous poet Gabblio has sweetly sung,--

    "'All languages and tongues must fail,
      In speaking of Polacko's tail.'"Polacko was my father's name," she explained."But how came he to go to China?""He was captured, my dear, and taken there when very young.He lived
there for twenty years, with one of the chief mandarins of the empire.He led a happy life, with a perch and ring of ebony and silver, the
freedom of the house, and chow-chow four times a day.At last, however,
the young grandson of the mandarin insisted upon my father's learning to
eat with chopsticks.The lofty spirit of Polacko could not brook this
outrage, and the door being left open one day he flew away and made his
way to Africa, the home of his infancy, where he passed the rest of his
life.I drop a tear," added Miss Mary, raising her claw gracefully to
her eyes, "to his respected memory."Nobody saw the tear, but all looked grave and sympathetic, and the
good-natured bear said, "Quite right, I'm sure.But now the grandmother rose and folded up her knitting."Dear friends, and Toto, boy," she said, "it is bed-time, now, for the
clock has struck nine.Good-night, and pleasant dreams to you all.My
good Bruin, you will cover the fire, and lock up the house?""Trust me for that, dear Madam!""Come, then, Cracker," said the old lady."Your basket is all ready for
you, and it is high time you were in it."And with the squirrel perched
on her shoulder she went into her own little room, closing the door
behind her.After exchanging mutual "good-nights," the other members of the family
sought their respective sleeping-places.The birds flew to their
perches, and each, tucking her head and one leg away in some mysterious
manner, became suddenly a very queer looking creature indeed."<DW53>," said Toto, "come and sleep on my bed, won't you?My feet were
cold, last night, and you do make such a delightful foot-warmer."It won't be
as warm for _me_ as my basket, though no doubt it would be nice for
you.""I'll put the big blue dressing-gown over you," said Toto."You know you
like that, because you can put your nose in the pocket, and keep it
warm."Bruin now proceeded to rake the ashes over the fire, covering it neatly
and carefully.He filled the kettle; he drew the bolts of door and
windows; and finally, when all was snug and safe, the good bear laid
himself down on the hearth-rug, and soon was fast asleep.Outside, the snow still fell,
softly, steadily, silently.In the shed, Bridget, the cow, was sleeping
soundly, with a cock and three hens roosting on her back, according to
their invariable custom.In the warm, covered sty the pig also slept.He
had no name, the pig; he would have scorned one."I am a pig," he was wont to say, "and as such every one knows me.There
is no danger of my being mistaken for anything else."But though slumber held fast, apparently, all the dwellers in cottage,
shed, and sty, there were in reality two pairs of eyes which were
particularly wide-awake at this moment.They were very black eyes, very
bright eyes, and they were, if you wish to know, peeping into the
kitchen through the crack under the cellar-door, to see what they could
see."Do you think we can get through the crack?"And the next moment they were in the kitchen.It was nearly dark, but not quite, for the covered embers still sent out
a dusky glow.It was warm; the floor was smooth and flat; there was a
smell as if there might be something to eat, somewhere.Altogether, it
was a very pleasant place for two little mice to play in; and as they
had it all to themselves, why should they not play?Play they did,
therefore, with right good-will; scampering hither and thither, rolling
over and over each other, poking their little sharp noses into every
crack and cranny they could find.how pleasant the dry, warm air, after their damp cellar-home!Playing and romping
is hungry work, and the two little brown mouse-stomachs are empty.It
seems to come from under that cupboard door.The crack is wide enough to
let out the smell, but not quite wide enough to let in Messrs.If they could enlarge it a bit, now, with the sharp little
tools which they always carry in their mouths!It is very fatiguing work;
but, see!If one made oneself _very_ small, now?It is
done, and the two mice find themselves in the immediate neighborhood of
a large piece of squash pie.too great for speech
or squeak, but just right for attack.and soon the plate shines white and empty, with only the smell of the
roses--I mean the pie--clinging round it still.There is nothing else to
eat in the cupboard, is there?what is this paper package which
smells so divinely, sending a warm, spicy, pungent fragrance through the
air?pie was good, but this will be better!Nibble through the paper
quickly, and then-- Alas!the spicy fragrance means _ginger_, and
it is not only warm, but _hot_.fire is
in our mouths, in our noses, our throats, our little brown stomachs, now
only too well filled.or we die, and never see our cool,
beloved cellar again.Hurry down from the shelf, creep through the
crack, rush frantically round the kitchen.Surely there is a smell of
water?there it is, in that tin basin, yonder.Into it we go,
splashing, dashing, drinking in the silver coolness, washing this fiery
torment from our mouths and throats.Thoroughly sobered by this adventure, the two little mice sat on the
floor beside the basin, dripping and shivering, the water trickling from
their long tails, their short ears, their sharp-pointed noses.They
blinked sadly at each other with their bright black eyes."Shall we go home now, Scrabble?""It is late, and Mother
Mouse will be looking for us.""I'm so c-c-c-cold!"shivered Scrabble, who a moment before had been
devoured by burning heat."Don't you think we might dry ourselves before
that fire before we go down?"replied Squeak, "we will.But--what is that great black thing in
front of the fire?"Shall
we climb over it, or go round it?""The exercise will help to warm
us; and it is such a queer-looking hill, I want to explore it."So they began to climb up the vast black mass, which occupied the whole
space in front of the fireplace."Because it is near the fire, stupid!""And what is this tall black stuff that grows so thick all over it?It
isn't a bit like grass, or trees either.""It _is_ grass, of course, stupid!"Scrabble," said little brown Squeak, stopping short, "you may call me
stupid as much as you please, but _I_ don't like this place.I--I--I
think it is moving.""_Moving?_" said little brown Scrabble, in a tone of horror.And then the two little mice clutched each other with their little paws,
and wound their little tails round each other, and held on tight, tight,
for the black mass _was_ moving!There was a long, stretching,
undulating movement, slow but strong; and then came a quick, violent,
awful shake, which sent the two brothers slipping, sliding, tumbling
headlong to the floor.Picking themselves up as well as they could, and
casting one glance back at the black hill, they rushed shrieking and
squeaking to the cellar-door, and literally flung themselves through the
crack.For in that glance they had seen a vast red cavern, a yawning
gulf of fire, open suddenly in the black mass, which was now heaving and
shuddering all over.And from this fiery cavern came smoke and flame (at
least so the mice said when they got home to the maternal hole), and an
awful roaring sound, which shook the whole house and made the windows
rattle.and never, never,
will we leave our cellar again!"But Bruin sat up on his haunches, and scratched himself and stretched
himself, and gave another mighty yawn."Haw-wa-wow-you-_wonk_!""Those must have been very
lively fleas, to wake me out of a sound sleep.I wonder where they have
crept to!And stretching his huge length once more along the floor, Bruin slept
again.AT dinner the next day, it was noticed that <DW53> was very melancholy.He
shook his head frequently, and sighed so deeply and sorrowfully that the
kind heart of the wood-pigeon was moved to pity."Are you not well, my dear <DW53>?""Something has gone amiss
with you, evidently.The raccoon shook his head again, and looked unutterably doleful."I knew how it would be, <DW53>," said the bear."You shouldn't have eaten
that third pie for supper.Two pies are enough for anybody, after such a
quantity of bread and honey and milk as you had."<DW53> sighed again, more deeply than before."I _didn't_ eat it all," he said; "I only wish I had!""Why, <DW53>," queried Toto, "what's the trouble?""Well," said <DW53>, "there was a piece left.I couldn't eat any more, so
I put it away in the cupboard, thinking I would have it for lunch
to-day.I never saw such a squash pie as that
was, anyhow, and that piece--"

He paused, and seemed lost in the thought of the pie."_Well!_" exclaimed Toto."So you _did_ eat it for your lunch, and now
you are unhappy because you didn't keep it for dinner.replied the other, "not at all!I trust I am not _greedy_,
Toto, _whatever_ my faults may be.I went to get it for my luncheon, for
I had been working all the morning like a--"

"Dormouse!"murmured the squirrel, the bear, and Toto,
simultaneously."I can say no more than that;
and I was desperately hungry.I went to the cupboard to get my piece of
pie, and it was--gone!"exclaimed the grandmother; "why, who can have taken it?""It was some small creature, for
it got in through the crack under the cupboard door, gnawing away the
wood.I have examined the marks," he added, "and they are the marks of
small, very sharp teeth.""What do you mean by looking at me in that way?"demanded little
Cracker, whisking his tail fiercely, and bristling all over."I've a
good mind to bite your ears with my sharp teeth.If you say I did, I'll throw this cheese--"

"Cracker!said the grandmother, gently, "you forget yourself!I am sure," she added, as Cracker hung
his head and looked much ashamed, "that none of us think seriously for a
moment that you took the pie.<DW53> loves his joke; but he has a good
heart, and he would not really give you pain, I know.Am I not right, <DW53>?"It is only justice to the raccoon to say that he was rather abashed at
this.He rubbed his nose, and gave a deprecatory wink at Bruin, who was
looking very serious; then, recovering himself, he beamed expansively on
the squirrel, who still looked fierce, though respect for "Madam" kept
him silent."Dear Madam, do I _ever_ mean
anything,--anything unkind, at least?"he added hastily, as Toto looked
up with a suppressed chuckle."I beg your pardon, Cracker, my boy, and I
hope you won't bear malice.As for those marks--"

"Those marks," interrupted the bear, who had risen from his seat and was
examining the cupboard door, "were made by mice."So am I," said Miss Mary, quietly."Two brown mice," said Miss Mary, "came out from under the cellar-door
about midnight.They gnawed at the cupboard till they had made the crack
wide enough to pass through.Then I heard them say, 'Squash pie!'and
heard them nibbling, or rather gobbling.After a while they came rushing
out as if the cat were after them, and jumped into the water-basin.Then
they tried to climb up Bruin's back, but he yawned like an alligator,
and shook them off, and they ran hurry-scurry under the cellar-door
again."A great laugh broke out at this recital of Messrs.Squeak and Scrabble's
nocturnal adventure, and under cover of the laughter the raccoon
approached the parrot."Why didn't you give the alarm," he asked, "or drive off the mice
yourself?You knew it was my pie, for you saw me put it there."Miss Mary cocked her bright yellow eye at him expressively."I lost two feathers from my tail, yesterday," she said."Somebody bit
them off while I was asleep.They were fine feathers, and I cannot
replace them."At length--

"Miss Mary," said the raccoon aloud, "what was the color of your
lamented husband?You told us once, but I am ashamed to say I'm not
positive that I remember."replied Miss Mary, in some surprise,--"a remarkably fine
emerald green."That explains his
choice of a wife.--Walk, Toto, did you say?and
in three bounds he was out of the door, and leaping and frolicking about
in the new-fallen snow.Toto caught up his cap and followed him, and the two together made their
way out of the yard, and walked, ran, leaped, jumped, tumbled,
scrambled, toward the forest.The sky had cleared, and the sun shone
brilliantly on the fresh white world.On every hand lay the snow,--here
heaped and piled in fantastic drifts and strange half-human shapes;
there spread smooth, like a vast counterpane.The tall trees of the
forest bent under white feathery masses, which came tumbling down on
Toto and his companion, as they lightly pushed the branches aside and
entered the woods.It is always a good thing for any one who
has eyes in his head, but it is especially good when you see all that
<DW53> and Toto saw; when you know, from every tiny track or footmark,
what little creatures have been running or hopping about; when many of
these little creatures are your friends, and all of them at least
acquaintances.how soft and powdery and
generally delightful the snow!What a pleasant world it was, on the
whole!said the raccoon, stopping and looking about him."It is
just about here that Chucky's aunt lives.You see
that oak-stump yonder, with the moss on it?Well, her burrow is just
under that.Suppose we give her a call, and tell her how her hopeful
nephew is."said Toto, "she is as fast asleep as he is, of course.We
couldn't wake her if we tried, and why should we try?""Might have a game of ball with her," suggested the raccoon."But I
don't know that it's worth while, after all.""Who lives in that hollow tree, now?""The wild-cat used to
live there, you know.It is a very comfortable tree, if I remember
right.""You found it so once, didn't you, Toto?""Do you remember
that day, when a thunder-shower came up, and you crept into that hollow
tree for shelter?_do_ you remember that day, my boy?""I am not likely to
forget it.It was raining guns and pitchforks, and the lightning was
cracking and zigzagging all through the forest, it seemed, and the
thunder crashing and bellowing and roaring--"

"Like Bruin, when the bumble-bee stung his nose!""There I was, curled up well in the hollow,
thinking how lucky I was, when suddenly came two green eyes glowering at
me, and a great spitting and spluttering and meowling.'F-s-s-s-s-yeh-yow-s-s-s-s-s-s!"'My dear Madam,' I said, 'it is really more than you can expect.You
are already thoroughly wet, and if you come here you will only drip all
over the nice dry hole and spoil it.Now, _I_ am quite dry; and to tell
you the truth, I mean to remain so.'"'My name is Klawtobitz!''I have lived in this tree for
seven years, and I am not going to be turned out of it by a thing with
two legs and no tail.cried I, getting angry in my turn.'I wouldn't have a
tail if I was paid for it; and I will _not_ leave this hole!'"And then the old cat humped her back, and grinned till I saw every
tooth in her head, and came flying at me,--claws spread, and tail as big
round as my arm.There we fought, tooth and nail, fist and claw, till we
were both out of breath.Finally I got her by the throat, and she made
her teeth meet in my arm, and there we both were.I had heard no noise
save the cat's screeching in my ear; but now, suddenly, a great growly
voice, close beside us, cried,--

"'Fair play!"We both dropped our hold, and looking up, saw--"

"Bruin and me!""We were taking a
quiet prowl in the rain, and hearing the scuffle, stopped to see what
was going on.Such a pretty fight I had not seen in a long time, and it
was really too bad of Bruin to stop it.How old Ma'am Wildcat's tail
went down, though, when she saw him!""I am very glad he did stop it," said Toto."I was quite a little chap
then, you see,--only seven years old,--and it was going hard with me.I
was frightened enough, though, I can tell you, when I saw Bruin standing
there.He looked as big as an elephant, and I fully expected to be eaten
up the next minute.But he said, in his great hearty voice,--

"'Give us your paw, my little fighting-cock!I gave you warning a week ago, when you killed the wood-pigeon's
nestlings.Off with you, now, quick, or--'"

"And she went!""Oh, yes, my dear, she went!I chased that cat for ten miles, to the very farthest end of
the forest.She had the start of me, and kept it pretty well, but I was
just overhauling her when we came to the open; she gave a flying leap
from the last tree, and went crash through the window of a farmhouse
which stood close at hand!I thought she would probably be attended to
there; so I went back, and found Bruin and you as sociable and friendly
as if you had been brought up in the same den,--you sitting in the hole,
with your funny red legs hanging out (you were the queerest-looking
animal I had ever seen, Toto!Sandra travelled to the office.), and he sitting up on his haunches,
talking to you.""Don't you remember,
<DW53>?That was the first time I had ever seen any of you people, and I
was dreadfully afraid that I should be the supper myself.But we went to
his den, and had a jolly supper.Bruin ate three large watermelons, I
remember.He _said_ a man gave them to him.""I think it very likely that he did," said <DW53>, "if Bruin asked him.""And I showed you how to play leap-frog," continued Toto; "and we played
it over Bruin's back till it was time for me to go home.And then you
both walked with me to the edge of the forest, and there we swore
eternal friendship."said the raccoon, "that we did, my boy; and well have we kept the
vow!And so long as <DW53>'s tail has a single hair in it, will he ever
cherish-- Hello!he cried with a sudden start, as a tiny
brown creature darted swiftly across the path.stop a minute; you are just the fellow I want to see."The woodmouse stopped and turned round, and greeted the two friends
cordially."I haven't seen you for an age!""<DW53>, I supposed you had been
asleep for a couple of months, at least.How does it happen that you are
prowling about at this season?"<DW53> briefly explained the state of the case, and then added:--

"I am specially glad to meet you, Woodmouse, for I want to consult you
about something.There are some mice in the cellar of the
cottage,--brown mice.Very troublesome, thieving creatures they are, and
we want to get rid of them.Now, I suppose they are relatives of yours,
eh?"well--yes," the woodmouse admitted reluctantly."Distant, you
know, quite distant; but--a--yes, they _are_ relatives.A wretched,
disreputable set, I have heard, though I never met any of them.""They are a
great annoyance to the Madam, and to all of us.They almost take the
food out of our mouths; they destroy things in the cellar, and--and in
fact, we want to get rid of them."The woodmouse stared at him in amazement.<DW53>," he said,
laughing, "I should not have supposed, from my past acquaintance with
you, that you would have any difficulty in getting rid of them."Raccoons cannot blush, or our <DW53> certainly would have done so.He
rubbed his nose helplessly, somewhat after the fashion of Bruin, and
cast a half-comical, half-rueful glance at Toto.Finally he replied,--

"Well, you see, Woodmouse, things are rather different from usual this
winter.The fact is, our Madam has a strong objection to--a--in point of
fact, to slaughter; and she made it a condition of our coming to spend
the winter with her, that we should not kill other creatures unless it
were necessary.So I thought if we _could_ get rid of those mice in any
other way, it would please her.I suppose there is plenty of room in the
forest for another family of mice?"as far as room goes," replied the woodmouse, "they have a range of
ten miles in which to choose their home.I cannot promise to call on
them, you know; that could not be expected.But if they behave
themselves, they may in time overcome the prejudice against them.""Very well," said <DW53>, "I shall send them, then.he added, "and what is going on in your set?"Now it was the woodmouse's turn to look confused."My son is to be married on the second evening after this," he said."That is the only thing I know of."Why, he is one of my best
friends!How strange that I should have heard nothing of it!""We didn't know--we really thought--we supposed you were asleep!""And so you chose this time for the wedding?""Now, I
call that unfriendly, Woodmouse, and I shouldn't have thought it of
you."The woodmouse stroked his whiskers, and looked piteously at his
formidable acquaintance."Don't be offended, <DW53>!""Perhaps--perhaps you will come to the wedding, after all."Yes, to be sure I will come!""_I_ don't
bear malice.I will come, and Toto shall come, too."We--we have engaged the cave for the evening," said the woodmouse, with
some diffidence."We have a large family connection, you know, and it is
the only place big enough to hold them all."<DW53> stared in amazement, and Toto gave a long whistle."I should say this was to be something very
grand indeed.I should like very much to come, Woodmouse, if you think
it would not trouble any of your family.I promise you that <DW53> shall
be on his very best behavior, and--I'll tell you what!"he added, "I
will provide the music, as I did last summer, at the Rabbit's Rinktum."cried the little woodmouse, his
slender tail quivering with delight."We shall be infinitely obliged,
Mr.Bring
Cracker, too, and any other friends who may be staying with you.said Toto, gravely, "I think not.My grandmother never goes
out in the evening."suggested <DW53>, with a sly wink at Toto.But here the poor little woodmouse looked so unutterably distressed,
that the two friends burst out laughing; and reassuring him by a word,
bade him good-day, and proceeded on their walk."AND now," said the squirrel, when the tea-things were cleared away that
evening, "now for dancing-school.If we are going to a ball, we really
must be more sure of our steps than we are now.<DW53>, oblige me with a
whisk of your tail over the hearth.Some coals have fallen from the
fire, and we shall be treading on them.""When the coals are cold," replied the raccoon, "I shall be happy to
oblige you.And meantime, as I have no idea
of dancing immediately after my supper, I will, if you like, tell you
the story of the Useful Coal, which your request brings to my mind.It
is short, and will not take much time from the dancing-lesson."Right willingly the family all seated themselves around the blazing
fire, and the raccoon began as follows:--


THE USEFUL COAL.There was once a king whose name was Sligo.He was noted both for his
riches and his kind heart.One evening, as he sat by his fireside, a
coal fell out on the hearth.The King took up the tongs, intending to
put it back on the fire, but the coal said:--

"If you will spare my life, and do as I tell you, I will save your
treasure three times, and tell you the name of the thief who steals it."These words gave the King great joy, for much treasure had been stolen
from him of late, and none of his officers could discover the culprit.So he set the coal on the table, and said:--

"Pretty little black and red bird, tell me, what shall I do?""Put me in your waistcoat pocket," said the coal, "and take no more
thought for to-night."Accordingly the King put the coal in his pocket, and then, as he sat
before the warm fire, he grew drowsy, and presently fell fast asleep.When he had been asleep some time, the door opened, very softly, and the
High Cellarer peeped cautiously in.This was the one of the King's
officers who had been most eager in searching for the thief.He now
crept softly, softly, toward the King, and seeing that he was fast
asleep, put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket; for in that
waistcoat-pocket King Sligo kept the key of his treasure-chamber, and
the High Cellarer was the thief.He put his hand into the waistcoat
pocket.S-s-s-s-s!the coal burned it so frightfully that he gave a loud
shriek, and fell on his knees on the hearth.cried the King, waking with a start.your Majesty," said the High Cellarer, thrusting his burnt
fingers into his bosom, that the King might not see them."You were just
on the point of falling forward into the fire, and I cried out, partly
from fright and partly to waken you."The King thanked the High Cellarer, and gave him a ruby ring as a
reward.But when he was in his chamber, and making ready for bed, the
coal said to him:--

"Once already have I saved your treasure, and to-night I shall save it
again.Only put me on the table beside your bed, and you may sleep with
a quiet heart."So the King put the coal on the table, and himself into the bed, and was
soon sound asleep.At midnight the door of the chamber opened very
softly, and the High Cellarer peeped in again.He knew that at night
King Sligo kept the key under his pillow, and he was coming to get it.He crept softly, softly, toward the bed, but as he drew near it, the
coal cried out:--

"One eye sleeps, but the other eye wakes!one eye sleeps, but the other
eye wakes!Who is this comes creeping, while honest men are sleeping?"The High Cellarer looked about him in affright, and saw the coal
burning fiery red in the darkness, and looking for all the world like a
great flaming eye.In an agony of fear he fled from the chamber,
crying,--

    "Black and red!The King has a devil to guard his bed."And he spent the rest of the night shivering in the farthest garret he
could find.The next morning the coal said to the King:--

"Again this night have I saved your treasure, and mayhap your life as
well.Yet a third time I shall do it, and this time you shall learn the
name of the thief.But if I do this, you must promise me one thing, and
that is that you will place me in your royal crown and wear me as a
jewel.replied King Sligo, "for a jewel indeed you
are.""It is true that I am dying; but no
matter.It is a fine thing to be a jewel in a king's crown, even if one
is dead.As soon as I am
quite black and dead,--which will be in about ten minutes from now,--you
must take me in your hand and rub me all over and around the handle of
the door of the treasure-chamber.A good part of me will be rubbed off,
but there will be enough left to put in your crown.When you have
thoroughly rubbed the door, lay the key of the treasure-chamber on your
table, as if you had left it there by mistake.You may then go hunting
or riding, but not for more than an hour; and when you return, you must
instantly call all your court together, as if on business of the
greatest importance.Invent some excuse for asking them to raise their
hands, and then arrest the man whose hands are black.replied King Sligo, fervently, "I do, and my warmest thanks,
good Coal, are due to you for this--"

But here he stopped, for already the coal was quite black, and in less
than ten minutes it was dead and cold.Then the King took it and rubbed
it carefully over the door of the treasure-chamber, and laying the key
of the door in plain sight on his dressing-table, he called his huntsmen
together, and mounting his horse, rode away to the forest.As soon as he
was gone, the High Cellarer, who had pleaded a headache when asked to
join the hunt, crept softly to the King's room, and to his surprise
found the key on the table.Full of joy, he sought the treasure-chamber
at once, and began filling his pockets with gold and jewels, which he
carried to his own apartment, returning greedily for more.In this way
he opened and closed the door many times.Suddenly, as he was stooping
over a silver barrel containing sapphires, he heard the sound of a
trumpet, blown once, twice, thrice.The wicked thief started, for it was
the signal for the entire court to appear instantly before the King, and
the penalty of disobedience was death.Hastily cramming a handful of
sapphires into his pocket, he stumbled to the door, which he closed and
locked, putting the key also in his pocket, as there was no time to
return it.He flew to the presence-chamber, where the lords of the
kingdom were hastily assembling.The King was seated on his throne, still in his hunting-dress, though he
had put on his crown over his hat, which presented a peculiar
appearance.It was with a majestic air, however, that he rose and
said:--

"Nobles, and gentlemen of my court!I have called you together to pray
for the soul of my lamented grandmother, who died, as you may remember,
several years ago.In token of respect, I desire you all to raise your
hands to Heaven."The astonished courtiers, one and all, lifted their hands high in air.the hands of the High Cellarer were as
black as soot!The King caused him to be arrested and searched, and the
sapphires in his pocket, besides the key of the treasure-chamber, gave
amble proof of his guilt.His head was removed at once, and the King had
the useful coal, set in sapphires, placed in the very front of his
crown, where it was much admired and praised as a BLACK DIAMOND.*       *       *       *       *

"And _now_, Cracker, my boy," continued the raccoon, rising from his
seat by the fire, "as you previously remarked, now for dancing-school!"With these words he proceeded to sweep the hearth carefully and
gracefully with his tail, while Toto and Bruin moved the chairs and
tables back against the wall.The grandmother's armchair was moved into
the warm chimney-corner, where she would be comfortably out of the way
of the dancers; and Pigeon Pretty perched on the old lady's shoulder,
"that the two sober-minded members of the family might keep each other
in countenance," she said.Toto ran into his room, and returned with a
little old fiddle which had belonged to his grandfather, and stationed
himself at one end of the kitchen, while the bear, the raccoon, and the
squirrel formed in line at the other."Now, then," said Master Toto, tapping smartly on the fiddle."Stand up
straight, all of you!Up they all went,--little Cracker sitting up jauntily, his tail cocked
over his left ear, <DW53> pawing the air gracefully, but not quite sure of
himself; while Bruin raised his huge form erect, and stood like a shaggy
black giant, waiting further orders.<DW53> and Cracker bowed to each other; and Bruin, having no partner,
gravely saluted Miss Mary, who stood on one leg and surveyed the
proceedings in silent but deep disdain.Bruin dropped on
all-fours, and frantically endeavored to stand on his fore-paws, with
his hind-legs in the air, throwing up first one great shaggy leg and
then another, and finally losing his balance and falling flat, with a
thump that shook the whole house.cried the grandmother, starting from her chair.Madam," cried the bear, rising with surprising agility for one
of his size; "it's nothing!I--I was only
jumping and changing my feet.he added, in an
aggrieved tone, to Toto."It isn't possible, you know, for a fellow of
my build to--a--do that sort of thing.You shouldn't, really--"

"Oh, Bruin!cried Toto, wiping the tears from his eyes, as he
leaned against the dresser in a paroxysm of merriment."I didn't _mean_
you to do that!You jump--_so!_ and change
your feet--_so!_ as you come down.There, look at <DW53>; he has the idea,
perfectly!"The astute <DW53>, in truth, seeing Bruin's error, had stood quietly in
his place till he saw Toto perform the mystic manoeuvre of "jump and
change feet," and had then begun to practise it with a quiet grace and
ease, as if he had done it all his life.[Illustration: "Now, then, attention all!And he
played a lively air on his fiddle.--PAGE 97.]The squirrel, meanwhile, had obeyed the first part of the order by
jumping to the top of the clock, where he sat inspecting his little
black feet with an air of comical perplexity."Come down and
take your place at once!and he played a lively air on his fiddle.he said, "I am all right when we
come to forward and back.Tum-tiddy tum-tum, tum-tum-tum!"and he
pranced forward, put out one foot, and slid back again, with an air of
enjoyment that was pleasant to behold."Stand a little
straighter, Bruin!Cracker, you don't point your toe enough.Hold your
head up, <DW53>, and don't be looking round at your tail every minute._Tum_-tiddy tum-tum, _tum_-tum-tum!_tiddy_-iddy tum-tum,
_tum_-tum-tum!There, now you may rest a moment
before you begin on the waltz step."that is _my_ delight," said the squirrel."What a sensation we
shall make at the wedding!One of the woodmouse's daughters is very
pretty, with such a nice little nose, and such bright eyes!I shall ask
her to waltz with me.""There won't be any one of my size there, I suppose," said the raccoon."You and I will have to be partners, Toto.""And I must stay at home and waltz alone!""It is a misfortune, in some ways, to be so big.""But great good fortune in others, Bruin, dear!"said Pigeon Pretty,
affectionately."I, for one, would not have you smaller, for the world!""Bruin, my friend and
protector, your size and strength are the greatest possible comfort to
me, coupled as they are with a kind heart and a willing--"

"Paw!""Your sentiments are most correct, Granny, dear; but
Bruin _must_ not stand bowing in the middle of the room, even if he is
grateful.Go in the corner, Bruin, and practise your steps, while I take
a turn with <DW53>.And you, Cracker, can--"

But Master Cracker did not wait for instructions.He had been watching
the parrot for some minutes, with his head on one side and his eyes
twinkling with merriment; and now, springing suddenly upon her perch, he
caught the astonished bird round the body, leaped with her to the floor,
and began to whirl her round the room at a surprising rate, in tolerably
good time to the lively waltz that Toto was whistling.Miss Mary gasped
for breath, and fluttered her wings wildly, trying to escape from her
tormentor, and presently, finding her voice, she shrieked aloud:--

"Ke-ke-kee!Let me go
this instant, or I'll peck your eyes out!I will--"

"Oh, no, you won't, my dear!""You wouldn't have the heart
to do that; for then how could I look at you, the delight of my life?tiddy-_tum_ tum-tum!just see what a pretty
step it is!You will enjoy it immensely, as soon as you know it a little
better."And he whirled her round faster and faster, trying to keep pace
with <DW53> and Toto, who were circling in graceful curves.she cried, "did
you put that custard pie out in the snow to cool?Bruin doesn't like it
hot, you know."Toto, his head still dizzy from waltzing, looked about him in
bewilderment.I don't remember what I did
with it."It is there, on that
chair.Thus adjured, the good bear, who had been gravely revolving by himself
in the corner until he was quite blind, tried to stop short; at the same
instant the squirrel and the parrot, stumbling against his shaggy paw,
fell over it in a confused heap of feathers and fur.He stepped hastily
back to avoid treading on them, lost his balance, and sat down
heavily--on the custard pie!At the crash of the platter, the squirrel released Miss Mary, who flew
screaming to her perch; the grandmother wrung her hands and lamented,
begging to be told what had happened, and who was hurt; and the
unfortunate Bruin, staggering to his feet, stared aghast at the ruin he
had wrought.It was a very complete ruin, certainly, for the platter was
in small fragments, while most of its contents were clinging to his own
shaggy black coat."Well, old fellow," said Toto, "you have done it now, haven't you?I
tried to stop you, but I was too late.""Yes," replied the bear, solemnly, "I have done it now!And I have also
done _with_ it now.Dear Madam," he added, turning to the old lady,
"please forgive me!I have spoiled your pie, and broken your platter;
but I have also learned a lesson, which I ought to have learned
before,--that is, that waltzing is not my forte, and that, as the old
saying is, 'A bullfrog cannot dance in a grasshopper's nest.'IT was a bright clear night, when Toto, accompanied by the raccoon and
the squirrel, started from home to attend the wedding of the woodmouse's
eldest son.The moon was shining gloriously, and her bright cold rays
turned everything they touched to silver.The long icicles hanging from
the eaves of the cottage glittered like crystal spears; the snow
sparkled as if diamond-dust were strewn over its powdery surface.The
raccoon shook himself as he walked along, and looked about him with his
keen bright eyes."What a fine night this would be for a hunt!"he said, sniffing the cold
bracing air eagerly."There is the track of one
yonder.""It's a--it's
a cat!I wonder
how a cat came here, anyhow.It is a long
time since I chased a cat.""Oh, never mind the cat now, <DW53>!""We are late for the
wedding as it is, with all your prinking.Besides," he added slyly, "I
didn't lend you that red cravat to chase cats in."The raccoon instantly threw off his professional eagerness, and resumed
the air of complacent dignity with which he had begun the walk.Never
before had he been so fully impressed with the sense of his own charms.The red ribbon which he had begged from Toto set off his dark fur and
bright eyes to perfection; and he certainly was a very handsome fellow,
as he frisked daintily along, his tail curling gracefully over his back.he said cheerfully; "we shall certainly
make a sensation."I do, indeed," replied Toto; "though it is a great pity that you and
Cracker didn't let me put your tails in curl-papers last night, as I
offered to do.You can't think what an improvement it would have been.""The cow offered to lend me her bell," said Cracker, "to wear round my
neck, but it was too big, you know.She's the dearest old thing, that
cow!I had a grand game, this morning, jumping over her back and
balancing myself on her horns.Why doesn't she live in the house, with
the rest of us?"said Toto, "one _couldn't_ have a cow in the house.She's too big,
in the first place; and besides, Granny would not like it.One could not
make a companion of a cow!I don't know exactly why, but that sort of
animal is entirely different from you wood-creatures.""The difference is, my dear," said the raccoon, loftily, "that we have
been accustomed to good society, and know something of its laws; while
persons like Mrs."Why, only yesterday I
went out to the barn, and being in need of a little exercise, thought I
would amuse myself by swinging on her tail.And the creature, instead of
saying, 'Mr.<DW53>, I am sensible of the honor you bestow upon me, but
your well-proportioned figure is perhaps heavier than you are aware of,'
or something of that sort, just kicked me off, without saying a word.said the squirrel, "I think I should have done the same in her
place.But see, here we are at the cave.Just look at the tracks in the
snow!Why, there must be a thousand persons here, at least."Indeed, the snow was covered in every direction with the prints of
little feet,--feet that had hopped, had run, had crept from all sides of
the forest, and had met in front of this low opening, from which the
brambles and creeping vines had been carefully cleared away.Torches of
light-wood were blazing on either side, lighting up the gloomy entrance
for several feet, and from within came a confused murmur of many voices,
as of hundreds of small creatures squeaking, piping, and chattering in
every variety of tone.So much the better; we
shall make all the more sensation.Toto, is my neck-tie straight?""You look like--like--"

"Like a popinjay!"muttered the squirrel, who had no neck-tie."Come
along, will you, <DW53>?"And the three companions entered the cave
together.A brilliant scene it was that presented itself before their eyes.The
cave was lighted not only by glow-worms, but by light-wood torches stuck
in every available crack and cranny of the walls.The floor was
sprinkled with fine white sand, clean and glittering, while branches of
holly and alder placed in the corners added still more to the general
air of festivity.As to the guests, they were evidently enjoying
themselves greatly, to judge from the noise they were making.There were
a great many of them,--hundreds, or perhaps even thousands, though it
was impossible to count them, as they were constantly moving, hopping,
leaping, jumping, creeping, trotting, running, even flying.Never were
so many tiny creatures seen together.There were woodmice, of course, by
the hundred,--old and young, big and little; cousins, uncles, aunts,
grandmothers, of the bride and bridegroom.There were respectable
field-mice, looking like well-to-do farmers, as indeed they were; frisky
kangaroo-mice, leaping about on their long hind-legs, to the admiration
of all those whose legs were short.There were all the moles, of both
families,--those who wore plain black velvet without any ornament, and
those who had lovely rose- stars at the end of their noses.These
last gentlemen were very aristocratic indeed, and the woodmice felt
highly honored by their presence.Besides all these, the squirrels had
been invited, and had come in full force, the Grays and the Reds and the
Chipmunks; and Mr.Titmouse were there, and old Mrs.Shrew and
her daughters, and I don't know how many more.Hundreds and hundreds of
guests, none of them bigger than a squirrel, and most of them much
smaller.You can perhaps imagine the effect that was produced on this gay
assembly by the sudden appearance among them of a RACCOON and a BOY!There was a confused murmur for a moment, a quick affrighted glance, and
then dead silence.Not a creature dared to move; not a tail waved, not a
whisker quivered; all the tiny creatures stood as if turned to stone,
gazing in mute terror and supplication at their formidable visitors.The
bride, who had just entered from a side-cave on her father's arm,
prepared to faint; the bridegroom threw his arms about her and glared
fiercely at the intruders, his tiny heart swelling as high as if he were
a lion instead of a very small red mouse.Woodmouse, Senior, alone
retained his presence of mind.He hastened to greet his formidable
guests, and bade them welcome in a voice which, though tremulous, tried
hard to be cordial.<DW53>," he said, "you are welcome, most welcome.Toto, your most
obedient, sir.Cracker, I am delighted to see you.Very good of you all,
I'm sure, to honor this little occasion with your distinguished
presence.Will you--ah!--hum--will you sit down?"The little host hesitated over this invitation; it would not be polite
to ask his guests to be careful lest they should sit down _on_ the other
guests, and yet they were so _very_ large, and took up so _much_
room,--two of them, at least!<DW53>, delighted at the sensation he had
produced, was as gracious as possible, and sitting down with great care
so as to avoid any catastrophe, looked about him with so benign an
expression that the rest of the company began to take heart, and
whiskers were pricked and tails were cocked again.he said heartily,--"this is really
delightful!But I do not see your son, the
happy-- Ah!Prick-ear, you rascal, come here!Are you too
proud to speak to your old friends?"Thus adjured, the young woodmouse left his bride in her mother's care
and came forward, looking half pleased and half angry."Good evening,
<DW53>!""I was not sure whether you _were_ a friend, after our
last meeting.But I am very glad to see you, and I bear no malice."And with this he shook paws with an air of magnanimity.<DW53> rubbed his
nose, as he was apt to do when a little confused."I had quite forgotten that little
matter.But say no more about it, my boy; say no more about it!By-gones
are by-gones, and we should think of nothing but pleasure on an occasion
like the present."With a graceful and condescending wave of his paw he
dismissed the past, and continued: "Pray, introduce me to your charming
bride!I assure you I am positively longing to make her acquaintance.and he crossed the room and joined the
bridal party."What trouble did your son have with <DW53>?"said his host, in some embarrassment, "it came _near_
being serious,--at least Prick-ear thought it did.<DW53> one day last autumn, when he was bringing home a load of
checkerberries for supper.<DW53> wanted the checkerberries,
and--ah!--in point of fact, ate them; and when Prick-ear remonstrated,
he chased him all round the forest, vowing that if he caught him he
would--if you will excuse my mentioning such a thing--eat _him_ too.Now, that sort of thing is very painful, Mr.Toto; very painful indeed
it is, I assure you, sir.And though Prick-ear escaped by running into
a mole's burrow, I must confess that he has _not_ felt kindly toward Mr."Very natural," said Toto, gravely."It _has_ occurred to me," continued the woodmouse, "that possibly it
may have been only a joke on Mr.Seeing him so friendly and condescending here to-night, one can hardly
suppose that he _really_--eh?--could have intended--"

"He certainly would not do such a thing _now_," said Toto, decidedly,
"certainly not.He has the kindest feeling for all your family.""Most
gratifying, I'm sure.But I see that the ceremony is about to begin.If
you _would_ excuse me, Mr.Toto--"

And the little host bowed himself away, leaving Toto to seat himself at
leisure and watch the proceedings.The bride, an extremely pretty little mouse, was attired in
a very becoming travelling-dress of brown fur, which fitted her to
perfection.The ceremony was performed by a star-nosed mole of high
distinction, who delivered a learned and impressive discourse to the
young couple, and ended by presenting them with three leaves of
wintergreen, of which one was eaten by each separately, while they
nibbled the third together, in token of their united lives.When they
met in the middle of the leaf, they rubbed noses together, and the
ceremony was finished.Then everybody advanced to rub noses with the bride, and to shake paws
with the happy bridegroom.One of the first to do so was the raccoon,
who comported himself with a grace and dignity which attracted the
admiration of all.The little bride was nearly frightened to death, it
is true; but she bore up bravely, for her husband whispered in her ear
that Mr.<DW53> was one of his dearest friends, _now_.Meanwhile, no one was enjoying the festivity more thoroughly than our
little friend Cracker.He was whisking and frisking about from one group
to another, greeting old friends, making new acquaintances, hearing all
the wood-gossip of the winter, and telling in return of the wonderful
life that he and Bruin and <DW53> were leading.His own relations were
most deeply interested in all he had to tell; but while his cousins were
loud in their expressions of delight and of envy, some of the elders
shook their heads.Uncle Munkle, a sedate and portly chipmunk, looked
very grave as he heard of all the doings at the cottage, and presently
he beckoned Cracker to one side, and addressed him in a low tone."Cracker, my boy," he said, "I don't quite like all this, do you know?Toto and his grandmother are all very well, though they seem to have a
barbarous way of living; but who is this Mrs.Cow, about whom you have
so much to say; not a domestic animal, I trust?"Cracker admitted, rather reluctantly, "she _is_ a domestic
animal, Uncle; but she is a very good one, I assure you, and not
objectionable in any way.""I did not expect this of you,
Cracker!"he said severely, "I did not, indeed.This is the first time,
to my knowledge, that a member of my family has had anything to do with
a domestic animal.I am disappointed in you, sir; distinctly
disappointed!"There was a pause, in which the delinquent Cracker found nothing to say,
and then his uncle added:--

"And in what condition are your teeth, pray?I suppose you are letting
them grow, while you eat those wretched messes of soft food.Have you
_any_ proper food, at all?""Indeed, Uncle Munkle, my teeth are in
excellent condition.and he exhibited two shining
rows of teeth as sharp as those of a newly-set saw."We have plenty of
nuts; more than I ever had before, I assure you.Toto got quantities of
them in the autumn, on purpose for me; and there are great heaps of
hazels and beech-nuts and hickories piled up in the barn-chamber, where
I can go and help myself when I please."Oh, they are _so_ jolly!"Uncle Munkle looked mollified; he even seemed interested."They are foreign nuts, and don't grow in this part
of the world.Where did Toto get them, do you
think?""He bought them of a pedler," said Cracker."I know he would give you
some, Uncle, if you asked him.Why won't you come out and see us, some
day?"At this moment a loud and lively whistle was heard,--first three notes
of warning, and then Toto's merriest jig,--which put all serious
thoughts to flight, and set the whole company dancing.Cracker flew
across the room to a charming young red squirrel on whom he had had his
eye for some time, made his bow, and was soon showing off to her
admiring gaze the fine steps which he had learned in the kitchen at
home.The woodmice skipped and hopped merrily about; the kangaroo-mice
danced with long, graceful bounds,--three short hops after each one.It
is easy to do when you know just how.As for the moles, they ran round
and round in a circle, with their noses to the ground, and thought very
well of themselves.Presently Toto changed his tune from a jig to a waltz; and then he and
<DW53> danced together, to the admiration of all beholders.Round they
went, and round and round, circling in graceful curves,--Toto never
pausing in his whistle, <DW53>'s scarlet neck-tie waving like a banner in
the breeze."Yes, that is a sight worth seeing!""It is
a pity, just for this once, that you have not eyes to see it.""And have they
stars on their noses?I have no desire to _see_ them, as you call it."That is of more consequence, to my
mind.One can show one's skill in dancing, but that does not fill the
stomach, and mine warns me that it is empty."At this very moment the music stopped, and the voice of the host was
heard announcing that supper was served in the side-cave.The mole
waited to hear no more, but rushed as fast as his legs would carry him,
following his unerring nose in the direction where the food lay.Bolting
into the supper-room, he ran violently against a neatly arranged pyramid
of hazel-nuts, and down it came, rattling and tumbling over the greedy
mole, and finally burying him completely.The rest of the company coming
soberly in, each gentleman with his partner, saw the heaving and quaking
mountain of nuts beneath which the mole was struggling, and he was
rescued amid much laughter and merriment.There were nuts of all kinds,--butternuts,
chestnuts, beech-nuts, hickories, and hazels.There were huge piles of
acorns, of several kinds,--the long slender brown-satin ones, and the
fat red-and-brown ones, with a woolly down on them.There were
partridge-berries and checkerberries, and piles of fragrant, spicy
leaves of wintergreen.And there was sassafras-bark and spruce-gum, and
a great dish of golden corn,--a present from the field-cousins.Really,
it gives one an appetite only to think of it!And I verily believe that
there never was such a nibbling, such a gnawing, such a champing and
cracking and throwing away of shells, since first the forest was a
forest.When the guests were thirsty, there was root-beer, served in
birch-bark goblets; and when one had drunk all the beer one ate the
goblet; which was very pleasant, and moreover saved some washing of
dishes.And so all were very merry, and the star-nosed moles ate so much
that their stars turned purple, and they had to be led home by their
fieldmouse neighbors.At the close of the feast, the bride and groom departed for their own
home, which was charmingly fitted up under an elder-bush, from the
berries of which they could make their own wine.And finally, after a last wild dance, the company
separated, the lights were put out, and "the event of the season" was
over.TOTO and his companions walked homeward in high spirits.The air was
crisp and tingling; the snow crackled merrily beneath their feet; and
though the moon had set, the whole sky was ablaze with stars, sparkling
with the keen, winter radiance which one sees only in cold weather."Very pretty," said Toto; "very pretty indeed.What good people they are, those little woodmice.they made me fill all my pockets with checkerberries and nuts for the
others at home, and they sent so many messages of regret and apology to
Bruin that I shall not get any of them straight."said the squirrel, who had been gazing up into the sky, "what's
that?""_That!_" repeated Cracker."That big thing with a tail, up among the
stars."His companions both stared upward in their turn, and Toto exclaimed,--

"Why, it's a comet!I never saw one before, but I know what they look
like, from the pictures."And _what_, if I may be so bold as to ask," said <DW53>, "_is_ a comet?""Why, it's--it's--THAT, you know!""What a clear way you have of putting things, to
be sure!""Well," cried Toto, laughing, "I'm afraid I cannot put it _very_
clearly, because I don't know just _exactly_ what comets are, myself.But they are heavenly bodies, and they come and go in the sky, with
tails; and sometimes you don't see one again for a thousand years; and
though you don't see them move, they are really going like lightning all
the time."<DW53> and Cracker looked at each other, as if they feared that their
companion was losing his wits."They have no legs," replied Toto, "nothing but heads and tails; and I
don't believe they live on anything, unless," he added, with a twinkle
in his eye, "they get milk from the milky way."The raccoon looked hard at Toto, and then equally hard at the comet,
which for its part spread its shining tail among the constellations, and
took no notice whatever of him."Can't you give us a little more of this precious information?""It is so valuable, you know, and we are so likely to
believe it, Cracker and I, being two greenhorns, as you seem to think."Toto flushed, and his brow clouded for an instant, for <DW53> could be so
_very_ disagreeable when he tried; but the next moment he threw back his
head and laughed merrily."I _will_ give you more information, old
fellow.I will tell you a story I once heard about a comet.It isn't
true, you know, but what of that?You will believe it just as much as
you would the truth.Listen, now, both you cross fellows, to the story
of


THE NAUGHTY COMET.In the great court-yard stood
hundreds of comets, of all sizes and shapes.Some were puffing and
blowing, and arranging their tails, all ready to start; others had just
come in, and looked shabby and forlorn after their long journeyings,
their tails drooping disconsolately; while others still were switched
off on side-tracks, where the tinker and the tailor were attending to
their wants, and setting them to rights.In the midst of all stood the
Comet Master, with his hands behind him, holding a very long stick with
a very sharp point.The comets knew just how the point of that stick
felt, for they were prodded with it whenever they misbehaved
themselves; accordingly, they all remained very quiet, while he gave
his orders for the day.In a distant corner of the court-yard lay an old comet, with his tail
comfortably curled up around him.He was too old to go out, so he
enjoyed himself at home in a quiet way.Beside him stood a very young
comet, with a very short tail.He was quivering with excitement, and
occasionally cast sharp impatient glances at the Comet Master.he exclaimed, but in an undertone, so that
only his companion could hear."He knows I am dying to go out, and for
that very reason he pays no attention to me.I dare not leave my place,
for you know what he is."said the old comet, slowly, "if you had been out as often as I
have, you would not be in such a hurry.Hot, tiresome work, _I_ call it."What _does_ it all
amount to?That is what I am determined to find out.I cannot understand
your going on, travelling and travelling, and never finding out why you
do it._I_ shall find out, you may be very sure, before I have finished
my first journey.""You'll only get into
trouble.Nobody knows except the Comet Master and the Sun.The Master
would cut you up into inch pieces if you asked him, and the Sun--"

"Well, what about the Sun?"rang suddenly, clear and sharp, through the
court-yard.The young comet started as if he had been shot, and in three bounds he
stood before the Comet Master, who looked fixedly at him."You have never been out before," said the Master.73; and he knew better than to add another word."You will go out now," said the Comet Master."You will travel for
thirteen weeks and three days, and will then return.You will avoid the
neighborhood of the Sun, the Earth, and the planet Bungo.You will turn
to the left on meeting other comets, and you are not allowed to speak to
meteors.At the word, the comet shot out of the gate and off into space, his
short tail bobbing as he went.No longer shut up in that
tiresome court-yard, waiting for one's tail to grow, but out in the
free, open, boundless realm of space, with leave to shoot about here and
there and everywhere--well, _nearly_ everywhere--for thirteen whole
weeks!How well his
tail looked, even though it was still rather short!What a fine fellow
he was, altogether!For two or three weeks our comet was the happiest creature in all space;
too happy to think of anything except the joy of frisking about.But
by-and-by he began to wonder about things, and that is always dangerous
for a comet."I wonder, now," he said, "why I may not go near the planet Bungo.I
have always heard that he was the most interesting of all the planets.how I _should_ like to know a little more about the Sun!And, by the way, that reminds me that all this time I have never found
out _why_ I am travelling.It shows how I have been enjoying myself,
that I have forgotten it so long; but now I must certainly make a point
of finding out.So he turned out to the left, and waited till No.The
latter was a middle-aged comet, very large, and with an uncommonly long
tail,--quite preposterously long, our little No.73 thought, as he shook
his own tail and tried to make as much of it as possible.he said as soon as the other was within
speaking distance."Would you be so very good as to tell me what you are
travelling for?""Started a
month ago; five months still to go.""I mean _why_ are
you travelling at all?"_Why_ do we travel for weeks and months and years?"What's
more, don't care!"The little comet fairly shook with amazement and indignation.And how long, may I ask, have you been
travelling hither and thither through space, without knowing or caring
why?""Long enough to learn not to ask stupid questions!"And without another word he was off, with his preposterously long tail
spreading itself like a luminous fan behind him.The little comet looked
after him for some time in silence.At last he said:--

"Well, _I_ call that simply _disgusting_!An ignorant, narrow-minded
old--"

"Hello, cousin!"Our roads seem to go in the same
direction."The comet turned and saw a bright and sparkling meteor."I--I--must not
speak to you!""N-nothing that I know of," answered No."Then why mustn't you speak to me?"persisted the meteor, giving a
little skip and jump.answered the little comet, slowly, for he was ashamed
to say boldly, as he ought to have done, that it was against the orders
of the Comet Master.But a fine high-spirited young fellow like you isn't going
to be afraid of that old tyrant.If there were any
_real reason_ why you should not speak to me--"

"That's just what I say," interrupted the comet, eagerly.After a little more hesitation, the comet yielded, and the two frisked
merrily along, side by side.73 confided all his
vexations to his new friend, who sympathized warmly with him, and spoke
in most disrespectful terms of the Comet Master."A pretty sort of person to dictate to you, when he hasn't the smallest
sign of a tail himself!"As
to the other orders, some of them are not so bad.Of course, nobody
would want to go near that stupid, poky Earth, if he could possibly help
it; and the planet Bungo is--ah--is not a very nice planet, I believe.[The fact is, the planet Bungo contains a large reform school for unruly
meteors, but our friend made no mention of that.]But as for the
Sun,--the bright, jolly, delightful Sun,--why, I am going to take a
nearer look at him myself.We will go together, in spite of the
Comet Master."Again the little comet hesitated and demurred; but after all, he had
already broken one rule, and why not another?He would be punished in
any case, and he might as well get all the pleasure he could.Reasoning
thus, he yielded once more to the persuasions of the meteor, and
together they shot through the great space-world, taking their way
straight toward the Sun.When the Sun saw them coming, he smiled and seemed much pleased.He
stirred his fire, and shook his shining locks, and blazed brighter and
brighter, hotter and hotter.The heat seemed to have a strange effect on
the comet, for he began to go faster and faster."Something is drawing me forward,
faster and faster!"On he went at a terrible rate, the meteor following as best he might.Several planets which he passed shouted to him in warning tones, but he
could not hear what they said.The Sun stirred his fire again, and
blazed brighter and brighter, hotter and hotter; and forward rushed the
wretched little comet, faster and faster, faster and faster!"Catch hold of my tail and stop me!""I am
shrivelling, burning up, in this fearful heat!Stop me, for pity's
sake!"But the meteor was already far behind, and had stopped short to watch
his companion's headlong progress.And now,--ah, me!--now the Sun opened
his huge fiery mouth.The comet made one desperate effort to stop
himself, but it was in vain.An awful, headlong plunge through the
intervening space; a hissing and crackling; a shriek,--and the fiery
jaws had closed on Short-Tail No.I quite forgot that the
Sun ate comets.I must be off, or I shall get an aeon in the Reform
School for this.I am really very sorry, for he was a nice little
comet!"And away frisked the meteor, and soon forgot all about it.But in the great court-yard in front of the Comet House, the Master took
a piece of chalk, and crossed out No.73 from the list of short-tailed
comets on the slate that hangs on the door.and the swiftest of all the comets stood before
him, brilliant and beautiful, with a bewildering magnificence of tail.The Comet Master spoke sharply and decidedly, as usual, but not
unkindly.73, Short-Tail," he said, "has disobeyed orders, and has in
consequence been devoured by the Sun."Here there was a great sensation among the comets.1," continued the Master, "you will start immediately, and travel
until you find a runaway meteor, with a red face and blue hair.You are
permitted to make inquiries of respectable bodies, such as planets or
satellites.When found, you will arrest him and take him to the planet
Bungo.My compliments to the Meteor Keeper, and I shall be obliged if he
will give this meteor two aeons in the Reform School.I trust," he
continued, turning to the assembled comets, "that this will be a lesson
to all of you!""BRUIN, what do you think?Thus spoke
the little squirrel as he sat perched on his big friend's shoulder, the
day after the wedding party."Why, I think that you are
tickling my ear, Master Cracker, and that if you do not stop, I shall be
under the painful necessity of knocking you off on the floor.""Oh, that isn't the kind of thinking I mean!"replied Cracker,
impudently flirting the tip of his tail into the good bear's eye."_That_ is of no consequence, you great big fellow!What are your ears
for, if not for me to tickle?I mean, what do you think I heard at the
party, last night?""Bruin, I shall certainly be obliged to shake you!""I shall shake you till your teeth rattle, if you give me any more of
this impudence.So behave yourself now, and listen to me.I was talking
with Chipper last night,--my cousin, you know, who lives at the other
end of the wood,--and he told me something that really quite troubled
me.said Bruin, "I should say I did.He hasn't been in our part
of the wood again, has he?""He is not likely to go anywhere for a long
time, I should say.He has broken his leg, Chipper tells me, and has
been shut up in his cavern for a week and more."How
does the poor old man get his food?""Chipper didn't seem to think he _could_ get any," replied the squirrel."He peeped in at the door, yesterday, and saw him lying in his bunk,
looking very pale and thin.He tried once or twice to get up, but fell
back again; and Chipper is sure there was nothing to eat in the cave.I
thought I wouldn't say anything to <DW53> or Toto last night, but would
wait till I had told you.""I will go
myself, and take care of the poor man till his leg is well.Where are
the Madam and Toto?The blind grandmother was in the kitchen, rolling out pie-crust.She
listened, with exclamations of pity and concern, to Cracker's account of
the poor old hermit, and agreed with Bruin that aid must be sent to him
without delay."I will pack a basket at once," she said, "with
nourishing food, bandages for the broken leg, and some simple medicines;
and Toto, you will take it to the poor man, will you not, dear?"But Bruin said: "No, dear Madam!Our Toto's heart is
big, but he is not strong enough to take care of a sick person.It is
surely best for me to go.""Dear Bruin," she said, "of course you
_would_ be the best nurse on many accounts; but if the man is weak and
nervous, I am afraid--you alarmed him once, you know, and possibly the
sight of you, coming in suddenly, might--"

"Speak out, Granny!""You think Bruin would simply
frighten the man to death, or at best into a fit; and you are quite
right.he added, turning to Bruin, who
looked sadly crestfallen at this throwing of cold water on the fire of
his kindly intentions, "we will go together, and then the whole thing
will be easily managed.I will go in first, and tell the hermit all
about you; and then, when his mind is prepared, you can come in and make
him comfortable."The good bear brightened up at this, and gladly assented to Toto's
proposition; and the two set out shortly after, Bruin carrying a large
basket of food, and Toto a small one containing medicines and bandages.Part of the food was for their own lunch, as they had a long walk before
them, and would not be back till long past dinner-time.They trudged
briskly along,--Toto whistling merrily as usual, but his companion very
grave and silent.asked the boy, when a couple of miles had
been traversed in this manner."Has our account of the wedding made you
pine with envy, and wish yourself a mouse?"replied the bear, slowly, "oh, no!I should not like to be a
mouse, or anything of that sort.But I do wish, Toto, that I was not so
frightfully ugly!"cried Toto, indignantly, "who said you were ugly?What put such
an idea into your head?""Why, you yourself," said the bear, sadly."You said I would frighten
the man to death, or into a fit.Now, one must be horribly ugly to do
that, you know.""My _dear_ Bruin," cried Toto, "it isn't because you are _ugly_; why,
you are a perfect beauty--for a bear.But--well--you are _very_ large,
you know, and somewhat shaggy, if you don't mind my saying so; and you
must remember that most bears are very savage, disagreeable creatures.How is anybody who sees you for the first time to know that you are the
best and dearest old fellow in the world?Besides," he added, "have you
forgotten how you frightened this very hermit when he stole your honey,
last year?"Bruin hung his head, and looked very sheepish."I shouldn't roar, now,
of course," he said."I meant to be very gentle, and just put one paw
in, and then the end of my nose, and so get into the cave by degrees,
you know."Toto had his doubts as to the soothing effect which would have been
produced by this singular measure, but he had not the heart to say so;
and after a pause, Bruin continued:--

"Of course, however, you and Madam were quite right,--quite right you
were, my boy.But I was wondering, just now, whether there were not
some way of making myself less frightful.Now, you and Madam have no
hair on your faces,--none anywhere, in fact, except a very little on the
top of your head.That gives you a gentle expression, you see.Do you
think--would it be possible--would you advise me to--to--in fact, to
shave the hair off my face?"The excellent bear looked wistfully at Toto, to mark the effect of this
proposition; but Toto, after struggling for some moments to preserve his
gravity, burst into a peal of laughter, so loud and clear that it woke
the echoes of the forest.Bruin,
dear, you really _must_ excuse me, but I cannot help it.Bruin looked hurt and vexed for a moment, but it was only a moment.Toto's laughter was too contagious to be resisted; the worthy bear's
features relaxed, and the next instant he was laughing himself,--or
coming as near to it as a black bear can."I am a foolish old fellow, I suppose!""We will say no more
about it, Toto.It sounded like a crow,
only it was too feeble."They listened, and presently the sound was heard again; and this time it
certainly was a faint but distinct "Caw!"and apparently at no great
distance from them.The two companions looked about, and soon saw the
owner of the voice perched on a stump, and croaking dismally.A more
miserable-looking bird was never seen.His feathers drooped in limp
disorder, and evidently had not been trimmed for days; his eyes were
half-shut, and save when he opened his beak to utter a despairing "Caw!"he might have been mistaken for a stuffed bird,--and a badly stuffed
bird at that.shouted Toto, in his cheery voice."What is the matter
that you look so down in the beak?"The crow raised his head, and looked sadly at the two strangers."I am
sick," he said, "and I can't get anything to eat for myself or my
master.""He is a hermit," replied the crow."He lives in a cave near by; but
last week he broke his leg, and has not been able to move since then.He
has nothing to eat, for he will not touch raw snails, and I cannot find
anything else for him.I fear he will die soon, and I shall probably die
too."said the bear, "don't let me hear any nonsense of that
kind.Here, take that, sir, and don't talk foolishness!""That" was neither more nor less than the wing of a roast chicken which
Bruin had pulled hastily from the basket.The famished crow fell upon
it, beak and claw, without more ado; and a silence ensued, while the two
friends, well pleased, watched the first effect of their charitable
mission."Were you ever so hungry as that, Bruin?"said the bear, carelessly, "often and often.When I came out
in the spring, you know.But I never stayed hungry very long," he
added, with a significant grimace."This crow is sick, you see, and
probably cannot help himself much.he
said, addressing the crow, who had polished the chicken-bone till it
shone again, and now looked up with a twinkle in his eyes very different
from the wretched, lacklustre expression they had at first worn.he said warmly; "you have positively
given me life.And now, tell me how I can serve
you, for you are evidently bent on some errand.""We have come to see your master," said Toto."We heard of his accident,
and thought he must be in need of help.So, if you will show us the
way--"

The crow needed no more, but joyfully spread his wings, and half hopped,
half fluttered along the ground as fast as he could go.he cried, "our humble dwelling is close at hand.Follow me,
I pray you, and blessings attend your footsteps."The two friends followed, and soon came upon the entrance to a cave,
around which a sort of rustic porch had been built.Vines were trained
over it, and a rude chair and table stood beneath the pleasant shade."This is my master's study," said the crow."Here we have spent many
happy and profitable hours.May it please you to enter, worshipful
sirs?"asked Toto, glancing at his companion."Shall
we go in, or send the crow first, to announce us?""You had better go in alone," said the bear, decidedly."I will stay
here with Master Crow, and when--that is, _if_ you think it best for me
to come in, later, you have but to call me."Accordingly Toto entered the cavern, which was dimly lighted by a hole
in the roof.As soon as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom, he
perceived a rude pallet at one side, on which was stretched the form of
a tall old man.His long white hair and beard were matted and tangled;
his thin hands lay helpless by his side; it seemed as if he were
scarcely alive.He opened his eyes, however, at the sound of footsteps,
and looked half-fearfully at the boy, who bent softly over him.said Toto, not knowing what else to say."Is your
leg better, to-day?"murmured the old man, feebly.He started for the mouth of the cave, but before he reached it, a huge,
shaggy, black paw was thrust in at the aperture, holding out a bark
dish, while a sort of enormous whisper, which just _was_ not a growl,
murmured, "Here it is!""Thank you, Bru--I mean, thank you!"said Toto, in some confusion,
glancing apprehensively toward the bed.But the old man noticed nothing,
till the clear cool water was held to his lips.He drank eagerly, and
seemed to gain a little strength at once, for he now gazed earnestly at
Toto, and presently said, in a feeble voice:--

"Who are you, dear child, and what good angel has sent you to save my
life?""My name is Toto," replied the boy."As to how I came here, I will tell
you all that by-and-by; but now you are too weak either to talk or to
listen, and I must see at once about getting you some--"

"_Food!_" came the huge whisper again, rolling like a distant muttering
of thunder through the cavern; and again the shaggy paw appeared,
solemnly waving a bowl of jelly.Toto flew to take it, but paused for a moment, overcome with amusement
at the aspect presented by his friend.The good bear had wedged his huge
bulk tightly into a corner behind a jutting fragment of rock.Here he
sat, with the basket of provisions between his knees, and an air of deep
and solemn mystery in his look and bearing.Not seeing Toto, he still
held the bowl of jelly in his outstretched paw, and opening his
cavernous jaws, was about to send out another rolling thunder-whisper of
"Food!"when Toto sprang quickly on the jelly, and taking a spoon from
the basket, rapped the bear on the nose with it, and then returned to
his charge.The poor hermit submitted meekly to being fed with a spoon, and at every
mouthful seemed to gain strength.A faint color stole into his wan
cheek, his eyes brightened, and before the bowl was two thirds empty, he
actually smiled."I little thought I should ever taste jelly again," he said."Indeed, I
had fully made up my mind that I must starve to death here; for I was
unable to move, and never thought of human aid coming to me in this
lonely spot.Even my poor crow, my faithful companion for many years,
has left me.I trust he has found some other shelter, for he was feeble
and lame, himself.""It was he who showed us the
way here; and he's outside now, talking to--that is--talking to himself,
you know."Why does he not come in, and let me thank him also for his kindness?""He--oh--he--he doesn't like to be
thanked."I
am distressed to think of his staying outside."He isn't a boy," said Toto.what a muddle I'm making of it!He's bigger than a boy, sir, a great deal bigger.And--I hope you won't
mind, but--he's black!""My dear boy, I have no
prejudice against the Ethiopian race.I believe they are generally called either
Caesar or Pompey.Pomp--"

"Oh, stop!""His name _isn't_ Pompey, it's
Bruin.And he wouldn't come in yet if I were to--"

"Cut him into inch pieces!"came rolling like muffled thunder through
the doorway.The old hermit started as if he had been shot.He is the best,
dearest, kindest old fellow _in the world_, and it isn't his fault,
because he was--"

"Born so!"resounded from without; and the poor hermit, now speechless
with terror, could only gasp, and gaze at Toto with eyes of agonized
entreaty."And we might have been bears
ourselves, you know, if we had happened to have them for fathers and
mothers; so--" But here he paused in dismay, for the hermit, without
more ado, quietly fainted away."I am afraid he is dead, or
dying.At this summons the crow came hopping and fluttering in, followed by the
unhappy bear, who skulked along, hugging the wall and making himself as
small as possible, while he cast shamefaced and apologetic glances
toward the bed."Oh, you needn't mind now!"Do
you think he is dead, Crow?But the crow never had; and the three were standing beside the bed in
mute dismay, when suddenly a light flutter of wings was heard, and a
soft voice cooed, "Toto!and the next moment Pigeon Pretty came
flying into the cave, with a bunch of dried leaves in her bill.A glance
showed her the situation, and alighting softly on the old man's breast
she held the leaves to his nostrils, fanning him the while with her
outspread wings.she said, "I have flown so fast I am quite out of breath.You see,
dears, I was afraid that something of this sort might happen, as soon as
I heard of your going.I was in the barn, you know, when you were
talking about it, and getting ready.So I flew to my old nest and got
these leaves, of which I always keep a store on hand.See, he is
beginning to revive already."In truth, the pungent fragrance of the leaves, which now filled the air,
seemed to have a magical effect on the sick man.His eyelids fluttered,
his lips moved, and he muttered faintly, "The bear!The wood-pigeon motioned to Bruin and Toto to withdraw, which they
speedily did, casting remorseful glances at one another.Silently and
sadly they sat down in the porch, and here poor Bruin abandoned himself
to despair, clutching his shaggy hair, and even pulling out several
handfuls of it, while he inwardly called himself by every hard name he
could think of.Toto sat looking gloomily at his boots for a long time,
but finally he said, in a whisper:--

"Cheer up, old fellow!I do suppose I am the
stupidest boy that ever lived.If I had only managed a little
better--hark!Both listened, and heard the soft voice of the wood-pigeon calling,
"Bruin!Hermit understands all
about it now, and is ready to welcome _both_ his visitors."Much amazed, the two friends rose, and slowly and hesitatingly
re-entered the cave, the bear making more desperate efforts even than
before to conceal his colossal bulk.To his astonishment, however, the
hermit, who was now lying propped up by an improvised pillow of dry
moss, greeted him with an unflinching gaze, and even smiled and held out
his hand.Bruin," he said, "I am glad to meet you, sir!This sweet bird has
told me all about you, and I am sincerely pleased to make your
acquaintance.So you have walked ten miles and more to bring help and
comfort to an old man who stole your honey!"But this was more than the good bear could stand.He sat down on the
ground, and thrusting his great shaggy paws into his eyes, fairly began
to blubber.At this, I am ashamed to say, all the others fell to
laughing.First, Toto laughed--but Toto, bless him!was always
laughing; and then Pigeon Pretty laughed; and then Jim Crow; and then
the hermit; and finally, Bruin himself.And so they all laughed
together, till the forest echoes rang, and the woodchucks almost stirred
in their holes.IT was late in the afternoon of the same day.In the cottage at home all
was quiet and peaceful.The grandmother was taking a nap in her room,
with the squirrel curled up comfortably on the pillow beside her.In the
kitchen, the fire and the kettle were having it all their own way, for
though two other members of the family were in the room, they were
either asleep or absorbed in their own thoughts, for they gave no sign
of their presence.The kettle was in its glory, for Bruin had polished
it that very morning, and it shone like the good red gold.It sang its
merriest song, and puffed out clouds of snow-white steam from its
slender spout.I
feel almost sure that I must have turned into gold, for I never used to
look like this.A golden kettle is rather a rare thing, I flatter
myself.It really seems a pity that there is no one here except the
stupid parrot, who has gone to sleep, and that odious raccoon, who
always looks at me as if I were a black pot, and a cracked pot at that."I admire you immensely, as you know, and it is my
greatest pleasure to see myself reflected in your bright face.cr-r-r-r-rickety!"And they performed
really a very creditable duet together.Now it happened that the parrot was not asleep, though she had had the
bad taste to turn her back on the fire and the kettle.She was looking
out of the window, in fact, and wondering when the wood-pigeon would
come back.Though not a bird of specially affectionate nature, Miss Mary
was still very fond of Pigeon Pretty, and always missed her when she
was away.This afternoon had seemed particularly long, for no one had
been in the kitchen save <DW53>, with whom she was not on very good terms.Now, she thought, it was surely time for her friend to return; and she
stretched her neck, and peered out of the window, hoping to catch the
flutter of the soft brown wings.Instead of this, however, she caught
sight of something else, which made her start and ruffle up her
feathers, and look again with a very different expression.Outside the cottage stood a man,--an ill-looking fellow, with a heavy
pack strapped on his back.He was looking all about him, examining the
outside of the cottage carefully, and evidently listening for any sound
that might come from within.All being silent, he stepped to the window
(not Miss Mary's window, but the other), and took a long survey of the
kitchen; and then, seeing no living creature in it (for the raccoon
under the table and the parrot on her perch were both hidden from his
view), he laid down his pack, opened the door, and quietly stepped in.An ill-looking fellow, Miss Mary had thought him at the first glance;
but now, as she noiselessly turned on her perch and looked more closely
at him, she thought his aspect positively villanous.He had a hooked
nose and a straggling red beard, and his little green eyes twinkled with
an evil light as he looked about the cosey kitchen, with all its neat
and comfortable appointments.First he stepped to the cupboard, and after examining its contents he
drew out a mutton-bone (which had been put away for Bruin), a hunch of
bread, and a cranberry tart, on which he proceeded to make a hearty
meal, without troubling himself about knife or fork.He ate hurriedly,
looking about him the while,--though, curiously enough, he saw neither
of the two pairs of bright eyes which were following his every movement.The parrot on her perch sat motionless, not a feather stirring; the
raccoon under the table lay crouched against the wall, as still as if
he were carved in stone.Even the kettle had stopped singing, and only
sent out a low, perturbed murmur from time to time.His meal finished, the rascal--his confidence increasing as the moments
went by without interruption--proceeded to warm himself well by the
fire, and then on tiptoe to walk about the room, peering into cupboards
and lockers, opening boxes and pulling out drawers.The parrot's blood
boiled with indignation at the sight of this "unfeathered vulture," as
she mentally termed him, ransacking all the Madam's tidy and well-kept
stores; but when he opened the drawer in which lay the six silver
teaspoons (the pride of the cottage), and the porringer that Toto had
inherited from his great-grandfather,--when he opened this drawer, and
with a low whistle of satisfaction drew the precious treasures from
their resting-place, Miss Mary could contain herself no longer, but
clapped her wings and cried in a clear distinct voice, "Stop thief!"The man started violently, and dropping the silver back into the drawer,
looked about him in great alarm.At first he saw no one, but presently
his eyes fell on the parrot, who sat boldly facing him, her yellow eyes
gleaming with anger.His terror changed to fury, and with a muttered
oath he stepped forward."You'll never say 'Stop thief'
again, my fine bird, for I'll wring your neck before I'm half a minute
older."[Illustration: But at this last mishap the robber, now fairly beside
himself, rushed headlong from the cottage.--PAGE 163.]He stretched his hand toward the parrot, who for her part prepared to
fly at him and fight for her life; but at that moment something
happened.There was a rushing in the air; there was a yell as if a dozen
wild-cats had broken loose, and a heavy body fell on the robber's
back,--a body which had teeth and claws (an endless number of claws, it
seemed, and all as sharp as daggers); a body which yelled and scratched
and bit and tore, till the ruffian, half mad with terror and pain,
yelled louder than his assailant.Vainly trying to loosen the clutch
of those iron claws, the wretch staggered backward against the hob.Was
it accident, or did the kettle by design give a plunge, and come down
with a crash, sending a stream of boiling water over his legs?But at this last mishap the robber,
now fairly beside himself, rushed headlong from the cottage, and still
bearing his terrible burden, fled screaming down the road.At the same moment the door of the grandmother's room was opened
hurriedly, and the old lady cried, in a trembling voice, "What has
happened?"<DW53> has--has just
stepped out, with--in fact, with an acquaintance.He will be back
directly, no doubt.""Was that--"

"The acquaintance, dear Madam!""He was
excited!--about something, and he raised his voice, I confess, higher
than good breeding usually allows.The good old lady, still much mystified, though her fears were set at
rest by the parrot's quiet confidence, returned to her room to put on
her cap, and to smooth the pretty white curls which her Toto loved.No
sooner was the door closed than the squirrel, who had been fairly
dancing up and down with curiosity and eagerness, opened a fire of
questions:--

"Who was it?Why didn't you want Madam to know?"Miss Mary entered into a full account of the thrilling adventure, and
had but just finished it when in walked the raccoon, his eyes sparkling,
his tail cocked in its airiest way.cried the parrot, eagerly, "is he gone?""Yes, my dear, he is gone!"Why didn't you come too, Miss Mary?You might
have held on by his hair.Yes, I went on
quite a good bit with him, just to show him the way, you know.And then
I bade him good-by, and begged him to come again; but he didn't say he
would."<DW53> shook himself, and fairly chuckled with glee, as did also his two
companions; but presently Miss Mary, quitting her perch, flew to the
table, and holding out her claw to the raccoon, said gravely:--

"<DW53>, you have saved my life, and perhaps the Madam's and Cracker's
too.Give me your paw, and receive my warmest thanks for your timely
aid.We have not been the best of friends, lately," she added, "but I
trust all will be different now.And the next time you are invited to a
party, if you fancy a feather or so to complete your toilet, you have
only to mention it, and I shall be happy to oblige you.""And for my part, Miss Mary," responded the raccoon warmly, "I beg you
to consider me the humblest of your servants from this day forth.If you
fancy any little relish, such as snails or fat spiders, as a change from
your every-day diet, it will be a pleasure to me to procure them for
you.Beauty," he continued, with his most gallant bow, "is enchanting,
and valor is enrapturing; but beauty and valor _combined_, are--"

"Oh, come!"said the squirrel, who felt rather crusty, perhaps, because
he had not seen the fun, and so did not care for the fine speeches,
"stop bowing and scraping to each other, you two, and let us put this
distracted-looking room in order before Madam comes in again.Pick up
the kettle, will you, <DW53>?the water is running all over the
floor."The raccoon did not answer, being apparently very busy setting the
chairs straight; so Cracker repeated his request, in a sharper voice."Do you hear me, <DW53>?I cannot do it
myself, for it is twice as big as I am, but I should think you could
lift it easily, now that it is empty."The raccoon threw a perturbed glance at the kettle, and then said in a
tone which tried to be nonchalant, "Oh!It will
get up, I suppose, when it feels like it.If it should ask me to help
it, of course I would; but perhaps it may prefer the floor for a change.I--I often lie on the floor, myself," he added.The raccoon beckoned him aside, and said in a low tone, "My good
Cracker, Toto _says_ a great many things, and no doubt he thinks they
are all true.But he is a young boy, and, let me tell you, he does _not_
know everything in the world.If that thing is not alive, why did it
jump off its seat just at the critical moment, and pour hot water over
the robber's legs?"And I don't deny that it was a great help, Cracker, and that I was
very glad the kettle did it.when a creature has no more
self-respect than to lie there for a quarter of an hour, with its head
on the other side of the room, without making the smallest attempt to
get up and put itself together again, why, I tell you frankly _I_ don't
feel much like assisting it.You never knew one of _us_ to behave in
that sort of way, did you, now?""But then, if any of us were to lose
our heads, we should be dead, shouldn't we?""And when that thing loses
its head, it _isn't_ dead.It can go without
its head for an hour!I've seen it, when Toto took it off--the head, I
mean--and forgot to put it on again.I tell you, it just _pretends_ to
be dead, so that it can be taken care of, and carried about like a baby,
and given water whenever it is thirsty.A secret, underhand, sly
creature, I call it, and I sha'n't touch it to put its head on again!"And that was all the thanks the kettle got for its pains.CHAPTER X.


WHEN Toto came home, as he did just when night was closing in around the
little cottage, he was whistling merrily, as usual; and the first sound
of his clear and tuneful whistle brought <DW53>, Cracker, and Miss Mary
all running to the door, to greet, to tell, and to warn him.The boy
listened wide-eyed to the story of the attempted robbery, and at the end
of it he drew a long breath of relief."I am _so_ glad you didn't let Granny know!"what a
good fellow you are, <DW53>!And Miss Mary, you are a
trump, and I would give you a golden nose-ring like your Princess's if
you had a nose to wear it on.To think of you two defending the castle,
and putting the enemy to flight, horse, foot, and dragoons!""I don't think he had any
about him, unless it was concealed.He had no horse, either; but he had
two feet,--and very ugly ones they were.He danced on them when the
kettle poured hot water over his legs,--danced higher than ever you did,
Toto."laughed Toto, who was in high spirits.But," he added, "it is so dark that you do not see our
guest, whom I have brought home for a little visit.Thus adjured, the crow hopped solemnly forward, and made his best bow to
the three inmates, who in turn saluted him, each after his or her
fashion.The raccoon was gracious and condescending, the squirrel
familiar and friendly, the parrot frigidly polite, though inwardly
resenting that a crow should be presented to her,--to _her_, the
favorite attendant of the late lamented Princess of Central
Africa,--without her permission having been asked first.As for the
crow, he stood on one leg and blinked at them all in a manner which
meant a great deal or nothing at all, just as you chose to take it.he said, gravely, "it is with pleasure that I
make your acquaintance.May this day be the least happy of your lives!Lady Parrot," he added, addressing himself particularly to Miss Mary,
"grant me the honor of leading you within.The evening air is chill for
one so delicate and fragile."Miss Mary, highly delighted at being addressed by such a stately title
as "Lady Parrot," relaxed at once the severity of her mien, and
gracefully sidled into the house in company with the sable-clad
stranger, while Toto and the two others followed, much amused.After a hearty supper, in the course of which Toto related as much of
his and Bruin's adventures in the hermit's cave as he thought proper,
the whole family gathered around the blazing hearth.Toto brought the
pan of apples and the dish of nuts; the grandmother took up her
knitting, and said, with a smile: "And who will tell us a story, this
evening?We have had none for two evenings now, and it is high time that
we heard something new.Cracker, my dear, is it not your turn?""I think it is," said the squirrel, hastily cramming a couple of very
large nuts into his cheek-pouches, "and if you like, I will tell you a
story that Mrs.It is about a cow that
jumped over the moon.""Why, I've known that story ever since I was a baby!And it isn't a story, either, it's a rhyme,--

    "Hey diddle diddle,
     The cat and the fiddle,
     The cow--"

"Yes, yes!I know, Toto," interrupted the squirrel."She told me that,
too, and said it was a pack of lies, and that people like you didn't
know anything about the real truth of the matter.So now, if you will
just listen to me, I will tell you how it really happened."There once was a young cow, and she had a calf.said Toto, in rather a provoking manner."No, it isn't, it's only the beginning," said the little squirrel,
indignantly; "and if you would rather tell the story yourself, Toto, you
are welcome to do so."Crackey," said Toto, apologetically."Won't do so again,
Crackey; go on, that's a dear!"and the squirrel, who never bore malice
for more than two minutes, put his little huff away, and continued:--

       *       *       *       *       *

This young cow, you see, she was very fond of her calf,--very fond
indeed she was,--and when they took it away from her, she was very
unhappy, and went about roaring all day long.There's a
piece of poetry about it that I learned once:--

    "'The lowing herd--'

do something or other, I don't remember what.""'The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,'"

quoted the grandmother, softly."Yarn, or a chain-pump like the
one in the yard, or what?""I don't know what you mean by _low_, Toto!"said the squirrel, without
noticing <DW53>'s remarks."Your cow roared so loud the other day that I
fell off her horn into the hay.I don't see anything _low_ in that.""Why, Cracker, can't you understand?""They _low_ when they
_moo_!I don't mean that they moo _low_, but'moo' _is_ 'low,' don't you
see?""No, I do _not_ see!""And I don't
believe there is anything _to_ see, I don't.At this point Madam interfered, and with a few gentle words made the
matter clear, and smoothed the ruffled feathers--or rather fur.The raccoon, who had been listening with ears pricked up, and keen eyes
glancing from one to the other of the disputants, now murmured, "Ah,
yes!and relapsed
into his former attitude of graceful and dignified ease.The squirrel repeated to himself, "Moo!several
times, shook his head, refreshed himself with a nut, and finally, at the
general request, continued his story:

       *       *       *       *       *

So, as I said, this young cow was very sad, and she looed--I mean
mowed--all day to express her grief.And she thought, "If I could only
know where my calf is, it would not be quite so dreadfully bad.But they
would not tell me where they were taking him, though I asked them
politely in seven different tones, which is more than any other cow here
can use."Now, when she was thinking these thoughts it chanced that the maid came
to milk the cows, and with the maid came a young man, who was talking
very earnestly to her."Doesn't thee know me well enough?""I knows a moon-calf when I sees him!"says the maid; and with that she
boxed his ears, and sat down to milk the cow, and he went away in a
huff.But the cow heard what the maid said, and began to wonder what
moon-calves were, and whether they were anything like her calf.Presently, when the maid had gone away with the pail of milk, she said
to the Oldest Ox, who happened to be standing near,--

"Old Ox, pray tell me, what is a moon-calf?"The Oldest Ox did not know anything about moon-calves, but he had no
idea of betraying his ignorance to anybody, much less to a very young
cow; so he answered promptly, "It's a calf that lives in the moon, of
course.""Is it--are they--like other calves?"inquired the cow, timidly, "or a
different sort of animal?""When a creature is called a calf," replied the Ox, severely, "it _is_ a
calf.If it were a cat, a hyena, or a toad with three tails, it would be
called by its own name.Then he shut his eyes and pretended to be asleep, for he did not like to
answer questions on matters of which he knew nothing; it fatigued his
brain, and oxen should always avoid fatigue of the brain.But the young cow had one more question to ask, and could not rest till
it was answered; so mustering all her courage, she said, desperately,
"Oh, Old Ox!before you go to sleep, please--_please_, tell me if people
ever take calves to the moon from here?"and in a few minutes he really was asleep.She thought so hard that when
the farmer's boy came to drive the cattle into the barn, she hardly saw
where she was going, but stumbled first against the door and then
against the wall, and finally walked into Old Brindle's stall instead of
her own, and got well prodded by the latter's horns in consequence."I must give her a warm mash,
and cut an inch or two off her tail to-morrow."Next day the cows were driven out into the pasture, for the weather was
warm, and they found it a pleasant change from the barn-yard.They
cropped the honey-clover, well seasoned with buttercups and with just
enough dandelions scattered about to "give it character," as Mother
Brindle said.They stood knee-deep in the cool, clear stream which
flowed under the willows, and lay down in the shade of the great
oak-tree, and altogether were as happy as cows can possibly be.She cared nothing for any of the pleasures
which she had once enjoyed so keenly; she only walked up and down, up
and down, thinking of her lost calf, and looking for the moon.For she
had fully made up her mind by this time that her darling Bossy had been
taken to the moon, and had become a moon-calf; and she was wondering
whether she might not see or hear something of him when the moon rose.The day passed, and when the evening was still all rosy in the west, a
great globe of shining silver rose up in the east.It was the full moon,
coming to take the place of the sun, who had put on his nightcap and
gone to bed.The young cow ran towards it, stretching out her neck, and
calling,--

"Bossy!Then she listened, and thought she heard a distant voice which said,
"There!"she cried, frantically, "I knew it!Bossy is now a
moon-calf.Something must be done about it at once, if I only knew
what!"And she ran to Mother Brindle, who was standing by the fence, talking to
the neighbor's black cow,--her with the spotted nose."Have you ever had a calf taken to the
moon?My calf, my Bossy, is there, and is now a moon-calf.tell me, how to get at him, I beseech you!"You are excited, and will injure your milk, and that would
reflect upon the whole herd.As for your calf, why should you be better
off than other people?I have lost ten calves, the finest that ever were
seen, and I never made half such a fuss about them as you make over this
puny little red creature.""But he is _there_, in the moon!""I must find him
and get him down."Decidedly, your wits must be in the moon, my dear," said the neighbor's
black cow, not unkindly.Who ever heard
of calves in the moon?Not I, for one; and I am not more ignorant than
others, perhaps."The red cow was about to reply, when suddenly across the meadow came
ringing the farm-boy's call, "Co, Boss!said Mother Brindle, "can it really be milking-time?And you,
child," she added, turning to the red cow, "come straight home with me.I heard James promise you a warm mash, and that will be the best thing
for you."But at these words the young cow started, and with a wild bellow ran to
the farthest end of the pasture.she cried, staring wildly up
at the silver globe, which was rising steadily higher and higher in the
sky, "you are going away from me!Jump down from the moon, and come to
your mother!_Come!_"

And then a distant voice, floating softly down through the air,
answered, "Come!"My darling calls me, and I go.I will
go to the moon; I will be a moon-cow!She ran forward like an antelope, gave a sudden leap into the air, and
went up, up, up,--over the haystacks, over the trees, over the
clouds,--up among the stars.in her frantic desire to reach the moon she overshot the
mark; jumped clear over it, and went down on the other side, nobody
knows where, and she never was seen or heard of again.And Mother Brindle, when she saw what had happened, ran straight home
and gobbled up the warm mash before any of the other cows could get
there, and ate so fast that she made herself ill.*       *       *       *       *

"That is the whole story," said the squirrel, seriously; "and it seemed
to me a very curious one, I confess.""But there's nothing about the others in
it,--the cat and fiddle, and the little dog, you know.""Well, they _weren't_ in it really, at all!"Cow ought to be a good judge of lies, I
should say.""What can be expected," said the raccoon loftily, "from a creature who
eats hay?Be good enough to hand me those nuts, Toto, will you?The
story has positively made me hungry,--a thing that has not happened--"

"Since dinner-time!""Wonderful indeed, <DW53>!But I shall
hand the nuts to Cracker first, for he has told us a very good story,
whether it is true or not."THE apples and nuts went round again and again, and for a few minutes
nothing was heard save the cracking of shells and the gnawing of sharp
white teeth.At length the parrot said, meditatively:--

"That was a very stupid cow, though!"Well, I don't think they are what you would call brilliant, as a rule,"
Toto admitted; "but they are generally good, and that is better.""That is probably why we have no
cows in Central Africa.Our animals being all, without exception, clever
_and_ good, there is really no place for creatures of the sort you
describe.""How about the bogghun, Miss Mary?"asked the raccoon, slyly, with a
wink at Toto.The parrot ruffled up her feathers, and was about to make a sharp reply;
but suddenly remembering the raccoon's brave defence of her an hour
before, she smoothed her plumage again, and replied gently,--

"I confess that I forgot the bogghun, <DW53>.It is indeed a treacherous
and a wicked creature!--a dark blot on the golden roll of African
animals."She paused and sighed, then added, as if to change the
subject, "But, come!If not, I
have a short one in mind, which I will tell you, if you wish."All assented joyfully, and Miss Mary, without more delay, related the
story of


THE THREE REMARKS.There was once a princess, the most beautiful princess that ever was
seen.Her hair was black and soft as the raven's wing [here the Crow
blinked, stood on one leg and plumed himself, evidently highly
flattered by the allusion]; her eyes were like stars dropped in a pool
of clear water, and her speech like the first tinkling cascade of the
baby Nile.She was also wise, graceful, and gentle, so that one would
have thought she must be the happiest princess in the world.No one knew whether it was the fault of her
nurse, or a peculiarity born with her; but the sad fact remained, that
no matter what was said to her, she could only reply in one of three
phrases.The first was,--

"What is the price of butter?"The second, "Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"And the third, "With all my heart!"You may well imagine what a great misfortune this was to a young and
lively princess.How could she join in the sports and dances of the
noble youths and maidens of the court?She could not always be silent,
neither could she always say, "With all my heart!"though this was her
favorite phrase, and she used it whenever she possibly could; and it was
not at all pleasant, when some gallant knight asked her whether she
would rather play croquet or Aunt Sally, to be obliged to reply, "What
is the price of butter?"On certain occasions, however, the princess actually found her infirmity
of service to her.She could always put an end suddenly to any
conversation that did not please her, by interposing with her first or
second remark; and they were also a very great assistance to her when,
as happened nearly every day, she received an offer of marriage.Emperors, kings, princes, dukes, earls, marquises, viscounts, baronets,
and many other lofty personages knelt at her feet, and offered her their
hands, hearts, and other possessions of greater or less value.But for
all her suitors the princess had but one answer.Fixing her deep radiant
eyes on them, she would reply with thrilling earnestness, "_Has_ your
grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and this always impressed the suitors
so deeply that they retired weeping to a neighboring monastery, where
they hung up their armor in the chapel, and taking the vows, passed the
remainder of their lives mostly in flogging themselves, wearing hair
shirts, and putting dry toast-crumbs in their beds.Now, when the king found that all his best nobles were turning into
monks, he was greatly displeased, and said to the princess:--

"My daughter, it is high time that all this nonsense came to an end.The
next time a respectable person asks you to marry him, you will say,
'With all my heart!'But this the princess could not endure, for she had never yet seen a man
whom she was willing to marry.Nevertheless, she feared her father's
anger, for she knew that he always kept his word; so that very night she
slipped down the back stairs of the palace, opened the back door, and
ran away out into the wide world.She wandered for many days, over mountain and moor, through fen and
through forest, until she came to a fair city.Here all the bells were
ringing, and the people shouting and flinging caps into the air; for
their old king was dead, and they were just about to crown a new one.The new king was a stranger, who had come to the town only the day
before; but as soon as he heard of the old monarch's death, he told the
people that he was a king himself, and as he happened to be without a
kingdom at that moment, he would be quite willing to rule over them.The
people joyfully assented, for the late king had left no heir; and now
all the preparations had been completed.The crown had been polished up,
and a new tip put on the sceptre, as the old king had quite spoiled it
by poking the fire with it for upwards of forty years.When the people saw the beautiful princess, they welcomed her with many
bows, and insisted on leading her before the new king."Who knows but that they may be related?""They both
came from the same direction, and both are strangers."Accordingly the princess was led to the market-place, where the king was
sitting in royal state.He had a fat, red, shining face, and did not
look like the kings whom she had been in the habit of seeing; but
nevertheless the princess made a graceful courtesy, and then waited to
hear what he would say.The new king seemed rather embarrassed when he saw that it was a
princess who appeared before him; but he smiled graciously, and said, in
a smooth oily voice,--

"I trust your 'Ighness is quite well.And 'ow did yer 'Ighness leave yer
pa and ma?"At these words the princess raised her head and looked fixedly at the
red-faced king; then she replied, with scornful distinctness,--

"What is the price of butter?"At these words an alarming change came over the king's face.The red
faded from it, and left it a livid green; his teeth chattered; his eyes
stared, and rolled in their sockets; while the sceptre dropped from his
trembling hand and fell at the princess's feet.For the truth was, this
was no king at all, but a retired butterman, who had laid by a little
money at his trade, and had thought of setting up a public house; but
chancing to pass through this city at the very time when they were
looking for a king, it struck him that he might just as well fill the
vacant place as any one else.No one had thought of his being an
impostor; but when the princess fixed her clear eyes on him and asked
him that familiar question, which he had been in the habit of hearing
many times a day for a great part of his life, the guilty butterman
thought himself detected, and shook in his guilty shoes.Hastily
descending from his throne, he beckoned he princess into a side-chamber,
and closing the door, besought her in moving terms not to betray him."Here," he said, "is a bag of rubies as big as pigeon's eggs.There are
six thousand of them, and I 'umbly beg your 'Ighness to haccept them as
a slight token hof my hesteem, if your 'Ighness will kindly consent to
spare a respeckable tradesman the disgrace of being hexposed."The princess reflected, and came to the conclusion that, after all, a
butterman might make as good a king as any one else; so she took the
rubies with a gracious little nod, and departed, while all the people
shouted, "Hooray!"and followed her, waving their hats and kerchiefs, to
the gates of the city.With her bag of rubies over her shoulder, the fair princess now pursued
her journey, and fared forward over heath and hill, through brake and
through brier.After several days she came to a deep forest, which she
entered without hesitation, for she knew no fear.She had not gone a
hundred paces under the arching limes, when she was met by a band of
robbers, who stopped her and asked what she did in their forest, and
what she carried in her bag.They were fierce, black-bearded men, armed
to the teeth with daggers, cutlasses, pistols, dirks, hangers,
blunderbusses, and other defensive weapons; but the princess gazed
calmly on them, and said haughtily,--

"Has your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of supplication.--PAGE
195.]The robbers started back in dismay, crying, "The
countersign!"Then they hastily lowered their weapons, and assuming
attitudes of abject humility, besought the princess graciously to
accompany them to their master's presence.With a lofty gesture she
signified assent, and the cringing, trembling bandits led her on through
the forest till they reached an open glade, into which the sunbeams
glanced right merrily.Here, under a broad oak-tree which stood in the
centre of the glade, reclined a man of gigantic stature and commanding
mien, with a whole armory of weapons displayed upon his person.Hastening to their chief, the robbers conveyed to him, in agitated
whispers, the circumstance of their meeting the princess, and of her
unexpected reply to their questions.Hardly seeming to credit their
statement, the gigantic chieftain sprang to his feet, and advancing
toward the princess with a respectful reverence, begged her to repeat
the remark which had so disturbed his men.With a royal air, and in
clear and ringing tones, the princess repeated,--

"_Has_ your grandmother sold her mangle yet?"and gazed steadfastly at
the robber chief.He turned deadly pale, and staggered against a tree, which alone
prevented him from falling.The enemy is without doubt
close at hand, and all is over.Yet," he added with more firmness, and
with an appealing glance at the princess, "yet there may be one chance
left for us.If this gracious lady will consent to go forward, instead
of returning through the wood, we may yet escape with our lives.and here he and the whole band assumed attitudes of
supplication, "consider, I pray you, whether it would really add to your
happiness to betray to the advancing army a few poor foresters, who earn
their bread by the sweat of their brow.Here," he continued, hastily
drawing something from a hole in the oak-tree, "is a bag containing ten
thousand sapphires, each as large as a pullet's egg.If you will
graciously deign to accept them, and to pursue your journey in the
direction I shall indicate, the Red Chief of the Rustywhanger will be
your slave forever."The princess, who of course knew that there was no army in the
neighborhood, and who moreover did not in the least care which way she
went, assented to the Red Chief's proposition, and taking the bag of
sapphires, bowed her farewell to the grateful robbers, and followed
their leader down a ferny path which led to the farther end of the
forest.When they came to the open country, the robber chieftain took
his leave of the princess, with profound bows and many protestations of
devotion, and returned to his band, who were already preparing to plunge
into the impenetrable thickets of the midforest.The princess, meantime, with her two bags of gems on her shoulders,
fared forward with a light heart, by dale and by down, through moss and
through meadow.By-and-by she came to a fair high palace, built all of
marble and shining jasper, with smooth lawns about it, and sunny gardens
of roses and gillyflowers, from which the air blew so sweet that it was
a pleasure to breathe it.The princess stood still for a moment, to
taste the sweetness of this air, and to look her fill at so fair a spot;
and as she stood there, it chanced that the palace-gates opened, and the
young king rode out with his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.Now when the king saw a right fair princess standing alone at his
palace-gate, her rich garments dusty and travel-stained, and two heavy
sacks hung upon her shoulders, he was filled with amazement; and leaping
from his steed, like the gallant knight that he was, he besought her to
tell him whence she came and whither she was going, and in what way he
might be of service to her.But the princess looked down at her little dusty shoes, and answered
never a word; for she had seen at the first glance how fair and goodly a
king this was, and she would not ask him the price of butter, nor
whether his grandmother had sold her mangle yet.But she thought in her
heart, "Now, I have never, in all my life, seen a man to whom I would so
willingly say, 'With all my heart!'The king marvelled much at her silence, and presently repeated his
questions, adding, "And what do you carry so carefully in those two
sacks, which seem over-heavy for your delicate shoulders?"Still holding her eyes downcast, the princess took a ruby from one bag,
and a sapphire from the other, and in silence handed them to the king,
for she willed that he should know she was no beggar, even though her
shoes were dusty.Thereat all the nobles were filled with amazement, for
no such gems had ever been seen in that country.But the king looked steadfastly at the princess, and said, "Rubies are
fine, and sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I could but see those
eyes of yours, I warrant that the gems would look pale and dull beside
them."At that the princess raised her clear dark eyes, and looked at the king
and smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced straight to his heart, so
that he fell on his knees and cried:

"Ah!sweet princess, now do I know that thou art the love for whom I
have waited so long, and whom I have sought through so many lands.Give
me thy white hand, and tell me, either by word or by sign, that thou
wilt be my queen and my bride!"And the princess, like a right royal maiden as she was, looked him
straight in the eyes, and giving him her little white hand, answered
bravely, "_With all my heart!_"




CHAPTER XII.NOW, if we had looked into the hermit's cave a few days after this, we
should have seen a very pleasant sight.The good old man was sitting up
on his narrow couch, with his lame leg on a stool before him.On another
stool sat our worthy friend Bruin, with a backgammon-board on his knees,
and the two were deep in the mysteries of Russian backgammon."Dear, dear, what luck you do have!""Yes," said the hermit, "this finishes the game and the rubber.But just
remember, my friend, how you beat me yesterday.I was gammoned over and
over again, with never a doublet to save me from ruin."yesterday was one
of my good days.And so to-day you have gammoned me back again.I
suppose that is why the game is called back-gammon, hey?""And how have you been in the habit of playing?""You spoke of playing last winter, you know.Whom did you play with, for
example?""With myself," said the hermit,--"the right hand against the left.I
taught my crow the game once, but it didn't work very well.He could not
lift the dice-box, and could only throw the dice by running against the
box, and upsetting it.This was apt to disarrange the pieces, you see;
and as he would not trust me to throw for him, we gave it up.""And what else did you do in the way
of amusement?""I read, chiefly," replied the old man."You see I have a good many
books, and they are all good ones, which will bear reading many times.""That is _one_ thing about you people that I
cannot understand,--the reading of books.Seems so senseless, you know,
when you can use your eyes for other things.But, tell me," he added,
"have you never thought of trying our way of passing the winter?It is
certainly much the best way, when one is alone.Choose a comfortable
place, like this, for example, curl yourself up in the warmest corner,
and there you are, with nothing to do but to sleep till spring comes
again.""I am afraid I could not do that," said the hermit with a smile."We are
made differently, you see.I cannot sleep more than a few hours at a
time, at any season of the year.""That makes
all the difference, you know.Have you ever _tried_ sucking your paw?"The hermit was forced to admit that he never had.well, you really must try it some day," said Bruin."There is
nothing like it, after all.I will confess to you," he
added in a low tone, and looking cautiously about to make sure that they
were alone, "that I have missed it sadly this winter.In most respects
this has been the happiest season of my life, and I have enjoyed it more
than I can tell you; but still there are times,--when I am tired, you
know, or the weather is dull, or <DW53> is a little trying, as he is
sometimes,--times when I feel as if I would give a great deal for a
quiet corner where I could suck my paw and sleep for a week or two.""Couldn't you manage it, somehow?"asked the hermit, sympathetically."<DW53> thinks the Madam
would not like it.He is very genteel, you know,--very genteel indeed,
<DW53> is; and he says it wouldn't be at all 'the thing' for me to suck
my paw anywhere about the place.I never know just what 'thing' he means
when he says that, but it's a favorite expression of his; and he
certainly knows a great deal about good manners.Besides," he added,
more cheerfully, "there is always plenty of work to do, and that is the
best thing to keep one awake.Baldhead, it is time for your
dinner, sir; and here am I sitting and talking, when I ought to be
warming your broth!"With these words the excellent bear arose, put away the backgammon
board, and proceeded to build up the fire, hang the kettle, and put the
broth on to warm, all as deftly as if he had been a cook all his life.He stirred and tasted, shook his head, tasted again, and then said,--

"You haven't the top of a young pine-tree anywhere about the house, I
suppose?It would give this broth such a nice flavor.""I don't generally keep a
large stock of such things on hand.But I fancy the broth will be very
good without it, to judge from the last I had.""Do you ever put frogs in your
broth?""Whole ones, you know, rolled in a batter,
just like dumplings?""_No!_" said the hermit, quickly and decidedly."I am quite sure I
should not like them, thank you,--though it was very kind of you to make
the suggestion!"he added, seeing that Bruin looked disappointed."You have no idea how nice they are," said the good bear, rather sadly."But you are so strange, you people!I never could induce Toto or Madam
to try them, either.I invented the soup myself,--at least the
frog-dumpling part of it,--and made it one day as a little surprise for
them.But when I told them what the dumplings were, Toto choked and
rolled on the floor, and Madam was quite ill at the very thought, though
she had not begun to eat her soup.So <DW53> and Cracker and I had it all
to ourselves, and uncommonly good it was.It's a pity for people to be
so prejudiced."The good hermit was choking a little himself, for some reason or other,
but he looked very grave when Bruin turned toward him for assent, and
said, "Quite so!"The broth being now ready, the bear proceeded to arrange a tray neatly,
and set it before his patient, who took up his wooden spoon and fell to
with right good-will.The good bear stood watching him with great
satisfaction; and it was really a pity that there was no one there to
watch the bear himself, for as he stood there with a clean cloth over
his arm, his head on one side, and his honest face beaming with pride
and pleasure, he was very well worth looking at.At this moment a sharp cry of terror was heard outside, then a quick
whirr of wings, and the next moment the wood-pigeon darted into the
cave, closely pursued by a large hawk.She was quite
exhausted, and with one more piteous cry she fell fainting at Bruin's
feet.In another instant the hawk would have pounced upon her, but that
instant never came for the winged marauder.Instead, something or
somebody pounced on _him_.A thick white covering enveloped him,
entangling his claws, binding down his wings, well-nigh stifling him.He
felt himself seized in an iron grasp and lifted bodily into the air,
while a deep, stern voice exclaimed,--

"Now, sir!have you anything to say for yourself, before I wring your
neck?"Then the covering was drawn back from his head, and he found himself
face to face with the great bear, whom he knew perfectly well by sight.But he was a bold fellow, too well used to danger to shrink from it,
even in so terrible a form as this; and his fierce yellow eyes met the
stern gaze of his captor without shrinking.repeated the bear, "before I wring your ugly
neck?"replied the hawk, sullenly, "wring away."This answer rather disconcerted our friend Bruin, who, as he sometimes
said sadly to himself, had "lost all taste for killing;" so he only
shook Master Hawk a little, and said,--

"Do you know of any reason why your neck should _not_ be wrung?"Are you
afraid, you great clumsy monster?""I'll soon show you whether I am afraid or not!""If _you_ had had
nothing to eat for a week, you'd have eaten her long before this, I'll
be bound!"Here Bruin began to rub his nose with his disengaged paw, and to look
helplessly about him, as he always did when disturbed in mind.he exclaimed, "you hawk, what do you mean by that?"It _is_ rather short," said Bruin; "but--yes!why, of course, _any one_
can dig, if he wants to.""Ask that old thing," said the hawk, nodding toward the hermit, "whether
_he_ ever dug with his beak; and it's twice as long as mine."replied Bruin, promptly; but then he faltered, for
it suddenly occurred to him that he had never seen either Toto or the
Madam dig with their noses; and it was with some hesitation that he
asked:

"Mr.but--a--have you ever tried digging for roots
in the ground--with your beak--I mean, nose?"The hermit looked up gravely, as he sat with Pigeon Pretty on his knee."No, my friend," he said with great seriousness, "I have never tried
it, and doubt if I could do it.I can dig with my hands, though," he
added, seeing the good bear look more and more puzzled."But you see this bird has no hands, though he
has very ugly claws; so that doesn't help-- Well!"he cried, breaking
off short, and once more addressing the hawk."I don't see anything for
it _but_ to wring your neck, do you?After all, it will keep you from
being hungry again."But here the soft voice of the wood-pigeon interposed.Bruin,
dear," cried the gentle bird."Give him something to eat, and let him
go.If he had eaten nothing for a week, I am sure he was not to blame
for pursuing the first eatable creature he saw.Remember," she added in
a lower tone, which only the bear could hear, "that before this winter,
any of us would have done the same."Bruin scratched his head helplessly; the hawk turned his yellow eyes on
Pigeon Pretty with a strange look, but said nothing.But now the hermit
saw that it was time for him to interfere."Pigeon Pretty," he said, "you are right, as usual.Bruin, my friend,
bring your prisoner here, and let him finish this excellent broth, into
which I have crumbled some bread.I will answer for Master Hawk's good
behavior, for the present at least," he added, "for I know that he comes
of an old and honorable family."In five minutes the hawk was sitting quietly on the
hermit's knee, sipping broth, pursuing the floating bits of bread in the
bowl, and submitting to have his soft black plumage stroked, with the
best grace in the world.On the good man's other knee sat Pigeon Pretty,
now quite recovered from her fright and fatigue, her soft eyes beaming
with pleasure; while Bruin squatted opposite them, looking from one to
the other, and assuring himself over and over again that Pigeon Pretty
was "a most astonishing bird!'pon my word, a _most_ astonishing bird!"His meal ended, the stranger wiped his beak politely on his feathers,
plumed himself, and thanked his hosts for their hospitality, with a
stately courtesy which contrasted strangely with his former sullen and
ferocious bearing.The fierce glare was gone from his eyes, which were,
however, still strangely bright; and with his glossy plumage smooth, and
his head held proudly erect, he really was a noble-looking bird."Long is it, indeed," he said, "since any one has spoken a kind word to
Ger-Falcon.It will not be forgotten, I assure you.We are a wild and
lawless family,--our beak against every one, and every one's claw
against us,--and yet, as you observed, Sir Baldhead, we are an old and
honorable race.for the brave, brave days of old, when my sires
were the honored companions of kings and princes!My grandfather seventy
times removed was served by an emperor, the obsequious monarch carrying
him every day on his own wrist to the hunting.He ate from a golden
dish, and wore a collar of gems about his neck.what would be
the feelings of that noble ancestor if he could see his descendant a
hunted outlaw, persecuted by the sons of those very men who once courted
and caressed him, and supporting a precarious existence by the ignoble
spoils of barn-yards and hen-roosts!"The hawk paused, overcome by these recollections of past glory, and the
good bear said kindly,--

"Dear!And how did this melancholy change come
about, pray?"replied the hawk, "ignoble fashion!The race of
men degenerated, and occupied themselves with less lofty sports than
hawking.My family, left to themselves, knew not what to do.They had
been trained to pursue, to overtake, to slay, through long generations;
they were unfitted for anything else.But when they began to lead this
life on their own account, man, always ungrateful, turned upon them, and
persecuted them for the very deeds which had once been the delight and
pride of his fickle race.So we fell from our high estate, lower and
lower, till the present representative of the Ger-Falcon is the poor
creature you behold before you."The hawk bowed in proud humility, and his hearers all felt, perhaps,
much more sorry for him than he deserved.The wood-pigeon was about to
ask something more about his famous ancestors, when a shadow darkened
the mouth of the cave, and Toto made his appearance, with the crow
perched on his shoulder.he cried in his fresh, cheery voice, "how are you
to-day, sir?And catching sight of the stranger, he stopped short, and looked at the
bear for an explanation.Ger-Falcon, Toto," said Bruin.Toto nodded, and the hawk made him a stately bow; but the two
looked distrustfully at each other, and neither seemed inclined to make
any advances.Bruin continued,--

"Mr.Falcon came here in a--well, not in a friendly way at all, I must
say.But he is in a very different frame of mind, now, and I trust there
will be no further trouble.""Do you ever change your name, sir?"asked Toto, abruptly, addressing
the hawk."I have
no reason to be ashamed of my name.""And yet I am tolerably sure that Mr.Ger-Falcon is no other than Mr.Chicken Hawkon, and that it was he who
tried to carry off my Black Spanish chickens yesterday morning."I was
starving, and the chickens presented themselves to me wholly in the
light of food.May I ask for what purpose you keep chickens, sir?""Why, we eat them when they grow up," said Toto; "but--"

"Ah, precisely!""But we don't steal other people's chickens," said the boy, "we eat our
own.""You eat the tame, confiding
creatures who feed from your hand, and stretch their necks trustfully to
meet their doom.I, on the contrary, when the pangs of hunger force me
to snatch a morsel of food to save me from starvation, snatch it from
strangers, not from my friends."Toto was about to make a hasty reply, but the bear, with a motion of his
paw, checked him, and said gravely to the hawk,--

"Come, come!Falcon, I cannot have any dispute of this kind.There
is some truth in what you say, and I have no doubt that emperors and
other disreputable people have had a large share in forming the bad
habits into which you and all your family have fallen.But those habits
must be changed, sir, if you intend to remain in this forest.You must
not meddle with Toto's chickens; you must not chase quiet and harmless
birds.You must, in short, become a respectable and law-abiding bird,
instead of a robber and a murderer.""But how am I to live, pray?I
can be'respectable,' as you call it, in summer; but in weather like
this--"

"That can be easily managed," said the kind hermit."You can stay with
me, Falcon.I shall soon be able to shift for myself, and I will gladly
undertake to feed you until the snow and frost are gone.You will be a
companion for my crow-- By the way, where is my crow?Surely he came in
with you, Toto?""He did," said Toto, "but he hopped off the moment we entered.Didn't
like the looks of the visitor, I fancy," he added in a low tone.Search was made, and finally the crow was discovered huddled together, a
disconsolate little bunch of black feathers, in the darkest corner of
the cave.cried Toto, who was the first to catch sight of him.Why are you rumpling and humping yourself up in that
absurd fashion?"asked the crow, opening one eye a very little way, and
lifting his head a fraction of an inch from the mass of feathers in
which it was buried."Good Toto, kind Toto, is he gone?I would not be
eaten to-day, Toto, if it could be avoided."If you mean the hawk," said Toto, "he is _not_ gone; and what is more,
he isn't going, for your master has asked him to stay the rest of the
winter.Bruin has bound him
over to keep the peace, and you must come out and make the best of it."The unhappy crow begged and protested, but all in vain.Toto caught him
up, laughing, and carried him to his master, who set him on his knee,
and smoothed his rumpled plumage kindly.The hawk, who was highly
gratified by the hermit's invitation, put on his most gracious manner,
and soon convinced the crow that he meant him no harm."A member of the ancient family of Corvus!""Contemporaries, and probably friends, of the early Falcons.Let us also
be friends, dear sir; and let the names of James Crow and Ger-Falcon go
down together to posterity."But now Bruin and Pigeon Pretty were eager to hear all the home news
from the cottage.They listened with breathless interest to Toto's
account of the attempted robbery, and of <DW53>'s noble "defence of the
castle," as the boy called it.Miss Mary also received her full share of
the credit, nor was the kettle excluded from honorable mention.When all
was told, Toto proceeded to unpack the basket he had brought, which
contained gingerbread, eggs, apples, and a large can of butter-milk
marked "For Bruin."Many were the joyous exclamations called forth by
this present of good cheer; and it seemed as if the old hermit could not
sufficiently express his gratitude to Toto and his good grandmother.cried the boy, half distressed by the oft-repeated thanks."If you only knew how we _like_ it!Besides,"
he added, "I want you to do something for _me_ now, Mr.Baldhead, so
that will turn the tables.A shower is coming up, and it is early yet,
so I need not go home for an hour.So, will you not tell us a story?We
are very fond of stories,--Bruin and Pigeon Pretty and I.""With all my heart, dear
lad!"I have not heard a fairy story
for a long time."said the hermit, after a moment's reflection."When I was a
boy like you, Toto, I lived in Ireland, the very home of the fairy-folk;
so I know more about them than most people, perhaps, and this is an
Irish fairy story that I am going to tell you."And settling himself comfortably on his moss-pillows, the hermit began
the story of--




CHAPTER XIII."'It's Green Men, it's Green Men,
        All in the wood together;
      And, oh!we're feared o' the Green Men
        In all the sweet May weather,'--


"ON'Y I'm _not_ feared o' thim mesilf!"said Eileen, breaking off her
song with a little merry laugh."Wouldn't I be plazed to meet wan o'
thim this day, in the wud!Sure, it 'ud be the lookiest day o' me
loife."She parted the boughs, and entered the deep wood, where she was to
gather <DW19>s for her mother.Holding up her blue apron carefully, the
little girl stepped lightly here and there, picking up the dry brown
sticks, and talking to herself all the while,--to keep herself company,
as she thought."Thin I makes a low curchy," she was saying, "loike that wan Mother made
to the lord's lady yistherday, and the Green Man he gi'es me a nod,
and--

"'What's yer name, me dear?'"'Eileen Macarthy, yer Honor's Riverence!'I mustn't say
'Riverence,' bekase he's not a priest, ava'.'Yer Honor's Grace' wud do
better."'And what wud ye loike for a prisint, Eily?'"And thin I'd say--lit me see!A big green grasshopper, caught be his leg
in a spider's wib.Wait a bit, poor crathur, oi'll lit ye free agin."Full of pity for the poor grasshopper, Eily stooped to lift it carefully
out of the treacherous net into which it had fallen.But what was her
amazement on perceiving that the creature was not a grasshopper, but a
tiny man, clad from head to foot in light green, and with a scarlet cap
on his head.The little fellow was hopelessly entangled in the net, from
which he made desperate efforts to free himself, but the silken strands
were quite strong enough to hold him prisoner.For a moment Eileen stood petrified with amazement, murmuring to
herself, "Howly Saint Bridget!Sure, I niver
thought I'd find wan really in loife!"but the next moment her kindness
of heart triumphed over her fear, and stooping once more she very gently
took the little man up between her thumb and finger, pulled away the
clinging web, and set him respectfully on the top of a large toadstool
which stood conveniently near.The little Green Man shook himself, dusted his jacket with his red cap,
and then looked up at Eileen with twinkling eyes."Ye have saved my life, and ye
shall not be the worse for it, if ye _did_ take me for a grasshopper."Eily was rather abashed at this, but the little man looked very kind; so
she plucked up her courage, and when he asked, "What is yer name, my
dear?"("jist for all the wurrld the way I thought of," she said to
herself) answered bravely, with a low courtesy, "Eileen Macarthy, yer
Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"and then she added, "They calls me
Eily, most times, at home.""Well, Eily," said the Green Man, "I suppose ye know who I am?""A fairy, plaze yer Honor's Grace!""Sure, I've aften heerd av yer Honor's people, but I niver thought I'd
see wan of yez.It's rale plazed I am, sure enough.Manny's the time
Docthor O'Shaughnessy's tell't me there was no sich thing as yez; but I
niver belaved him, yer Honor!"said the Green Man, heartily, "that's very right.And now, Eily, alanna, I'm going to do ye a
fairy's turn before I go.Ye shall have yer wish of whatever ye like in
the world.Take a minute to think about it, and then make up yer mind."Her dreams had then come true; she was to
have a fairy wish!Eily had all the old fairy-stories at her tongue's end, for her
mother told her one every night as she sat at her spinning.Jack and the
Beanstalk, the Sleeping Beauty, the Seven Swans, the Elves that stole
Barney Maguire, the Brown Witch, and the Widdy Malone's Pig,--she knew
them all, and scores of others besides.Her mother always began the
stories with, "Wanst upon a time, and a very good time it was;" or,
"Long, long ago, whin King O'Toole was young, and the praties grew all
ready biled in the ground;" or, "Wan fine time, whin the fairies danced,
and not a poor man lived in Ireland."In this way, the fairies seemed
always to be thrown far back into a remote past, which had nothing in
common with the real work-a-day world in which Eily lived.But now--oh,
wonder of wonders!--now, here was a real fairy, alive and active, with
as full power of blessing or banning as if the days of King O'Toole had
come again,--and what was more, with good-will to grant to Eileen
Macarthy whatever in the wide world she might wish for!The child stood
quite still, with her hands clasped, thinking harder than she had ever
thought in all her life before; and the Green Man sat on the toadstool
and watched her, with eyes which twinkled with some amusement, but no
malice."Take yer time, my dear," he said, "take yer time!Ye'll not meet a
Green Man every day, so make the best o' your chance!"Suddenly Eily's face lighted up with a sudden inspiration.she
cried, "sure I have it, yer Riverence's Grace--Honor, I shud say!it's the di'monds and pearrls I'll have, iv ye plaze!"repeated the fairy, "what diamonds and pearls?You don't want them _all_, surely?""Och, no, yer Honor!""Only wan of aich to dhrop out o' me
mouth ivery time I shpake, loike the girrl in the sthory, ye know.Whiniver she opened her lips to shpake, a di'mond an' a pearrl o' the
richest beauty dhropped from her mouth.That's what I mane, plaze yer
Honor's Grace.wudn't it be beautiful, entirely?""Are ye _quite_ sure that
this is what you wish for most, Eileen?Don't decide hastily, or ye may
be sorry for it."cried Eileen, "what for wud I be sorry?Sure I'd be richer than
the Countess o' Kilmoggen hersilf, let alone the Queen, be the time I'd
talked for an hour.An' I _loove_ to talk!"she added softly, half to
herself."Well, Eily," he said, "ye shall
have yer own way.Eileen bent down, and he touched her lips three times with the scarlet
tassel of his cap.Now go home, Eileen Macarthy, and the good wishes of the Green Men go
with ye.Ye will have yer own wish fulfilled as soon as ye cross the
threshold of yer home."A day
may come when ye will wish with all yer heart to have the charm taken
away.If that ever happens, come to this same place with a sprig of
holly in yer hand.Strike this toadstool three times, and say,
'Slanegher Banegher, Skeen na Lane!'and
clapping his scarlet cap on his head, the little man leaped from the
toadstool, and instantly disappeared from sight among the ferns and
mosses.Eileen stood still for some time, lost in a dream of wonder and delight.Finally rousing herself, she gave a long, happy sigh, and hastily
filling her apron with sticks, turned her steps homeward.The sun was sinking low when she came in sight of the little cabin, at
the door of which her mother was standing, looking anxiously in every
direction."Is it yersilf, Eily?"cried the good woman in a tone of relief, as she
saw the child approaching.It's a wild
colleen y'are, to be sprankin' about o' this way, and it nearly sundown.Where have ye been, I'm askin' ye?"Eily held up her apronful of sticks with a beaming smile, but answered
never a word till she stood on the threshold of the cottage.("Sure I
might lose some," she had been saying to herself, "and that 'ud niver
do.")But as soon as she had entered the little room which was kitchen,
hall, dining-room, and drawing-room for the Macarthy family, she dropped
her bundle of <DW19>s, and clasping her hands together, cried, "Och,
mother!Sure ye'll niver belave me whin I till ye--"

Here she suddenly stopped, for hop!two round shining things
dropped from her mouth, and rolled away over the floor of the cabin.[marbles]" shouted little Phelim, jumping up from his
seat by the fire and running to pick up the shining objects."Eily's
got her mouf full o' marvels!"Wait till I till ye,
mother asthore!I wint to the forest as ye bade me, to gather shticks,
an'--" hop!out flew two more shining things from her mouth and
rolled away after the others.Macarthy uttered a piercing shriek, and clapped her hand over
Eileen's mouth."Me choild's bewitched,
an' shpakin' buttons!Run,
Phelim," she added, "an' call yer father.He's in the praty-patch,
loikely.she said to Eily, who was struggling
vainly to free herself from her mother's powerful grasp."Kape shtill,
I'm tillin' ye, an' don't open yer lips!It's savin' yer body an' sowl I
may be this minute.Saint Bridget, Saint Michael, an' blissid Saint
Patrick!"she ejaculated piously, "save me choild, an' I'll serve ye on
me knees the rist o' me days."This was a sad beginning of all her glory.She tried
desperately to open her mouth, sure that in a moment she could make her
mother understand the whole matter.But Honor Macarthy was a stalwart
woman, and Eily's slender fingers could not stir the massive hand which
was pressed firmly upon her lips.At this moment her father entered hastily, with Phelim panting behind
him."Phwhat's the matther, woman?""Here's Phelim clane
out o' his head, an' shcramin' about Eily, an' marvels an' buttons, an'
I dunno what all.he added in a tone of great
alarm, as he saw Eileen in her mother's arms, flushed and disordered,
the tears rolling down her cheeks.cried Honor, "it's bewitched she is,--clane bewitched out
o' her sinses, an shpakes buttons out av her mouth wid ivery worrd she
siz.Who wud do ye sich an
ill turn as this, whin ye niver harmed annybody since the day ye were
born?""_Buttons!_" said Dennis Macarthy; "what do ye mane by buttons?How can
she shpake buttons, I'm askin' ye?Sure, ye're foolish yersilf, Honor,
woman!Lit the colleen go, an' she'll till me phwhat 'tis all about.""Och, av ye don't belave me!""Show thim to yer father,
Phelim!Look at two av thim there in the corner,--the dirrty things!"Phelim took up the two shining objects cautiously in the corner of his
pinafore and carried them to his father, who examined them long and
carefully.Finally he spoke, but in an altered voice."Lit the choild go, Honor," he said."I want to shpake till her.he added sternly; and very reluctantly his wife released poor
Eily, who stood pale and trembling, eager to explain, and yet afraid to
speak for fear of being again forcibly silenced."Eileen," said her father, "'tis plain to be seen that these things are
not buttons, but jew'ls."said Dennis; "jew'ls, or gims, whichiver ye plaze to call thim.Now, phwhat I want to know is, where did ye get thim?"cried Eily; "don't look at me that a-way!Sure, I've done
no harrum!another splendid diamond and another
white, glistening pearl fell from her lips; but she hurried on, speaking
as quickly as she could: "I wint to the forest to gather shticks, and
there I saw a little Grane Man, all the same loike a hoppergrass, caught
be his lig in a spidher's wib; and whin I lit him free he gi' me a wish,
to have whativer I loiked bist in the wurrld; an' so I wished, an' I
sid--" but by this time the pearls and diamonds were hopping like
hail-stones all over the cabin-floor; and with a look of deep anger and
sorrow Dennis Macarthy motioned to his wife to close Eileen's mouth
again, which she eagerly did."To think," he said, "as iver a child o' mine shud shtale the Countess's
jew'ls, an' thin till me a pack o' lies about thim!Honor, thim is the
beads o' the Countess's nickluss that I was tillin' ye about, that I saw
on her nick at the ball, whin I carried the washin' oop to the Castle.An' this misfortunate colleen has shwallied 'em.""How wud she shwally 'em,
an' have 'em in her mouth all the toime?An' how wud she get thim to
shwally, an' the Countess in Dublin these three weeks, an' her jew'ls
wid her?Shame an ye, Dinnis Macarthy!to suspict yer poor, diminted
choild of shtalin'!It's bewitched she is, I till ye!Look at the face
av her this minute!"Just at that moment the sound of wheels was heard; and Phelim, who was
standing at the open door, exclaimed,--

"Father!here's Docthor O'Shaughnessy dhrivin' past.cried both mother and father in a
breath.Phelim darted out, and soon returned, followed by the doctor,--a tall,
thin man with a great hooked nose, on which was perched a pair of green
spectacles.O'Shaughnessy; and now a cold shiver passed
over her as he fixed his spectacled eyes on her and listened in silence
to the confused accounts which her father and mother poured into his
ear.Let me see the jew'ls, as ye call thim."The pearls and diamonds were brought,--a whole handful of them,--and
poured into the doctor's hand, which closed suddenly over them, while
his dull black eyes shot out a quick gleam under the shading spectacles.The next moment, however, he laughed good-humoredly and turned them
carelessly over one by one."Why, Dinnis," he said, "'tis aisy to see that ye've not had mich
expeerunce o' jew'ls, me bye, or ye'd not mistake these bits o' glass
an' sich fer thim.there's no jew'ls here, wheriver the
Countess's are.An' these bits o' trash dhrop out o' the choild's mouth,
ye till me, ivery toime she shpakes?""Ivery toime, yer Anner!""Out they dhrops, an' goes hoppin'
an' leppin' about the room, loike they were aloive."This is a very sirrious case,
Misther Macarthy,--a very sirrious case _in_dade, sirr; an' I'll be free
to till ye that I know but _wan_ way av curin' it.""Och, whirrasthru!""What is it at all, Docthor
alanna?Is it a witch has overlooked her, or what is it?will I lose ye this-a-way?and in her grief she loosed her hold of Eileen and clapped her hands to
her own face, sobbing aloud.But before the child could open her lips to
speak, she found herself seized in another and no less powerful grasp,
while another hand covered her mouth,--not warm and firm like her
mother's, but cold, bony, and frog-like.Holding her as in a vice, Dr.O'Shaughnessy spoke once more to her parents."I'll save her loife," said he, "and mebbe her wits as well, av the
thing's poassible.But it's not here I can do ut at all.I'll take the
choild home wid me to me house, and Misthress O'Shaughnessy will tind
her as if she wuz her own; and thin I will try th' ixpirimint which is
the ownly thing on airth can save her.""Sure, there's two, three kinds o' mint growin'
here in oor own door-yard, but I dunno av there's anny o' that kind.Will ye make a tay av it, Docthor, or is it a poultuss ye'll be puttin'
an her, to dhraw out the witchcraft, loike?""Whisht, whisht, woman!""Howld yer prate,
can't ye, an' the docthor waitin'?Is there no way ye cud cure her, an'
lave her at home thin, Docthor?Faith, I'd be loth to lave her go away
from uz loike this, let alone the throuble she'll be to yez!""At laste," he added
more gravely, "naw moor thin I'd gladly take for ye an' yer good woman,
Dinnis!Come, help me wid the colleen, now.Now, thin, oop
wid ye, Eily!"And the next moment Eileen found herself in the doctor's narrow gig,
wedged tightly between him and the side of the vehicle."Ye can sind her bits o' clothes over by Phelim," said Dr.O'Shaughnessy, as he gathered up the reins, apparently in great haste.Good-day t' ye, Dinnis!My respicts to ye,
Misthress Macarthy.Ye'll hear av the choild in a day or two!"And
whistling to his old pony, they started off at as brisk a trot as the
latter could produce on such short notice.Was this the result of the fairy's gift?She sat still,
half-paralyzed with grief and terror, for she made no doubt that the
hated doctor was going to do something very, very dreadful to her.Seeing that she made no effort to free herself, or to speak, her captor
removed his hand from her mouth; but not until they were well out of
sight and hearing of her parents."Now, Eileen," he said, not unkindly, "av ye'll be a good colleen, and
not shpake a wurrd, I'll lave yer mouth free.But av ye shpake, so much
as to say, 'Bliss ye!'I'll tie up yer jaw wid me pock'-handkercher, so
as ye can't open ut at all.She had not the slightest desire to say "Bliss
ye!"O'Shaughnessy; nor did she care to fill his rusty old gig,
or to sprinkle the high road, with diamonds and pearls.said the Doctor, "that's a sinsible gyurrl as ye are.See, now, what a foine bit o' sweet-cake Misthress O'Shaughnessy 'ull be
givin' ye, whin we git home."The poor child burst into tears, for the word 'home' made her realize
more fully that she was going every moment farther and farther away from
her own home,--from her kind father, her anxious and loving mother, and
dear little Phelim.What would Phelim do at night, without her shoulder
to curl up on and go to sleep, in the trundle-bed which they had shared
ever since he was a tiny baby?Who would light her father's pipe, and
sing him the little song he always liked to hear while he smoked it
after supper?These, and many other such thoughts, filled Eileen's mind
as she sat weeping silently beside the green-spectacled doctor, who
cared nothing about her crying, so long as she did not try to speak.After a drive of some miles, they reached a tall, dark, gloomy-looking
house, which was not unlike the doctor himself, with its small greenish
window-panes and its gaunt chimneys.Here the pony stopped, and the
doctor, lifting Eileen out of the gig, carried her into the house.O'Shaughnessy came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on her apron,
and stared in amazement at the burden in her husband's arms.Is she
kilt, or what's the matther?""Open the door o' the best room!""Open it,
woman, I'm tillin' ye!"and entering a large bare room, he set Eileen
down hastily on a stool, and then drew a long breath and wiped his brow."Safe and sound I've got ye now, glory for ut!And ye'll not lave this room until ye've made me _King av Ireland_!"Eileen stared at the man, thinking he had gone mad; for his face was
red, and his eyes, from which he had snatched the green spectacles,
glittered with a strange light.The same idea flashed into his wife's
mind, and she crossed herself devoutly, exclaiming,--

"Howly St.Pathrick, he's clane diminted.he said; "ye'll soon see
av I'm diminted.I till ye I'll be King av Ireland before the month's
oot.Open yer mouth, alanna, and make yer manners
to Misthress O'Shaughnessy."Thus adjured, Eileen dropped a courtesy, and said, timidly, "Good day t'
ye, Ma'm!down dropped a pearl and a diamond, and the doctor, pouncing
on them, held them up in triumph before the eyes of his astonished wife.There's no sich in Queen
Victory's crownd this day.That's a pearrl, an' as big
as a marrowfat pay.The loike of ut's not in Ireland, I till ye.Woman,
there's a fortin' in ivery wurrd this colleen shpakes!And she's goin'
to shpake," he added, grimly, "and to kape an shpakin', till Michael
O'Shaughnessy is rich enough to buy all Ireland,--ay, and England too,
av he'd a mind to!"O'Shaughnessy, utterly bewildered by her
husband's wild talk, and by the sight of the jewels, "what does it all
mane?And won't she die av 'em, av it's
that manny in her stumick?""Whisht wid yer foolery!""Swallied
'em, indade!The gyurrl has met a Grane Man, that's the truth of ut; and
he's gi'n her a wish, and she's got ut,--and now I've got _her_."And he
chuckled, and rubbed his bony hands together, while his eyes twinkled
with greed."Sure, ye always till't me there was no sich thing ava'.""I lied, an' that's all there is to
say about ut.Do ye think I'm obleeged to shpake the thruth ivery day in
the week to an ignor'nt crathur like yersilf?It's worn out I'd be, body
and sowl, at that rate.Now, Eileen Macarthy," he continued, turning to
his unhappy little prisoner, "ye are to do as I till ye, an' no
harrum'll coom to ye, an' maybe good.Ye are to sit in this room and
_talk_; and ye'll kape an talkin' till the room is _full-up_!"No less'll satisfy me, and it's the
laste ye can do for all the throuble I've taken forr ye.Misthress
O'Shaughnessy an' mesilf 'ull take turns sittin' wid ye, so 'at ye'll
have some wan to talk to.Ye'll have plinty to ate an' to dhrink, an'
that's more than manny people have in Ireland this day.With this, the worthy man proceeded to give strict injunctions to his
wife to keep the child talking, and not to leave her alone for an
instant; and finally he departed, shutting the door behind him, and
leaving the captive and her jailer alone together.O'Shaughnessy immediately poured forth a flood of questions, to
which Eileen replied by telling the whole pitiful story from beginning
to end.It was a relief to be able to speak at last, and to rehearse the
whole matter to understanding, if not sympathetic, ears.O'Shaughnessy listened and looked, looked and listened, with open mouth
and staring eyes.With her eyes shut, she would not have believed her
ears; but the double evidence was too much for her.The diamonds and pearls kept on falling, falling, fast and faster.They
filled Eileen's lap, they skipped away over the floor, while the
doctor's wife pursued them with frantic eagerness.Each diamond was
clear and radiant as a drop of dew, each pearl lustrous and perfect; but
they gave no pleasure now to the fairy-gifted child.She could only
think of the task that lay before her,--to FILL this great, empty room;
of the millions and millions, and yet again millions of gems that must
fall from her lips before the floor would be covered even a few inches
deep; of the weeks and months,--perhaps the years,--that must elapse
before she would see her parents and Phelim again.She remembered the
words of the fairy: "A day may come when you will wish with all your
heart to have the charm removed."And then, like a flash, came the
recollection of those other words: "When that day comes, come here to
this spot," and do so and so.In fancy, Eileen was transported again to the pleasant green forest; was
looking at the Green Man as he sat on the toadstool, and begging him to
take away this fatal gift, which had already, in one day, brought her so
much misery.Harshly on her reverie broke in the voice of Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, asking,--

"And has yer father sold his pigs yit?"She started, and came back to the doleful world of reality.But even as
she answered the woman's question, she made in her heart a firm
resolve,--somehow or other, _somehow_, she would escape; she would get
out of this hateful house, away from these greedy, grasping people; she
would manage somehow to find her way to the wood, and then--then for
freedom again!Cheered by her own resolution, she answered the woman
composedly, and went into a detailed account of the birth, rearing, and
selling of the pigs, which so fascinated her auditor that she was
surprised, when the recital was over, to find that it was nearly
supper-time.The doctor now entered, and taking his wife's place, began to ply Eily
with questions, each one artfully calculated to bring forth the longest
possible reply:--

"How is it yer mother is related to the Countess's auld housekeeper,
avick; and why is it, that wid sich grand relations she niver got into
the castle at all?""Phwhat was that I h'ard the other day about the looky bargain yer
father--honest man!--made wid the one-eyed peddler from beyant
Inniskeen?"and--

"Is it thrue that yer mother makes all her butther out av skim-milk just
by making the sign of the cross--God bless it!--over the churn?"Although she did not like the doctor, Eily did, as she had said to the
Green Man, "_loove_ to talk;" so she chattered away, explaining and
disclaiming, while the diamonds and pearls flew like hail-stones from
her lips, and her host and jailer sat watching them with looks of greedy
rapture.Eily paused, fairly out of breath, just as Mrs.O'Shaughnessy entered,
bringing her rather scanty supper.There was quite a pile of jewels in
her lap and about her feet, while a good many had rolled to a distance;
but her heart sank within her as she compared the result of three hours'
steady talking with the end to which the rapacious doctor aspired.She was allowed to eat her supper in peace, but no sooner was it
finished than the questioning began again, and it was not until ten
o'clock had struck that the exhausted child was allowed to lay her head
down on the rude bed which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy had hastily made up for
her.The next day was a weary one for poor Eily.From morning till night she
was obliged to talk incessantly, with only a brief space allowed for her
meals.The doctor and his wife mounted guard by turns, each asking
questions, until to the child's fancy they seemed like nothing but
living interrogation points.All day long, no matter what she was
talking about,--the potato-crop, or the black hen that the fox stole, or
Phelim's measles,--her mind was fixed on one idea, that of escaping from
her prison.If only some fortunate chance would call them both out of
the room at once!There was always a
pair of greedy eyes fixed on her, and on the now hated jewels which
dropped in an endless stream from her lips; always a harsh voice in her
ears, rousing her, if she paused for an instant, by new questions as
stupid as they were long.Once, indeed, the child stopped short, and declared that she could not
and would not talk any more; but she was speedily shown the end of a
birch rod, with the hint that the doctor "would be loth to use the likes
av it on Dinnis Macarthy's choild; but her parints had given him charge
to dhrive out the witchcraft be hook or be crook; and av a birch rod
wasn't first cousin to a crook, what was it at all?"and Eily was forced
to find her powers of speech again.By nightfall of this day the room was ankle-deep in pearls and diamonds.A wonderful sight it was, when the moon looked in at the window, and
shone on the lustrous and glittering heaps which Mrs.O'Shaughnessy
piled up with her broom.The woman was fairly frightened at the sight of
so much treasure, and she crossed herself many times as she lay down on
the mat beside Eileen's truckle-bed, muttering to herself, "Michael
knows bist, I suppose; but sorrow o' me if I can feel as if there was a
blissing an it, ava'!"The third day came, and was already half over, when an urgent summons
came for Doctor O'Shaughnessy.One of his richest patrons had fallen
from his horse and broken his leg, and the doctor must come on the
instant.The doctor grumbled and swore, but there was no help for it; so
he departed, after making his wife vow by all the saints in turn, that
she would not leave Eileen's side for an instant until he returned.When Eily heard the rattle of the gig and the sound of the pony's feet,
and knew that the most formidable of her jailers was actually _gone_,
her heart beat so loud for joy that she feared its throbbing would be
heard.Now, at last, a loop-hole seemed to open for her.She had a plan
already in her head, and now there was a chance for her to carry it out.But an Irish girl of ten has shrewdness beyond her years, and no gleam
of expression appeared in Eileen's face as she spoke to Mrs.O'Shaughnessy, who had been standing by the window to watch her
husband's departure, and who now returned to her seat."We'll be missin' the docthor this day, ma'm, won't we?""He's
so agrayable, ain't he, now?"O'Shaughnessy, with something of a sigh."He's rale agrayable, Michael is--whin he wants to be," she added."Yis,
I'll miss um more nor common to-day, for 'tis worn out I am intirely
wid shlapin so little these two nights past.Sure, I _can't_ shlape, wid
thim things a-shparklin' an' a-glowerin' at me the way they do; and now
I'll not get me nap at all this afthernoon, bein' I must shtay here and
kape ye talkin' till the docthor cooms back.Me hid aches, too, mortial
bad!""Arrah, it's too bad, intirely!Will I till ye a little shtory that me grandmother hed for the hidache?""A shtory for the hidache?""What do ye mane by
that, I'm askin' ye?""I dunno roightly how ut is," replied Eily, innocently, "but Granny used
to call this shtory a cure for the hidache, and mebbe ye'd find ut so.An' annyhow it 'ud kape me talkin'," she added meekly, "for 'tis mortial
long."O'Shaughnessy, settling herself more
comfortably in her chair."I loove a long shtory, to be sure.And Eily began as follows, speaking in a clear, low monotone:--

"Wanst upon a toime there lived an owld, owld woman, an' her name was
Moira Magoyle; an' she lived in an owld, owld house, in an owld, owld
lane that lid through an owld, owld wood be the side of an owld, owld
shthrame that flowed through an owld, owld shthrate av an owld, owld
town in an owld, owld county.An' this owld, owld woman, sure enough,
she had an owld, owld cat wid a white nose; an' she had an owld, owld
dog wid a black tail, an' she had an owld, owld hin wid wan eye, an' she
had an owld, owld cock wid wan leg, an' she had--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy yawned, and stirred uneasily on her seat."Seems to
me there's moighty little goin' an in this shtory!"she said, taking up
her knitting, which she had dropped in her lap."I'd loike somethin' a
bit more loively, I'm thinkin', av I had me ch'ice."said Eily, with quiet confidence, "ownly wait till I
coom to the parrt about the two robbers an' the keg o' gunpowdther, an'
its loively enough ye'll foind ut.But I must till ut the same way 'at
Granny did, else it 'ull do no good, ava.Well, thin, I was sayin' to
ye, ma'm, this owld woman (Saint Bridget be good to her!)she had an
owld, owld cow, an' she had an owld, owld shape, an' she had an owld,
owld kitchen wid an owld, owld cheer an' an owld, owld table, an' an
owld, owld panthry wid an owld, owld churn, an' an owld, owld sauce-pan,
an' an owld, owld gridiron, an' an owld, owld--"

Mrs.O'Shaughnessy's knitting dropped again, and her head fell forward
on her breast.Eileen's voice grew lower and softer, but still she went
on,--rising at the same time, and moving quietly, stealthily, towards
the door,--

"An' she had an owld, owld kittle, an' she had an owld, owld pot wid an
owld, owld kiver; an' she had an owld, owld jug, an' an owld, owld
platther, an' an owld, owld tay-pot--"

Eily's hand was on the door, her eyes were fixed on the motionless form
of her jailer; her voice went on and on, its soft monotone now
accompanied by another sound,--that of a heavy, regular breathing which
was fast deepening into a snore."An' she had an owld, owld shpoon, an' an owld, owld fork, an' an owld,
owld knife, an' an owld, owld cup, an' an owld, owld bowl, an' an owld,
owld, owld--"

The door is open!Two little feet go speeding down
the long passage, across the empty kitchen, out at the back door, and
away, away!the story is done and the
bird is flown!Surely it was the next thing to flying, the way in which Eily sped
across the meadows, far from the hated scene of her imprisonment.The
bare brown feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground; the brown locks
streamed out on the wind; the little blue apron fluttered wildly, like a
banner of victory.with panting bosom, with parted lips,
with many a backward glance to see if any one were following; on went
the little maid, over field and fell, through moss and through mire,
till at last--oh, happy, blessed sight!--the dark forest rose before
her, and she knew that she was saved.Quite at the other end of the wood lay the spot she was seeking; but she
knew the way well, and on she went, but more carefully now,--parting the
branches so that she broke no living twig, and treading cautiously lest
she should crush the lady fern, which the Green Men love.How beautiful
the ferns were, uncurling their silver-green fronds and spreading their
slender arms abroad!How pleasant,
how kind, how friendly was everything in the sweet green wood!And here at last was the oak-tree, and at the foot of it there stood the
yellow toadstool, looking as if it did not care about anything or
anybody, which in truth it did not: Breathless with haste and eagerness,
Eileen tapped the toadstool three times with a bit of holly, saying
softly, "Slanegher Banegher!there
sat the Green Man, just as if he had been there all the time, fanning
himself with his scarlet cap, and looking at her with a comical twinkle
in his sharp little eyes."Well, Eily," he said, "is it back so soon ye are?Well, well, I'm not
surprised!"Oh, yer Honor's Riverence--Grace, I mane!"cried poor Eily, bursting
into tears, "av ye'll plaze to take it away!Sure it's nearly kilt I am
along av it, an' no plazure or coomfort in ut at all at all!Take it
away, yer Honor, take it away, and I'll bliss ye all me days!"and, with
many sobs, she related the experiences of the past three days.As she
spoke, diamonds and pearls still fell in showers from her lips, and
half-unconsciously she held up her apron to catch them as they fell, so
that by the time she had finished her story she had more than a quart of
splendid gems, each as big as the biggest kind of pea.The Green Man smiled, but not unkindly, at the recital of Eileen's
woes."Faith, it's a hard time ye've had, my maiden, and no mistake!Hold fast the jewels ye have there, for they're the
last ye'll get."He touched her lips with his cap, and said, "Cabbala
ku!Eily drew a long breath of relief, and the fairy added,--

"The truth is, Eily, the times are past for fairy gifts of this kind.Few people believe in the Green Men now at all, and fewer still ever see
them.Why, ye are the first mortal child I've spoken to for a matter of
two hundred years, and I think ye'll be the last I ever speak to.Fairy
gifts are very pretty things in a story, but they're not convenient at
the present time, as ye see for yourself.There's one thing I'd like to
say to ye, however," he added more seriously; "an' ye'll take it as a
little lesson-like, me dear, before we part.Ye asked me for diamonds
and pearls, and I gave them to ye; and now ye've seen the worth of that
kind for yourself.But there's jewels and jewels in the world, and if
ye choose, Eily, ye can still speak pearls and diamonds, and no harm to
yourself or anybody.""Sure, I don't
undershtand yer Honor at all.""Likely not," said the little man, "but it's now I'm telling ye.Every
gentle and loving word ye speak, child, is a pearl; and every kind deed
done to them as needs kindness, is a diamond brighter than all those
shining stones in your apron.Ye'll grow up a rich woman, Eily, with the
treasure ye have there; but it might all as well be frogs and toads, if
with it ye have not the loving heart and the helping hand that will make
a good woman of ye, and happy folk of yer neighbors.And now good-by,
mavourneen, and the blessing of the Green Men go with ye and stay with
ye, yer life long!""Good-by, yer Honor," cried Eily, gratefully."The saints reward yer
Honor's Grace for all yer kindness to a poor silly colleen like me!But,
oh, wan minute, yer Honor!"she cried, as she saw the little man about
to put on his cap."Will Docthor O'Shaughnessy be King av Ireland?Sure
it's the wicked king he'd make, intirely.Don't let him, plaze, yer
Honor!"Have no fears, Eily,
alanna!O'Shaughnessy has come into his kingdom by this time, and I
wish him joy of it."With these words he clapped his scarlet cap on his head, and vanished
like the snuff of a candle.*       *       *       *       *

Now, just about this time Dr.Michael O'Shaughnessy was dismounting from
his gig at his own back door, after a long and weary drive.He thought
little, however, about his bodily fatigue, for his heart was full of joy
and triumph, his mind absorbed in dreams of glory.He could not even
contain his thoughts, but broke out into words, as he unharnessed the
rusty old pony."An' whin I coom to the palace, I'll knock three times wid the knocker;
or maybe there'll be a bell, loike the sheriff's house (bad luck to um!)And the gossoon'll open the dure, and--

"'Phwhat's yer arrind?'"'It's Queen Victory I'm wantin',' says I.'An' ye'll till her King
Michael av Ireland is askin' for her,' I says."Thin whin Victory hears that, she'll coom roonnin' down hersilf, to bid
me welkim; an' she'll take me oop to the best room, an'--

"'Sit down an the throne, King Michael,' says she.'The other cheers
isn't good enough for the loikes of ye,' says she."'Afther ye, ma'm,' says I, moinding me manners."'An' is there annythin' I can du for ye, to-day, King Michael?'says
she, whin we've sat down an the throne."An' I says, loight and aisy loike, all as if I didn't care, 'Nothin' in
loife, ma'm, I'm obleeged to ye, widout ye'd lind me the loan o' yer
Sunday crownd,' says I, 'be way av a patthern,' says I."An' says she--"

But at this moment the royal meditations were rudely broken in upon by a
wild shriek which resounded from the house.The door was flung violently
open, and Mrs.O'Shaughnessy rushed out like a mad woman."The colleen's gone, an' me niver
shtirrin' from her side!Och, wirra, wirra!It must be the
witches has taken her clane up chimley."O'Shaughnessy stood for a moment transfixed, glaring with speechless
rage at the unhappy woman; then rushing suddenly at her, he seized and
shook her till her teeth chattered together.he yelled, beside himself with rage and
disappointment."Ye've fell ashlape, an' laved her shlip out!Sorrow
seize ye, ye're always the black bean in me porridge!"Then flinging her
from him, he cried, "I don't care!I'll be king wid
what's in there now!"He paused before the door of the best room, lately poor Eily's prison,
to draw breath and to collect his thoughts.The door was closed, and
from within--hark!Waking suddenly from her nap, had she
failed to see the girl, who had perhaps been sleeping, too?At all
events the jewels were there, in shining heaps on the floor, as he had
last seen them, with thousands more covering the floor in every
direction,--a king's ransom in half a handful of them.He would be king
yet, even if the girl were gone.Cautiously he opened the door and
looked in, his eyes glistening, his mouth fairly watering at the thought
of all the splendor which would meet his glance.Captive was there none, yet the room was not empty.Jewels were there none, yet the floor was covered; covered with living
creatures,--toads, snakes, newts, all hideous and unclean reptiles that
hop or creep or wriggle.And as the wretched man stared, with open mouth
and glaring eye-balls, oh, horror!they were all hopping, creeping,
wriggling towards the open door,--towards him!With a yell beside which
his wife's had been a whisper, O'Shaughnessy turned and fled; but after
him--through the door, down the passage and out of the house--came
hopping, creeping, wriggling his myriad pursuers.stretch your long legs, and run like a hunted hare
over hill and dale, over moss and moor.They are close behind you; they
are catching at your heels; they come from every side, surrounding you!Fly, King O'Shaughnessy!The Green Men are
hunting you, if you could but know it, in sport and in revenge; and
three times they will chase you round County Kerry, for thrice three
days, till at last they suffer you to drop exhausted in a bog, and
vanish from your sight.Eily went home with her apron full of pearls and diamonds, to
tell her story again, and this time to be believed.And she grew up a
good woman and a rich woman; and she married the young Count of
Kilmoggan, and spoke diamonds and pearls all her life long,--at least
her husband said she did, and he ought to know.cried Toto, springing lightly into the barn, and waving a
basket round his head.Spanish, Dame Clucket, where
are you all?I want all the fresh eggs you can spare, please!directly-now-this-very-moment!"and the boy tossed his basket up in the
air and caught it again, and danced a little dance of pure enjoyment,
while he waited for the hens to answer his summons.Speckle and Dame Clucket, who had been having a quiet chat together
in the mow, peeped cautiously over the billows of hay, and seeing that
Toto was alone, bade him good-morning."I don't know about eggs, to-day, Toto!""I want to
set soon, and I cannot be giving you eggs every day.""Oh, but I haven't had any for two or three days!""And I
_must_ have some to-day.Good old Clucket, dear old Cluckety, give me
some, please!""Well, I never can refuse that boy, somehow!"said Dame Clucket, half to
herself; and Mrs.Speckle agreed with her that it could not be done.Indeed, it would have been hard to say "No!"to Toto at that moment, for
he certainly was very pleasant to look at.The dusty sunbeams came
slanting through the high windows, and fell on his curly head, his
ruddy-brown cheeks, and honest gray eyes; and as the eyes danced, and
the curls danced, and the whole boy danced with the dancing sunbeams,
why, what could two soft-hearted old hens do but meekly lead the way to
where their cherished eggs lay, warm and white, in their fragrant nests
of hay?"And what is to be done with them?"Speckle, as the last egg
disappeared into the basket."We are going to have a party
to-night,--a real party!Baldhead is coming, and Jim Crow, and
Ger-Falcon.And Granny and Bruin are making all sorts of good
things,--I'll bring you out some, if I can, dear old Speckly,--and these
eggs are for a custard, don't you see?""And <DW53> and I are decorating the kitchen," continued he; "and Cracker
is cracking the nuts and polishing the apples; and Pigeon Pretty and
Miss Mary are dusting the ornaments,--so you see we are all very busy
indeed.and off ran boy Toto, with his basket of eggs, leaving the
two old hens to scratch about in the hay, clucking rather sadly over the
memories of their own chickenhood, when they, too, went to parties,
instead of laying eggs for other people's festivities.In the cottage, what a bustle was going on!The grandmother was at her
pastry-board, rolling out paste, measuring and filling and covering, as
quickly and deftly as if she had had two pairs of eyes instead of none
at all.The bear, enveloped in a huge blue-checked apron, sat with a
large mortar between his knees, pounding away at something as if his
life depended on it.On the hearth sat the squirrel, cracking nuts and
piling them up in pretty blue china dishes; and the two birds were
carefully brushing and dusting, each with a pair of dusters which she
always carried about with her,--one pair gray, and the other soft brown.As for Toto and the raccoon, they were here, there, and everywhere, all
in a moment."Now, then, where are those greens?"called the boy, when he had
carefully deposited his basket of eggs in the pantry.replied <DW53>, appearing at the same moment from the
shed, dragging a mass of ground-pine, fragrant fir-boughs, and
alder-twigs with their bright coral-red berries."We will stand these
big boughs in the corners, Toto.The creeping stuff will go over the
looking-glass and round the windows."Yes, that will do very well," said Toto."We shall need steps, though,
to reach so high, and the step-ladder is broken.""Bruin will be the step-ladder.Stand up here,
Bruin, and make yourself useful."The good bear meekly obeyed, and the raccoon, mounting nimbly upon his
shoulders, proceeded to arrange the trailing creepers with much grace
and dexterity."This reminds me of some of our honey-hunts, old fellow!""Do you remember the famous one we had in the
autumn, a little while before we came here?""That was, indeed, a famous hunt!It gave us our whole winter's supply of honey.And we might have got
twice as much more, if it hadn't been for the accident.""Tell us about it," said Toto."I wasn't with you, you know; and then
came the moving, and I forgot to ask you."<DW53>, you see, had discovered this hive in a big oak-tree, hollow
from crotch to ground.He couldn't get at it alone, for the clever bees
had made it some way down inside the trunk, and he couldn't reach far
enough down unless some one held him on the outside.So we went
together, and I stood on my hind tip-toes, and then he climbed up and
stood on my head, and I held his feet while he reached down into the
hole."said the grandmother, "that was very dangerous, Bruin."Well, you see, dear Madam," replied the bear, apologetically, "it was
really the only way.I couldn't stand on <DW53>'s head and have him hold
_my_ feet, you know; and we couldn't give up the honey, the finest crop
of the season.So--"

"Oh, it was all right!""At least, it was at
first.There was such a quantity of honey,--pots and pots of it!--and
all of the very best quality.I took out comb after comb, laying them in
the crotch of the tree for safe-keeping till I was ready to go down.""But where were the bees all the time?"replied the raccoon, "buzzing about and making a
fine fuss.They tried to sting me, of course, but my fur was too much
for them.The only part I feared for was my nose, and that I had covered
with two or three thicknesses of mullein-leaves, tied on with stout
grass.But as ill-luck would have it, they found out Bruin, and began to
buzz about him, too.One flew into his eye, and he let my feet go for an
instant,--just just for the very instant when I was leaning down as far
as I could possibly stretch to reach a particularly fine comb.Up went
my heels, of course, and down went I.""My _dear_ <DW53>!do you mean--"

"I mean _down_, dear Madam!"repeated the raccoon, gravely,--"the very
downest down there was, I assure you.I fell through that hollow tree as
the falling star darts through the ambient heavens.Luckily there was a
soft bed of moss and rotten wood at the bottom, or I might not have had
the happiness of being here at this moment.As it was--"

"As it was," interrupted the bear, "I dragged him out by the tail
through the hole at the bottom.Indeed, he looked like a hive
himself, covered from head to foot with wax and honey, and a cloud of
bees buzzing about him.But he had a huge piece of comb in each paw, and
was gobbling away, eating honey, wax, bees and all, as if nothing had
happened.""Naturally," said the raccoon, "I am of a saving disposition, as you
know, and cannot bear to see anything wasted.It is not generally known
that bees add a slight pungent flavor to the honey, which is very
agreeable.he repeated, throwing his head back, and
screwing up one eye, to contemplate the arrangement he had just
completed."How is that, Toto; pretty, eh?""But, see here, if you keep Bruin there all
day, we shall never get through all we have to do.Jump down, that's a
good fellow, and help me to polish these tankards."When all was ready, as in due time it was, surely it would have been
hard to find a pleasanter looking place than that kitchen.The clean
white walls were hung with wreaths and garlands, while the great
fir-boughs in the corners filled the air with their warm, spicy
fragrance.Every bit of metal--brass, copper, or steel--was polished so
that it shone resplendent, giving back the joyous blaze of the crackling
fire in a hundred tiny reflections.The kettle was especially glorious,
and felt the importance of its position keenly."I trust you have no unpleasant feeling about this," it said to the
black soup-kettle."Every one cannot be beautiful, you know.If you are
useful, you should be content with that."Some have the fun, and some have the trouble!""My business is to make soup, and I make it.The table was covered with a snowy cloth, and set with glistening
crockery--white and blue--and clean shining pewter.The great tankard
had been brought out of its cupboard, and polished within an inch of its
life; while the three blue ginger-jars, filled with scarlet
alder-berries, looked down complacently from their station on the
mantelpiece.As for the floor, I cannot give you an idea of the
cleanness of it.When everything else was ready and in place, the bear
had fastened a homemade scrubbing-brush to each of his four feet, and
then executed a sort of furious scrubbing-dance, which fairly made the
house shake; and the result was a shining purity which vied with that
of the linen table-cloth, or the very kettle itself.And you should have seen the good bear, when his toilet was completed!The scrubbing-brushes had been applied to his own shaggy coat as well as
to the floor, and it shone, in its own way, with as much lustre as
anything else; and in his left ear was stuck a red rose, from the
monthly rose-bush which stood in the sunniest window and blossomed all
winter long.It is extremely uncomfortable to have a rose stuck in one's
ear,--you may try it yourself, and see how you like it; but Toto had
stuck it there, and nothing would have induced Bruin to remove it.And
you should have seen our Toto himself, carrying his own roses on his
cheeks, and enough sunshine in his eyes to make a thunder-cloud laugh!And you should have seen the great <DW53>, glorious in scarlet
neck-ribbon, and behind his ear (_not_ in it!<DW53> was not Bruin) a
scarlet feather, the gift of Miss Mary, and very precious.And you
should have seen the little squirrel, attired in his own bushy tail,
and rightly thinking that he needed no other adornment; and the parrot
and the wood-pigeon, both trim and elegant, with their plumage arranged
to the last point of perfection.Last of all, you should have seen the
dear old grandmother, the beloved Madam, with her snowy curls and cap
and kerchief; and the ebony stick which generally lived in a drawer and
silver paper, and only came out on great occasions.How proud Toto was
of his Granny!and how the others all stood around her, gazing with
wondering admiration at her gold-bowed spectacles (for those she usually
wore were of horn) and the large breastpin, with a weeping-willow
displayed upon it, which fastened her kerchief."Made out of your grandfather's tail, did you say, Toto?"said the bear,
in an undertone.cried the boy, half pettishly.Surely you might know by this time that we have no tails.""I beg your pardon,
Toto, boy.You are not really vexed with old Bruin?"Toto rubbed his curly head affectionately against the shaggy black one,
in token of amity, and the bear continued:--

"When Madam was a young grandmother, was she as beautiful as she is
now?""Why, yes, I fancy so," replied Toto."Only she wasn't a grandmother
then, you know."You never were
anything but a boy, were you?"When Granny
was young, she was a girl, you see.""I--do--_not_--believe it!I saw a girl once--many years ago; it squinted, and its hair was frowzy,
and it wore a hideous basket of flowers on its head,--a dreadful
creature!Madam never can have looked like _that_!"At this moment a knock was heard at the door.Toto flew to open it, and
with a beaming face ushered in the old hermit, who entered leaning on
his stick, with his crow perched on one shoulder and the hawk on the
other.What bows and
courtesies, and whisking of tails and flapping of wings!The hermit's
bow in greeting to the old lady was so stately that Master <DW53> was
consumed with a desire to imitate it; and in so doing, he stepped back
against the nose of the tea-kettle and burned himself, which caused him
to retire suddenly under the table with a smothered shriek.And the hawk and the pigeon, the raccoon and the crow,
the hermit and the bear, all shook paws and claws, and vowed that they
were delighted to see each other; and what is more, they really _were_
delighted, which is not always the case when such vows are made.Now, when all had become well acquainted, and every heart was prepared
to be merry, they sat down to supper; and the supper was not one which
was likely to make them less cheerful.For there was chicken and ham,
and, oh, such a mutton-pie!You never saw such a pie; the standing crust
was six inches high, and solid as a castle wall; and on that lay the
upper-crust, as lightly as a butterfly resting on a leaf; while inside
was store of good mutton, and moreover golden eggballs and tender little
onions, and gravy as rich as all the kings of the earth put together.and besides all that there was white bread like snow, and brown
bread as sweet as clover-blossoms, and jam and gingerbread, and apples
and nuts, and pitchers of cream and jugs of buttermilk.Truly, it does
one's heart good to think of such a supper, and I only wish that you and
I had been there to help eat it.However, there was no lack of hungry
mouths, with right good-will to keep their jaws at work, and for a time
there was little conversation around the table, but much joy and comfort
in the good victuals.The good grandmother ate little herself, though she listened with
pleasure to the stirring sound of knives and forks, which told her that
her guests were well and pleasantly employed.Presently the hermit
addressed her, and said:--

"Honored Madam, you will be glad to know that there has been a great
change in the weather during the past week.Truly, I think the spring is
at hand; for the snow is fast melting away, the sun shines with more
than winter's heat, and the air to-day is mild and soft."At these words there was a subdued but evident excitement among the
company.The raccoon and the squirrel exchanged swift and significant
glances; the birds, as if by one unconscious impulse, ruffled their
feathers and plumed themselves a little.But boy Toto's face fell, and
he looked at the bear, who, for his part, scratched his nose and looked
intently at the pattern on his plate."It has been a long, an unusually long, season," continued the hermit,
"though doubtless it has seemed much shorter to you in your cosey
cottage than to me in my lonely cavern.But I have lived the
forest-life long enough to know that some of you, my friends," and he
turned with a smile to the forest-friends, "must be already longing to
hear the first murmur of the greenwood spring, and to note in tree and
shrub the first signs of awakening life."There was a moment of silence, during which the raccoon shifted uneasily
on his seat, and looked about him with restless, gleaming eyes.Suddenly
the silence was broken by a singular noise, which made every one start.It was a long-drawn sound, something between a snort, a squeal, and a
snore; and it came from--where _did_ it come from?"It seemed to come," said the hawk, who sat facing the fire, "from the
wall near the fireplace."At this moment the sound was heard again, louder and more distinct, and
this time it certainly _did_ come from the wall,--or rather from the
cupboard in the wall, near the fireplace.Then came a muffled, scuffling sound, and finally
a shrill peevish voice cried, "Let me out!<DW53>, I
know your tricks; let me out, or I'll tell Bruin this minute!"The bear burst into a volcanic roar of laughter, which made the hermit
start and turn pale in spite of himself, and going to the cupboard he
drew out the unhappy woodchuck, hopelessly entangled in his worsted
covering, from which he had been vainly struggling to free himself.It seemed as they would never have done
laughing; while every moment the woodchuck grew more furious,--squeaking
and barking, and even trying to bite the mighty paw which held him.But
the wood-pigeon had pity on him, and with a few sharp pulls broke the
worsted net, and begged Bruin to set him down on the table.This being
done, Master Chucky found his nose within precisely half an inch of a
most excellent piece of dried beef, upon which he fell without more ado,
and stayed not to draw breath till the plate was polished clean and
dry.That made every one laugh again, and altogether they were very merry,
and fell to playing games and telling stories, leaving the woodchuck to
try the keen edge of his appetite upon every dish on the table.By-and-by, however, this gentleman could eat no more; so he wiped his
paws and whiskers, brushed his coat a little, and then joined in the
sport with right good-will.It was a pleasant sight to see the great bear blindfolded, chasing Toto
and <DW53> from one corner to another, in a grand game of blindman's buff;
it was pleasant to see them playing leap-frog, and spin-the-platter, and
many a good old-fashioned game besides.Then, when these sat down to
rest and recover their breath, what a treat it was to see the four birds
dance a quadrille, to the music of Toto's fiddle!How they fluttered and
sidled, and hopped and bridled!How gracefully Miss Mary courtesied to
the stately hawk; and how jealous the crow was of this rival, who stood
on one leg with such a perfect grace!altogether that was a party worth going to.And when late in the
evening it broke up, and the visitors started on their homeward walk,
all declared it was the merriest time they had yet had together, and all
wished that they might have many more such times.And yet each one knew
in his heart,--and grieved to know,--that it was the last, and that the
end was come.The woodchuck sounded, the next morning, the note
which had for days been vibrating in the hearts of all the wild
creatures, but which they had been loth to strike, for Toto's sake.I don't know what you are all
thinking of, to stay on here after you are awake.I smelt the wet earth
and the water, and the sap running in the trees, even in that dungeon
where you had put me.The young reeds will soon be starting beside the
pool, and it is my work to trim them and thin them out properly;
besides, I am going to dig a new burrow, this year.And the squirrel with a chuckle, and the wood-pigeon with a sigh, and
the raccoon with a strange feeling which he hardly understood, but
which was not all pleasure, echoed the words, "We must be off!"Only the
bear said nothing, for he was in the wood-shed, splitting kindling-wood
with a fury of energy which sent the chips flying as if he were a
saw-mill.So it came to pass that on a soft, bright day in April, when the sun was
shining sweetly, and the wind blew warm from the south, and the buds
were swelling on willow and alder, the party of friends stood around the
door of the little cottage, exchanging farewells, half merry, half sad,
and wholly loving."After all, it is hardly good-by!""We shall
be here half the time, just as we were last summer; and the other half,
Toto will be in the forest.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his right paw, and said nothing."And you will come to the forest, too, dear Madam!"cried the raccoon,
"will you not?You will bring the knitting and the gingerbread, and we
will have picnics by the pool, and you will learn to love the forest as
much as Toto does.But Bruin rubbed his nose with his left paw, and still said nothing."And when my nest is made, and my little ones are fledged," cooed the
wood-pigeon in her tender voice, "their first flight shall be to you,
dear Madam, and their first song shall tell you that they love you, and
that we love you, every day and all day.For we do love you; don't we,
Bruin?"But the bear only looked helplessly around him, and scratched his head,
and again said nothing."Well," said Toto, cheerily, though with a suspicion of a quiver in his
voice, "you are all jolly good fellows, and we have had a merry winter
together.Of course we shall miss you sadly, Granny and I; but as you
say, Cracker, we shall all see each other every day; and I am longing
for the forest, too, almost as much as you are.""Dear friends," said the blind grandmother, folding her hands upon her
stick, and turning her kindly face from one to the other of the
group,--"dear friends, merry and helpful companions, this has indeed
been a happy season that we have spent together.You have, one and all,
been a comfort and a help to me, and I think you have not been
discontented yourselves; still, the confinement has of course been
strange to you, and we cannot wonder that you pine for your free,
wildwood life.it is a mischievous paw, but it
has never played any tricks on me, and has helped me many and many a
time.My little Cracker, I shall miss your merry chatter as I sit at my
spinning-wheel.Mary, and Pigeon Pretty, let me stroke your soft
feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 44, illustration caption, "Wah-song!And then to my Lady, who do shew my wife and me the
greatest favour in the world, in which I take great content.Home by
water and to the office all the afternoon, which is a great pleasure to me
again, to talk with persons of quality and to be in command, and I give it
out among them that the estate left me is L200 a year in land, besides
moneys, because I would put an esteem upon myself.At night home and to
bed after I had set down my journals ever since my going from London this
journey to this house.This afternoon I hear that my man Will hath lost
his clock with my tankard, at which I am very glad.This morning came my box of papers from Brampton of all my uncle's
papers, which will now set me at work enough.At noon I went to the
Exchange, where I met my uncle Wight, and found him so discontented about
my father (whether that he takes it ill that he has not been acquainted
with things, or whether he takes it ill that he has nothing left him, I
cannot tell), for which I am much troubled, and so staid not long to talk
with him.Thence to my mother's, where I found my wife and my aunt Bell
and Mrs.Ramsey, and great store of tattle there was between the old women
and my mother, who thinks that there is, God knows what fallen to her,
which makes me mad, but it was not a proper time to speak to her of it,
and so I went away with Mr.Moore, and he and I to the Theatre, and saw
"The Jovial Crew," the first time I saw it, and indeed it is as merry and
the most innocent play that ever I saw, and well performed.From thence
home, and wrote to my father and so to bed.Full of thoughts to think of
the trouble that we shall go through before we come to see what will
remain to us of all our expectations.At home all the morning, and walking met with Mr.Hill of Cambridge
at Pope's Head Alley with some women with him whom he took and me into the
tavern there, and did give us wine, and would fain seem to be very knowing
in the affairs of state, and tells me that yesterday put a change to the
whole state of England as to the Church; for the King now would be forced
to favour Presbytery, or the City would leave him: but I heed not what he
says, though upon enquiry I do find that things in the Parliament are in a
great disorder.Moore, and with him to
an ordinary alone and dined, and there he and I read my uncle's will, and
I had his opinion on it, and still find more and more trouble like to
attend it.Back to the office all the afternoon, and that done home for
all night.Having the beginning of this week made a vow to myself to
drink no wine this week (finding it to unfit me to look after business),
and this day breaking of it against my will, I am much troubled for it,
but I hope God will forgive me.Montagu's chamber I heard a Frenchman
play, a friend of Monsieur Eschar's, upon the guitar, most extreme well,
though at the best methinks it is but a bawble.From thence to
Westminster Hall, where it was expected that the Parliament was to have
been adjourned for two or three months, but something hinders it for a day
or two.George Montagu, and advised about a
ship to carry my Lord Hinchingbroke and the rest of the young gentlemen to
France, and they have resolved of going in a hired vessell from Rye, and
not in a man of war.He told me in discourse that my Lord Chancellor is
much envied, and that many great men, such as the Duke of Buckingham and
my Lord of Bristoll, do endeavour to undermine him, and that he believes
it will not be done; for that the King (though he loves him not in the way
of a companion, as he do these young gallants that can answer him in his
pleasures), yet cannot be without him, for his policy and service.From
thence to the Wardrobe, where my wife met me, it being my Lord of
Sandwich's birthday, and so we had many friends here, Mr.Townsend and his
wife, and Captain Ferrers lady and Captain Isham, and were very merry, and
had a good venison pasty.Pargiter, the merchant, was with us also.Townsend was called upon by Captain Cooke: so we three
went to a tavern hard by, and there he did give us a song or two; and
without doubt he hath the best manner of singing in the world.Back to my
wife, and with my Lady Jem.and Pall by water through bridge, and showed
them the ships with great pleasure, and then took them to my house to show
it them (my Lady their mother having been lately all alone to see it and
my wife, in my absence in the country), and we treated them well, and were
very merry.Then back again through bridge, and set them safe at home,
and so my wife and I by coach home again, and after writing a letter to my
father at Brampton, who, poor man, is there all alone, and I have not
heard from him since my coming from him, which troubles me.This morning as my wife and I were going to church,
comes Mrs.Ramsay to see us, so we sent her to church, and we went too,
and came back to dinner, and she dined with us and was wellcome.To
church again in the afternoon, and then come home with us Sir W. Pen, and
drank with us, and then went away, and my wife after him to see his
daughter that is lately come out of Ireland.I staid at home at my book;
she came back again and tells me that whereas I expected she should have
been a great beauty, she is a very plain girl.This evening my wife gives
me all my linen, which I have put up, and intend to keep it now in my own
custody.This morning we began again to sit in the mornings at the office,
but before we sat down.Sir R. Slingsby and I went to Sir R. Ford's to
see his house, and we find it will be very convenient for us to have it
added to the office if he can be got to part with it.Then we sat down
and did business in the office.So home to dinner, and my brother Tom
dined with me, and after dinner he and I alone in my chamber had a great
deal of talk, and I find that unless my father can forbear to make profit
of his house in London and leave it to Tom, he has no mind to set up the
trade any where else, and so I know not what to do with him.After this I
went with him to my mother, and there told her how things do fall out
short of our expectations, which I did (though it be true) to make her
leave off her spending, which I find she is nowadays very free in,
building upon what is left to us by my uncle to bear her out in it, which
troubles me much.While I was here word is brought that my aunt Fenner is
exceeding ill, and that my mother is sent for presently to come to her:
also that my cozen Charles Glassecocke, though very ill himself, is this
day gone to the country to his brother, John Glassecocke, who is a-dying
there.After my singing-master had done with me this morning, I went to
White Hall and Westminster Hall, where I found the King expected to come
and adjourn the Parliament.I found the two Houses at a great difference,
about the Lords challenging their privileges not to have their houses
searched, which makes them deny to pass the House of Commons' Bill for
searching for pamphlets and seditious books.Thence by water to the
Wardrobe (meeting the King upon the water going in his barge to adjourn
the House) where I dined with my Lady, and there met Dr.Thomas Pepys, who
I found to be a silly talking fellow, but very good-natured.So home to
the office, where we met about the business of Tangier this afternoon.Moore, and he and I walked into the City
and there parted.To Fleet Street to find when the Assizes begin at
Cambridge and Huntingdon, in order to my going to meet with Roger Pepys
for counsel.Salisbury, who is now
grown in less than two years' time so great a limner--that he is become
excellent, and gets a great deal of money at it.I took him to Hercules
Pillars to drink, and there came Mr.Whore (whom I formerly have known), a
friend of his to him, who is a very ingenious fellow, and there I sat with
them a good while, and so home and wrote letters late to my Lord and to my
father, and then to bed.Singing-master came to me this morning; then to the office all the
morning.In the afternoon I went to the Theatre, and there I saw "The
Tamer Tamed"  well done.And then home, and prepared to go to Walthamstow
to-morrow.This night I was forced to borrow L40 of Sir W. Batten.DIARY OF SAMUEL PEPYS.AUGUST
                                   1661

August 1st.This morning Sir Williams both, and my wife and I and Mrs.Margarett Pen (this first time that I have seen her since she came from
Ireland) went by coach to Walthamstow, a-gossiping to Mrs.Browne, where I
did give her six silver spoons--[But not the porringer of silver.See May
29th, 1661.--M.Here we had a venison pasty, brought hot
from London, and were very merry.Only I hear how nurse's husband has
spoken strangely of my Lady Batten how she was such a man's whore, who
indeed is known to leave her her estate, which we would fain have
reconciled to-day, but could not and indeed I do believe that the story is
true.Pepys dined with
me, and after dinner my brother Tom came to me and then I made myself
ready to get a-horseback for Cambridge.So I set out and rode to Ware,
this night, in the way having much discourse with a fellmonger,--[A dealer
in hides.]--a Quaker, who told me what a wicked man he had been all his
life-time till within this two years.Here I lay, and

3rd.Got up early the next morning and got to Barkway, where I staid and
drank, and there met with a letter-carrier of Cambridge, with whom I rode
all the way to Cambridge, my horse being tired, and myself very wet with
rain.I went to the Castle Hill, where the judges were at the Assizes;
and I staid till Roger Pepys rose and went with him, and dined with his
brother, the Doctor, and Claxton at Trinity Hall.Then parted, and I went
to the Rose, and there with Mr.Pechell, Sanchy, and others, sat and drank
till night and were very merry, only they tell me how high the old doctors
are in the University over those they found there, though a great deal
better scholars than themselves; for which I am very sorry, and, above
all, Dr.At night I took horse, and rode with Roger Pepys and
his two brothers to Impington, and there with great respect was led up by
them to the best chamber in the house, and there slept.Got up, and by and by walked into the orchard with my
cozen Roger, and there plucked some fruit, and then discoursed at large
about the business I came for, that is, about my uncle's will, in which he
did give me good satisfaction, but tells me I shall meet with a great deal
of trouble in it.However, in all things he told me what I am to expect
and what to do.To church, and had a good plain sermon, and my uncle
Talbot went with us and at our coming in the country-people all rose with
so much reverence; and when the parson begins, he begins "Right
worshipfull and dearly beloved" to us.Home to dinner, which was very
good, and then to church again, and so home and to walk up and down and so
to supper, and after supper to talk about publique matters, wherein Roger
Pepys--(who I find a very sober man, and one whom I do now honour more
than ever before for this discourse sake only) told me how basely things
have been carried in Parliament by the young men, that did labour to
oppose all things that were moved by serious men.That they are the most
prophane swearing fellows that ever he heard in his life, which makes him
think that they will spoil all, and bring things into a warr again if they
can.Early to Huntingdon, but was fain to stay a great while at Stanton
because of the rain, and there borrowed a coat of a man for 6d., and so he
rode all the way, poor man, without any.Staid at Huntingdon for a
little, but the judges are not come hither: so I went to Brampton, and
there found my father very well, and my aunt gone from the house, which I
am glad of, though it costs us a great deal of money, viz.Here I
dined, and after dinner took horse and rode to Yelling, to my cozen
Nightingale's, who hath a pretty house here, and did learn of her all she
could tell me concerning my business, and has given me some light by her
discourse how I may get a surrender made for Graveley lands.Hence to
Graveley, and there at an alehouse met with Chancler and Jackson (one of
my tenants for Cotton closes) and another with whom I had a great deal of
discourse, much to my satisfaction.Hence back again to Brampton and
after supper to bed, being now very quiet in the house, which is a content
to us.Phillips, but lost my labour, he lying at
Huntingdon last night, so I went back again and took horse and rode
thither, where I staid with Thos.Philips drinking till
noon, and then Tom Trice and I to Brampton, where he to Goody Gorum's and
I home to my father, who could discern that I had been drinking, which he
did never see or hear of before, so I eat a bit of dinner and went with
him to Gorum's, and there talked with Tom Trice, and then went and took
horse for London, and with much ado, the ways being very bad, got to
Baldwick, and there lay and had a good supper by myself.The landlady
being a pretty woman, but I durst not take notice of her, her husband
being there.Before supper I went to see the church, which is a very
handsome church, but I find that both here, and every where else that I
come, the Quakers do still continue, and rather grow than lessen.Called up at three o'clock, and was a-horseback by four; and as I
was eating my breakfast I saw a man riding by that rode a little way upon
the road with me last night; and he being going with venison in his
pan-yards to London, I called him in and did give him his breakfast with
me, and so we went together all the way.At Hatfield we bayted and walked
into the great house through all the courts; and I would fain have stolen
a pretty dog that followed me, but I could not, which troubled me.To
horse again, and by degrees with much ado got to London, where I found all
well at home and at my father's and my Lady's, but no news yet from my
Lord where he is.At my Lady's (whither I went with Dean Fuller, who came
to my house to see me just as I was come home) I met with Mr.Moore, who
told me at what a loss he was for me, for to-morrow is a Seal day at the
Privy Seal, and it being my month, I am to wait upon my Lord Roberts, Lord
Privy Seal, at the Seal.Early in the mornink to Whitehall, but my Lord Privy Seal came not
all the morning.Moore and I to the Wardrobe to dinner, where
my Lady and all merry and well.Back again to the Privy Seal; but my Lord
comes not all the afternoon, which made me mad and gives all the world
reason to talk of his delaying of business, as well as of his severity and
ill using of the Clerks of the Privy Seal.Pierce's brother (the souldier) to the tavern
next the Savoy, and there staid and drank with them.Mage, and discoursing of musique Mons.Eschar spoke so much against the
English and in praise of the French that made him mad, and so he went
away.After a stay with them a little longer we parted and I home.To the office, where word is brought me by a son-in-law of Mr.Pierces; the purser, that his father is a dying and that he desires that I
would come to him before he dies.So I rose from the table and went,
where I found him not so ill as I thought that he had been ill.So I did
promise to be a friend to his wife and family if he should die, which was
all he desired of me, but I do believe he will recover.Back again to the
office, where I found Sir G. Carteret had a day or two ago invited some of
the officers to dinner to-day at Deptford.So at noon, when I heard that
he was a-coming, I went out, because I would see whether he would send to
me or no to go with them; but he did not, which do a little trouble me
till I see how it comes to pass.Although in other things I am glad of it
because of my going again to-day to the Privy Seal.I dined at home, and
having dined news is brought by Mr.Hater that his wife is now falling
into labour, so he is come for my wife, who presently went with him.I to
White Hall, where, after four o'clock, comes my Lord Privy Seal, and so we
went up to his chamber over the gate at White Hall, where he asked me what
deputacon I had from My Lord.I told him none; but that I am sworn my
Lord's deputy by both of the Secretarys, which did satisfy him.Moore to read over all the bills as is the manner, and all
ended very well.So that I see the Lyon is not so fierce as he is
painted.Eschar (who all this afternoon had been
waiting at the Privy Seal for the Warrant for L5,000 for my Lord of
Sandwich's preparation for Portugal) and I took some wine with us and went
to visit la belle Pierce, who we find very big with child, and a pretty
lady, one Mrs.Clifford, with her, where we staid and were extraordinary
merry.From thence I took coach to my father's, where I found him come
home this day from Brampton (as I expected) very well, and after some
discourse about business and it being very late I took coach again home,
where I hear by my wife that Mrs.Hater is not yet delivered, but
continues in her pains.This morning came the maid that my wife hath lately hired for a
chamber maid.She is very ugly, so that I cannot care for her, but
otherwise she seems very good.But however she do come about three weeks
hence, when my wife comes back from Brampton, if she go with my father.By
and by came my father to my house, and so he and I went and found out my
uncle Wight at the Coffee House, and there did agree with him to meet the
next week with my uncle Thomas and read over the Captain's will before
them both for their satisfaction.Having done with him I went to my
Lady's and dined with her, and after dinner took the two young gentlemen
and the two ladies and carried them and Captain Ferrers to the Theatre,
and shewed them "The merry Devill of Edmunton," which is a very merry
play, the first time I ever saw it, which pleased me well.And that being
done I took them all home by coach to my house and there gave them fruit
to eat and wine.So by water home with them, and so home myself.To our own church in the forenoon, and in the
afternoon to Clerkenwell Church, only to see the two

     [A comedy acted at the Globe, and first printed in 1608.In the
     original entry in the Stationers' books it is said to be by T. B.,
     which may stand for Tony or Anthony Brewer.The play has been
     attributed without authority both to Shakespeare and to Drayton.]fayre Botelers;--[Mrs.--and I happened to
be placed in the pew where they afterwards came to sit, but the pew by
their coming being too full, I went out into the next, and there sat, and
had my full view of them both, but I am out of conceit now with them,
Colonel Dillon being come back from Ireland again, and do still court
them, and comes to church with them, which makes me think they are not
honest.Hence to Graye's-Inn walks, and there staid a good while; where I
met with Ned Pickering, who told me what a great match of hunting of a
stagg the King had yesterday; and how the King tired all their horses, and
come home with not above two or three able to keep pace with him.So to
my father's, and there supped, and so home.At home in the afternoon, and had
notice that my Lord Hinchingbroke is fallen ill, which I fear is with the
fruit that I did give them on Saturday last at my house: so in the evening
I went thither and there found him very ill, and in great fear of the
smallpox.I supped with my Lady, and did consult about him, but we find
it best to let him lie where he do; and so I went home with my heart full
of trouble for my Lord Hinchinabroke's sickness, and more for my Lord
Sandwich's himself, whom we are now confirmed is sick ashore at Alicante,
who, if he should miscarry, God knows in what condition would his family
be.I dined to-day with my Lord Crew, who is now at Sir H. Wright's,
while his new house is making fit for him, and he is much troubled also at
these things.To the Privy Seal in the morning, then to the Wardrobe to dinner,
where I met my wife, and found my young Lord very ill.So my Lady intends
to send her other three sons, Sidney, Oliver, and John, to my house, for
fear of the small-pox.After dinner I went to my father's, where I found
him within, and went up to him, and there found him settling his papers
against his removal, and I took some old papers of difference between me
and my wife and took them away.After that Pall being there I spoke to my
father about my intention not to keep her longer for such and such
reasons, which troubled him and me also, and had like to have come to some
high words between my mother and me, who is become a very simple woman.Cordery to take her leave of my father, thinking
he was to go presently into the country, and will have us to come and see
her before he do go.Then my father and I went forth to Mr.Rawlinson's,
where afterwards comes my uncle Thomas and his two sons, and then my uncle
Wight by appointment of us all, and there we read the will and told them
how things are, and what our thoughts are of kindness to my uncle Thomas
if he do carry himself peaceable, but otherwise if he persist to keep his
caveat up against us.So he promised to withdraw it, and seemed to be
very well contented with things as they are.After a while drinking, we
paid all and parted, and so I home, and there found my Lady's three sons
come, of which I am glad that I am in condition to do her and my Lord any
service in this kind, but my mind is yet very much troubled about my Lord
of Sandwich's health, which I am afeard of.This morning Sir W. Batten and Sir W. Pen and I, waited upon the
Duke of York in his chamber, to give him an account of the condition of
the Navy for lack of money, and how our own very bills are offered upon
the Exchange, to be sold at 20 in the 100 loss.He is much troubled at
it, and will speak to the King and Council of it this morning.So I went
to my Lady's and dined with her, and found my Lord Hinchingbroke somewhat
better.After dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Alchymist;" and there I saw Sir W. Pen, who took us when the play was
done and carried the Captain to Paul's and set him down, and me home with
him, and he and I to the Dolphin, but not finding Sir W. Batten there, we
went and carried a bottle of wine to his house, and there sat a while and
talked, and so home to bed.Creed of
the 15th of July last, that tells me that my Lord is rid of his pain
(which was wind got into the muscles of his right side) and his feaver,
and is now in hopes to go aboard in a day or two, which do give me mighty
great comfort.To the Privy Seal and Whitehall, up and down, and at noon Sir W.
Pen carried me to Paul's, and so I walked to the Wardrobe and dined with
my Lady, and there told her, of my Lord's sickness (of which though it
hath been the town-talk this fortnight, she had heard nothing) and
recovery, of which she was glad, though hardly persuaded of the latter.I
found my Lord Hinchingbroke better and better, and the worst past.Thence
to the Opera, which begins again to-day with "The Witts," never acted yet
with scenes; and the King and Duke and Duchess were there (who dined
to-day with Sir H. Finch, reader at the Temple, in great state); and
indeed it is a most excellent play, and admirable scenes.So home and was
overtaken by Sir W. Pen in his coach, who has been this afternoon with my
Lady Batten, &c., at the Theatre.So I followed him to the Dolphin, where
Sir W. Batten was, and there we sat awhile, and so home after we had made
shift to fuddle Mr.At the office all the morning, though little to be done; because
all our clerks are gone to the buriall of Tom Whitton, one of the
Controller's clerks, a very ingenious, and a likely young man to live, as
any in the Office.But it is such a sickly time both in City and country
every where (of a sort of fever), that never was heard of almost, unless
it was in a plague-time.Among others, the famous Tom Fuller is dead of it; and Dr.Nichols, Dean
of Paul's; and my Lord General Monk is very dangerously ill.Dined at
home with the children and were merry, and my father with me; who after
dinner he and I went forth about business.John Williams at an alehouse, where we staid till past nine at
night, in Shoe Lane, talking about our country business, and I found him
so well acquainted with the matters of Gravely that I expect he will be of
great use to me.I understand my Aunt Fenner is upon
the point of death.At the Privy Seal, where we had a seal this morning.Then met with
Ned Pickering, and walked with him into St.James's Park (where I had not
been a great while), and there found great and very noble alterations.And, in our discourse, he was very forward to complain and to speak loud
of the lewdness and beggary of the Court, which I am sorry to hear, and
which I am afeard will bring all to ruin again.So he and I to the
Wardrobe to dinner, and after dinner Captain Ferrers and I to the Opera,
and saw "The Witts" again, which I like exceedingly.The Queen of Bohemia
was here, brought by my Lord Craven.So the Captain and I and another to
the Devil tavern and drank, and so by coach home.Troubled in mind that I
cannot bring myself to mind my business, but to be so much in love of
plays.We have been at a great loss a great while for a vessel that I
sent about a month ago with, things of my Lord's to Lynn, and cannot till
now hear of them, but now we are told that they are put into Soale Bay,
but to what purpose I know not.To our own church in the morning and so home to
dinner, where my father and Dr.Tom Pepys came to me to dine, and were
very merry.Sidney to my Lady to see
my Lord Hinchingbroke, who is now pretty well again, and sits up and walks
about his chamber.So I went to White Hall, and there hear that my Lord
General Monk continues very ill: so I went to la belle Pierce and sat with
her; and then to walk in St.James's Park, and saw great variety of fowl
which I never saw before and so home.At night fell to read in "Hooker's
Ecclesiastical Polity," which Mr.Moore did give me last Wednesday very
handsomely bound; and which I shall read with great pains and love for his
sake.At the office all the morning; at noon the children are sent for by
their mother my Lady Sandwich to dinner, and my wife goes along with them
by coach, and she to my father's and dines there, and from thence with
them to see Mrs.Cordery, who do invite them before my father goes into
the country, and thither I should have gone too but that I am sent for to
the Privy Seal, and there I found a thing of my Lord Chancellor's

     [This "thing" was probably one of those large grants which Clarendon
     quietly, or, as he himself says, "without noise or scandal,"
     procured from the king.Besides lands and manors, Clarendon states
     at one time that the king gave him a "little billet into his hand,
     that contained a warrant of his own hand-writing to Sir Stephen Fox
     to pay to the Chancellor the sum of L20,000,--[approximately 10
     million dollars in the year 2000]--of which nobody could have
     notice."In 1662 he received L5,000 out of the money voted to the
     king by the Parliament of Ireland, as he mentions in his vindication
     of himself against the impeachment of the Commons; and we shall see
     that Pepys, in February, 1664, names another sum of L20,000 given to
     the Chancellor to clear the mortgage upon Clarendon Park; and this
     last sum, it was believed, was paid from the money received from
     France by the sale of Dunkirk.--B.]to be sealed this afternoon, and so I am forced to go to Worcester House,
where severall Lords are met in Council this afternoon.And while I am
waiting there, in comes the King in a plain common riding-suit and velvet
cap, in which he seemed a very ordinary man to one that had not known him.Here I staid till at last, hearing that my Lord Privy Seal had not the
seal here, Mr.Moore and I hired a coach and went to Chelsy, and there at
an alehouse sat and drank and past the time till my Lord Privy Seal came
to his house, and so we to him and examined and sealed the thing, and so
homewards, but when we came to look for our coach we found it gone, so we
were fain to walk home afoot and saved our money.We met with a companion
that walked with us, and coming among some trees near the Neate houses, he
began to whistle, which did give us some suspicion, but it proved that he
that answered him was Mr.Marsh (the Lutenist) and his wife, and so we all
walked to Westminster together, in our way drinking a while at my cost,
and had a song of him, but his voice is quite lost.So walked home, and
there I found that my Lady do keep the children at home, and lets them not
come any more hither at present, which a little troubles me to lose their
company.At the office in the morning and all the afternoon at home to put
my papers in order.This day we come to some agreement with Sir R. Ford
for his house to be added to the office to enlarge our quarters.This morning by appointment I went to my father, and after a
morning draft he and I went to Dr.Williams, but he not within we went to
Mrs.Whately's, who lately offered a proposal of
her sister for a wife for my brother Tom, and with her we discoursed about
and agreed to go to her mother this afternoon to speak with her, and in
the meantime went to Will.Joyce's and to an alehouse, and drank a good
while together, he being very angry that his father Fenner will give him
and his brother no more for mourning than their father did give him and my
aunt at their mother's death, and a very troublesome fellow I still find
him to be, that his company ever wearys me.From thence about two o'clock
to Mrs.Whately's, but she being going to dinner we went to Whitehall and
there staid till past three, and here I understand by Mr.Moore that my
Lady Sandwich is brought to bed yesterday of a young Lady, and is very
well.Whately's again, and there were well received, and she
desirous to have the thing go forward, only is afeard that her daughter is
too young and portion not big enough, but offers L200 down with her.The
girl is very well favoured,, and a very child, but modest, and one I think
will do very well for my brother: so parted till she hears from Hatfield
from her husband, who is there; but I find them very desirous of it, and
so am I. Hence home to my father's, and I to the Wardrobe, where I supped
with the ladies, and hear their mother is well and the young child, and so
home.To the Privy Seal, and sealed; so home at noon, and there took my
wife by coach to my uncle Fenner's, where there was both at his house and
the Sessions, great deal of company, but poor entertainment, which I
wonder at; and the house so hot, that my uncle Wight, my father and I were
fain to go out, and stay at an alehouse awhile to cool ourselves.Then
back again and to church, my father's family being all in mourning, doing
him the greatest honour, the world believing that he did give us it: so to
church, and staid out the sermon, and then with my aunt Wight, my wife,
and Pall and I to her house by coach, and there staid and supped upon a
Westphalia ham, and so home and to bed.This morning I went to my father's, and there found him and my
mother in a discontent, which troubles me much, and indeed she is become
very simple and unquiet.Williams, and found him
within, and there we sat and talked a good while, and from him to Tom
Trice's to an alehouse near, and there sat and talked, and finding him
fair we examined my uncle's will before him and Dr.Williams, and had them
sign the copy and so did give T. Trice the original to prove, so he took
my father and me to one of the judges of the Court, and there we were
sworn, and so back again to the alehouse and drank and parted.Williams and I to a cook's where we eat a bit of mutton, and away, I to W.
Joyce's, where by appointment my wife was, and I took her to the Opera,
and shewed her "The Witts," which I had seen already twice, and was most
highly pleased with it.So with my wife to the Wardrobe to see my Lady,
and then home.At the office all the morning and did business; by and by we are
called to Sir W. Batten's to see the strange creature that Captain Holmes
hath brought with him from Guiny; it is a great baboon, but so much like a
man in most things, that though they say there is a species of them, yet I
cannot believe but that it is a monster got of a man and she-baboon.I do
believe that it already understands much English, and I am of the mind it
might be taught to speak or make signs.Hence the Comptroller and I to
Sir Rd.Ford's and viewed the house again, and are come to a complete end
with him to give him L200 per an.Isham
inquiring for me to take his leave of me, he being upon his voyage to
Portugal, and for my letters to my Lord which are not ready.But I took
him to the Mitre and gave him a glass of sack, and so adieu, and then
straight to the Opera, and there saw "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark," done
with scenes very well, but above all, Betterton

     [Sir William Davenant introduced the use of scenery.The character
     of Hamlet was one of Betterton's masterpieces.Downes tells us that
     he was taught by Davenant how the part was acted by Taylor of the
     Blackfriars, who was instructed by Shakespeare himself.]Hence homeward, and met with
Mr.Spong and took him to the Sampson in Paul's churchyard, and there
staid till late, and it rained hard, so we were fain to get home wet, and
so to bed.At church in the morning, and dined at home alone with
my wife very comfortably, and so again to church with her, and had a very
good and pungent sermon of Mr.Mills, discoursing the necessity of
restitution.Home, and I found my Lady Batten and her daughter to look
something askew upon my wife, because my wife do not buckle to them, and
is not solicitous for their acquaintance, which I am not troubled at at
all.By and by comes in my father (he intends to go into the country
to-morrow), and he and I among other discourse at last called Pall up to
us, and there in great anger told her before my father that I would keep
her no longer, and my father he said he would have nothing to do with her.At last, after we had brought down her high spirit, I got my father to
yield that she should go into the country with my mother and him, and stay
there awhile to see how she will demean herself.That being done, my
father and I to my uncle Wight's, and there supped, and he took his leave
of them, and so I walked with [him] as far as Paul's and there parted, and
I home, my mind at some rest upon this making an end with Pall, who do
trouble me exceedingly.This morning before I went out I made even with my maid Jane, who
has this day been my maid three years, and is this day to go into the
country to her mother.The poor girl cried, and I could hardly forbear
weeping to think of her going, for though she be grown lazy and spoilt by
Pall's coming, yet I shall never have one to please us better in all
things, and so harmless, while I live.So I paid her her wages and gave
her 2s.over, and bade her adieu, with my mind full of trouble at her
going.Hence to my father, where he and I and Thomas together setting
things even, and casting up my father's accounts, and upon the whole I
find that all he hath in money of his own due to him in the world is but
L45, and he owes about the same sum: so that I cannot but think in what a
condition he had left my mother if he should have died before my uncle
Robert.Hence to Tom Trice for the probate of the will and had it done to
my mind, which did give my father and me good content.From thence to my
Lady at the Wardrobe and thence to the Theatre, and saw the "Antipodes,"
wherein there is much mirth, but no great matter else.Bostock whom I met there (a clerk formerly of Mr.Phelps) to the Devil
tavern, and there drank and so away.I to my uncle Fenner's, where my
father was with him at an alehouse, and so we three went by ourselves and
sat talking a great while about a broker's daughter that he do propose for
a wife for Tom, with a great portion, but I fear it will not take, but he
will do what he can.So we broke up, and going through the street we met
with a mother and son, friends of my father's man, Ned's, who are angry at
my father's putting him away, which troubled me and my father, but all
will be well as to that.We have news this morning of my uncle Thomas and
his son Thomas being gone into the country without giving notice thereof
to anybody, which puts us to a stand, but I fear them not.At night at
home I found a letter from my Lord Sandwich, who is now very well again of
his feaver, but not yet gone from Alicante, where he lay sick, and was
twice let blood.This letter dated the 22nd July last, which puts me out
of doubt of his being ill.In my coming home I called in at the Crane
tavern at the Stocks by appointment, and there met and took leave of Mr.Fanshaw, who goes to-morrow and Captain Isham toward their voyage to
Portugal.Here we drank a great deal of wine, I too much and Mr.Fanshaw
till he could hardly go.This morning to the Wardrobe, and there took leave of my Lord
Hinchingbroke and his brother, and saw them go out by coach toward Rye in
their way to France, whom God bless.Then I was called up to my Lady's
bedside, where we talked an hour about Mr.Edward Montagu's disposing of
the L5000 for my Lord's departure for Portugal, and our fears that he will
not do it to my Lord's honour, and less to his profit, which I am to
enquire a little after.Hence to the office, and there sat till noon, and
then my wife and I by coach to my cozen, Thos.Pepys, the Executor, to
dinner, where some ladies and my father and mother, where very merry, but
methinks he makes but poor dinners for such guests, though there was a
poor venison pasty.Hence my wife and I to the Theatre, and there saw
"The Joviall Crew," where the King, Duke and Duchess, and Madame Palmer,
were; and my wife, to her great content, had a full sight of them all the
while.Hence to my father's, and there staid to
talk a while and so by foot home by moonshine.In my way and at home, my
wife making a sad story to me of her brother Balty's a condition, and
would have me to do something for him, which I shall endeavour to do, but
am afeard to meddle therein for fear I shall not be able to wipe my hands
of him again, when I once concern myself for him.I went to bed, my wife
all the while telling me his case with tears, which troubled me.At home all the morning setting papers in order.At noon to the
Exchange, and there met with Dr.Williams by appointment, and with him
went up and down to look for an attorney, a friend of his, to advise with
about our bond of my aunt Pepys of L200, and he tells me absolutely that
we shall not be forced to pay interest for the money yet.I spent the whole afternoon drinking with him and so home.This day I counterfeited a letter to Sir W. Pen, as from the thief that
stole his tankard lately, only to abuse and laugh at him.At the office all the morning, and at noon my father, mother, and
my aunt Bell (the first time that ever she was at my house) come to dine
with me, and were very merry.After dinner the two women went to visit my
aunt Wight, &c., and my father about other business, and I abroad to my
bookseller, and there staid till four o'clock, at which time by
appointment I went to meet my father at my uncle Fenner's.So thither I
went and with him to an alehouse, and there came Mr.Evans, the taylor,
whose daughter we have had a mind to get for a wife for Tom, and then my
father, and there we sat a good while and talked about the business; in
fine he told us that he hath not to except against us or our motion, but
that the estate that God hath blessed him with is too great to give where
there is nothing in present possession but a trade and house; and so we
friendly ended.There parted, my father and I together, and walked a
little way, and then at Holborn he and I took leave of one another, he
being to go to Brampton (to settle things against my mother comes)
tomorrow morning.At noon my wife and I met at the Wardrobe, and there dined with the
children, and after dinner up to my Lady's bedside, and talked and laughed
a good while.Then my wife end I to Drury Lane to the French comedy,
which was so ill done, and the scenes and company and every thing else so
nasty and out of order and poor, that I was sick all the while in my mind
to be there.Here my wife met with a son of my Lord Somersett, whom she
knew in France, a pretty man; I showed him no great countenance, to avoyd
further acquaintance.That done, there being nothing pleasant but the
foolery of the farce, we went home.At home and the office all the morning, and at noon comes Luellin
to me, and he and I to the tavern and after that to Bartholomew fair, and
there upon his motion to a pitiful alehouse, where we had a dirty slut or
two come up that were whores, but my very heart went against them, so that
I took no pleasure but a great deal of trouble in being there and getting
from thence for fear of being seen.From hence he and I walked towards
Ludgate and parted.I back again to the fair all alone, and there met
with my Ladies Jemimah and Paulina, with Mr.Pickering and Madamoiselle,
at seeing the monkeys dance, which was much to see, when they could be
brought to do so, but it troubled me to sit among such nasty company.After that with them into Christ's Hospitall, and there Mr.Pickering
bought them some fairings, and I did give every one of them a bauble,
which was the little globes of glass with things hanging in them, which
pleased the ladies very well.After that home with them in their coach,
and there was called up to my Lady, and she would have me stay to talk
with her, which I did I think a full hour.And the poor lady did with so
much innocency tell me how Mrs.Crispe had told her that she did intend,
by means of a lady that lies at her house, to get the King to be godfather
to the young lady that she is in childbed now of; but to see in what a
manner my Lady told it me, protesting that she sweat in the very telling
of it, was the greatest pleasure to me in the world to see the simplicity
and harmlessness of a lady.Then down to supper with the ladies, and so
home, Mr.Moore (as he and I cannot easily part) leading me as far as
Fenchurch Street to the Mitre, where we drank a glass of wine and so
parted, and I home and to bed.My maid Jane newly gone, and Pall left now to do all
the work till another maid comes, which shall not be till she goes away
into the country with my mother.My Lord
Sandwich in the Straits and newly recovered of a great sickness at
Alicante.My father gone to settle at Brampton, and myself under much
business and trouble for to settle things in the estate to our content.But what is worst, I find myself lately too much given to seeing of plays,
and expense, and pleasure, which makes me forget my business, which I must
labour to amend.No money comes in, so that I have been forced to borrow
a great deal for my own expenses, and to furnish my father, to leave
things in order.I have some trouble about my brother Tom, who is now
left to keep my father's trade, in which I have great fears that he will
miscarry for want of brains and care.At Court things are in very ill
condition, there being so much emulacion, poverty, and the vices of
drinking, swearing, and loose amours, that I know not what will be the end
of it, but confusion.And the Clergy so high, that all people that I meet
with do protest against their practice.In short, I see no content or
satisfaction any where, in any one sort of people.The Benevolence

     [A voluntary contribution made by the subjects to their sovereign.Upon this occasion the clergy alone gave L33,743: See May 31st,
     1661.--B]

proves so little, and an occasion of so much discontent every where; that
it had better it had never been set up.We are
at our Office quiet, only for lack of money all things go to rack.Our
very bills offered to be sold upon the Exchange at 10 per cent.We
are upon getting Sir R. Ford's house added to our Office.But I see so
many difficulties will follow in pleasing of one another in the dividing
of it, and in becoming bound personally to pay the rent of L200 per annum,
that I do believe it will yet scarce come to pass.The season very sickly
every where of strange and fatal fevers.ETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:

     Sat before Mrs."_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."John went to the hallway.Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!John went back to the garden.La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
trans
