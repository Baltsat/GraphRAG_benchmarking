It was not
strange, therefore, that country life had matured her native love of
flowers into almost a passion, which culminated in her intense enjoyment of
the rose in all its varieties.The family, aware of this marked preference,
rarely left her without these flowers at any season; but in June her eyes
feasted on their varied forms and colors, and she distinguished between her
favorites with all the zest and accuracy which a connoisseur of wines ever
brought to bear upon their delicate bouquet.With eyes shut she could name
from its perfume almost any rose with which she was familiar.Therefore, in
all the flower-beds and borders roses abounded, especially the
old-fashioned kinds, which are again finding a place in florists'
catalogues.Originally led by love for his mother, Webb, years since, had
begun to give attention to the queen of flowers.He soon found, however,
that the words of an English writer are true, "He who would have beautiful
roses in his garden must have them first in his heart," and there, with
queenly power, they soon enthroned themselves.In one corner of the garden,
which was protected on the north and west by a high stone wall, where the
soil was warm, loamy, and well drained, he made a little rose garden.He
bought treatises on the flower, and when he heard of or saw a variety that
was particularly fine he added it to his collection."Webb is marked with
my love of roses," his mother often said, with her low, pleased laugh.Amy
had observed that even in busiest times he often visited his rose garden as
if it contained pets that were never forgotten.He once laughingly remarked
that he "gave receptions there only by special invitation," and so she had
never seen the spot except from a distance.On the third morning after her birthday Amy came down very early.The bird
symphony had penetrated her open windows with such a jubilant resonance
that she had been awakened almost with the dawn.The air was so cool and
exhilarating, and there was such a wealth of dewy beauty on every side,
that she yielded to the impulse to go out and enjoy the most delightful
hour of the day.To her surprise, she saw Webb going down the path leading
to the garden."What's on your conscience," she cried, "that you can't
sleep?""The shame of leaving so many mornings like this unseen and not enjoyed.I
mean to repent and mend my ways from this time forth; that is, if I wake
up."Well, I did not know," she said, joining him, "but that you were going to
visit that _sanctum sanctorum_ of yours."Your virtue of early rising is about to be rewarded.You know when
some great personage is to be specially honored, he is given the freedom of
a city or library, etc.I shall now give you the freedom of my rose garden
for the rest of the summer, and from this time till frost you can always
find roses for your belt.I meant to do this on your birthday, but the buds
were not sufficiently forward this backward season."Oh, Webb, what miracles have you been working here?"she
exclaimed, as she passed through some screening shrubbery, and looked upon
a plot given up wholly to roses, many of which were open, more in the phase
of exquisite buds, while the majority were still closely wrapped in their
green calyxes.At the same time,
let me assure you that this small place is like a picture-gallery, and that
there is a chance here for as nice discrimination as there would be in a
cabinet full of works of art.There are few duplicate roses in this place,
and I have been years in selecting and winnowing this collection.They are
all named varieties, labelled in my mind.I love them too well, and am too
familiar with them, to hang disfiguring bits of wood upon them.Each one has been chosen and kept because of
some individual point of excellence, and you can gradually learn to
recognize these characteristics just as mother does.This plot here is
filled with hardy hybrid perpetuals, and that with tender tea-roses,
requiring very different treatment.Here is a moss that will bloom again in
the autumn.It has a sounding name--_Soupert-et-notting_--but it is
worthy of any name.Though not so mossy as some others, look at its fine
form and beautiful rose-color.Only one or two are out yet, but in a week
this bush will be a thing of beauty that one would certainly wish might
last forever.Nothing surpasses it unless it is _La
France_, over there."She inhaled the exquisite perfume in long breaths, and then looked around
at the budding beauty on every side, even to the stone walls that were
covered with climbing varieties.At last she turned to him with eyes that
were dilated as much with wonder as with pleasure, and said: "Well, this
_is_ a surprise.How in the world have you found time to bring all this
about?I never saw anything to equal it even in England.Of course I saw
rose gardens there on a larger scale in the parks and greenhouses, but I
have reference to the bushes and flowers.Why, Amy, an old gentleman who lives but a few
miles away has had seventy distinct kinds of hybrid perpetuals in bloom at
one time, and many of them the finest in existence; and yet he has but a
little mite of a garden, and has been a poor, hard-working man all his
life.Speaking of England, when I read of what the poor working people of
Nottingham accomplished in their little bits of glass-houses and their
Liliputian gardens, I know that all this is very ordinary, and within the
reach of almost any one who loves the flower.After one learns how to grow
roses, they do not cost much more care and trouble than a crop of onions or
cabbages.The soil and location here just suit the rose.You see that the
place is sheltered, and yet there are no trees near to shade them and drain
the ground of its richness.""Oh, you are sure to make it all seem simple and natural.It's a way you
have," she said, "But to me it's a miracle.I don't believe there are many
who have your feeling for this flower or your skill."The love for roses is very common, as it should
be, for millions of plants are sold annually, and the trade in them is
steadily increasing.Come, let me give you a lesson in the distinguishing
marks of the different kinds.A rose will smell as sweet by its own name as
by another, and you will find no scentless flowers here.There are some
fine odorless ones, like the Beauty of Stapleford, but I give them no
place."The moments flew by unheeded until an hour had passed, and then Webb,
looking at the sun, exclaimed: "I must go.This will answer for the first
lesson.You can bring mother here now in her garden chair whenever she
wishes to come, and I will give you other lessons, until you are a true
connoisseur in roses;" and he looked at those in her cheeks as if they were
more lovely than any to which he had been devoted for years."Well, Webb," she said, laughing, "I cannot think of anything lacking in my
morning's experience.I was wakened by the song of birds.You have revealed
to me the mystery of your sanctum, and that alone, you know, would be
happiness to the feminine soul.You have also introduced me to dozens of
your sweethearts, for you look at each rose as Burt does at the pretty
girls he meets.You have shown me your budding rose garden in the dewy
morning, and that was appropriate, too.Every one of your pets was gemmed
and jewelled for the occasion, and unrivalled musicians, cleverly concealed
in the trees near, have filled every moment with melody.Why should we not have them for
breakfast, also?""Why not, indeed, since it would seem that there are to be thousands here
and elsewhere in the garden?Fresh roses and strawberries for
breakfast--that's country life to perfection.He went away as if in a dream, and his heart almost ached with a tension of
feeling that he could not define.It seemed to him the culmination of all
that he had loved and enjoyed.His rose garden had been complete at this
season the year before, but now that Amy had entered it, the roses that she
had touched, admired, and kissed with lips that vied with their petals grew
tenfold more beautiful, and the spot seemed sacred to her alone.He could
never enter it again without thinking of her and seeing her lithe form
bending to favorites which hitherto he had only associated with his mother.His life seemed so full and his happiness so deep that he did not want to
think, and would not analyze according to his habit.He brought the strawberries to Amy in the breakfast-room, and stood near
while she and Johnnie hulled them.He saw the roses arranged by his
mother's plate in such nice harmony that one color did not destroy another.He replied to her mirthful words and rallyings, scarcely knowing what he
said, so deep was the feeling that oppressed him, so strong was his love
for that sweet sister who had come into his life and made it ideally
perfect.She appreciated what he had loved so fully, her very presence had
ever kindled his spirit, and while eager to learn and easily taught, how
truly she was teaching him a philosophy of life that seemed divine!The day passed in a confused maze of thought and
happiness, so strange and absorbing that he dared not speak lest he should
waken as from a dream.The girl had grown so beautiful to him that he
scarcely wished to look at her, and hastened through his meals that he
might be alone with his thoughts.The sun had sunk, and the moon was well
over the eastern mountains, before he visited the rose garden.Amy was
there, and she greeted him with a pretty petulance because he had not come
before.Then, in sudden compunction, she asked:

"Don't you feel well, Webb?You have been so quiet since we were here this
morning!Perhaps you are sorry you let me into this charmed seclusion.""No, Amy, I am not," he said, with an impetuosity very unusual in him."You
should know me better than even to imagine such a thing."Before he could say anything more, Burt's mellow voice rang out, "Amy!""Oh, I half forgot; I promised to take a drive with Burt this evening.Forgive me, Webb," she added, gently, "I only spoke in sport.I do know you
too well to imagine I am unwelcome here.No one ever had a kinder or more
patient brother than you have been to me;" and she clasped her hands upon
his arm, and looked up into his face with frank affection.His arm trembled under her touch, and he felt that he must be alone.In his
usual quiet tones, however, he was able to say: "You, rather, must forgive
me that I spoke so hastily.No; I'm not ill, but very tired.A good night's
rest will bring me around."Webb, you work too hard," she said, earnestly."But Burt is calling--"

"Yes; do not keep him waiting; and think of me," he added, laughing, "as
too weary for moonlight, roses, or anything but prosaic sleep.June is all
very well, but it brings a pile of work to a fellow like me.""Oh, Webb, what a clodhopper you're trying to make yourself out to be!Well, 'Sleep, sleep'--I can't think of the rest of the quotation.rang out her clear voice; and, with a smiling glance
backward, she hastened away.From the shrubbery he watched her pass up the wide garden path, the
moonlight giving an ethereal beauty to her slight form with its white,
close drapery.Then, deeply troubled, he threw himself on a rustic seat
near the wall, and buried his face in his hands.It was all growing too
clear to him now, and he found himself face to face with the conviction
that Amy was no longer his sister, but the woman he loved.The deep-hidden
current of feeling that had been gathering volume for months at last
flashed out into the light, and there could be no more disguise.The
explanation of her power over him was now given to his deepest
consciousness.By some law of his nature, when she spoke he had ever
listened; whatever she said and did had been invested with a nameless
charm.Day after day they had been together, and their lives had harmonized
like two chords that blend in one sweet sound.He had never had a sister,
and his growing interest in Amy had seemed the most natural thing in the
world; that Burt should love her, equally natural--to fall in love was
almost a habit with the mercurial young fellow when thrown into the society
of a pretty girl--and he had felt that he should be only too glad that his
brother had at last fixed his thoughts on one who would not be a stranger
to them.He now remembered that, while all this had been satisfactory to
reason, his heart for a long time had been uttering its low, half-conscious
protest.The events of this long day had revealed him unto
himself, because he was ripe for the knowledge.His nature had its hard, practical business side, but he had never been
content with questions of mere profit and loss.He not only had wanted the
corn, but the secret of the corn's growth and existence.To search into
Nature's hidden life, so that he could see through her outward forms the
mechanism back of all, and trace endless diversity to simple inexorable
laws, had been his pride and the promised solace of his life.His love of
the rose had been to him what it is to many another hard-working man and
woman--recreation, a habit, something for which he had developed the taste
and feeling of a connoisseur.It had had no appreciable influence on the
current of his thoughts.Amy's coming, however, had awakened the poetic
side of his temperament, and, while this had taken nothing from the old, it
had changed everything.Before, his life had been like nature in winter,
when all things are in hard, definite outline.The feeling which she had
inspired brought the transforming flowers and foliage.It was an immense
addition to that which already existed, and which formed the foundation for
it.For a long time he had exulted in this inflorescence of his life, as it
were, and was more than content.He did not know that the spirit gifted
even unconsciously with the power thus to develop his own nature must soon
become to him more than a cause of an effect, more than a sister upon whom
he could look with as tranquil eyes and even pulse in youth as in frosty
age.But now he knew it with the absolute certainty that was characteristic
of his mind when once it grasped a truth.The voice of Burt calling
"Amy," after the experiences of the day, had been like a shaft of light,
instantly revealing everything.For her sake more than his own he had
exerted himself to the utmost to conceal the truth of that moment of bitter
consciousness.He trembled as he thought of his blind, impetuous words and
her look of surprise; he grew cold with dread as he remembered how easily
he might have betrayed himself.what could he do but hide the truth with
sleepless vigilance?In the eyes
of Amy and all the family Burt was her acknowledged suitor, who, having
been brought to reason, was acting most rationally and honorably.Whether
Amy was learning to love him or not made no difference.If she, growing
conscious of her womanhood, was turning her thoughts to Burt as the one who
had first sought her, and who was now cheerfully waiting until the look of
shy choice and appeal came into her eyes, he could not seek to thrust his
younger brother aside.If the illustration of the rose which she had forced
into unnatural bloom was still true of her heart, he would be false to her
and himself, as well as to Burt, should he seek her in the guise of a
lover.He had felt that it was almost sacrilege to disturb her May-like
girlhood; that this child of nature should be left wholly to nature's
impulses and to nature's hour for awakening."If it only could have been, how rich and full life would be!""We were in sympathy at almost every point When shall I forget the hour
we spent here this morning!The exquisite purity and beauty of the dawn,
the roses with the dew upon them, seemed emblems of herself.Hereafter
they will ever speak to me of her.That perfume that comes on the breeze
to me now from the wild grapevine--the most delicate and delightful of
all the odors of June--is instantly associated with her in my mind, as
all things lovely in nature ever will be hereafter.How can I hide all
this from her, and seem merely her quiet elder brother?How can I meet
her here to-morrow morning, and in the witchery of summer evenings, and
still speak in measured tones, and look at her as I would at Johnnie?The
thing is impossible until I have gained a stronger self-control.I must
go away for a day or two, and I will.When I return neither Burt nor Amy
shall have cause to complain;" and he strode away.A firm to whom the Cliffords had been
sending part of their produce had not given full satisfaction, and Webb
announced his intention of going to the city in the morning to investigate
matters.His father and Leonard approved of his purpose, and when he added
that he might stay in town for two or three days, that he felt the need of
a little change and rest before haying and harvest began, they all
expressed their approval still more heartily.The night was so beautiful that Burt prolonged his drive.The witchery of
the romantic scenery through which he and Amy passed, and the loveliness of
her profile in the pale light, almost broke down his resolution, and once,
in accents much too tender, he said, "Oh, Amy, I am so happy when with
you!""I'm happy with you also," she replied, in brusque tones, "now that you
have become so sensible."He took the hint, and said, emphatically: "Don't you ever be apprehensive
or nervous when with me.I'll wait, and be'sensible,' as you express it,
till I'm gray."Her laugh rang out merrily, but she made no other reply.He was a little
nettled, and mentally vowed a constancy that would one day make her regret
that laugh.Webb had retired when Amy returned, and she learned of his plans from
Maggie."It's just the best thing he can do," she said, earnestly."Webb's
been overworking, and he needs and deserves a little rest."In the morning he seemed so busy with his preparations that he had scarcely
time to give her more than a genial off-hand greeting."Oh, Webb, I shall miss you so much!"she said, in parting, and her look
was very kind and wistful.He did not trust himself to speak, but gave her
a humorous and what seemed to her a half-incredulous smile.He puzzled her,
and she thought about him and his manner of the previous day and evening
not a little.With her sensitive nature, she could not approach so near the
mystery that he was striving to conceal without being vaguely impressed
that there was something unusual about him.The following day, however,
brought a cheerful, business-like letter to his father, which was read at
the dinner-table.He had straightened out matters in town and seemed to be
enjoying himself.She more than once admitted that she did miss him as she
would not any other member of the household.But her out-door life was very
full.By the aid of her glass she made the intimate acquaintance of her
favorite songsters.Clifford in her garden chair to
the rosary, and proposed through her instruction to give Webb a surprise
when he returned.She would prove to him that she could name his pets from
their fragrance, form, and color as well as he himself.CHAPTER XXXIV

A SHAM BATTLE AT WEST POINT


Burt did his best to keep things lively, and a few days after Webb's
departure said: "I've heard that there is to be a sham battle at West Point
this afternoon.The heavy guns from the river batteries had been awakening deep echoes
among the mountains every afternoon for some time past, reminding the
Cliffords that the June examinations were taking place at the Military
Academy, and that there was much of interest occurring near them.Not only
did Amy assent to Burt's proposition, but Leonard also resolved to go and
take Maggie and the children.In the afternoon a steam-yacht bore them and
many other excursionists to their destination, and they were soon skirting
the grassy plain on which the military evolutions were to take place.The scene was full of novelty and interest for Amy.Thousands of people
were there, representing every walk and condition of life.Plain farmers
with their wives and children, awkward country fellows with their
sweethearts, dapper clerks with bleached hands and faces, were passing to
and fro among ladies in Parisian toilets and with the unmistakable air of
the metropolis.There were officers with stars upon their shoulders, and
others, quite as important in their bearing, decorated with the insignia of
a second lieutenant.Plain-looking men were pointed out as senators, and
elegantly dressed men were, at a glance, seen to be nobodies.Scarcely a
type was wanting among those who came to see how the nation's wards were
drilled and prepared to defend the nation's honor and maintain peace at the
point of the bayonet.On the piazzas of the officers' quarters were groups
of favored people whose relations or distinguished claims were such as to
give them this advantage over those who must stand where they could to see
the pageant.The cadets in their gray uniforms were conspicuously absent,
but the band was upon the plain discoursing lively music.From the
inclosure within the barracks came the long roll of a drum, and all eyes
turned thitherward expectantly.Soon from under the arched sally-port two
companies of cadets were seen issuing on the double-quick.They crossed the
plain with the perfect time and precision of a single mechanism, and passed
down into a depression of the ground toward the river.After an interval
the other two companies came out in like manner, and halted on the plain
within a few hundred yards of this depression, their bayonets scintillating
in the unclouded afternoon sun.Both parties were accompanied by mounted
cadet officers.The body on the plain threw out pickets, stacked arms, and
lounged at their ease.Suddenly a shot was fired to the eastward, then
another, and in that direction the pickets were seen running in.With
marvellous celerity the loungers on the plain seized their muskets, formed
ranks, and faced toward the point from which the attack was threatened.A
skirmish line was thrown out, and this soon met a similar line advancing
from the depression, sloping eastward.Behind the skirmishers came a
compact line of battle, and it advanced steadily until within fair musket
range, when the firing became general.While the attacking party appeared
to fight resolutely, it was soon observed that they made no further effort
to advance, but sought only to occupy the attention of the party to which
they were opposed.The Cliffords stood on the northwestern edge of the plain near the statue
of General Sedgwick, and from this point they could also see what was
occurring in the depression toward the river."Turn, Amy, quick, and see
what's coming," cried Burt.Stealing up the hillside in solid column was
another body of cadets.A moment later they passed near on the
double-quick, went into battle formation on the run, and with loud shouts
charged the flank and rear of the cadets on the plain, who from the first
had sustained the attack.These seemed thrown into confusion, for they were
now between two fires.After a moment of apparent indecision they gave way
rapidly in seeming defeat and rout, and the two attacking parties drew
together in pursuit.When they had united, the pursued, who a moment before
had seemed a crowd of fugitives, became almost instantly a steady line of
battle.rang out, and, with fixed bayonets, they
rushed upon their assailants, and steadily drove them back over the plain,
and down into their original position.It was all carried out with a far
degree of life-like reality.The "sing" of minie bullets was wanting, but
abundance of noise and sulphurous smoke can be made with blank cartridges;
and as the party attacked plucked victory from seeming defeat, the people's
acclamations were loud and long.At this point the horse of one of the cadet officers became unmanageable.They had all observed this rider during the battle, admiring the manner in
which he restrained the vicious brute, but at last the animal's excitement
or fear became so great that he rushed toward the crowded sidewalk and road
in front of the officers' quarters.Burt had scarcely time to do more than encircle Amy with his arm and sweep
her out of the path of the terrified beast.The cadet made heroic efforts,
until it was evident that the horse would dash into the iron fence beyond
the road, and then the young fellow was off and on his feet with the
agility of a cat, but he still maintained his hold upon the bridle.A
second later there was a heavy thud heard above the screams of women and
children and the shouts of those vociferating advice.The horse fell
heavily in his recoil from the fence, and in a moment or two was led
limping and crestfallen away, while the cadet quietly returned to his
comrades on the plain.Johnnie and little Ned were crying from fright, and
both Amy and Maggie were pale and nervous; therefore Leonard led the way
out of the crowd.From a more distant point they saw the party beneath the
hill rally for a final and united charge, which this time proved
successful, and the companies on the plain, after a stubborn resistance,
were driven back to the barracks, and through the sally-port, followed by
their opponents.The clouds of smoke rolled away, the band struck up a
lively air, and the lines of people broke up into groups and streamed in
all directions.Leonard decided that it would be best for them to return by
the evening boat, and not wait for parade, since the little yacht would
certainly be overcrowded at a later hour.CHAPTER XXXV

CHASED BY A THUNDER-SHOWER


The first one on the "Powell" to greet them was Webb, returning from the
city.Amy thought he looked so thin as to appear almost haggard, but he
seemed in the best of spirits, and professed to feel well and rested.She
half imagined that she missed a certain gentleness in his words and manner
toward her, but when he heard how nearly she had been trampled upon, she
was abundantly satisfied by his look of deep affection and solicitude as he
said: "Heaven bless your strong, ready arm, Burt!""Oh, that it had been
mine!"He masked his feelings so well, however,
that all perplexity passed from her mind.She was eager to visit the rose
garden with him, and when there he praised her quickly acquired skill so
sincerely that her face flushed with pleasure.No one seemed to enjoy the
late but ample supper more than he, or to make greater havoc in the
well-heaped dish of strawberries."I tasted none like these in New York,"
he said."After all, give me the old-fashioned kind.We've tried many
varieties, but the Triomphe de Gand proves the most satisfactory, if one
will give it the attention it deserves.The fruit ripens early and lasts
till late.It is firm and good even in cool, wet weather, and positively
delicious after a sunny day like this.""I agree with you, Webb," said his mother, smiling."It's the best of all
the kinds we've had, except, perhaps, the President Wilder, but that
doesn't bear well in our garden.""Well, mother," he replied, with a laugh, "the best is not too good for
you.I have a row of Wilders, however, for your especial benefit, but
they're late, you know."The next morning he went into the haying with as much apparent zest as
Leonard.The growth had been so heavy that
in many places it had "lodged," or fallen, and it had to be cut with
scythes.Later on, the mowing-machine would be used in the timothy fields
and meadows.Amy, from her open window, watched him as he steadily bent to
the work, and she inhaled with pleasure the odors from the bleeding clover,
for it was the custom of the Cliffords to cut their grasses early, while
full of the native juices.Rakes followed the scythes speedily, and the
clover was piled up into compact little heaps, or "cocks," to sweat out its
moisture rather than yield it to the direct rays of the sun.said Amy, at the dinner-table, "my bees won't fare so well, now
that you are cutting down so much of their pasture.""Red clover affords no pasturage for honey-bees," said Webb, laughing."How
easily he seems to laugh of late!""They can't reach the honey
in the long, tube-like blossoms.Here the bumble-bees have everything their
way, and get it all except what is sipped by the humming-birds, with their
long beaks, as they feed on the minute insects within the flowers.I've
heard the question, Of what use are bumble-bees?--I like to say _bumble_
best, as I did when a boy.Well, I've been told that red clover cannot be
raised without this insect, which, passing from flower to flower, carries
the fertilizing pollen.In Australia the rats and the field mice were so
abundant that they destroyed these bees, which, as you know, make their
nests on the ground, and so cats had to be imported in order to give the
bumble-bees and red clover a chance for life.There is always trouble in
nature unless an equilibrium is kept up.Much as I dislike cats, I must
admit that they have contributed largely toward the prosperity of an
incipient empire.""When I was a boy," remarked Leonard, "I was cruel enough to catch
bumble-bees and pull them apart for the sake of the sac of honey they
carry."Alf hung his head, and looked very conscious."Well, I ain't any worse than papa," said the boy.All through the afternoon the musical sound of whetting the scythes with
the rifle rang out from time to time, and in the evening Leonard said, "If
this warm, dry weather holds till to-morrow night, we shall get in our
clover in perfect condition."On the afternoon of the following day the two-horse wagon, surmounted by
the hay-rack, went into the barn again and again with its fragrant burden;
but at last Amy was aroused from her book by a heavy vibration of thunder.Going to a window facing the west, she saw a threatening cloud that every
moment loomed vaster and darker.The great vapory heads, tipped with light,
towered rapidly, until at last the sun passed into a sudden eclipse that
was so deep as to create almost a twilight.As the cloud approached, there
was a low, distant, continuous sound, quite distinct from nearer and
heavier peals, which after brief and briefer intervals followed the
lightning gleams athwart the gloom.She saw that the hay-makers were
gathering the last of the clover, and raking, pitching, and loading with
eager haste, their forms looking almost shadowy in the distance and the dim
light.Their task was nearly completed, and the horses' heads were turned
barnward, when a flash of blinding intensity came, with an instantaneous
crash, that roared away to the eastward with deep reverberations.Amy
shuddered, and covered her face with her hands.When she looked again, the
clover-field and all that it contained seemed annihilated.The air was
thick with dust, straws, twigs, and foliage torn away, and the gust passed
over the house with a howl of fury scarcely less appalling than the
thunder-peal had been.Trembling, and almost faint with fear, sho strained
her eyes toward the point where she had last seen Webb loading the
hay-rack.The murky obscurity lightened up a little, and in a moment or two
she saw him whipping the horses into a gallop.The doors of the barn stood
open, and the rest of the workers had taken a cross-cut toward it, while
Mr.Clifford was on the piazza, shouting for them to hurry.Great drops
splashed against the window-panes, and the heavy, monotonous sound of the
coming torrent seemed to approach like the rush of a locomotive.Webb, with
the last load, is wheeling to the entrance of the barn.A second later, and
the horses' feet resound on the planks of the floor.Then all is hidden,
and the rain pours against the window like a cataract.In swift alternation
of feeling she clapped her hands in applause, and ran down to meet Mr.Clifford, who, with much effort, was shutting the door against the gale.When he turned he rubbed his hands and laughed as he said, "Well, I never
saw Webb chased so sharply by a thunder-shower before; but he won the race,
and the clover's safe."The storm soon thundered away to parts unknown, the setting sun spanning
its retreating murkiness with a magnificent bow; long before the rain
ceased the birds were exulting in jubilant chorus, and the air grew still
and deliciously cool and fragrant.When at last the full moon rose over the
Beacon Mountains there was not a cloud above the horizon, and Nature, in
all her shower-gemmed and June-clad loveliness, was like a radiant beauty
lost in revery.CHAPTER XXXVI

THE RESCUE OF A HOME


Who remembers when his childhood ceased?Who can name the hour when
buoyant, thoughtless, half-reckless youth felt the first sobering touch of
manhood, or recall the day when he passed over the summit of his life, and
faced the long decline of age?As imperceptibly do the seasons blend when
one passes and merges into another.There were traces of summer in May,
lingering evidences of spring far into June, and even in sultry July came
days in which the wind in the groves and the chirp of insects at night
foretold the autumn.The morning that followed the thunder-shower was one of warm, serene
beauty.The artillery of heaven had done no apparent injury.A rock may
have been riven in the mountains, a lonely tree splintered, but homes were
safe, the warm earth was watered, and the air purified.With the dawn Amy's
bees were out at work, gleaning the last sweets from the white clover, that
was on the wane, from the flowers of the garden, field, and forest.The
rose garden yielded no honey: the queen of flowers is visited by no bees.The sweetbrier, or eglantine, belonging to this family is an exception,
however, and if the sweets of these wild roses could be harvested, an Ariel
would not ask for daintier sustenance.White and delicate pink hues characterize the flowers of early spring.In
June the wild blossoms emulate the skies, and blue predominates.In July
and August many of the more sensitive in Flora's train blush crimson under
the direct gaze of the sun.Yellow hues hold their own throughout the year,
from the dandelions that first star the fields to the golden-rod that
flames until quenched by frost and late autumn storms.During the latter part of June the annual roses of the garden were in all
stages and conditions.Beautiful buds could be gleaned among the developing
seed receptacles and matured flowers that were casting their petals on
every breeze.The thrips and the disgusting rose-bug were also making havoc
here and there.But an untiring vigilance watched over the rose garden.Morning, noon, and evening Webb cut away the fading roses, and Amy soon
learned to aid him, for she saw that his mind was bent on maintaining the
roses in this little nook at the highest attainable point of perfection.It
is astonishing how greatly nature can be assisted and directed by a little
skilled labor at the right time.Left to themselves, the superb varieties
in the rose garden would have spent the remainder of the summer and autumn
chiefly in the development of seed-vessels, and in resting after their
first bloom.But the pruning-knife had been too busy among them, and the
thoroughly fertilized soil sent up supplies that must be disposed of.As
soon as the bushes had given what may be termed their first annual bloom
they were cut back halfway to the ground, and dormant buds were thus forced
into immediate growth.Meanwhile the new shoots that in spring had started
from the roots were already loaded with buds, and so, by a little
management and attention, the bloom would be maintained until frosty nights
should bring the sleep of winter.No rose-bug escaped Webb's vigilant
search, and the foliage was so often sprayed by a garden syringe with an
infusion of white hellebore that thrips and slugs met their deserved fate
before they had done any injury.Clifford and Amy was
maintained a supply of these exquisite flowers, which in a measure became a
part of their daily food.On every side was the fulfilment of its innumerable
promises.The bluebird, with the softness of June in his notes, had told
his love amid the snows and gales of March, and now, with unabated
constancy, and with all a father's solicitude, he was caring for his third
nestful of fledglings.Young orioles were essaying flight from their
wind-rocked cradles on the outer boughs of the elms.Phoebe-birds, with
nests beneath bridges over running streams, had, nevertheless, the skill to
land their young on the banks.Nature was like a vast nursery, and from
gardens, lawns, fields, and forest the cries and calls of feathered infancy
were heard all day, and sometimes in the darkness, as owls, hawks, and
other night prowlers added to the fearful sum of the world's tragedies.The
cat-birds, that had built in some shrubbery near the house, had by the last
of June done much to gain Amy's good-will and respect.As their domestic
character and operations could easily be observed, she had visited them
almost daily from the time they had laid the dry-twig and leafy foundation
of their nest until its lining of fine dry grasses was completed.She bad
found that, although inclined to mock and gibe at outsiders, they were
loyal and affectionate to each other.In their home-building, in the
incubation of the deep bluish-green eggs, and in the care of the young, now
almost ready to fly, they had been mutually helpful and considerate,
fearless and even fierce in attacking all who approached too near their
domicile.To Amy and her daily visits they had become quite reconciled,
even as she had grown interested in them, in spite of a certain lack of the
high breeding which characterized the thrushes and other favorites."My better acquaintance with them," she said one evening to Dr.Marvin,
who, with his wife, had stopped at the Cliffords' in passing, "has taught
me a lesson.I think I'm too much inclined to sweeping censure on the
exhibition of a few disagreeable traits.I've learned that the gossips in
yonder bushes have some excellent qualities, and I suppose you find that
this is true of the gossips among your patients.""Yes," replied the doctor, "but the human gossips draw the more largely on
one's charity; and if you knew how many pestiferous slugs and insects your
neighbors in the shrubbery have already destroyed, the human genus of
gossip would suffer still more in comparison."That Amy had become so interested in these out-door neighbors turned out to
their infinite advantage, for one morning their excited cries of alarm
secured her attention.Hastening to the locality of their nest, she looked
upon a scene that chilled the blood in her own veins.A huge black-snake
suspended his weight along the branches of the shrubbery with entire
confidence and ease, and was in the act of swallowing a fledgling that,
even as Amy looked, sent out its last despairing peep.The parent birds
were frantic with terror, and their anguish and fearless efforts to save
their young redeemed them forever in Amy's eyes.she cried, since, for some reason, he ever came first to her mind
in an emergency.It so happened that he had just come from the hay field to
rest awhile and prepare for dinner.In a moment he was at her side, and
followed with hasty glance her pointing finger."Come away, Amy," he said, as he looked at her pale face and dilated eyes."I do not wish you to witness a scene like that;" and almost by force he
drew her to the piazza.In a moment he was out with a breech-loading gun,
and as the smoke of the discharge lifted, she saw a writhing, sinuous form
fall heavily to the earth.After a brief inspection Webb came toward her in
smiling assurance, saying: "The wretch got only one of the little family.You have saved a home
from utter desolation.That, surely, will be a pleasant thing to remember.""What could I have done if you had not come?""I don't like to think of what you might have done--emulated the
mother-bird, perhaps, and flown at the enemy.""I did not know you were near when I called your name," she said."It was
entirely instinctive on my part; and I believe," she added, musingly,
looking with a child's directness into his eyes, "that one's instincts are
usually right; don't you?"He turned away to hide the feeling of intense pleasure caused by her words,
but only said, in a low voice, "I hope I may never fail you, Amy, when you
turn to me for help."Then he added, quickly, as if hastening away from
delicate ground: "While those large black-snakes are not poisonous, they
are ugly customers sometimes.I have read of an instance in which a boy put
his hand into the hole of a tree where there had been a bluebird's nest,
and touched the cold scales of one of these snakes.The boy took to his
heels, with the snake after him, and it is hard to say what would have
happened had not a man plowing near come to the rescue with a heavy
ox-whip.What I should fear most in your case would be a nervous shock had
the snake even approached you, for you looked as if you had inherited from
Mother Eve an unusual degree of hate for the reptile."The report of the gun had attracted Alf and others to the scene.Amy, with
a look of smiling confidence, said: "Perhaps you have rescued me as well as
the birds.I can't believe, though, that such a looking creature could have
tempted Eve to either good or evil;" and she entered the house, leaving him
in almost a friendly mood toward the cause of the cat-bird's woe.Alf exulted over the slain destroyer, and even Johnnie felt no compunction
at the violent termination of its life.The former, with much sportsmanlike
importance, measured it, and at the dinner-table announced its length to be
a little over four feet."By the way," said Webb, "your adventure, Amy, reminds me of one of the
finest descriptions I ever read;" and jumping up, he obtained from the
library Burroughs's account of a like scene and rescue."I will just give
you some glimpses of the picture," he said, reading the following
sentences: "'Three or four yards from me was the nest, beneath which, in
long festoons, rested a huge black-snake.I can conceive of nothing more
overpoweringly terrible to an unsuspecting family of birds than the sudden
appearance above their domicile of the head and neck of this arch enemy.One thinks of the great myth of the tempter and the cause of all our woe,
and wonders if the Arch-One is not playing off some of his pranks before
him.Whether we call it snake or devil matters little.I could but admire
his terrible beauty, however; his black, shining folds; his easy, gliding
movement--head erect, eyes glistening, tongue playing like subtile flame,
and the invisible means of his almost winged locomotion.Presently, as he
came gliding down the slender body of a leaning alder, his attention was
attracted by a slight movement of my arm; eying me an instant with that
crouching, utter, motionless gaze which I believe only snakes and devils
can assume, he turned quickly,'" etc.Clifford looked a little troubled that the scene in
Eden should be spoken of as merely a "myth."When she was a child "Paradise
Lost" had been her story-book, and the stories had become real to her.Burt, however, not to be outdone, recalled his classics."By the way," he said, "I can almost parallel your description from the
'Iliad' of Homer.I won't pretend that I can give you the Greek, and no
doubt it would be Greek to you.I'll get even with you, Webb, however, and
read an extract from Pope's translation," and he also made an excursion to
the library.Returning, he said, "Don't ask me for the connection," and
read:

  "'Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he rolled,
    And curled around in many a winding fold.The topmost branch a mother-bird possessed;
    Eight callow infants filled the mossy nest;
    Herself the ninth: the serpent as he hung
    Stretched his black jaws, and crashed the crying young:
    While hovering near, with miserable moan,
    The drooping mother wailed her children gone.The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
    Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew.'""I am now quite reconciled to your four years at
college.Heretofore I had thought you had passed through it as Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego passed through the fiery furnace, without even the
smell of fire upon their garments, but I now at last detect a genuine
Greek aroma.""I think Burt's quotation very pat," said Amy, "and I could not have
believed that anything written so long ago would apply so marvellously to
what I have seen to-day.""Marvellously pat, indeed," said Leonard."And since your quotation has
led to such a nice little pat on your classical back, Burt, you must feel
repaid for your long burning of the midnight oil."Burt flushed slightly, but he turned Leonard's shafts with smiling
assurance, and said: "Amply repaid.I have ever had an abiding confidence
that my education would be of use to me at some time."The long days grew hot, and often sultry, but the season brought
unremitting toil.The click of the mowing-machine, softened by distance,
came from field after field.As the grain in the rye grew plump and
heavy, the heads drooped more and more, and changed from a pale yellow to
the golden hue that announced the hour of harvest.In smooth and level
fields the reaping-machine also lightened and expedited labor, but there
was one upland <DW72> that was too rough for anything except the
old-fashioned cradle.On a breezy afternoon Amy went out to sketch the
harvesters, and from the shade of an adjacent tree to listen to the
rhythmical rush and rustle as the blade passed through the hollow stocks,
and the cradle dropped the gathered wealth in uniform lines.Almost
immediately the prostrate grain was transformed into tightly girthed
sheaves.How black Abram's great paw looked as he twisted a wisp of
straw, bound together the yellow stalks, and tucked under the end of his
improvised rope!Webb was leading the reapers, and they had to step quickly to keep pace
with him.As Amy appeared upon the scene he had done no more than take
off his hat and wave it to her, but as the men circled round the field
near her again, she saw that her acquaintance of the mountain cabin was
manfully bringing up the rear.Every time, before Lumley stooped to the
sweep of his cradle, she saw that he stole a glance toward her, and she
recognized him with cordial good-will.He, too, doffed his hat in
grateful homage, and as he paused a moment in his honest toil, and stood
erect, he unconsciously asserted the manhood that she had restored to
him.She caught his attitude, and he became the subject of her sketch.Rude and simple though it was, it would ever recall to her a pleasant
picture--the diminishing area of standing rye, golden in the afternoon
sunshine, with light billows running over it before the breeze, Webb
leading, with the strong, assured progress that would ever characterize
his steps through life, and poor Lumley, who had been wronged by
generations that had passed away, as well as by his own evil, following
in an honest emulation which she had evoked.CHAPTER XXXVII

A MIDNIGHT TEMPEST


As far as possible, the prudent Leonard, who was commander-in-chief of
the harvest campaign, had made everything snug before the Fourth of July,
which Alf ushered in with untimely patriotic fervor.Almost before the
first bird had taken its head from under its wing to look for the dawn,
he had fired a salute from a little brass cannon.Not very long afterward
the mountains up and down the river were echoing with the thunder of the
guns at West Point and Newburgh.The day bade fair to justify its
proverbial character for sultriness.Even in the early morning the air
was languid and the heat oppressive.The sun was but a few hours high
before the song of the birds almost ceased, with the exception of the
somewhat sleepy whistling of the orioles.They are half tropical in
nature as well as plumage, and their manner during the heat of the day is
like that of languid Southern beauties.They kept flitting here and there
through their leafy retirement in a mild form of restlessness, exchanging
soft notes--pretty nonsense, no doubt--which often terminated abruptly,
as if they had not energy enough to complete the brief strain attempted.Alf, with his Chinese crackers and his cannon, and Johnnie and Ned, with
their torpedoes, kept things lively during the forenoon, but their elders
were disposed to lounge and rest.The cherry-trees, laden with black and
white ox-hearts, were visited.One of the former variety was fairly
sombre with the abundance of its dark-hued fruit, and Amy's red lips grew
purple as Burt threw her down the largest and ripest from the topmost
boughs.Webb, carrying a little basket lined with grapevine leaves,
gleaned the long row of Antwerp raspberries.The first that ripen of this
kind are the finest and most delicious, and their strong aroma announced
his approach long before he reached the house.His favorite Triomphe de
Grand strawberries, that had supplied the table three weeks before, were
still yielding a fair amount of fruit, and his mother was never without
her dainty dish of pale red berries, to which the sun had been adding
sweetness with the advancing season until nature's combination left
nothing to be desired.By noon the heat was oppressive, and Alf and Ned were rolling on the
grass under a tree, quite satiated for a time with two elements of a
boy's elysium, fire-crackers and cherries.The family gathered in the
wide hall, through the open doors of which was a slight draught of air.All had donned their coolest costumes, and their talk was quite as
languid as the occasional notes and chirpings of the birds without.Amy
was reading a magazine in a very desultory way, her eyelids drooping over
every page before it was finished, Webb and Burt furtively admiring the
exquisite hues that the heat brought into her face, and the soft lustre
of her eyes.Clifford nodded over his newspaper until his
spectacles clattered to the floor, at which they all laughed, and asked
for the news.His invalid wife lay upon the sofa in dreamy, painless
repose.To her the time was like a long, quiet nooning by the wayside of
life, with all her loved band around her, and her large, dark eyes rested
on one and another in loving, lingering glances--each so different, yet
each so dear!Sensible Leonard was losing no time, but was audibly
resting in a great wooden rocking-chair at the further end of the hall.Maggie only, the presiding genius of the household, was not wilted by the
heat.She flitted in and out occasionally, looking almost girlish in her
white wrapper.She had the art of keeping house, of banishing dust and
disorder without becoming an embodiment of dishevelled disorder herself.No matter what she was doing, she always appeared trim and neat, and in
the lover-like expression of her husband's eyes, as they often followed
her, she had her reward.She was not deceived by the semi-torpid
condition of the household, and knew well what would be expected in a
Fourth-of-July dinner.The tinkle of the bell
at two o'clock awakened unusual animation, and then she had her triumph.Leonard beamed upon a hind-quarter of lamb roasted to the nicest turn of
brownness.A great dish of Champion-of-England pease, that supreme
product of the kitchen-garden, was one of the time-honored adjuncts,
while new potatoes, the first of which had been dug that day, had half
thrown off their mottled jackets in readiness for the feast.Nature had
been Maggie's handmaid in spreading that table, and art, with its
culinary mysteries and combinations, was conspicuously absent.If Eve had
had a kitchen range and the Garden of Eden to draw upon, Adam could
scarcely have fared better than did the Clifford household that day.The
dishes heaped with strawberries, raspberries, cherries, and white
grape-currants that had been gathered with the dew upon them might well
tempt the most _blase_ resident of a town to man's primal calling.Before they reached their iced tea, which on this hot day took the place
of coffee, there was a distant peal of thunder."I knew it would come," said old Mr."We shall have a cool
night, after all.""A Fourth rarely passes without showers," Leonard remarked."That's why I
was so strenuous about getting all our grass and grain that was down
under cover yesterday.""You are not the only prudent one," Maggie added, complacently."I've
made my currant jelly, and it jellied beautifully: it always does if I
make it before the Fourth and the showers that come about this time.It's
queer, but a rain on the currants after they are fairly ripe almost
spoils them for jelly."The anticipations raised by the extreme sultriness were fulfilled at
first only in part.Instead of a heavy shower accompanied by violent
gusts, there was a succession of tropical and vertical down-pourings,
with now and then a sharp flash and a rattling peal, but usually a heavy
monotone of thunder from bolts flying in the distance.One great cloud
did not sweep across the sky like a concentrated charge, leaving all
clear behind it, as is so often the case, but, as if from an immense
reserve, Nature appeared to send out her vapory forces by battalions.Instead of enjoying the long siesta which she had promised herself, Amy
spent the afternoon in watching the cloud scenery.A few miles southwest
of the house was a prominent highland that happened to be in the direct
line of the successive showers.This formed a sort of gauge of their
advance.A cloud would loom up behind it, darken it, obscure it until it
faded out even as a shadow; then the nearer spurs of the mountains would
be blotted out, and in eight or ten minutes even the barn and the
adjacent groves would be but dim outlines through the myriad rain-drops.The cloud would soon be well to the eastward, the dim landscape take form
and distinctness, and the distant highland appear again, only to be
obscured in like manner within the next half-hour.It was as if invisible
and Titanic gardeners were stepping across the country with their
watering-pots.Burt and Webb sat near Amy at the open window, the former chatting
easily, and often gayly.Webb, with his deep-set eyes fixed on the
clouds, was comparatively silent.At last he rose somewhat abruptly, and
was not seen again until evening, when he seemed to be in unusually good
spirits.As the dusk deepened he aided Alf and Johnnie in making the
finest possible display of their fireworks, and for half an hour the
excitement was intense.Leonard and
his father, remembering the hay and grain already stored in the barn,
congratulated each other that the recent showers had prevented all danger
from sparks.After the last rocket had run its brief, fiery course, Alf and Johnnie
were well content to go with Webb, Burt, and Amy to an upper room whose
windows looked out on Newburgh Bay and to the westward.Near and far,
from their own and the opposite side of the river, rockets were flaming
into the sky, and Roman candles sending up their globes of fire.But
Nature was having a celebration of her own, which so far surpassed
anything terrestrial that it soon won their entire attention.A great
black cloud that hung darkly in the west was the background for the
electric pyrotechnics.Against this obscurity the lightning played almost
every freak imaginable.At one moment there would be an immense
illumination, and the opaque cloud would become vivid gold.Again, across
its blackness a dozen fiery rills of light would burn their way in zigzag
channels, and not infrequently a forked bolt would blaze earthward.Accompanying these vivid and central effects were constant illuminations
of sheet lightning all round the horizon, and the night promised to be a
carnival of thunder-showers throughout the land.The extreme heat
continued, and was rendered far more oppressive by the humidity of the
atmosphere.The awful grandeur of the cloud scenery at last so oppressed Amy that she
sought relief in Maggie's lighted room.As we have already seen, her
sensitive organization was peculiarly affected by an atmosphere highly
charged with electricity.She was not re-assured, for Leonard inadvertently
remarked that it would take "a rousing old-fashioned storm to cool and
clear the air.""Why, Amy," exclaimed Maggie, "how pale you are!and your eyes shine as
if some of the lightning had got into them.""I wish it was morning," said the girl."Such a sight oppresses me like a
great foreboding of evil;" and, with a restlessness she could not
control, she went down to Mrs.Clifford
fanning the invalid, who was almost faint from the heat.Amy took his
place, and soon had the pleasure of seeing her charge drop off into quiet
slumber.Clifford was very weary also, Amy left them to their
rest, and went to the sitting-room, where Webb was reading.Burt had
fallen asleep on the lounge in the hall.Leonard's prediction promised to
come true.The thunder muttered nearer and nearer, but it was a sullen,
slow, remorseless approach through the absolute silence and darkness
without, and therefore was tenfold more trying to one nervously
apprehensive than a swift, gusty storm would have been in broad day.Webb looked up and greeted her with a smile.His lamp was shaded, and the
room shadowy, so that he did not note that Amy was troubled and
depressed."I am running over
Hawthorne's 'English Note-Books' again.""Yes," she said, in a low voice; and she sat down with her back to the
windows, through which shone momentarily the glare of the coming tempest.He had not read a page before a long, sullen peal rolled across the
entire arc of the sky."Webb," faltered Amy, and she rose and took an
irresolute step toward him.Never had he heard sweeter music
than that low appeal, to which the deep echoes in the mountains formed a
strange accompaniment.He stepped to her side, took her hand, and found
it cold and trembling.Drawing her within the radiance of the lamp, he
saw how pale she was, and that her eyes were dilated with nervous dread."Webb," she began again, "do you--do you think there is danger?""No, Amy," he said, gently; "there is no danger for you in God's
universe.""Webb," she whispered, "won't you stay up till the storm is over?And you
won't think me weak or silly either, will you?I
wish I had a little of your courage and strength.""I like you best as you are," he said; "and all my strength is yours when
you need it.I understand you, Amy, and well know you cannot help this
nervous dread.I saw how these electrical storms affected you last
February, and such experiences are not rare with finely organized
natures.See, I can explain it all with my matter-of-fact philosophy.But, believe me, there is no danger.She looked at him affectionately as she said, with a child's unconscious
frankness: "I don't know why it is, but I always feel safe when with you.I often used to wish that I had a brother, and imagine what he would be
to me; but I never dreamed that a brother could be so much to me as you
are.--Oh, Webb!"and she almost clung to him, as the heavy thunder pealed
nearer than before.Involuntarily he encircled her with his arm, and drew her closer to him
in the impulse of protection.She felt his arm tremble, and wholly
misinterpreted the cause.Springing aloof, she clasped her hands, and
looked around almost wildly."Oh, Webb," she cried, "there is danger.Webb was human, and had nerves also, but all the thunder that ever roared
could not affect them so powerfully as Amy's head bowed upon his
shoulder, and the appealing words of her absolute trust.He mastered
himself instantly, however, for he saw that he must be strong and calm in
order to sustain the trembling girl through one of Nature's most awful
moods.She was equally sensitive to the smiling beauty and the wrath of
the great mother.The latter phase was much the same to her as if a loved
face had suddenly become black with reckless passion.He took both her
hands in a firm grasp, and said: "Amy, I am not afraid, and you must not
be.Come," he added, in tones almost
authoritative, "sit here by me, and give me your hand.I shall read to
you in a voice as quiet and steady as you ever heard me use."She obeyed, and he kept his word.His strong, even grasp reassured her in
a way that excited her wonder, and the nervous paroxysm of fear began to
pass away.While she did not comprehend what he read, his tones and
expression had their influence.His voice, however, was soon drowned by
the howling of the tempest as it rushed upon them.He felt her hand
tremble again, and saw her look apprehensively toward the windows."Amy," he said, and in smiling confidence he fixed his eyes on hers and
held them.The house rocked in the
furious blasts.The uproar without was frightful, suggesting that the
Evil One was in very truth the "prince of the power of the air," and that
he was abroad with all his legions.Amy trembled violently, but Webb's
hand and eyes held hers.he said, cheerily; "the storm is
passing."A wan, grateful smile glimmered for a moment on her pale face, and then
her expression passed into one of horror.With a cry that was lost in a
deafening crash, she sprang into his arms.Even Webb was almost stunned
and blinded for a moment.Burt at last had
been aroused from the slumber of youth, and, fortunately for his peace,
rushed first into his mother's room.Webb thought Amy had fainted, and he
laid her gently on the lounge."Don't leave me," she gasped, faintly."Amy," he said, earnestly, "I assure you that all danger is now over.As
I told you once before, the centre of the storm has passed.Maggie and Burt now came running in, and Webb said, "Amy has had a faint
turn.This revived her speedily, but the truth of Webb's words proved more
efficacious.The gale was sweeping the storm from the sky.The swish of
the torrents mattered little, for the thunder-peals died away steadily to
the eastward.Amy made a great effort to rally, for she felt ashamed of
her weakness, and feared that the others would not interpret her as
charitably as Webb had done.In a few minutes he smilingly withdrew, and
went out on the rear porch with Leonard, whence they anxiously scanned
the barn and out-buildings.These were evidently safe, wherever the bolt
had fallen, and it must have struck near.In half an hour there was a
line of stars along the western horizon, and soon the repose within the
old house was as deep as that of nature without.He sat at his open window, and saw the clouds
roll away.But he felt that a cloud deeper and murkier than any that had
ever blackened the sky hung over his life.He knew too well why his arm
had trembled when for a moment it encircled Amy.The deepest and
strongest impulse of his soul was to protect her, and her instinctive
appeal to him had raised a tempest in his heart as wild as that which had
raged without.He felt that he could not yield her to another, not even
to his brother.It was to him she
turned and clung in her fears.And yet she had not even dreamed of his
untold wealth of love, and probably never would suspect it.He could not
reveal it--indeed, it must be the struggle of his life to hide it--and
she, while loving him as a brother, might easily drift into an engagement
and marriage with Burt.Could he be patient, and wear a smiling mask
through it all?That tropical night and its experiences taught him anew
that he had a human heart, with all its passionate cravings.When he came
down from his long vigil on the following morning his brow was as serene
as the scene without.Amy gave him a grateful and significant smile, and
he smiled back so naturally that observant Burt, who had been a little
uneasy over the events of the previous night, was wholly relieved of
anxiety.They had scarcely seated themselves at the breakfast-table
before Alf came running in, and said that an elm not a hundred yards from
the house had been splintered from the topmost branch to the roots.Clifford went out to look at the smitten tree, and they gazed
with awe at the deep furrow plowed in the blackened wood."It will live," said Webb, quietly, as he turned away; "it will probably
live out its natural life."Amy, in her deep sympathy, looked after him curiously.There was
something in his tone and manner which suggested a meaning beyond his
words.Not infrequently he had puzzled her of late, and this added to her
interest in him.Clifford saw in the shattered tree only reasons for profound
thankfulness, and words of Christian gratitude rose to his lips.CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE TWO LOVERS


The July sun speedily drank up the superabundant moisture, and the farm
operations went on with expedition.The corn grew green and strong, and
its leaves stretched up to Abram's shoulder as he ran the cultivator
through it for the last time.The moist sultriness of the Fourth finished
the ox-heart cherries.They decayed at once, to Alf's great regret."That
is the trouble with certain varieties of cherries," Webb remarked."One
shower will often spoil the entire crop even before it is ripe."But it
so happened that there were several trees of native or ungrafted fruit on
the place, and these supplied the children and the birds for many days
thereafter.The robins never ceased gorging themselves.Indeed, they were
degenerating into shameless _gourmands_, and losing the grace of
song, as were also the bobolinks in the meadows.Already there was a perceptible decline in the morning and evening
minstrelsy of all the birds, and, with the exception of calls and
twitterings, they grew more and more silent through the midday heat.With
the white bloom of the chestnut-trees the last trace of spring passed
away.Summer reached its supreme culmination, and days that would not be
amiss at the equator were often followed by nights of breathless
sultriness.Early in the month haying and harvest were over, and the last
load that came down the lane to the barn was ornamented with green
boughs, and hailed with acclamations by the farm hands, to whom a
generous supper was given, and something substantial also to take home to
their families.As the necessity for prompt action and severe labor passed, the Cliffords
proved that their rural life was not one of plodding, unredeemed toil.For the next few weeks Nature would give them a partial respite.She
would finish much of the work which they had begun.The corn would
mature, the oats ripen, without further intervention on their part.By
slow but sure alchemy the fierce suns would change the acid and bitter
juices in the apples, peaches, plums, and pears into nectar.Already Alf
was revelling in the harvest apples, which, under Maggie's culinary
magic, might tempt an ascetic to surfeit.While Burt had manfully done his part in the harvest-field, he had not
made as long hours as the others, and now was quite inclined to enjoy to
the utmost a season of comparative leisure.He was much with Amy, and she
took pleasure in his society, for, as she characterized his manner in her
thoughts, he had grown very sensible.He had accepted the situation, and
he gave himself not a little credit for his philosophical patience.He
regarded himself as committed to a deep and politic plan, in which,
however, there was no unworthy guile.He would make himself essential to
Amy's happiness.He would be so quietly and naturally devoted to her that
she would gradually come to look forward to a closer union as a matter of
course.He also made it clear to her that she had no rivals in his
thoughts, or even admiration, and, as far as courtesy permitted, withdrew
from the society of a few favorites who once had welcomed him gladly and
often.He had even pretended indifference to the advent of a dark-eyed
beauty to the neighborhood, and had made no efforts to form her
acquaintance.This stranger from the city was so charming, however, that
he had felt more than once that he was giving no slight proof of
constancy.His fleet horse Thunder was his great ally, and in the long
twilight evenings, he, with Amy, explored the country roads far and near.When the early mornings were not too warm they rowed upon the river, or
went up the Moodna Creek for water-lilies, which at that hour floated
upon the surface with their white petals all expanded--beautiful emblems
of natures essentially good.From mud and slime they developed purity and
fragrance.He was also teaching Amy to be an expert horsewoman, and they
promised themselves many a long ride when autumn coolness should make
such exercise more agreeable.Burt was a little surprised at his tranquil enjoyment of all this
companionship, but nevertheless prided himself upon it.He was not so
mercurial and impetuous as the others had believed him to be, but was
capable of a steady and undemonstrative devotion.Amy was worth winning
at any cost, and he proposed to lay such a patient siege that she could
not fail to become his.Indeed, with a disposition toward a little
retaliation, he designed to carry his patience so far as to wait until he
had seen more than once an expression in her eyes that invited warmer
words and manner.But he had to admit that time was passing, and that no
such expression appeared.This piqued him a little, and he felt that he
was not appreciated.The impression grew upon him that she was very
young--unaccountably young for one of her years.She enjoyed his bright
talk and merry ways with much the same spirit that Alf's boyish
exuberance called forth.She had the natural love of all young, healthful
natures for pleasure and change, and she unconsciously acted toward him
as if he were a kind, jolly brother who was doing much to give the spice
of variety to her life.At the same time her unawakened heart was
disposed to take his view of the future.Why should she not marry him,
after her girlhood had passed?All the family wished and expected it, and
surely she liked him exceedingly.But it would be time enough for such
thoughts years hence.He had the leisure and self-control for
good-comradeship, and without questioning she enjoyed it.Her life was
almost as free from care as that of the young birds that had begun their
existence in June.Only Webb perplexed and troubled her a little.At this season, when even
Leonard indulged in not a little leisure and rest, he was busy and
preoccupied.She could not say that he avoided her, and yet it seemed to
happen that they were not much together."I fear I'm too young and
girlish to be a companion for him," she sighed."His manner is just as
kind and gentle, but he treats me as if I were his very little sister.I
don't seem to have the power to interest him that I once had.I wish I
knew enough to talk to him as he would like;" and she stealthily tried to
read some of the scientific books that she saw him poring over.He, poor fellow, was engaged in the most difficult task ever given to
man--the ruling of his own spirit.He saw her sisterly solicitude and
goodwill, but could not respond in a manner as natural as her own.His best resource was the comparative
solitude of constant occupation.He was growing doubtful, however, as to
the result of his struggle, while Amy was daily becoming more lovely in
his eyes.Her English life had not destroyed the native talent of an
American girl to make herself attractive.She knew instinctively how to
dress, how to enhance the charms of which nature had not been chary, and
Webb's philosophy and science were no defence against her winsomeness.In
her changeful eyes lurked spells too mighty for him.Men of his caste
rarely succumb to a learned and aggressive woman.They require
intelligence, but it is a feminine intelligence, which supplements their
own, and is not akin to it.Webb saw in Amy all that his heart craved,
and he believed that he also saw her fulfilling Burt's hopes.She seemed
to be gradually learning that the light-hearted brother might bring into
her life all the sunshine and happiness she could desire.Webb
depreciated himself, and believed that he was too grave and dull to win
in any event more than the affection which she would naturally feel for
an elder brother, and this she already bestowed upon him frankly and
unstintedly.Burt took the same view, and was usually complacency itself,
although a week seemed a long time to him, and he sometimes felt that he
ought to be making more progress.He would be
faithful for years, and Amy could not fail to reward such constancy.CHAPTER XXXIX

BURT'S ADVENTURE


Not only had the little rustic cottages which had been placed on poles
here and there about the Clifford dwelling, and the empty tomato-cans
which Alf, at Dr.Marvin's suggestion, had fastened in the trees, been
occupied by wrens and bluebirds, but larger homes had been taken for the
summer by migrants from the city.Hargrove, a
wealthy gentleman, who had rented a pretty villa on the banks of the
Hudson, a mile or two away.Burt, with all his proposed lifelong
constancy, had speedily discovered that Mr.Hargrove had a very pretty
daughter.Of course, he was quite indifferent to the fact, but he could
no more meet a girl like Gertrude Hargrove and be unobservant than could
Amy pass a new and rare wildflower with unregarding eyes.Miss Hargrove
was not a wildflower, however.She was a product of city life, and was
perfectly aware of her unusual and exotic beauty.Admiring eyes had
followed her even from childhood, and no one better than she knew her
power.Her head had been quite turned by flattery, but there was a saving
clause in her nature--her heart.She was a belle, but not a cold-blooded
coquette.Admiration was like sunshine--a matter of course.She had
always been accustomed to it, as she had been to wealth, and neither had
spoiled her.Beneath all that was artificial, all that fashion prescribed
and society had taught, was the essential womanhood which alone can win
and retain a true man's homage.For reasons just the reverse of those
which explained Amy's indisposition to sentiment, she also had been kept
fancy-free.Seclusion and the companionship of her father, who had been
an invalid in his later years, had kept the former a child in many
respects, at a time when Miss Hargrove had her train of admirers.Miss
Gertrude enjoyed the train very much, but showed no disposition to permit
any one of its constituents to monopolize her.Indeed, their very numbers
had been her safety.Her attention had been divided and distracted by a
score of aspirants, and while in her girlish eyes some found more favor
than others, she was inclined to laughing criticism of them all.They
amused her immensely, and she puzzled them.Her almost velvety black
eyes, and the rich, varying tints of her clear brunette complexion,
suggested a nature that was not cold and unresponsive, yet many who would
gladly have won the heiress for her own sake found her as elusive as only
a woman of perfect tact and self-possession can be.She had no vulgar
ambition to count her victims who had committed themselves in words.With
her keen intuition and abundant experience she recognized the first
glance that was warmer than mere friendliness, and this was all the
committal she wished for.She loved the admiration of men, but was too
good-hearted a girl to wish to make them cynics in regard to women.She
also had the sense to know that it is a miserable triumph to lure a man
to the declaration of a supreme regard, and then in one moment change it
into contempt.While, therefore, she had refused many an offer, no one
had been humiliated, no one had been made to feel that he had been
unworthily trifled with.Thus she retained the respect and goodwill of
those to whom she might easily have become the embodiment of all that was
false and heartless.She had welcomed the comparative seclusion of the
villa on the Hudson, for, although not yet twenty, she was growing rather
weary of society and its exactions.Its pleasures had been tasted too
often, its burdens were beginning to be felt.She was a good horsewoman,
and was learning, under the instruction of a younger brother, to row as
easily and gracefully on the river as she danced in the ballroom, and she
found the former recreation more satisfactory, from its very novelty.Burt was well aware of these outdoor accomplishments.Any one inclined to
rural pleasures won his attention at once; and Miss Hargrove, as she
occasionally trotted smartly by him, or skimmed near on the waters of the
Hudson, was a figure sure to win from his eyes more than a careless
glance.Thus far, as has been intimated, he had kept aloof, but he had
observed her critically, and he found little to disapprove.She also was
observing him, and was quite as well endowed as he with the power of
forming a correct judgment.Men of almost every description had sought
her smiles, but he did not suffer by comparison.His tall, lithe figure
was instinct with manly grace.There was a fascinating trace of reckless
boldness in his blue eyes.He rode like a centaur, and at will made his
light boat, in which Amy was usually seated, cut through the water with
spray flying from its prow.In Miss Hargrove's present mood for rural
life she wished for his acquaintance, and was a little piqued that he had
not sought hers, since her father had opened the way.Hargrove, soon after his arrival in the neighborhood, had had
business transactions with the Cliffords, and had learned enough about
them to awaken a desire for social relations, and he had courteously
expressed his wishes.Maggie and Amy had fully intended compliance, but
the harvest had come, time had passed, and the initial call had not been
made.Leonard was averse to such formalities, and, for reasons already
explained, Burt and Webb were in no mood for them.They would not have
failed in neighborliness much longer, however, and a call was proposed
for the first comparatively cool day.A little incident now occurred
which quite broke the ice, and also somewhat disturbed Burt's serenity.Amy was not feeling very well, and he had gone out alone for a ride on
his superb black horse Thunder.In a shady road some miles away, where
the willows interlaced their branches overhead in a long, Gothic-like
arch, he saw Miss Hargrove, mounted also, coming slowly toward him.He
never forgot the picture she made under the rustic archway.Her fine
horse was pacing along with a stately tread, his neck curved under the
restraining bit, while she was evidently amusing herself by talking, for
the want of a better companion, to an immense Newfoundland dog that was
trotting at her side, and looking up to her in intelligent appreciation.Thus, in her preoccupation, Burt was permitted to draw comparatively
near, but as soon as she observed him it was evidently her intention to
pass rapidly.As she gave her horse the rein and he leaped forward, she
clutched his mane, and by a word brought him to a standstill.Burt saw
the trouble at once, for the girth of her saddle had broken, and hung
loosely down.Only by prompt action and good horsemanship had she kept
her seat.Now she was quite helpless, for an attempt to dismount would
cause the heavy saddle to turn, with unknown and awkward results.She had
recognized Burt, and knew that he was a gentleman; therefore she patted
her horse and quieted him, while the young man came promptly to her
assistance.He, secretly exulting over the promise of an adventure, said,
suavely, as he lifted his hat:

"Miss Hargrove, will you permit me to aid you?""Certainly," she replied, smiling so pleasantly that the words did not
seem ungracious; "I have no other resource."He bowed, leaped lightly to the ground, and fastened his horse by the
roadside; then came forward without the least embarrassment."Your
saddle-girth has broken," he said.You maintained your seat admirably, but a very slight
movement on your part will cause the saddle to turn.""I know that," she replied, laughing.I
am only anxious to reach ground in safety;" and she dropped the reins,
and held out her hands."Your horse is too high for you to dismount in that way," he said,
quietly, "and the saddle might fall after you and hurt you.Pardon me;"
and he encircled her with his right arm, and lifted her gently off.She blushed like the western sky, but he was so grave and apparently
solicitous, and his words had made his course seem so essential, that she
could not take offence.Indeed, he was now giving his whole attention to
the broken girth, and she could only await the result of his examination."I think I can mend it with a strap from my bridle so that it will hold
until you reach home," he said; "but I am sorry to say that I cannot make
it very secure.Clifford, I think," she began, hesitatingly.Clifford, and, believe me, I am wholly at your service.If you
had not been so good a horsewoman you might have met with a very serious
accident.""More thanks are due to you, I imagine," she replied; "though I suppose I
could have got off in some way.""There would have been no trouble in your getting off," he said, with one
of his frank, contagious smiles; "but then your horse might have run
away, or you would have had to lead him some distance, at least.Perhaps
it was well that the girth gave way when it did, for it would have broken
in a few moments more, in any event.Therefore I hope you will tolerate
one not wholly unknown to you, and permit me to be of service.""Indeed, I have only cause for thanks.I have interfered with your ride,
and am putting you to trouble.""I was only riding for pleasure, and as yet you have had all the
trouble."She did not look excessively annoyed, and in truth was enjoying the
adventure quite as much as he was, but she only said: "You have the
finest horse there I ever saw."I fear he would be ungallant."I should not be afraid so long as the saddle remained firm.At the sound of his name the beautiful animal arched his neck
and whinnied."There, be quiet, old fellow, and speak when you are spoken
to," Burt said."He is comparatively gentle with me, but uncontrollable
by others.I have now done my best, Miss Hargrove, and I think you may
mount in safety, if you are willing to walk your horse quietly home.But
I truly think I ought to accompany you, and I will do so gladly, with
your permission.""But it seems asking a great deal of-"

"Of a stranger?I wish I knew how to bring about a formal introduction.Will you not in the emergency defer the introduction
until we arrive at your home?""I think we may as well dispense with it altogether," she said, laughing."It would be too hollow a formality after the hour we must spend
together, since you think so slow a pace is essential to safety.Events,
not we, are to blame for all failures in etiquette.""I was coming to call upon you this very week with the ladies of our
house," he began."I assure you of the truth of what I say," he continued, earnestly,
turning his handsome eyes to hers.Then throwing his head back a little
proudly, he added, "Miss Hargrove, you must know that we are farmers, and
midsummer brings the harvest and unwonted labors."With a slight, piquant imitation of his manner, she said: "My father, you
must know, Mr.Clifford, is a merchant Is not that an equally respectable
calling?""Some people regard it as far more so."There is no higher rank than that of a
gentleman, Mr.He took off his hat, and said, laughingly: "I hope it is not presumption
to imagine a slight personal bearing in your remark.At least, let me
prove that I have some claim to the title by seeing you safely home.Put your foot in my hand, and bear your whole weight upon it,
and none upon the saddle.""You don't know how heavy I am.""No, but I know I can lift you.Without the least effort she found herself in the saddle."Yes," he replied, laughing; "I developed my muscle, if not my brains, at
college."In a moment he vaulted lightly upon his horse, that reared proudly, but,
at a word from his master, arched his neck and paced as quietly as Miss
Hargrove's better-trained animal.Burt's laugh would have thawed Mrs.He was so vital with youth and vigor, and his flow of
spirits so irresistible, that Miss Hargrove found her own nerves tingling
with pleasure.The episode was novel, unexpected, and promised so much
for the future, that in her delightful excitement she cast conventionality
to the winds, and yielded to his sportive mood.They had not gone a mile
together before one would have thought they had been acquainted for years.Burt's frank face was like the open page of a book, and the experienced
society girl saw nothing in it but abounding good-nature, and an enjoyment
as genuine as her own.She was on the alert for traces of provincialism and
rusticity, but was agreeably disappointed at their absence.He certainly
was unmarked, and, to her taste, unmarred, by the artificial mode of the
day, but there was nothing under-bred in his manner or language.He rather
fulfilled her ideal of the light-hearted student who had brought away the
air of the university without being oppressed by its learning.She saw,
with a curious little blending of pique and pleasure, that he was not in
the least afraid of her, and that, while claiming to be simply a farmer, he
unconsciously asserted by every word and glance that he was her equal.She
had the penetration to recognize from the start that she could not
patronize him in the slightest degree, that he was as high-spirited as he
was frank and easy in manner, and she could well imagine that his mirthful
eyes would flash with anger on slight provocation.She had never met just
such a type before, and every moment found her more and more interested and
amused.It must be admitted that his sensations kept pace with hers.Many had
found Miss Hargrove's eyes singularly effective under ordinary
circumstances, but now her mood gave them an unwonted lustre and power.Her color was high, her talk animated and piquant.Even an enemy, had she
had one, would have been forced to admit that she was dazzlingly
beautiful, and inflammable Burt could not be indifferent to her charms.He knew that he was not, but complacently assured himself that he was a
good judge in such matters.Hargrove met them at the door, and his daughter laughingly told him
of her mishap.She evidently reposed in him the utmost confidence.He
justified it by meeting her in like spirit with her own, and he
interpreted her unspoken wishes by so cordially pressing Burt to remain
to dinner that he was almost constrained to yield."You will be too late
for your own evening meal," he said, "and your kindness to my daughter
would be ill-requited, and our reputation for hospitality would suffer,
should we let you depart without taking salt with us.Burt was the last one to have any scruples on such grounds, and he
resolved to have his "lark" out, as he mentally characterized it.Hargrove had been something of a sportsman in his earlier days, and the
young fellow's talk was as interesting to him as it had been to Miss
Gertrude.Fred, her younger brother, was quite captivated, and elegant
Mrs.Hargrove, like her daughter, watched in vain for mannerisms to
criticise in the breezy youth.The evening was half gone before Burt
galloped homeward, smiling broadly to himself at the adventure.His absence had caused little remark in the family.It had been taken for
granted that he was at Dr.Marvin's or the parsonage, for the young
fellow was a great favorite with their pastor.When he entered the
sitting-room, however, there was a suppressed excitement in his manner
which suggested an unusual experience.He was not slow in relating all
that had happened, for the thought had occurred to him that it might be
good policy to awaken a little jealousy in Amy.In this effort he was
obliged to admit to himself that he failed signally.Even Webb's
searching eyes could not detect a trace of chagrin.She only seemed very
much amused, and was laughingly profuse in her congratulations to Burt.Moreover, she was genuinely interested in Miss Hargrove, and eager to
make her acquaintance."If she is as nice as you say, Burt," she
concluded, "she would make a pleasant addition to our little excursions
and pleasure parties.Perhaps she's old and bright enough to talk to
Webb, and draw him out of his learned preoccupation," she added, with a
shy glance toward the one who was growing too remote from her daily life.Even his bronzed face flushed, but he said, with a laugh: "She is evidently
much too bright for me, and would soon regard me as insufferably stupid.I
have never found much favor with city dames, or with dames of any
description, for that matter.""So much the worse for the dames, then," she replied, with a piquant nod
at him."Little sisters are apt to be partial judges--at least, one is," he said,
smilingly, as he left the room.He walked out in the moonlight, thinking:
"There was not a trace of jealousy in her face.Burt's perfect frankness was enough to prevent anything of the kind.If there had been cause for jealousy, he would have been reticent.Besides, Amy is too high-toned to yield readily to this vice, and Burt
can never be such an idiot as to endanger his prospects."A scheme, however, was maturing in Burt's busy brain that night, which he
thought would be a master-stroke of policy.He was quite aware of the
good impression that he had made on Miss Hargrove, and he determined that
Amy's wishes should be carried out in a sufficient degree at least to
prove to her that a city belle would not be wholly indifferent to his
attentions."I'll teach the coy little beauty that others are not so
blind as she is, and I imagine that, with Miss Hargrove's aid, I can
disturb her serenity a little before many weeks pass."CHAPTER XL

MISS HARGROVE


But a few days elapsed before Mr.Clifford, with Burt, Maggie, and Amy,
made the call which would naturally inaugurate an exchange of social
visits.Hargrove was especially interested in the old gentleman, and
they were at once deep in rural affairs.Maggie was a little reserved at
first with Mrs.Hargrove, but the latter, with all her stateliness, was a
zealous housekeeper, and so the two ladies were soon _en rapport._

The young people adjourned to the piazza, and their merry laughter and
animated talk proved that if there had been any constraint it was
vanishing rapidly.Amy was naturally a little shy at first, but Miss
Hargrove had the tact to put her guests immediately at ease.She proposed
to have a good time during the remainder of the summer, and saw in Burt a
means to that end, while she instinctively felt that she must propitiate
Amy in order to accomplish her purpose.Therefore she was disposed to pay
a little court to her on general principles.She had learned that the
young girl was a ward of Mr.What Burt was to Amy she did not
know, but was sure she could soon find out, and his manner had led to the
belief that he was not a committed and acknowledged lover.She made no
discoveries, however, for he was not one to display a real preference in
public, and indeed, in accordance with his scheme, she received his most
marked attentions.She could
not immediately accept of this genuine child of nature, whose very
simplicity was puzzling.It might be the perfection of well-bred reserve,
such complete art as to appear artless.Miss Hargrove had been in society
too long to take anything impulsively on trust.Still, she was charmed
with the young girl, and Amy was also genuinely pleased with her new
acquaintance.Before they parted a horseback ride was arranged, at Burt's
suggestion, for the next afternoon.This was followed by visits that soon
lost all formality, boating on the river, other rides, drives, and
excursions to points of interest throughout the region.Webb was
occasionally led to participate in these, but he usually had some excuse
for remaining at home.He, also, was a new type to Miss Hargrove,
"indigenous to the soil," she smilingly said to herself, "and a fine
growth too.With his grave face and ways he makes a splendid contrast to
his brother."She found him too reticent for good-fellowship, and he gave
her the impression also that he knew too much about that which was remote
from her life and interests.At the same time, with her riper experience,
she speedily divined his secret, to which Amy was blind."He could almost
say his prayers to Amy," she thought, as she returned after an evening
spent at the Cliffords', "and she doesn't know it."With all his frankness, Burt's relations to Amy still baffled her.She
sometimes thought she saw his eyes following the young girl with
lover-like fondness, and she also thought that he was a little more
pronounced in his attentions to her in Amy's absence.Acquaintanceship
ripened into intimacy as plans matured under the waning suns of July, and
the girls often spent the night together.Amy was soon beguiled into
giving her brief, simple history, omitting, of course, all reference to
Bart's passionate declaration and his subsequent expectations.As far as
she herself was concerned, she had no experiences of this character to
relate, and her nature was much too fine to gossip about Burt.Miss
Hargrove soon accepted Amy's perfect simplicity as a charming fact, and
while the young girl had all the refinement and intelligence of her city
friend, the absence of certain phases of experience made her companionship
all the more fascinating and refreshing.It was seen that she had grown
thus far in secluded and sheltered nooks, and the ignorance that resulted
was like morning dew upon a flower.Of one thing her friend thought herself
assured--Burt had never touched Amy's heart, and she was as unconscious of
herself as of Webb's well-hidden devotion.The Clifford family interested
Miss Gertrude exceedingly, and her innate goodness of heart was proved by
the fact that she soon became a favorite with Mr.She
never came to the house without bringing flowers to the latter--not only
beautiful exotics from the florists, but wreaths of clematis, bunches of
meadow-rue from her rambles, and water-lilies and cardinal-flowers from
boating excursions up the Moodna Creek--and the secluded invalid enjoyed
her brilliant beauty and piquant ways as if she had been a rare flower
herself.Burt had entered on his scheme with the deepest interest and with
confident expectations.As time passed, however, he found that he could
not pique Amy in the slightest degree; that she rather regarded his
interest in Miss Hargrove as the most natural thing in the world, because
she was so interesting.Therefore he at last just let himself drift, and
was content with the fact that the summer was passing delightfully.That
Miss Hargrove's dark eyes sometimes quickened his pulse strangely did not
trouble him; it had often been quickened before.When they were alone,
and she sang to him in her rich contralto, and he, at her request, added
his musical tenor, it seemed perfectly natural that he should bend over
her toward the notes in a way that was not the result of near-sightedness.Burt was amenable to other attractions than that of gravitation.Webb was the only one not blind to the drift of events.While he forbore
by word or sign to interfere, he felt that new elements were entering
into the problem of the future.He drove the farm and garden work along
with a tireless energy against which even Leonard remonstrated.But Webb
knew that his most wholesome antidote for suspense and trouble was work,
and good for all would come of his remedy.He toiled long hours in the
oat harvest.He sowed seed which promised a thousand bushels of turnips.Land foul with weeds, or only half subdued, he sowed with that best of
scavenger crops, buckwheat, which was to be plowed under as soon as in
blossom.The vegetable and fruit gardens gave him much occupation, also,
and the table fairly groaned under the over-abundant supply, while Abram
was almost daily despatched to the landing or to neighboring markets with
loads of various produce.The rose garden, however, seemed to afford Webb
his chief recreation and a place of rest, and the roses in Amy's belt
were the wonder and envy of all who saw them.His mother sometimes looked
at him curiously, as he still brought to her the finest specimens, and
one day she said: "Webb, I never knew even you to be so tireless before.You are growing very thin, and you are certainly going beyond your
strength, and--forgive me--you seem restlessly active.Have you any
trouble in which mother can help you?""You always help me, mother," he said, gently; "but I have no trouble
that requires your or any one's attention.I like to be busy, and there
is much to do.I am getting the work well along, so that I can take a
trip in August, and not leave too much for Leonard to look after."August came, and with it the promise of drought, but he and his elder
brother had provided against it.The young trees had been well mulched
while the ground was moist, and deep, thorough cultivation rendered the
crops safe unless the rainless period should be of long duration.Already in the rustling foliage there were whisperings of autumn.The
nights grew longer, and were filled with the sounds of insect life.The
robins disappeared from about the house, and were haunting distant
groves, becoming as wild as they had formerly been domestic.The season
of bird song was over for the year.The orioles whistled in a languid and
desultory way occasionally, and the smaller warblers sometimes gave
utterance to defective strains, but the leaders of the feathered chorus,
the thrushes, were silent.The flower-beds flamed with geraniums and
salvias, and were gay with gladioli, while Amy and Mrs.Clifford exulted
in the extent and variety of their finely quilled and rose-like asters
and dahlias.The foliage of the trees had gained its darkest hues, and
the days passed, one so like another that nature seemed to be taking a
summer siesta.CHAPTER XLI

A FIRE IN THE MOUNTAINS


A day in August can be as depressing as a typical one in May is
inspiring, or in June entrancing.As the season advanced Nature appeared
to be growing languid and faint.There was neither cloud by day nor dew
at night.The sun burned rather than vivified the earth, and the grass
and herbage withered and shrivelled before its unobstructed rays.The
foliage along the roadsides grew dun- from the dust, and those who
rode or drove on thoroughfares were stifled by the irritating clouds that
rose on the slightest provocation.Pleasure could be found only on the
unfrequented lanes that led to the mountains or ran along their bases.Even there trees that drew their sustenance from soil spread thinly on
the rocks were seen to be dying, their leaves not flushing with autumnal
tints, but hanging limp and bleached as if they had exhaled their vital
juices.The moss beneath them, that had been softer to the tread than a
Persian rug, crumbled into powder under the foot.Alf went to gather
huckleberries, but, except in moist and swampy places, found them
shrivelled on the bushes.Even the corn leaves began to roll on the
uplands, and Leonard shook his head despondingly.Webb's anxieties,
however, were of a far deeper character, and he was philosophical enough
to average the year's income.If the cows did come home hungry from their
pasture, there was abundance of hay and green-corn fodder to carry them
through until the skies should become more propitious.Besides, there was
an unfailing spring upon the place, and from this a large cask on wheels
was often filled, and was then drawn by one of the quiet farm-horses to
the best of the flower beds, the young trees, and to such products of the
garden as would repay for the expenditure of time and labor.The ground
was never sprinkled so that the morning sun of the following day would
drink up the moisture, but so deluged that the watering would answer for
several days.It was well known that partial watering does only harm.Nature can be greatly assisted at such times, but it must be in
accordance with her laws.The grapevine is a plant that can endure an
unusual degree of drought, and the fruit will be all the earlier and
sweeter for it.An excellent fertilizer for the grape is suds from the
laundry, and by filling a wide, shallow basin, hollowed out from the
earth around the stems, with this alkaline infusion, the vines were kept
in the best condition.The clusters of the earlier varieties were already
beginning to color, and the season insured the perfect ripening of those
fine old kinds, the Isabella and Catawba, that too often are frost-bitten
before they become fit for the table.Thus it would appear that Nature has compensations for her worst
moods--greater compensations than are thought of by many.Drought causes
the roots of plants and trees to strike deep, and so extends the range of
their feeding-ground, and anchors vegetation of all kinds more firmly in
the soil.Nevertheless, a long dry period is always depressing.The bright green
fades out of the landscape, the lawns and grass-plots become brown and
sear, the air loses its sweet, refreshing vitality, and is often so
charged with smoke from forest-fires, and impalpable dust, that
respiration is not agreeable.Apart from considerations of profit and
loss, the sympathy of the Clifford household was too deep with Nature to
permit the indifference of those whose garden is the market stall and the
florist's greenhouse, and to whom vistas in hotel parlors and piazzas are
the most attractive."It seems to me," Leonard remarked at the dinner-table one day, "that
droughts are steadily growing more serious and frequent.""While I remember a few in early life
that were more prolonged than any we have had of late years, they must
have resulted from exceptional causes, for we usually had an abundance of
rain, and did not suffer as we do now from violent alternations of
weather.There was one year when there was scarcely a drop of rain
throughout the summer.Potatoes planted in the late spring were found in
the autumn dry and unsprouted.But such seasons were exceedingly rare,
and now droughts are the rule.""And the people are chiefly to blame for them," said Webb."We are
suffering from the law of heredity.Our forefathers were compelled to
fell the trees to make room for the plow, and now one of the strongest
impulses of the average American is to cut down a tree.Our forests, on
which a moist climate so largely depends, are treated as if they
encumbered the ground.The smoke that we are breathing proves that fires
are ravaging to the north and west of us.They should be permitted no
more than a fire in the heart of a city.The future of the country
depends upon the people becoming sane on this subject.If we will send to
the Legislature pot-house politicans who are chiefly interested in
keeping up a supply of liquor instead of water, they should be provided
with a little primer giving the condition of lands denuded of their
forests.There is scarcely anything in their shifty ways, their blind
zeal for what the 'deestrict' wants to-day, regardless of coming days,
that so irritates me as their stupidity on this subject.A man who votes
against the protection of our forests is not fit for the office of
road-master.After all, the people are to blame, and their children will
pay dear for their ignorance and the spirit which finds expression in the
saying, 'After me the deluge'; and there will be flood and drought until
every foot of land not adapted to cultivation and pasturage is again
covered with trees.Indeed, a great deal of good land should be given up
to forests, for then what was cultivated would produce far more than
could be obtained from a treeless and therefore rainless country."cried Burt; "we must send you to the Legislature.""Primarily by instruction and the formation of public opinion.The
influence of trees on the climate should be taught in all our schools as
thoroughly as the multiplication-table.The national and state
governments would then be compelled to look beyond the next election, and
to appoint foresters who would have the same power to call out the people
to extinguish a forest fire that the sheriff has to collect his posse to
put down mob violence.In the long-run fire departments in our forest
tracts would be more useful than the same in cities, for, after all,
cities depend upon the country and its productiveness.The owners of
woodland should be taught the folly of cutting everything before them,
and of leaving the refuse brush to become like tinder.The smaller growth
should be left to mature, and the brush piled and burned in a way that
would not involve the destruction of every sprout and sapling over wide
areas.As it is, we are at the mercy of every careless boy, and such
vagrants as Lumley used to be before Amy woke him up.It is said--and
with truth at times, I fear--that the shiftless mountaineers occasionally
start the fires, for a fire means brief high-priced labor for them, and
afterward an abundance of whiskey."Events furnished a practical commentary on Webb's words.Miss Hargrove
had come over to spend the night with Amy, and to try some fine old
English glees that she had obtained from her city home.They had just
adjourned from the supper-table to the piazza when Lumley appeared, hat
in hand.He spoke to Leonard, but looked at Amy with a kind of wondering
admiration, as if he could not believe that the girl, who looked so fair
and delicate in her evening dress, so remote from him and his
surroundings, could ever have given him her hand, and spoken as if their
humanity had anything in common.The Cliffords were informed that a fire had broken out on a tract
adjoining their own."City chaps was up there gunning out o' season,"
Lumley explained, "and wads from their guns must 'a started it."As there was much wood ranked on the Clifford tract, the matter was
serious.Abram and other farm-hands were summoned, and the brothers acted
as did the minute-men in the Revolution when the enemy appeared in their
vicinity.The young men excused themselves, and bustle and confusion
followed.Burt, with a flannel blouse belted tightly around his waist,
soon dashed up to the front piazza on his horse, and, flourishing a rake,
said, laughingly, "I don't look much like a knight sallying forth to
battle-do I?""You look as if you could be one if the occasion arose," Miss Hargrove
replied.During the half-jesting badinage that followed Amy stole away.Behind the
house Webb was preparing to mount, when a light hand fell on his
shoulder."You don't seem
to spare yourself in anything.I dread to have you go up into those
darkening mountains.""Why, Amy," he replied, laughing, "one would think I was going to fight
Indians, and you feared for my scalp.""I am not so young and blind but that I can see that you are quietly half
reckless with yourself," she replied; and her tone indicated that she was
a little hurt."I pledge you my word that I will not be reckless tonight; and, after
all, this is but disagreeable, humdrum work that we often have to do.Burt will be there to watch over me, you
know," he added."Oh, he's talking romantic nonsense to Miss Hargrove.I wish I was as sure of you, and I wish I had more influence
over you.I'm not such a very little sister, even if I don't know enough
to talk to you as you would like;" and she left him abruptly.He mastered a powerful impulse to spring from his horse and call her
back.A moment's thought taught him, however, that he could not trust
himself then to say a word, and he rode rapidly away."That is the best chance for us
both, unless--" But he hesitated to put into words the half-formed hope
that Miss Hargrove's appearance in the little drama of their lives might
change its final scenes."She's jealous of her friend, at last," he
concluded, and this conviction gave him little comfort.Burt soon
overtook him, and their ride was comparatively silent, for each was busy
with his own thoughts.Lumley was directed to join them at the fire, and
then was forgotten by all except Amy, who, by a gentle urgency, induced
him to go to the kitchen and get a good supper.Before he departed she
slipped a banknote into his hand with which to buy a dress for the baby.Lumley had to pass more than one groggery on his way to the mountains,
but the money was as safe in his pocket as it would have been in Amy's.he soliloquized, as he hastened
through the gathering darkness with his long, swinging stride."I didn't
know there was sich gells.She's never lectured me once, but she jest
smiles and looks a feller into bein' a man."Miss Hargrove had noted Amy's influence over the mountaineer, and she
asked for an explanation.Amy, in a very brief, modest way, told of her
visits to the wretched cabin, and said, in conclusion: "I feel sorry for
poor Lumley.The fact that he is trying to do better, with so much
against him, proves what he might have been.That's one of the things
that trouble me most, as I begin to think and see a little of life; so
many people have no chance worth speaking of.""The thing that ought to trouble me most is, I suppose, that those who
have a chance do so little for such people.Amy," she added, sadly, after
a moment's thought, "I've had many triumphs over men, but none like
yours; and I feel to-night as if I could give them all to see a man look
at me as that poor fellow looked at you.It was the grateful homage of a
human soul to whom you had given something that in a dim way was felt to
be priceless.The best that I can remember in my pleasure-loving life is
that I have not permitted myself selfishly and recklessly to destroy
manhood, but I fear no one is the better for having known me.""You do yourself injustice," said Amy, warmly."I'm the better and
happier for having known you.Papa had a morbid horror of fashionable
society, and this accounts for my being so unsophisticated.With all your
experience of such society, I have perfect faith in you, and could trust
you implicitly."(and Amy thought she had never seen such
depth and power in human eyes as in those of Miss Hargrove, who encircled
the young girl with her arm, and looked as if seeking to detect the
faintest doubt)."Yes," said Amy, with quiet emphasis.Miss Hargrove drew a long breath, and then said: "That little word may do
me more good than all the sermons I ever heard.Many would try to be
different if others had more faith in them.I think that is the secret of
your power over the rough man that has just gone.You recognized the good
that was in him, and made him conscious of it.Well, I must try to
deserve your trust."Then she stepped out on the dusky piazza, and
sighed, as she thought: "It may cost me dear.She seemed troubled at my
words to Burt, and stole away as if she were the awkward third person.I
may have misjudged her, and she cares for him after all."Amy went to the piano, and played softly until summoned without by an
excited exclamation from her friend.A line of fire was creeping toward
them around a lofty highland, and it grew each moment more and more
distinct."Oh, I know from its position that it's drawing near our
tract," cried Amy."If it is so bright to us at this distance, it must be
almost terrible to those near by.I suppose they are all up there just in
front of it, and Burt is so reckless."She was about to say Webb, but,
because of some unrecognized impulse, she did not.The utterance of
Burt's name, however, was not lost on Miss Hargrove.For a long time the girls watched the scene with awe, and each, in
imagination, saw an athletic figure begrimed with smoke, and sending out
grotesque shadows into the obscurity, as the destroying element was met
and fought in ways unknown to them, which, they felt sure, involved
danger.Miss Hargrove feared that they both had the same form in mind.She was not a girl to remain long unconscious of her heart's inclinations,
and she knew that Burt Clifford had quickened her pulses as no man had ever
done before.This very fact made her less judicial, less keen, in her
insight.If he was so attractive to her, could Amy be indifferent to him
after months of companionship?She had thought that she understood Amy
thoroughly, but was beginning to lose faith in her impression.While in
some respects Amy was still a child, there were quiet depths in her nature
of which the young girl herself was but half conscious.She often lapsed
into long reveries.Never had he been more
fraternal in his manner, but apparently she was losing her power to
interest him, to lure him away from the material side of life."I can't
keep pace with him," she sighed; "and now that he has learned all about my
little range of thoughts and knowledge, he finds that I can be scarcely
more to him than Johnnie, whom he pets in much the same spirit that he does
me, and then goes to his work or books and forgets us both.He could help
me so much, if he only thought it worth his while!I'm sure I'm not
contented to be ignorant, and many of the things that he knows so much
about interest me most."Thus each girl was busy with her thoughts, as they sat in the warm summer
night and watched the vivid line draw nearer.Clifford and Maggie
came out from time to time, and were evidently disturbed by the unchecked
progress of the fire.Alf had gone with his father, and anything like a
conflagration so terrified Johnnie that she dared not leave her mother's
lighted room.Suddenly the approaching line grew dim, was broken, and before very long
even the last red glow disappeared utterly.Clifford,
rubbing his hands, "they have got the fire under, and I don't believe it
reached oar tract.""How did they put it out so suddenly?""Were they
not fighting it all the time?""The boys will soon be here, and they can give you a more graphic account
than I. Mother is a little excited and troubled, as she always is when
her great babies are away on such affairs, so I must ask you to excuse
me."In little more than half an hour a swift gallop was heard, and Burt soon
appeared, in the light of the late-rising moon."It's all out," he
exclaimed."Leonard and Webb propose remaining an hour or two longer, to
see that it does not break out again.There's no need of their doing so,
for Lumley promised to watch till morning.If
you'll wait till I put on a little of the aspect of a white man, I'll
join you."He had been conscious of a feverish impatience to get back to
the ladies, having carefully, even in his thoughts, employed the plural,
and he had feared that they might have retired.Miss Hargrove exclaimed: "How absurd!You wish to go and divest yourself
of all picturesqueness!I've seen well-dressed men before, and would much
prefer that you should join us as you are.We can then imagine that you
are a bandit or a frontiersman, and that your rake was a rifle, which you
had used against the Indians.We are impatient to have you tell us how
you fought the fire."He gave but scant attention to Thunder that night, and soon stepped out
on the moonlit piazza, his tall, fine figure outlined to perfection in
his close-fitting costume."You will, indeed, need all your imagination to make anything of our task
to-night," he said."Fighting a mountain fire is the most prosaic of hard
work.Suppose the line of fire coming down toward me from where you are
sitting."As yet unknown to him, a certain subtile flame was originating
in that direction."We simply begin well in advance of it, so that we may
have time to rake a space, extending along the whole front of the fire,
clear of leaves and rubbish, and as far as possible to hollow out with
hoes a trench through this space.Thus, when the fire comes to this
cleared area, there is nothing to burn, and it goes out for want of fuel.Of course, it's rough work, and it must be done rapidly, but you can see
that all the heroic elements which you may have associated with our
expedition are utterly lacking."Amy and I have had our little romance, and have
imagined you charging the line of fire in imminent danger of being
strangled with smoke, if nothing worse."Amy soon heard Maggie bustling about, preparing a midnight lunch for
those who would come home hungry as well as weary, and she said that she
would go and try to help.To Burt this seemed sufficient reason for her
absence, but Miss Hargrove thought, "Perhaps she saw that his eyes were
fixed chiefly on me as he gave his description.I wish I knew just how
she feels toward him!"But the temptation to remain in the witching moonlight was too strong to
be resisted.His mellow tones were a music that she had never heard
before, and her eyes grew lustrous with suppressed feeling, and a
happiness to which she was not sure she was entitled.The spell of her
beauty was on him also, and the moments flew by unheeded, until Amy was
heard playing and singing softly to herself.was Miss Hargrove's mental comment, and with not a little
compunction she rose and went into the parlor.Burt lighted a cigar, in
the hope that the girls would again join him, but Leonard, Webb, and Alf
returned sooner than they were expected, and all speedily sat down to
their unseasonable repast.To Amy's surprise, Webb was the liveliest of
the party, but he looked gaunt from fatigue--so worn, indeed, that he
reminded her of the time when he had returned from Burt's rescue.But
there was no such episode as had then occurred before they parted for the
night, and to this she now looked back wistfully.He rose before the
others, pleaded fatigue, and went to his room.CHAPTER XLII

CAMPING OUT


They all gathered at a late breakfast, and the surface current of family
and social life sparkled as if there were no hidden depths and secret
thoughts.Amy's manner was not cold toward Webb, but her pride was
touched, and her feelings were a little hurt.While disposed to blame
herself only that she had not the power to interest him and secure his
companionship, as in the past, it was not in human nature to receive with
indifference such an apparent hint that he was far beyond her."It would
be more generous in Webb to help than to ignore me because I know so
little," she thought."Very well: I can have a good time with Burt and
Gertrude until Webb gets over his hurry and preoccupation;" and with a
slight spirit of retaliation she acted as if she thoroughly enjoyed
Burt's lively talk.The young fellow soon made a proposition that caused a general and breezy
excitement."There never was a better time than this for camping out," he
said."The ground is dry, and there is scarcely any dew.Suppose we go up and spend a few days on our mountain
tract?Maggie could chaperon the party, and I've no doubt that Dr.How could she leave the old people and her housekeeping?Clifford, however, became the strongest advocates of the scheme.They
could get along with the servants, they said, and a little outing would
do Maggie good.Leonard, who had listened in comparative silence, brought
his wife to a decision by saying: "You had better go, Maggie.You will
have all the housekeeping you want on the mountain, and I will go back
and forth every day and see that all's right.It's not as if you were
beyond the reach of home, for you could be here in an hour were there
need.Come now, make up your mind for a regular lark.The children were wild with delight at the prospect, and Miss Hargrove
and Amy scarcely less pleased.The latter had furtively watched Webb, who
at first could not disguise a little perplexity and trouble at the
prospect.But he had thought rapidly, and felt that a refusal to be one
of the party might cause embarrassing surmises.Therefore he also soon
became zealous in his advocacy of the plan.He felt that circumstances
were changing and controlling his action.He had fully resolved on an
absence of some weeks, but the prolonged drought and the danger it
involved--the Cliffords would lose at least a thousand dollars should a
fire sweep over their mountain tract--made it seem wrong for him to leave
home until rain insured safety.Moreover, he believed that he detected
symptoms in Burt which, with his knowledge of his brother, led to hopes
that he could not banish.An occasional expression in Miss Hargrove's
dark eyes, also, did not tend to lessen these hopes."The lack of
conventionality incident to a mountain camp," he thought, "may develop
matters so rapidly as to remove my suspense.With all Amy's gentleness,
she is very sensitive and proud, and Burt cannot go much further with
Miss Hargrove without so awakening her pride as to render futile all
efforts to retrieve himself.After all, Miss Hargrove, perhaps, would
suit him far better than Amy.They are both fond of excitement and
society.At least, if the way were clear, I
would try as no man ever tried to win Amy, and I should be no worse off
than I am if I failed in the attempt."These musings were rather remote from his practical words, for he had
taken pains to give the impression that their woodland would be far safer
for the proposed expedition, and Amy had said, a little satirically, "We
are now sure of Webb, since he can combine so much business with
pleasure."He only smiled back in an inscrutable way.Musk-melons formed one of their breakfast dishes, and Miss Hargrove
remarked, "Papa has been exceedingly annoyed by having some of his finest
ones stolen."Burt began laughing, and said: "He should imitate my tactics.Ours were
stolen last year, and as they approached maturity, some time since, I put
up a notice in large black letters, 'Thieves, take warning: be careful
not to steal the poisoned melons.'Hearing a dog bark one night about a
week ago, I took a revolver and went out.The moonlight was clear, and
there, reading the notice, was a group of ragamuffin boys.Stealing up
near them, behind some shrubbery, I fired my pistol in the air, and they
fairly tumbled over each other in their haste to escape.We've had no
trouble since, I can assure you.I'll drive you home this morning, and,
with your father's permission, will put up a similar notice in your
garden.We also must make our arrangements for camping promptly.It surely will not if our mountain
experience makes us wish it would;" and, full of his projects, he
hastened to harness Thunder to his light top-wagon.He might have taken the two-seated carriage, and asked Amy to accompany
them, but it had not occurred to him to do so, especially as he intended
to drive on rapidly to Newburgh to make arrangements for the tents.She
felt a little slighted and neglected, and Miss Hargrove saw that she did,
but thought that any suggestion of a different arrangement might lead to
embarrassment.She began to think, with Webb, that the camping experience
would make everything clearer.At any rate, it promised so much
unhackneyed pleasure that she resolved to make the most of it, and then
decide upon her course.She was politic, and cautioned Burt to say
nothing until she had first seen her father, for she was not certain how
her stately and conventional mother would regard the affair.Hargrove in his library, and he knew from her preliminary
caresses that some unusual favor was to be asked."Come," he said, "you wily little strategist, what do you want now?His answer was unexpected, for he asked, "Is Mr."No," she replied, faintly; "he's on the piazza."Then, with unusual
animation, she began about the melons.Her father's face softened, and he
looked at her a little humorously, for her flushed, handsome face would
disarm a Puritan."You are seeing a great deal of this young Mr.Her color deepened, and she began, hastily, "Oh, well, papa, I've seen a
good deal of a great many gentlemen.""Come, come, Trurie, no disguises with me.Your old father is not so
blind as you think, and I've not lived to my time of life in ignorance of
the truth that prevention is better than cure.Whether you are aware of
it or not, your eyes have revealed to me a growing interest in Mr."He is a comparatively poor man, I suppose, and while I think him a fine
fellow, I've seen in him no great aptness for business.If I saw that he
was no more to you than others who have sought your favor, I would not
say a word, Trurie, for when you are indifferent you are abundantly able
to take care of yourself.I knew you would in
time meet some one who would have the power to do more than amuse you,
and my love, darling, is too deep and vigilant to be blind until it is
too late to see.You might
become more than interested during an experience like the one proposed.""If I should, papa, am I so poor that I have not even the privilege of a
village girl, who can follow her heart?""My advice would be," he replied, gently, "that you guide yourself by
both reason and your heart.This is our secret council-chamber, and one
is speaking to you who has no thought but for your lasting happiness."She took a chair near him, and looked into his eyes, as she said,
thoughtfully and gravely: "I should be both silly and unnatural, did I
not recognize your motive and love.I know I am not a child any longer,
and should have no excuse for any school-girl or romantic folly.You have
always had my confidence; you would have had it in this case as soon as
there was anything to tell.I scarcely understand myself as yet, but must
admit that I am more interested in Mr.Clifford than in any man I ever
met, and, as you said, I also have not reached my time of life without
knowing what this may lead to.You married mamma when she was younger
than I, and you, too, papa, were 'a comparatively poor man' at the time.I know all that wealth and
fashionable society can give me, and I tell you honestly, papa, I would
rather be the happy wife that Maggie Clifford is than marry any
millionaire in New York.There is no need, however, for such serious
talk, for there is nothing yet beyond congenial companionship, and--Well,"
she added, hastily, in memory of Amy, "I don't believe anything will come
of it.There will probably be two
married ladies in the party, and so I don't see that even mamma can
object.Best assured I shall never become engaged to any one without your
consent; that is," she added, with another of her irresistible caresses,
"unless you are very unreasonable, and I become very old.""Very well, Trurie, you shall go, with your mother's consent, and I think
I can insure that.As you say, you are no longer a child."And his
thought was, "I have seen enough of life to know that it is best not to
be too arbitrary in such matters."After a moment he added, gravely, "You
say you have thought.Think a great deal more before you take any steps
which may involve all your future."Burt was growing uneasy on the piazza, and feared that Miss Hargrove
might not obtain the consent that she had counted on so confidently.He
was a little surprised, also, to find how the glamour faded out of his
anticipations at the thought of her absence, but explained his feeling by
saying to himself, "She is so bright and full of life, and has so fine a
voice, that we should miss her sadly."He was greatly relieved,
therefore, when Mr.Hargrove came out and greeted him courteously.Gertrude had been rendered too conscious, by her recent interview, to
accompany her father, but she soon appeared, and no one could have
imagined that Burt was more to her than an agreeable acquaintance.Hargrove gave a reluctant consent, and it was soon settled that they
should try to get off on the afternoon of the following day.Burt also
included in the invitation young Fred Hargrove, and then drove away
elated.At the dinner-table he announced his success in procuring the tents, and
his intention of going for them in the afternoon.At the same time he
exhorted Leonard and Maggie to prepare provisions adequate to mountain
appetites, adding, "Webb, I suppose, will be too busy to do more than
join us at the last moment."Webb said nothing, but disappeared after dinner.As he was at supper as
usual, no questions were asked.Before it was light the next morning Amy
thought she heard steps on the stairs, and the rear hall-door shut
softly.When finally awaking, she was not sure but that her impression
was a dream.As she came down to breakfast Burt greeted her with dismay."The tents, that I put on the back piazza, are gone," he said.No one had seen him, and it was soon learned that a horse and a strong
wagon were also missing."Ah, Burt," cried Amy, laughing, "rest assured Webb has stolen a march on
you, and taken his own way of retaliation for what you said at the
dinner-table yesterday.I believe he
has chosen a camping-ground, and the tents are standing on it.""He should have remembered that others might have some choice in the
matter," was the discontented reply."If Webb has chosen the camping-ground, you will all be pleased with it,"
said his mother, quietly."I think he is merely trying to give a pleasant
surprise."He soon appeared, and explained that, with Lumley's help, he had made
some preparations, since any suitable place, with water near, from which
there was a fine outlook, would have seemed very rough and uninviting to
the ladies unless more work was done than could be accomplished in the
afternoon of their arrival."Now I think that is very thoughtful of you, Webb," said Amy."The steps
I heard last night were not a dream.At what unearthly hour did you
start?""Was I so heavy-footed as to disturb you?""Oh, no, Webb," she said, with a look of comic distress, in which there
was also a little reproach; "it's not your feet that disturb me, but your
head.You have stuffed it so full of learning that I am depressed by the
emptiness of mine."He laughed, as he replied, "I hope all your troubles may be quite as
imaginary."Then he told Leonard to spend the morning in helping Maggie,
who would know best what was needed for even mountain housekeeping, and
said that he would see to farm matters, and join them early in the
evening.The peaches were ripening, and Amy, from her window, saw that he
was taking from the trees all fit to market; also that Abram, under his
direction, was busy with the watering-cart."Words cannot impose upon
me," she thought, a little bitterly."He knows how I long for his
companionship, and it's not a little thing to be made to feel that I am
scarcely better qualified for it than Johnnie."Marvin's, who promised to join them, with his
wife, on the following day.He had a tent which he had occasionally used
in his ornithological pursuits.At two in the afternoon a merry party started for the hills.All the
vehicles on the farm had been impressed into the service to bring up the
party, with chairs, cooking-utensils, provisions, bedding, etc.When they
reached the ground that Webb had selected, even Burt admitted his pleased
surprise.The outlook over the distant river, and a wide area of country
dotted with villages, was superb, while to the camp a home-like look had
already been given, and the ladies, with many mental encomiums, saw how
secluded and inviting an aspect had been imparted to their especial
abode.As they came on the scene, Lumley was finishing the construction
of a dense screen of evergreen boughs, which surrounded the canvas to the
doorway.Not far away an iron pot was slung on a cross-stick in gypsy
style, and it was flanked by rock-work fireplaces which Maggie declared
were almost equal to a kitchen range.The men's tent was pitched at easy
calling distance, and, like that of the ladies, was surrounded by a thick
growth of trees, whose shade would be grateful.A little space had been
cleared between the two tents for a leaf-canopied dining-hall, and a
table of boards improvised.The ground, as far as possible, had been
cleared of loose stones and rubbish.Around the fireplace mossy rocks
abounded, and were well adapted for picturesque groupings.What touched
Amy most was a little flowerbed made of the rich black mould of decayed
leaves, in which were some of her favorite flowers, well watered.This
did not suggest indifference on the part of Webb.About fifty feet from
the tents the mountain shelf sloped off abruptly, and gave the
magnificent view that has been mentioned.Even Burt saw how much had been
gained by Webb's forethought, and frankly acknowledged it.As it was,
they had no more than time to complete the arrangements for the night
before the sun's level rays lighted up a scene that was full of joyous
activity and bustle.The children's happy voices made the echoes ring,
and Fred Hargrove, notwithstanding his city antecedents, yielded with
delight to the love of primitive life that exists in every boy's heart.Although he was a few years older than Alf, they had become friendly
rivals as incipient sportsmen and naturalists.Amy felt that she was
coming close to nature's heart, and the novelty of it all was scarcely
less exciting to her than to Johnnie.To little Ned it was a place of
wonder and enchantment, and he kept them all in a mild state of terror by
his exploring expeditions.At last his father threatened to take him
home, and, with this awful punishment before his eyes, he put his thumb
in his mouth, perched upon a rock, and philosophically watched the
preparations for supper.Maggie was the presiding genius of the occasion,
and looked like the light-hearted girl that Leonard had wooed more than a
dozen years before.She ordered him around, jested with him, and laughed
at him in such a piquant way that Burt declared she was proving herself
unfit for the duties of chaperon by getting up a flirtation with her
husband.Meanwhile, under her supervision, order was evoked from chaos,
and appetizing odors arose from the fireplace.Miss Hargrove admitted to herself that in all the past she had never
known such hours of keen enjoyment, and she was bent on proving that,
although a city-bred girl, she could take her part in the work as well as
in the fun.Nor were her spirits dampened by the fact that Burt was often
at her side, and that Amy did not appear to care.The latter, however,
was becoming aware of his deepening interesting in her brilliant friend.As yet she was not sure whether it was more than a good-natured and
hospitable effort to make one so recently a stranger at home with them,
or a new lapse on his part into a condition of ever-enduring love and
constancy--and the smile that followed the thought was not flattering to
Burt.A little before supper was ready Maggie asked him to get a pail of water."Come, Miss Gertrude," he said, "and I'll show you the Continental spring
at which the Revolutionary soldiers drank more than a hundred years ago;"
and she tripped away with him, nothing loth.As they reappeared, flushed
and laughing, carrying the pail between them, Amy trilled out,

"Jack and Jill came up the hill."A moment later, Webb followed them, on horseback, and was greeted with
acclamations and overwhelmed with compliments.Miss Hargrove was only too
glad of the diversion from herself, for Amy's words had made her absurdly
conscious for a society girl.Never had green corn, roasted in
its husks on the coals, tasted so delicious, and never before were
peaches and cream so ambrosial.Amy made it her care that poor Lumley
should feast also, but the smile with which she served him was the
sustenance he most craved.Then, as the evening breeze grew chilly, and
the night darkened, lanterns were hung in the trees, the fire was
replenished, and they sat down, the merriest of merry parties.Even Webb
had vowed that he would ignore the past and the future, and make the most
of that camp-fire by the wayside of life.It must be admitted, however,
that his discovery of Burt and Miss Hargrove alone at the spring had much
to do with his resolution.Stories and songs succeeded each other, until
Ned was asleep in Maggie's arms, and Johnnie nodding at her side.In
reaction from the excitements and fatigues of the day, they all early
sought the rest which is never found in such perfection as in a mountain
camp.Hemlock boughs formed the mattresses on which their blankets were
spread, and soon there were no sounds except the strident chirpings of
insects and the calls of night-birds.There was one perturbed spirit, however, and at last Burt stole out and
sat by the dying fire.When the mind is ready for impressions, a very
little thing will produce them vividly, and Amy's snatch of song about
"Jack and Jill" had awakened Burt at last to a consciousness that he
might be carrying his attention to Miss Hargrove too far, in view of his
vows and inexorable purpose of constancy.He assured himself that his
only object was to have a good time, and enjoy the charming society of
his new acquaintance.Of course, he was in love with Amy, and she was all
that he could desire.Girls
even like Amy were not so unsophisticated as they appeared to be, and he
felt that he was profoundly experienced in such questions, if in nothing
else.and would she not be led, by his
evident admiration for Miss Hargrove, to believe that he was mercurial
and not to be depended upon?He had to admit to himself that some
experiences in the past had tended to give him this reputation."I was
only a boy then," he muttered, with a stern compression of the lips."I'll prove that I am a man now;" and having made this sublime
resolution, he slept the sleep of the just.All who have known the freshness, the elasticity, the mental and physical
vigor, with which one springs from a bed of boughs, will envy the camping
party's awakening on the following morning.Webb resolved to remain and
watch the drift of events, for he was growing almost feverish in his
impatience for more definite proof that his hopes were not groundless.But he was doomed to disappointment and increasing doubt.Burt began to
show himself a skilful diplomatist.He felt that, perhaps, he had checked
himself barely in time to retrieve his fortunes and character with Amy,
but he was too adroit to permit any marked change to appear in his manner
and action.He said to himself that he cordially liked and admired Miss
Hargrove, but he believed that she had enjoyed not a few flirtations, and
was not averse to the addition of another to the list.Even his
self-complacency had not led him to think that she regarded him in any
other light than that of a very agreeable and useful summer friend.He
had seen enough of society to be aware that such temporary friendships
often border closely on the sentimental, and yet with no apparent trace
remaining in after-years.To Amy, however, such affairs would not appear
in the same light as they might to Miss Hargrove, and he felt that he had
gone far enough.But not for the world would he be guilty of _gaucherie,_
of neglecting Miss Hargrove for ostentatious devotion to Amy.Indeed, he
was more pronounced in his admiration than ever, but in many little
unobtrusive ways he tried to prove to Amy that she had his deeper thoughts.She, however, was not at this time disposed to dwell upon the subject.His
manner merely tended to confirm the view that he, like herself, regarded
Miss Hargrove as a charming addition to their circle, and proposed that she
should enjoy herself thoroughly while with them.Amy also reproached
herself a little that she had doubted him so easily, and felt that he was
giving renewed proof of his good sense.He could be true to her, and yet be
most agreeable to her friend, and her former acquiescence in the future of
his planning remained undisturbed.Webb was more like the brother she
wished him to be than he had been for a long time.The little flowerbed was
an abiding reassurance, and so the present contained all that she desired.This was not true of either Webb or Miss Hargrove.The former, however,
did not lose heart.He thought he knew Burt too well to give up hope yet.The latter, with all her experience, was puzzled.She speedily became
conscious of the absence of a certain warmth and genuineness in Bart's
manner and words.The thermometer is not so sensitive to heat and cold as
the intuition of a girl like Miss Hargrove to the mental attitude of an
admirer, but no one could better hide her thoughts and feelings than she
when once upon her guard.CHAPTER XLIII

AN OLD TENEMENT


The few remaining days of August passed, and September came, bringing
little suggestion of autumn rains or coolness.Marvin had
joined them, and the former's interest in every wild creature of the
woods became infectious.Alf and Fred were his ardent disciples, and he
rarely found an indifferent listener in Amy.The heat of the day was
given up to reading and the fashioning of alpenstocks, and the mornings
and late afternoons to excursions.In one of these they had sat down to
rest near an immense decaying tree that was hollow in parts, and full of
holes from the topmost shattered branches to the ground."That," said the doctor, "might fitly be called an old tenement-house.You have no idea how many and various creatures may have found a home in
it."He was immediately urged to enumerate its possible inhabitants in the
past, present, and future.The doctor, pleased with the conceit of regarding the decaying tree in
this light, began with animation: "All three of the squirrels of this
region have undoubtedly dwelt in it.I scarcely need do more than mention
the well-known saucy red or fox squirrel, whose delight is mischief.By
the way, we have at home two tame robins that before they could fly were
tumbled out of their nest by one of these ruthless practical jokers.The
birds come in and out of the house like members of the family.The
graceful gray squirrel is scarcely less familiar than the red one.He
makes a lively pet, and we have all seen him turning the wheel attached
to his cage.The curious little flying-squirrel, however, is a stranger
even to those to whom he may be a near neighbor, for the reason that his
habits are chiefly nocturnal.He ventures out occasionally on a cloudy
day, but is shy and retiring.Thoreau relates an interesting experience
with one.He captured it in a decayed hemlock stump, wherein it had a
little nest of leaves, bits of bark, and pine needles.It bit viciously
at first, and uttered a few 'dry shrieks,' but he carried it home.After
it had been in his room a few hours it reluctantly allowed its soft fur
to be stroked.He says it had'very large, prominent black eyes, which
gave it an innocent look.In color it was a chestnut ash, inclining to
fawn, slightly browned, and white beneath.tinged yellow, the upper dark, perhaps black.'He put it into a
barrel, and fed it with an apple and shag-bark hickory-nuts.The next
morning he carried it back and placed it on the stump from which it had
been taken, and it ran up a sapling, from which it skimmed away to a
large maple nine feet distant, whose trunk it struck about four feet from
the ground.This tree it ascended thirty feet on the opposite side from
Thoreau, then, coming into view, it eyed its quondam captor for a moment
or two, as much as to say 'good-by.'Then away it went, first raising its
head as if choosing its objective point.Thoreau says its progress is
more like that of a bird than he had been led to believe from naturalists'
accounts, or than he could have imagined possible in a quadruped.Its
flight was not a regular descent on a given line.It veered to right and
left, avoiding obstructions, passed between branches of trees, and flew
horizontally part of the way, landing on the ground at last, over fifty-one
feet from the foot of the tree from which it sprang.After its leap,
however, it cannot renew its impetus in the air, but must alight and start
again.It appears to sail and steer much like a hawk when the latter does
not flap its wings.The little striped chipmunk, no doubt, has heaped up
its store of nuts in the hole there that opens from the ground into the
tree, and the pretty white-footed mouse, with its large eyes and ears, has
had its apartment in the decayed recesses that exist in the worm-eaten
roots."Opossums and raccoons are well-known denizens of trees, and both furnish
famous country sports, especially in the South.''Possum up de gum-tree,
cooney in de hollow,' is a line from a <DW64> ditty that touches a deep
chord in the African heart.The former is found not infrequently in this
region, but the Hudson seems to be the eastern boundary of its habitat.""I took two from a tree in one night," Burt remarked."The raccoon's haunts, however, extend far to the northward, and it is
abundant in the regions bordering on the Adirondacks, though not common
in the dense pine woods of the interior.They are omnivorous creatures,
and often rob nests of eggs and young birds, for they are expert
climbers.They are fond of nuts and fruits, and especially of corn when
in the condition of a milky pulp.They are
also eager fishermen, although they are unable to pursue their prey under
water like the otter and mink.They like to play in shallows, and leave
no stone unturned in the hope of finding a crawfish under it.If fish have
been left in land-locked pools, they are soon devoured.'<DW53>-hunting by
the light of the harvest-moon has long been one of the most noted of rural
sports.During this month the corn kernels are in the most toothsome state
for the '<DW53> bill of fare, and there are few fields near forests where
they will not be marauding to-night, for they are essentially night
prowlers.A '<DW53> hunt usually takes place near midnight.Men, with dogs
trained to the sport, will repair to a cornfield known to be infested.The
feasters are soon tracked and treed, then shot, or else the tree is felled,
when such a snarling fight ensues as creates no little excitement.No
matter how plucky a cur may be, he finds his match in an old '<DW53>, and
often carries the scars of combat to his dying day."If taken when young, raccoons make amusing pets, and become attached to
their masters, but they cannot be allowed at large, for they are as
mischievous as monkeys.Their curiosity is boundless, and they will pry
into everything within reach.Anything, to be beyond their reach, must be
under lock and key.They use their forepaws as hands, and will unlatch a
door with ease, and soon learn to turn a knob.Alf there could not begin
to ravage a pantry like a tame '<DW53>.They will devour honey, molasses,
sugar, pies, cake, bread, butter, milk--anything edible.They will
uncover preserve-jars as if Mrs.Leonard had given them lessons, and with
the certainty of a toper uncork a bottle and get drunk on its contents.""No pet '<DW53>s, Alf, if you please," said his mother."Raccoons share with Reynard his reputation for cunning," the doctor
resumed, "and deserve it, but they do not use this trait for
self-preservation.They are not suspicious of unusual objects, and,
unlike a fox, are easily trapped.They hibernate during the coldest part
of the winter, reappearing in the latter part of February or March.They
are fond of little excursions, and usually travel in small family
parties, taking refuge in hollow trees about daylight.They make their
home high up, and prefer a hollow limb to the trunk of a tree.Some of
those half-decayed limbs yonder would just suit them.They have their
young in April--from four to six--and these little '<DW53>s remain with the
mother a year.While young they are fair eating, but grow tough and rank
with age."Two other interesting animals may have lived in that tree, the least
weasel and his sanguinary cousin the ermine, or large weasel.Both are
brown, after the snow finally disappears, and both turn white with the
first snowstorm.""Now you are romancing, doctor," cried Miss Hargrove."Yes," added Leonard, "tell us that you have caught a weasel asleep, and
we will, at least, look credulous; but this turning white with the first
snow, and brown as soon as the snow is gone, is a little off color.""It's true, nevertheless," maintained the doctor, "although I have seen
no satisfactory explanation of the changes.They not only make their
nests in hollow trees, but in the sides of banks.Were it not for its
habit of destroying the eggs and young of birds, the least weasel might
be regarded as a wholly useful creature, for it devours innumerable mice,
moles, shrews, and insects, and does not attack larger animals or
poultry.It is so exceedingly lithe and slender that its prey has no
chance to escape.Where a mouse or a mole can go it can go also, and if
outrun in the field, it follows the scent of its game like a hound, and
is as relentless as fate in its pursuit.They are not very shy, and
curiosity speedily overcomes their timidity.Sit down quietly, and they
will investigate you with intense interest, and will even approach rather
near in order to see better.Merriam describes one as standing
bolt-upright, and eying him, with its head bent at right angles to its
slender body.After a brief retreat it made many partial advances toward
him, meanwhile constantly sniffing the air in his direction.Merriam would have liked to know the weasel's opinion.They
have two or three litters a year, and the nest is made of dry leaves and
herbage.The mother weasel will defend her young at any cost, and never
hesitates to sacrifice her life in their behalf.She will fasten herself
by her sharp teeth to the nose of a dog, and teach him that weasel-hunting
has some drawbacks."In its next of kin, the ermine, or large weasel, we have perhaps the
most cruel and bloodthirsty animal in existence.It is among mammals what
the butcher-bird is among the feathered tribes--an assassin, a beautiful
fiend.It would seem that nature reproduces among animals and plants
every phase of human character.Was it Nero or Caligula who said, 'Oh,
that Rome had but one neck, that I might sever it?'Such is the spirit
that animates the ermine.Its instinct to kill is so strong that, were it
possible, it would destroy the means of its subsistence.It would leave
none of its varied prey alive.The lion and even the man-eating tiger,
when gorged, are inert and quiet.They kill no more than they want for a
meal; but the ermine will attack a poultry-yard, satiate itself with the
brains of the fowls or by sucking their blood, and then, out of 'pure
cussedness,' will kill all the rest within reach.Fifty chickens have
been destroyed in a night by one of these remorseless little beasts.It
makes fearful ravages among grouse, rabbits, and hares.It is the
mythical vampire embodied.It is not very much larger than the least
weasel, and has the same long, lithe, slender body and neck.A gray
squirrel would look bulky beside one, but in indomitable courage and
pitiless ferocity I do not think it has an equal.Only a lack of material
or bodily fatigue suspends its bloody work, and its life is one long
career of carnage.It has a terrific set of teeth, which are worked by
most powerful muscles.Coues, an eminent naturalist, has given a
graphic account of him.His words, as I remember them, are a true
portrait of a murderer.'His forehead is low, and nose sharp; his eyes
are small, penetrating, cunning, and glitter with an angry green light.His fierce face surmounts a body extraordinarily wiry, lithe, and
muscular, which ends in a singularly long, slender neck that can be
lifted at right angles with the body.When he is looking around, his neck
stretched up, his flat triangular head bent forward, swaying to and fro,
we have the image of a serpent.'"This is a true picture of the ermine when excited or angry; when at
rest, and in certain conditions of his fur, there are few more beautiful,
harmless, innocent-looking creatures.Let one of the animals on which he
preys approach, however, and instantly he becomes a demon.In the economy
of nature he often serves a very useful purpose.In many regions field
mice are destructive.A rat will fight
a man, if cornered, but it gives up at once in abject terror when
confronted by the large weasel.This arch-enemy has a pride in his
hunting, and when taking up his quarters in a barn will collect in one
place all the rats and mice he kills.Sometimes a hundred or more have
been found together as the result of two or three nights' work.The
ermine hunts, however, both by day and night, and climbs trees with great
facility.He is by no means shy, and one has been known to try to kill
chickens in a coop when a man was standing near him.Hunger was not his
motive, for he had destroyed dozens of fowls the night before.The ermine
has been used successfully as a ferret.Having first filed the creature's
teeth down, so that it could not kill the game, a gentleman secured
twelve live rabbits in one forenoon."But it's getting late, and time we started tentward, and yet I'm not
through even the list of quadrupeds that may have dwelt in our old
tenement.There are four species of bats to be mentioned, besides moles
and shrews, that would burrow in its roots if they are as hollow as the
branches.There are thirteen species of birds, including several very
interesting families of woodpeckers, that would live in a tree like that,
not to speak of tree-toads, salamanders, brown tree-lizards, insects and
slugs innumerable, and black-snakes--"

"Snakes?"I once put my hand in a hole for high-holders' eggs, and a
big black-snake ran down my back, but not inside of my coat, however.""Please say nothing more about snakes," cried Amy; and she rose
decisively, adding, in a low tone: "Come, Gertrude, let us go.The
tenants of the old tree that we've heard about may be very interesting to
naturalists, but some of them are no more to my taste than the people in
the slums of London.""You have made our blood run cold with horrors--an agreeable sensation,
however, to-day," said Burt, also rising."Your ermine out-Herods Herod.By the way, is not the fur of this pitiless beast worn by the highest
dignitaries of the legal profession?"CHAPTER XLIV

"BUT HE RISKED HIS LIFE?"The days passed, and the novelty of their mountain life began to wane a
little.There were agreeable episodes, as, for instance, visits from Mr.Barkdale, who were entertained
in royal style; but, after all, the camping experience was not,
apparently, fulfilling the hopes of two of the party.Webb's doubt and
suspense had only been increased, and Miss Hargrove was compelled to
admit to herself that her father's fears were not groundless.She was the
life of the party, and yet she was not at rest.Even in her dreams there
was a minor key of trouble and dread.The past few weeks were bringing a
revelation.She had read novels innumerable; she had received tender
confidences from friends.Love had been declared to her, and she had seen
its eloquent pleading in more than one face; but she acknowledged that
she had never known the meaning of the word until, without her volition,
her own heart revealed to her the mystery.Reason and will might control
her action, but she could no more divert her thoughts from Burt Clifford
than a flower can turn from the sun.She wondered at herself, and was
troubled.She had supposed that the training of society had brought her
perfect self-possession, and she had looked forward to a match, when she
was ready for one, in which the pros and cons should be weighed with
diplomatic nicety; but now that her heart was touched she learned that
nature is supreme, and her whole being revolted at such a union as she
had contemplated.She saw the basis of true marriage--the glad consent of
body and soul, and not a calculation.She watched Maggie closely, and saw
that her life was happy and rounded out in spite of her many cares.It
was not such a life as she would choose in its detail, and yet it was
infinitely better than that of many of her acquaintances.Burt was no
hero in her eyes, but he was immensely companionable, and it was a
companion, not a hero, or a man remote from her life and interests, that
she desired.He was refined and intelligent, if not learned; low, mean
traits were conspicuously absent; but, above and beyond all, his mirthful
blue eyes, and spirited ways and words, set all her nerves tingling with
a delicious exhilaration which she could neither analyze nor control.In
brief, the time that her father foresaw had come; the man had appeared
who could do more than amuse; her whole nature had made its choice.She
could go back to the city, and still in semblance be the beautiful and
brilliant girl that she had been; but she knew that in all the future few
waking hours would pass without her thoughts reverting to that little
mountain terrace, its gleaming canvas, its gypsy-like fire, with a tall,
lithe form often reclining at her feet beside it.Would the future bring more than regretful memories?As time passed, she
feared not.As Burt grew conscious of himself, his pride was deeply touched.He knew
that he had been greatly fascinated by Miss Hargrove, and, what was
worse, her power had not declined after he had awakened to his danger;
but he felt that Amy and all the family would despise him--indeed, that
he would despise himself--should he so speedily transfer his allegiance;
and under the spur of this dread he made especial, though very
unobtrusive, efforts to prove his loyalty to Amy.Therefore Webb had
grown despondent, and his absences from the camp were longer and more
frequent He pleaded the work of the farm, and the necessity of coping
with the fearful drought, so plausibly that Amy felt that she could not
complain, but, after all, there was a low voice of protest in her heart."It's the old trouble," she thought."The farm interests him far more
than I ever can, and even when here his mind is absent."Thus it may be seen that Nature, to whom they had gone, was not only busy
with the mountain and its life, but that her silent forces were also at
work in those whose unperverted hearts were not beyond her power.But there are dark mysteries in Nature, and some of her creations appear
to be visible and concentrated evil.The camping party came very near
breaking up in a horrible tragedy.The day was growing warm, and they
were returning from a rather extended excursion, straggling along a steep
wood road that was partially overgrown with bushes.Burt had been a
little more attentive to Miss Hargrove than usual, but was now at Amy's
side with his ready laugh and jest.Marvin was in the rear, peering
about, as usual, for some object of interest to a naturalist.Miss
Hargrove, so far from succumbing to the increasing heat, was reluctant to
return, and seemed possessed with what might be almost termed a nervous
activity.She had been the most indefatigable climber of the party, and
on their return had often diverged from the path to gather a fern or some
other sylvan trifle.At one point the ascending path formed an angle with
a ledge of rock that made a little platform.At the further end of this
she saw a flower, and she went to get it.A moment or two later Burt and
Amy heard her scream, and the sound of her voice seemed almost beneath
them.Grasping his alpenstock firmly, Burt sprang through the intervening
copsewood, and witnessed a scene that he never forgot, though he paused
not a second in his horror.Even as he rushed toward her a huge
rattlesnake was sending forth the "long, loud, stinging whir" which, as
Dr.Holmes says, is "the dreadful sound that nothing which breathes can
hear unmoved."Miss Hargrove was looking down upon it, stupefied,
paralyzed with terror.Already the reptile was coiling its thick body for
the deadly stroke, when Burt's stock fell upon its neck and laid it
writhing at the girl's feet.With a flying leap from the rock above he
landed on the venomous head, and crushed it with his heel.He had
scarcely time to catch Miss Hargrove, when she became apparently a
lifeless burden in his arms.Marvin now reached him, and after a glance at the scene exclaimed,
"Great God!"No; but let us get away from here.Where there's one of these devils
there is usually another not far off;" and they carried the unconscious
girl swiftly toward the camp, which fortunately was not far away, all the
others following with dread and anxiety in their faces.Marvin's and Maggie's efforts soon revived Miss Hargrove, but she had
evidently received a very severe nervous shock.When at last Burt was
permitted to see her, she gave him her hand with such a look of gratitude,
and something more, which she could not then disguise, that his heart began
to beat strangely fast.He was so confused that he could only stammer some
incoherent words of congratulation; but he half-consciously gave her hand a
pressure that left the most delicious pain the young girl had ever known.He was deeply excited, for he had taken a tremendous risk in springing upon
a creature that can strike its crooked fangs through the thick leather of a
boot, as a New York physician once learned at the cost of his life, when he
carelessly sought to rouse with his foot a caged reptile of this kind.Miss Hargrove had ceased to be a charming summer acquaintance to Burt.She was the woman at whose side he had stood in the presence of death.Before their midday repast was ready a rumble of wagons was heard coming
up the mountain, and Webb soon appeared."The barometer is falling
rapidly," he said, "and father agrees with me that it will be safer for
you all to return at once."He found ready acquiescence, for after the event of the morning the
ladies were in haste to depart.Lumley, who had come up with Webb, was
sent to take the rattles from the snake, and the men drew apart, with Alf
and Fred, to discuss the adventure, for it was tacitly agreed that it
would be unwise to talk about snakes to those whose nerves were already
unstrung at the thought of such fearful neighbors.Marvin would have
gone with Lumley had not his wife interposed.As it was, he had much to
say concerning the habits and character of the reptiles, to which the
boys listened with awe."By the way," he concluded, "I remember a passage
from that remarkable story, 'Elsie Venner,' by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in
which he gives the most vivid description of the rattlesnake I have ever
seen.One of his characters has two of them in a cage.'The expression of
the creatures,' he writes, 'was watchful, still, grave, passionless,
fate-like, suggesting a cold malignity which seemed to be waiting for its
opportunity.Their awful, deep-cut mouths were sternly closed over long,
hollow fangs, which rested their roots against the swollen poison-gland
where the venom had been hoarded up ever since the last stroke had
emptied it.They never winked, for ophidians have no movable eyelids, but
kept up an awful fixed stare.Their eyes did not flash, but shone with a
cold, still light.They were of a pale golden color, horrible to look
into, with their stony calmness, their pitiless indifference, hardly
enlivened by the almost imperceptible vertical slit of the pupil, through
which Death seemed to be looking out, like the archer behind the long,
narrow loophole in a blank turret wall.'The description is superb, and
impressed itself so deeply on my mind that I can always recall it."The ladies now joined them at dinner--the last at their rustic board.Miss Hargrove was very pale, but she was a spirited girl, and was bent on
proving that there was nothing weak or hysterical in her nature.Neither
was there the flippancy that a shallow woman might have manifested.She
acted like a brave, well-bred lady, whose innate refinement and good
sense enabled her speedily to regain her poise, and take her natural
place among her friends.They all tried to be considerate, and Amy's
solicitude did not indicate the jealousy that her friend almost expected
to see.Before they had finished their repast an east wind was moaning and
sighing in the trees, and a thin scud of clouds overcasting the sky.They
were soon in the haste and bustle of departure.Miss Hargrove found an
opportunity, however, to draw Dr.Marvin aside, and asked, hesitatingly,

"If Burt--if Mr.Clifford had missed his aim when he sprang upon the
snake, what would have happened?""You had better not dwell on that scene for the present, Miss Hargrove.""But I wish to know," she said, decisively."I am not a child, and I
think I have a right to know.""Well," said the doctor, gravely, "you are brave about it, and may as
well know the truth.Indeed, a little thought would soon make it clear to
you that if he had struck the body of the snake and left its head free,
it would have bitten him."She drew a long breath, and said, "I thought as much"; then added, in a
low tone, "Would it have been death?""Not necessarily; but only the most vigorous treatment could have saved
him.""Certainly; but a brave man could scarcely have acted otherwise.The
snake was at your very feet.""Thank you," she said, simply, and there was a very gentle expression in
her eyes.Much of the work of breaking up was left to Lumley, and an abundant
reward for his labor.He had returned with an exultant grin, but at a
sign from Dr.As soon as he had a chance,
however, he gave Burt two rattles, one having twelve and the other
fourteen joints, thus proving the fear, that the mate of the snake first
killed was not far off, to be well grounded.At the foot of the mountain
they met Mr.He explained that his barometer
and the indications of a storm had alarmed him also, and that he had come
for his daughter and Fred.Nothing was said of Miss Hargrove's recent
peril in the brief, cordial parting.Her eyes and Burt's met almost
involuntarily as she was driven away, and he was deeply perturbed.The face of Nature was also clouding fast, and she was sighing and
moaning as if she, too, dreaded the immediate future.CHAPTER XLV

SUMMER'S WEEPING FAREWELL


Nature was at last awakening from her long, deathlike repose with an
energy that was startling.The thin skirmish-line of vapor was followed
by cloudy squadrons, and before sunset great masses of mist were pouring
over Storm King, suggesting that the Atlantic had taken the drought in
hand, and meant to see what it could do.The wind mourned and shrieked
about the house, as if trouble, and not relief, were coming.In spite of
the young moon, the night grew intensely dark.The dash of rain was
expected every moment, but it did not come.Amy thought with a shudder of their desolate camping-ground.Time must
pass before pleasant associations could be connected with it.The intense
darkness, the rush and roar of the coming storm, the agony, the death
that might have occurred there, were now uppermost in her mind.She had
found an opportunity to ask Webb questions similar to those of Miss
Hargrove, and he had given Burt full credit for taking a fearful risk.A
woman loves courage in the abstract, and when it is shown in behalf of
herself or those whom she loves, he who has manifested it became heroic.But her homage troubled Burt, who was all at sea, uncertain of himself,
of the future, of almost everything, but not quite uncertain as to Miss
Hargrove.There was something in her look when they first met after their
common peril that went straight to his deepest consciousness.He had
before received, with not a little complacency, glances of preference,
but none like that, in which a glimpse of feeling, deep and strong, had
been revealed in a moment of weakness.The thought of it moved him far
more profoundly than the remembrance of his danger.Indeed, he scarcely
thought of that, except as it was associated with a girl who now might
have been dead or dying, and who, by a glance, had seemed to say, "What
you saved is yours."If this were true it was indeed a priceless, overwhelming gift, and he
was terrified at himself as he found how his whole nature was responding.He also knew that it was not in his frank, impetuous spirit to disguise
deep feeling.Should Miss Hargrove control his heart, he feared that all
would eventually know it, as they had speedily discovered his other
little affairs.And little, indeed, they now seemed to him, relating to
girls as immature as himself.Some had since married, others were
engaged, "and none ever lost their appetites," he concluded, with a grim
smile.But he could not thus dismiss the past so far as Amy was concerned, the
orphan girl in his own home to whom he had promised fealty.What would be
his feeling toward another man who had promised so much and had proved
fickle?What would the inmates of his own home say?What would even his
gentle mother, of whom he had made a confidante, think of him?Would not
a look of pain, or, even worse, of scorn, come into Amy's eyes?He did
love her dearly; he respected her still more as the embodiment of truth
and delicacy.From Miss Hargrove's manner he knew that Amy had never
gossiped about him, as he felt sure nine-tenths of his acquaintances
would have done.He also believed that she was taking him at his word,
like the rest of the family, and that she was looking forward to the
future that he had once so ardently desired.The past had taught him that
she was not one to fall tumultuously in love, but rather that she would
let a quiet and steady flame kindle in her heart, to last through life.She had proved herself above hasty and resentful jealousy, but she had,
nevertheless, warned him on the mountain, and had received the renewed
manifestations of his loyalty as a matter of course.Since his rescue of
her friend in the morning her eyes had often sought his with a lustre so
gentle and approving that he felt guilty, and cursed himself for a fickle
wretch.Cost him what it might, he must be true to her.She, little divining his tragic mood, which, with the whole force of his
will, he sought to disguise, gave him an affectionate good-night kiss as
she said, "Dear Burt, how happily the day has ended, after all!--and we
know the reason why.""Yes, Burt," added Webb; "no man ever did a braver thing."His father's hearty praise, and even his mother's grateful and almost
passionate embrace, only added to his deep unrest.As he went to his room
he groaned, "If they only knew!"After very little and troubled sleep he awoke on the following morning
depressed and exhausted.Mental distress was a new experience, and he
showed its effects; but he made light of it, as the result of
over-excitement and fatigue.He felt that Nature harmonized with his
mood, for he had scarcely ever looked upon a gloomier sky.Yet, strange
to say, no rain had fallen.It seemed as if the malign spell could not be
broken.The wind that had been whirling the dust in clouds all night long
grew fitful, and died utterly away, while the parched earth and withered
herbage appeared to look at the mocking clouds in mute, despairing
appeal.How could they be so near, so heavy, and yet no rain?The air was
sultry and lifeless.Fall had come, but no autumn days as yet.Clifford looked often at the black, lowering sky, and
predicted that a decided change was at hand."My fear is," he added, "that the drought may be followed by a deluge.I
don't like the looks of the clouds in the southeast."Even as he spoke a gleam of lightning shot athwart them, and was soon
followed by a heavy rumble of thunder.It seemed that the electricity,
or, rather, the concussion of the air, precipitated the dense vapor into
water, for within a few moments down came the rain in torrents.As the
first great drops struck the roads the dust flew up as if smitten by a
blow, and then, with scarcely any interval, the gutters and every incline
were full of tawny rills, that swelled and grew with hoarser and deeper
murmurs, until they combined in one continuous roar with the downfall
from clouds that seemed scarcely able to lift themselves above the
tree-tops.The lightning was not vivid, but often illumined the obscurity
with a momentary dull red glow, and thunder muttered and growled in the
distance almost without cessation.To Amy its gloomy, portentous ending was
even more so.The arid noonday heat and glare of preceding days had given
place to a twilight so unnatural that it had almost the awe-inspiring
effect of an eclipse.The hitherto brazen sky seemed to have become an
overhanging reservoir from which poured a vertical cataract.The clouds
drooped so heavily, and were so black, that they gave an impression of
impending solid masses that might fall at any moment with crushing
weight.Within an hour the beds of streams long dry were full and
overflowing.In spite of remonstrances Webb put on a rubber suit, and went to look
after some little bridges on the place.He soon returned, and said, "If
this keeps up until morning, there will be a dozen bridges lacking in our
region.I've tried to anchor some of our little affairs by putting heavy
stones on them, so that the water will pass over instead of sweeping them
away.It makes one think that the flood was no myth."To the general relief, the rain slackened in the late afternoon, and soon
ceased.The threatening pall of clouds lifted a little, and in rocky
channels on the mountains the dull gleam of rushing water could be seen.From every side its voice was heard, the scale running up, from the
gurgle in the pipes connected with the roof, to the roar of the nearest
large stream.As the day advanced Burt had grown very restless.The long day of imprisonment had given time for thought, and a
review of the past novel and exciting experiences.She had not seen the
glances from Miss Hargrove which had suggested so much to Burt, but she
had long since perceived that her friend greatly enjoyed his society.Had
she loved him she would have seen far more.If this interest had been
shown in Webb, she would have understood herself and Miss Hargrove also
much better.Preoccupied as she was by her sense of loss and shortcoming
produced by Webb's apparent absorption in pursuits which she did not
share, the thought had repeatedly occurred to her that Miss Hargrove's
interest in Burt might be more than passing and friendly.If this were
true, she was sure the event of the preceding day must develop and deepen
it greatly.And now Burt's manner, his fits of absent-mindedness, during
which he stared at vacancy, awakened surmises also.she queried, and she resolved to find out."Burt," she said, arousing him from one of the lapses into deep thought
which alternated with his restless pacings and rather forced gayety, "it
has stopped raining.I think you ought to ride over and see how Gertrude
is."Do you truly think I ought to go?""Certainly, and it would be a favor to me also," she added.He looked at her searchingly for a moment, but there was nothing in her
friendly expression to excite his fears."Very well," he tried to say quietly.A swift gallop would do
me good, I believe.""Of course it will, and so will a walk brighten me up.I'm going out to
see the brook.""Let me go with you," he exclaimed, with an eagerness too pronounced.I'd rather hear how Gertrude is;" and she went to her room
to prepare for her walk, smiling a little bitterly as she mused: "I now
know where his thoughts were.Not only brother
Webb, but also lover Burt, has grown weary of me.I can't entertain
either of them through one rainy day."From her window she saw Burt
riding away with a promptness that brought again the smile rarely seen on
her fair features.In her light rubber suit, she started on her ramble,
her face almost as clouded as the sky.Another had been on the watch
also, and Webb soon joined her, with the question, "May I not go too?""Oh, I fear it will take too much of your time," she said, in tones that
were a little constrained.He, too, had been interpreting Burt, and
guessed his destination as he galloped away.His love for Amy was so deep
that in a generous impulse of self-forgetfulness he was sorry for her,
and sought to cheer her, and make what poor amends he could for Burt's
absence, and all that it foreboded."Since you don't say outright that I
can't go," he said, "I think I'll venture;" and then, in a quiet, genial
way, he began to talk about the storm and its effects.She would not have
believed that even remarkable weather could be made so interesting a
topic as it soon proved.Before long they stood upon the bank, and saw a
dark flood rushing by where but yesterday had trickled a little rill.Now
it would carry away horse and rider, should they attempt to ford it, and
the fields beyond were covered with water."I don't like these violent changes," said Amy."Tennyson's brook, that
'goes on forever,' is more to my taste than one like this, that almost
stops, and then breaks out into a passionate, reckless torrent.""It's the nature of this brook; you should not blame it," he answered."But see, it's falling rapidly already.""Oh, certainly; nothing lasts," and she turned away abruptly."You are mistaken, sister Amy," he replied, with strong, quiet emphasis.The early twilight deepened around them, and gloomy night came on apace,
but before Amy re-entered the house his unselfish efforts were rewarded.Burt's threatened disloyalty apparently had lost its depressing
influence.Some subtile reassuring power had been at work, and the clouds
passed from her face, if not from the sky.CHAPTER XLVI

FATHER AND DAUGHTER


That sombre day would ever be a memorable one to Miss Hargrove.Nature
seemed weeping passionately over the summer that had gone, with all its
wealth of beauty and life.She knew that her girlhood had gone with it.She had cautioned her brother to say nothing of her escape on the
previous day, for she was too unnerved to go over the scene again that
night, and meet her father's questioning eyes.She wanted to be alone
first and face the truth; and this she had done in no spirit of weak
self-deception.The shadow of the unknown had fallen upon her, and in its
cold gray light the glitter and tinsel of the world had faded, but
unselfish human love had grown more luminous.The imminence of death had
kindled rather than quenched it.It was seen to be something intrinsically
precious, something that might survive even the deadliest poison.Her father was disposed to regard Burt as one who looked upon life in the
light of a pleasure excursion, and who might never take it seriously.His
laugh hereafter could never be so light and careless to her but that,
like a minor key, would run the thought, "He risked his life for me; he
might have died for me."Her dark, full eyes, the warm blood that her thoughts brought into her
face even in the solitude of her chamber, did not belie her nature, which
was intense, and capable of a strong and an abiding passion when once
kindled.Hargrove had watched her with the deepest solicitude on her return,
and he felt rather than saw the change that had taken place in his idol.In the morning she was again
conscious of his half-questioning scrutiny, and when he went to his study
she followed, and told him what had occurred.He grew very pale, and drew
a long, deep breath.Then, as if mastered by a strong impulse, he clasped
her to his heart, and said, in trembling tones, "Oh, Trurie, if I had
lost you!""I fear you would have lost me, papa, had it not been for Mr.He paced the room for a few moments in agitation, and at last stopped
before her and said: "Perhaps in a sense I am to lose you after all."No, papa; he has only risked his life to save mine.""Do not think I underestimate his act, Trurie; but, believe me, if he
should speak now or soon, you are in no condition to answer him.""He did what any man would do for a woman in peril.He has no right to
claim such an immense reward.""Before I went to the mountains I said I was no longer a child; but I
was, compared with what I am now.It seems to me that feeling,
experience, more than years, measures our age.I am a woman to-day, one
who has been brought so near the future world that I have been taught how
to value what may be ours now.I have learned how to value you and your
unselfish love as I never did before.Clifford will not speak very
soon, if he ever does, and I have not yet decided upon my answer.Should
it be favorable, rest assured more than gratitude will prompt me; and
also be assured you would not lose me.Could I not be more to you were I
happy than if I went through life with the feeling that I had missed my
chance?""I fear your mother would never give her consent to so unworldly a
choice," he said, with a troubled brow."I've yet to be convinced that it would be such a choice.It's scarcely
unworldly to make the most and the best of the world one is in, and mamma
must permit me to judge for myself, as she chose for herself.I shall
never marry any one but a gentleman, and one who can give me a home.Have
I not a right to prefer a home to an establishment, papa?"He looked at her long and searchingly, and she met his scrutiny with a
grave and gentle dignity."I suppose we must submit to the inevitable,"
he said at last."It seems but the other day that you were a baby on my knee," he began,
sadly; "and now you are drifting far away.""No, papa, there shall be no drifting whatever.I shall marry, if ever,
one whom I have learned to love according to Nature's simple laws--one to
whom I can go without effort or calculation.I could give my heart, and
be made rich indeed by the gift.I couldn't invest it; and if I did, no
one would be more sorry than you in the end.""I should indeed be more than sorry if I ever saw you unhappy," he said,
after another thoughtful pause; then added, shaking his head, "I've seen
those who gave their hearts even more disappointed with life than those
who took counsel of prudence.""I shall take counsel of prudence, and of you too, papa.""I think it is as I feared--you have already given your heart."Before leaving him she pleaded: "Do not make much of
my danger to mamma.She is nervous, and not over-fond of the country at
best.You know that a good many people survive in the country," she
concluded, with a smile that was so winning and disarming that he shook
his head at her as he replied:

"Well, Trurie, I foresee what a lovingly obstinate little girl you are
likely to prove.I think I may as well tell you first as last that you
may count on me in all that is fairly rational.If, with my years and
experience, I can be so considerate, may I hope that you will be also?"Her answer was reassuring, and she went to tell her mother.Fred was quite as confidential with his mother as she with
her father, and the boy had been wild to horrify Mrs.Hargrove by an
account of his sister's adventure.The injunction laid upon him had been
only for the previous evening, and Gertrude found her mother almost
hysterical over the affair, and less inclined to commend Burt than to
blame him as the one who had led her daughter into such "wild,
harum-scarum experiences.""It's always the way," she exclaimed, "when one goes out of one's own
natural associations in life.""I've not been out of my natural associations," Gertrude answered, hotly."The Cliffords are as well-bred and respectable as we are;" and she went
to her room.It was a long, dismal day for her, but, as she had said to her father,
she would not permit herself to drift.Her nature was too positive for
idle, sentimental dreaming.Feeling that she was approaching one of the
crises of her life, she faced it resolutely and intelligently.She went
over the past weeks from the time she had first met Burt under the Gothic
willow arch, and tried to analyze not only the power he had over her, but
also the man himself."I have claimed to papa that I am a woman, and I
should act like one," she thought.Her interest
in Burt had been a purely natural growth, the unsought result of
association with one who had proved congenial.He was so handsome, so
companionable, so vital with spirit and mirthfulness, that his simple
presence was exhilarating, and he had won his influence like the sun in
spring-time.Had he the higher qualities of manhood, those that could
sustain her in the inevitable periods when life would be no laughing
matter?Could he meet the winter of life as well as the summer?She felt
that she scarcely knew him well enough to be sure of this, but she was
still sufficiently young and romantic to think, "If he should ever love
me as I can love him, I could bring out the qualities that papa fears are
lacking."His courage seemed an earnest of all that she could desire.Amy's feeling toward him, and the question whether he had ever regarded
her in another light than that of a sister, troubled her the most.Amy's
assurance of implicit trust, and her promise to deserve it, appeared to
stand directly in her path, and before that stormy day closed she had
reached the calmness of a fixed resolution."If Amy loves him, and he has
given her reason to do so, I shall not come between them, cost me what it
may.I'll do without happiness rather than snatch it from a friend who
has not only spoken her trust, but proved it."Therefore, although her heart gave a great bound as she saw Burt riding
toward the house in the late afternoon, she went to her father and said:
"Mr.I wish you would be present during his call."The young fellow was received cordially, and Mr.Hargrove acknowledged
his indebtedness so feelingly that Burt flushed like a girl, and was
greatly embarrassed.He soon recovered himself, however, and chatted in
his usual easy and spirited way.Before he left he asked, hesitatingly,
"Would you like a souvenir of our little episode yesterday?"and took
from his pocket the rattles of the snake he had killed."It was not a little episode," Gertrude replied, gravely."I shall indeed
value the gift, for it will remind me that I have a friend who did not
count the cost in trying to help me."Impetuous words rose to Burt's lips, but he checked them in time.Trembling for his resolutions, he soon took his departure, and rode
homeward in deeper disquiet than he had ever known.He gave Amy her
friend's messages, and he also, in spite of himself, afforded her a
clearer glimpse of what was passing in his mind than she had received
before."I might have learned to love him in time, I suppose," she
thought, bitterly, "but it's impossible now.I shall build my future on
no such uncertain foundation, and I shall punish him a little, too, for
it's time he had a lesson."CHAPTER XLVII

DISQUIET WITHIN AND WITHOUT


Amy would scarcely have been human had she felt otherwise, for it
appeared that Burt was in a fair way to inflict a slight that would touch
the pride of the gentlest nature.During her long residence abroad Amy
had in a general and unthinking way adopted some English ideas on the
subject of marriage.Burt had at first required what was unnatural and
repugnant, and she had resented the demand that she should pass from an
age and a state of feeling slightly removed from childhood to relations
for which she was not ready.When he had sensibly recognized his error,
and had appeared content to wait patiently and considerately, she had
tacitly assented to his hopes and those of his parents.Her love and
gratitude toward the latter influenced her powerfully, and she saw no
reason why she should disappoint them.But she was much too high-spirited
a girl to look with patience on any wavering in Burt.She had not set her
heart on him or sought to be more to him than to a brother, and if he
wished for more he must win and hold the right by undoubted loyalty.The
fact that Amy had been brought into the Clifford family as a daughter and
sister had not cheated Nature a moment, as both Burt and Webb had proved.She was not their sister, and had unconsciously evoked from each of the
young men a characteristic regard.He had to contend with a temperament not uncommon--one that renders its
possessor highly susceptible to the beauty and fascination of women.He
was as far removed from the male flirt genus as sincerity is from
falsehood; but his passion for Amy had been more like a manifestation of
a trait than a strong individual preference based on mutual fitness and
helpfulness.Miss Hargrove was more truly his counterpart.She could
supplement the weaknesses and defects of his character more successfully
than Amy, and in a vague way he felt this.With all the former's vivacity
there was much reserve strength and magnetism.She was unusually gifted
with will power, and having once gained an influence over a person, she
would have, as agents to maintain it, not only her beauty, but tact, keen
insight and a very quick intelligence.Although true herself, she was by
no means unsophisticated, and having once comprehended Burt's character,
she would have the power, possessed by few others, to make the most of
him.She would first attract unconsciously, like a
rare and beautiful flower, and the loveliness and fragrance of her life
would be undying.Burt had felt her charm, and responded most decisively;
but the tranquil regard of her unawakened heart had little power to
retain and deepen his feeling.She bloomed on at his side, sweet to him,
sweet to all.In Miss Hargrove's dark eyes lurked a stronger spell, and
he almost dared to believe that they had revealed to him a love of which
he began to think Amy was not capable.On the generous young fellow,
whose intentions were good, this fact would have very great influence,
and in preserving her supremacy Miss Hargrove would also be able to
employ not a little art and worldly wisdom.The events that are most desired do not always happen, however, and poor
Burt felt that he had involved himself in complications of which he saw
no solution; while Amy's purpose to give him "a lesson" promised anything
but relief.Her plan involved scarcely any change in her manner toward
him.She would simply act as if she believed all that he had said, and
take it for granted that his hopes for the future were unchanged.She
proposed, however, to maintain this attitude only long enough to teach
him that it is not wise, to say the least, to declare undying devotion
too often to different ladies.The weather during the night and early on the following morning was
puzzling.It might be that the storm was passing, and that the ragged
clouds which still darkened the sky were the rear-guard or the stragglers
that were following the sluggish advance of its main body; or it might be
that there was a partial break in Nature's forces, and that heavier
cloud-masses were still to come.Clifford inclined to the latter
view."Old Storm King is still shrouded," he said at the breakfast-table,
"and this heavy, sultry air does not indicate clearing weather."Nature seemed bent on repeating the
programme of the preceding day, with the purpose of showing how much more
she could do on the same line of action.There was no steady wind from
any quarter.Converging or conflicting currents in the upper air may have
brought heavy clouds together in the highlands to the southwest, for
although the rain began to fall heavily, it could not account for the
unprecedented rise of the streams.In little over an hour there was a
continuous roar of rushing water.Burt, restless and almost reckless,
went out to watch the floods.He soon returned to say that every bridge
on the place had gone, and that what had been dry and stony channels
twenty-four hours before were now filled with resistless torrents.Webb also put on his rubber suit, and they went down the main street
toward the landing.This road, as it descended through a deep valley to
the river, was bordered by a stream that drained for some miles the
northwestern <DW72> of the mountains.For weeks its rocky bed had been
dry; now it was filled with a river yellow as the Tiber.One of the main
bridges across it was gone, and half of the road in one place had been
scooped out and carried away by the furious waters.People were removing
their household goods out into the vertical deluge lest they and all they
had should be swept into the river by the torrent that was above their
doorsteps.The main steamboat wharf, at which the "Powell" had touched
but a few hours before, was scarcely passable with boats, so violent was
the current that poured over it.The rise had been so sudden that people
could scarcely realize it, and strange incidents had occurred.A horse
attached to a wagon had been standing in front of a store.A vivid flash
of lightning startled the animal, and he broke away, galloped up a side
street to the spot where the bridge had been, plunged in, was swept down,
and scarcely more than a minute had elapsed before he was back within a
rod or two of his starting-point, crushed and dead.He had noticed that Amy's eyes had followed him
wistfully, and almost reproachfully, as he went out.Nature's mood was
one to inspire awe, and something akin to dread, in even his own mind.She appeared to have lost or to have relaxed her hold upon her forces.It
seemed that the gathered stores of moisture from the dry, hot weeks of
evaporation were being thrown recklessly away, regardless of consequences.There was no apparent storm-centre, passing steadily to one quarter of the
heavens, but on all sides the lightning would leap from the clouds, while
mingling with the nearer and louder peals was the heavy and continuous
monotone from flashes below the horizon.He was glad he had returned, for he found Amy pale and nervous indeed.Johnnie had been almost crying with terror, and had tremblingly asked her
mother if Noah's flood could come again."If there was to be another flood,
grandpa would have been told to build an ark;" and this assurance had
appeared so obviously true that the child's fears were quieted.Even
Leonard's face was full of gloom and foreboding, when the children were
not present, as he looked out on flooded fields, and from much experience
estimated the possible injury to the farm and the town.They had attained a peace which was not
easily disturbed, and the old gentleman remarked: "I have seen a worse
storm even in this vicinity."But this deluge isn't over," was the reply."It seems a tremendous
reaction from the drought, and where it will end it is hard to tell,
unless this steady downpouring slackens soon."Leonard's fears were not realized, however.The unusual and tropical
manifestations of the storm at last ceased, and by night the rain fell
softly and gently, as if Nature were penitent over her wild passion.The
results of it, however, were left in all directions.Many roads were
impassable; scores of bridges were gone.The passengers from the evening
boats were landed on a wharf partially submerged, and some were taken in
boats to a point whence they could reach their carriages.In the elements' disquiet Burt had found an excuse for his own, and he
had remained out much of the day.He had not called on Miss Hargrove
again, but had ridden far enough to learn that the bridges in that
direction were safe.All the family had remonstrated with him for his
exposure, and Amy asked him, laughingly, if he had been "sitting on
bridges to keep them from floating away.""You are growing ironical," he answered for he was not in an amiable
mood, and he retired early.CHAPTER XLVIII

IDLEWILD


In the morning Nature appeared to have forgotten both her passion and her
penitence, and smiled serenely over the havoc she had made, as if it were
of no consequence.Amy said, "Let us take the strong rockaway, call for Miss Hargrove, and
visit some of the streams"; and she noted that Burt's assent was too
undemonstrative to be natural.Maggie decided to go also, and take the
children, while Leonard proposed to devote the day to repairing the
damage to the farm, his brothers promising to aid him in the afternoon.When at last the party left their carriage at one of the entrances of
Idlewild, the romantic glen made so famous by the poet Willis, a stranger
might have thought that he had never seen a group more in accord with the
open, genial sunshine.This would be true of Maggie and the children.They thought of that they saw, and uttered all their thoughts.The
solution of one of life's deep problems had come to Maggie, but not to
the others, and such is the nature of this problem that its solution can
usually be reached only by long and hidden processes.Not one of the four
young people was capable of a deliberately unfair policy; all, with the
exception of Amy, were conscious whither Nature was leading them, and she
had thoughts also of which she would not speak.There was no lack of
truth in the party, and yet circumstances had brought about a larger
degree of reticence than of frankness.To borrow an illustration from
Nature, who, after all, was to blame for what was developing in each
heart, a rapid growth of root was taking place, and the flower and fruit
would inevitably manifest themselves in time.Miss Hargrove naturally had
the best command over herself.She had taken her course, and would abide
by it, no matter what she might suffer.Burt had mentally set his teeth,
and resolved that he would be not only true to Amy, but also his old gay
self.Amy, however, was not to be
deceived, and her intuition made it clear that he was no longer her old
happy, contented comrade.But she was too proud to show that her pride
was wounded, and appeared to be her former self.Webb, as usual, was
quiet, observant, and not altogether hopeless.And so this merry party,
innocent, notwithstanding all their hidden thoughts about each other,
went down into the glen, and saw the torrent flashing where the sunlight
struck it through the overhanging foliage.Half-way down the ravine there
was a rocky, wooded plateau from which they had a view of the flood for
some distance, as it came plunging toward them with a force and volume
that appeared to threaten the solid foundations of the place on which
they stood.With a roar of baffled fury it sheered off to the left,
rushed down another deep descent, and disappeared from view.The scene
formed a strange blending of peace and beauty with wild, fierce movement
and uproar.From the foliage above and around them came a soft,
slumberous sound, evoked by the balmy wind that fanned their cheeks.The
ground and the surface of the torrent were flecked with waving, dancing
light and shade, as the sunlight filtered through innumerable leaves, on
some of which a faint tinge of red and gold was beginning to appear.Beneath and through all thundered a dark, resistless tide, fit emblem of
lawless passion that, unchanged, unrestrained by gentle influences,
pursues its downward course reckless of consequences.Although the volume
of water passing beneath their feet was still immense, it was evident
that it had been very much greater."I stood here yesterday afternoon,"
said Burt, "and then the sight was truly grand.""Why, it was raining hard in the afternoon!""Burt seemed even more perturbed than the weather yesterday," Amy
remarked, laughing.We were alarmed
about him, fearing lest he should be washed away, dissolved, or
something.""Do I seem utterly quenched this morning?"he asked, in a light vein, but
flushing deeply."Oh, no, not in the least, and yet it's strange, after so much cold water
has fallen on you.""One is not quenched by such trifles," he replied, a little coldly.They were about to turn away, when a figure sprang out upon a rock, far
up the stream, in the least accessible part of the glen.Alvord, as he stood with folded arms and looked down on
the flood that rushed by on either side of him.He had not seen them, and
no greeting was possible above the sound of the waters.Webb thought as
he carried little Ned up the steep path, "Perhaps, in the mad current, he
sees the counterpart of some period in his past."The bridge across the mouth of Idlewild Brook was gone, and they next
went to the landing.The main wharf was covered with large stones and
gravel, the debris of the flood that had poured over it from the adjacent
stream, whose natural outlet had been wholly inadequate.Then they drove
to the wild and beautiful Mountainville road, that follows the Moodna
Creek for a long distance.They could not proceed very far, however, for
they soon came to a place where a tiny brook had passed under a wooden
bridge.Now there was a great yawning chasm.Not only the bridge, but
tons of earth were gone.The Moodna Creek, that had almost ceased to flow
in the drought, had become a tawny river, and rushed by them with a
sullen roar, flanging over the tide was an old dead tree, on which was
perched a fish-hawk.Even while they were looking at him, and Burt was
wishing for his rifle, the bird swooped downward, plunged into the stream
with a splash, and rose with a fish in his talons.It was an admirable
exhibition of fearlessness and power, and Burt admitted that such a
sportsman deserved to live.CHAPTER XLIX

ECHOES OF A PAST STORM


Miss Hargrove returned to dine with them, and as they were lingering over
the dessert and coffee Webb remarked, "By the way, I think the poet
Willis has given an account of a similar, or even greater, deluge in this
region."He soon returned from the library, and read the following
extracts: "'I do not see in the Tribune or other daily papers any mention
of an event which occupies a whole column on the outside page of the
highest mountain above West Point.An avalanche of earth and stone, which
has seamed from summit to base the tall bluff that abuts upon the Hudson,
forming a column of news visible for twenty miles, has reported a deluge
we have had--a report a mile long, and much broader than Broadway.'"Clifford, "that's the flood of which I spoke
yesterday.It was very local, but was much worse than the one we have
just had.Willis
wrote a good deal about the affair in his letters from Idlewild.Webb, selecting here and there, continued to read: "'We have had a deluge
in the valley immediately around us--a deluge which is shown by the
overthrown farm buildings, the mills, dams, and bridges swept away, the
well-built roads cut into chasms, the destruction of horses and cattle,
and the imminent peril to life.It occurred on the evening of August 1,
and a walk to-day down the valley which forms the thoroughfare to
Cornwall Landing (or, rather, a scramble over its gulfs in the road, its
upset barns and sheds, its broken vehicles, drift lumber, rocks, and
rubbish) would impress a stranger like a walk after the deluge of Noah."'The flood came upon us with scarce half an hour's notice.My venerable
neighbor, of eighty years of age, who had passed his life here, and knows
well the workings of the clouds among the mountains, had dined with us,
but hastened his departure to get home before what looked like a shower,
crossing with his feeble steps the stream whose strongest bridge, an hour
after, was swept away.Another of our elderly neighbors had a much
narrower escape.The sudden rush of water alarmed him for the safety of
an old building he used for his stable, which stood upon the bank of the
small stream usually scarce noticeable as it crosses the street at the
landing.He had removed his horse, and returned to unloose a favorite
dog, but before he could accomplish it the building fell.The single jump
with which he endeavored to clear himself of the toppling rafters threw
him into the torrent, and he was swept headlong toward the gulf which it
had already torn in the wharf on the Hudson.His son and two others
plunged in, and succeeded in snatching him from destruction.Another
citizen was riding homeward, when the solid and strongly embanked road
was swept away before and behind him, and he had barely time to unhitch
his horse and escape, leaving his carriage islanded between the chasms.A
man who was driving with his wife and child along our own wall on the
river-shore had a yet more fearful escape: his horse suddenly forced to
swim, and his wagon set afloat, and carried so violently against a tree
by the swollen current of Idlewild Brook that he and his precious load
were thrown into the water, and with difficulty reached the bank beyond.A party of children who were out huckleberrying on the mountain were
separated from home by the swollen brook, and one of them was nearly
drowned in vainly attempting to cross it.Their parents and friends were
out all night in search of them.An aged farmer and his wife, who had
been to Newburgh, and were returning with their two-horse wagon well
laden with goods, attempted to drive over a bridge as it unsettled with
the current, and were precipitated headlong.The old man caught a sapling
as he went down with the flood, the old woman holding on to his
coat-skirts, and so they struggled until their cries brought assistance.'One large building was completely
disembowelled, and the stream coursed violently between the two halves of
its ruins.'I was stopped,' he writes in another place, 'as I scrambled
along the gorge, by a curious picture for the common highway.The brick
front of the basement of a dwelling-house had been torn off, and the
mistress of the house was on her hands and knees, with her head thrust in
from a rear window, apparently getting her first look down into the
desolated kitchen from which she had fled in the night.A man stood in
the middle of the floor, up to his knees in water, looking round in
dismay, though he had begun to pick up some of the overset chairs and
utensils.The fireplace, with its interrupted supper arrangements, the
dresser, with its plates and pans, its cups and saucers, the closets and
cupboards, with their various stores and provisions, were all laid open
to the road like a sliced watermelon.'""Well," ejaculated Leonard, "we haven't so much cause to complain, after
hearing of an affair like that.I do remember many of my impressions at
the time, now that the event is recalled so vividly, but have forgotten
how so sudden a flood was accounted for.""Willis speaks of it on another page," continued Webb, "as 'the
aggregation of extensive masses of clouds into what is sometimes called a
"waterspout," by the meeting of winds upon the converging edge of our
bowl of highlands.The storm for a whole country was thus concentrated.'I think there must have been yesterday a far heavier fall of water on the
mountains a little to the southeast than we had here.Perhaps the truer
explanation in both instances would be that the winds brought heavy
clouds together or against the mountains in such a way as to induce an
enormous precipitation of vapor into rain.Willis indicates by the
following passage the suddenness of the flood he describes: 'My first
intimation that there was anything uncommon in the brook was the sight of
a gentleman in a boat towing a cow across the meadow under our library
window--a green glade seldom or never flooded.The roar from the foaming
precipices in the glen had been heard by us all, but was thought to be
thunder.'Then he tells how he and his daughter put on their rubber suits
and hastened into the glen.'The chasm,' he writes, 'in which the brook,
in any freshet I had heretofore seen, was still only a deep-down stream,
now seemed too small for the torrent.Those giddy precipices on which the
sky seems to lean as you stand below were the foam-lashed sides of a full
and mighty river.The spray broke through the tops of the full-grown
willows and lindens.As the waves plunged against the cliffs they parted,
and disclosed the trunks and torn branches of the large trees they had
overwhelmed and were bearing away, and the earth- flood, in the
wider places, was a struggling mass of planks, timber, rocks, and
roots--tokens of a tumultuous ruin above, to which the thunder-shower
pouring around us gave but a feeble clew.A heavy-limbed willow, which
overhung a rock on which I had often sat to watch the freshets of spring,
rose up while we looked at it, and with a surging heave, as if lifted by
an earthquake, toppled back, and was swept rushingly away.'""How I would have liked to see it!""I can see it," said Amy, leaning back, and closing her eyes."I can see
it all too vividly.I don't like nature in such moods."Then she took up
the volume, and began turning the leaves, and said: "I've never seen this
book before.Why, it's all about this region, and written before I was
born.Oh dear, here is another chapter of horrors!"and she read: "Close
to our gate, at the door of one of our nearest and most valued
neighbors--a lovely girl was yesterday struck dead by lightning.A friend
who stood with her at the moment was a greater sufferer, in being
prostrated by the same flash, and paralyzed from the waist downward--her
life spared at the cost of tortures inexpressible.'"Webb reached out his hand to take the book from her, but she sprang
aloof, and with dilating eyes read further: "'Misa Gilmour had been
chatting with a handsome boy admirer, but left him to take aside a
confidential friend that she might read her a letter.It was from her
mother, a widow with this only daughter.They passed out of the gate,
crossed the road to be out of hearing, and stood under the telegraph
wire, when the letter was opened.Her lips were scarce parted to read
when the flash came--an arrow of intense light-' Oh, horrible!How can you blame me for fear in a thunderstorm?""Amy," said Webb, now quietly taking the book, "your dread at such times
is constitutional.If there were need, you could face danger as well as
any of us.You would have all a woman's fortitude, and that surpasses
ours.Take the world over, the danger from lightning is exceedingly
slight, and it's not the danger that makes you tremble, but your nervous
organization.""You interpret me kindly," she said, "but I don't see why nature is so
full of horrible things.If Gertrude had been bitten by the snake, she
might have fared even worse than the poor girl of whom I have read."Miss Hargrove could not forbear a swift, grateful glance at Burt."I do not think nature is _full_ of horrible things," Webb resumed."Remember how many showers have cooled the air and made the earth
beautiful and fruitful in this region.In no other instance that I know
anything about has life been destroyed in our vicinity.There is indeed a
side to nature that is full of mystery--the old dark mystery of evil; but
I should rather say it is full of all that is beautiful and helpful.At
least this seems true of our region.I have never seen so much beauty in
all my life as during the past year, simply because I am forming the
habit of looking for it.""Why, Webb," exclaimed Amy, laughing, "I thought your mind was
concentrating on crops and subjects as deep as the ocean.""It would take all the salt of the ocean to save that remark," he
replied; but he beat a rather hasty retreat.Clifford, "you may now dismiss your fears.I
imagine that in our tropical storm summer has passed; and with it
thunder-showers and sudden floods.We may now look forward to two months
of almost ideal weather, with now and then a day that will make a book
and a wood fire all the more alluring."The days passed like bright
smiles, in which, however, lurked the pensiveness of autumn.Slowly
failing maples glowed first with the hectic flush of disease, but
gradually warmer hues stole into the face of Nature, for it is the dying
of the leaves that causes the changes of color in the foliage.CHAPTER L

IMPULSES OF THE HEART


The fall season brought increased and varied labors on the farm and in the
garden.As soon as the ground was dry after the tremendous storm, and its
ravages had been repaired as far as possible, the plows were busy preparing
for winter grain, turnips were thinned out, winter cabbages and
cauliflowers cultivated, and the succulent and now rapidly growing celery
earthed up.The fields of corn were watched, and as fast as the kernels
within the husks--now becoming golden-hued--were glazed, the stalks were
cut and tied in compact shocks.The sooner maize is cut, after it has
sufficiently matured, the better, for the leaves make more nutritious
fodder if cured or dried while still full of sap.From some fields the
shocks were wholly removed, that the land might be plowed and seeded with
grain and grass.Buckwheat, used merely as a green and scavenger crop, was
plowed under as it came into blossom, and that which was sown to mature was
cut in the early morning, while the dew was still upon it, for in the heat
of the day the grain shells easily, and is lost.After drying for a few
days in compact little heaps it was ready for the threshing-machine.Then
the black, angular kernels--promises of many winter breakfasts--were spread
to dry on the barn floor, for if thrown into heaps or bins at this early
stage, they heat badly.The Cliffords had long since learned that the large late peaches, that
mature after the Southern crop is out of the market, are the most
profitable, and almost every day Abram took to the landing a load of
baskets full of downy beauties.An orange grove, with Its deep green
foliage and golden fruit, is beautiful indeed, but an orchard laden with
Crawford's Late, in their best development, can well sustain comparison.Sharing the honors and attention given to the peaches were the Bartlett
and other early pears.These latter fruits were treated in much the same
way as the former.The trees were picked over every few days, and the
largest and ripest specimens taken, their maturity being indicated by the
readiness of the stem to part from the spray when the pear is lifted.The
greener and imperfect fruit was left to develop, and the trees, relieved
of much of their burden, were able to concentrate their forces on what
was left.The earlier red grapes, including the Delaware, Brighton, and
Agawam, not only furnished the table abundantly, but also a large surplus
for market.Indeed, there was high and dainty feasting at the Cliffords'
every day--fruit everywhere, hanging temptingly within reach, with its
delicate bloom untouched, untarnished.The storm and the seasonable rains that followed soon restored its
fulness and beauty to Nature's withered face.The drought had brought to
vegetation partial rest and extension of root growth, and now, with the
abundance of moisture, there was almost a spring-like revival.The grass
sprang up afresh, meadows and fields grew green, and annual weeds, from
seeds that had matured in August, appeared by the million."I am glad to see them," Webb remarked."Before they can mature any seed
the frost will put an end to their career of mischief, and there will be
so many seeds less to grow next spring.""There'll be plenty left," Leonard replied.The Cliffords, by their provident system of culture, had prepared for
droughts as mariners do for storms, and hence they had not suffered so
greatly as others; but busy as they were kept by the autumnal bounty of
Nature, and the rewards of their own industry, they found time for
recreation, and thoughts far removed from the material questions of
profit and loss.The drama of life went on, and feeling, conviction, and
love matured like the ripening fruits, although not so openly.As soon as
his duties permitted, Burt took a rather abrupt departure for a hunting
expedition in the northern woods, and a day or two later Amy received a
note from Miss Hargrove, saying that she had accepted an invitation to
join a yachting party.she exclaimed, "I wish you were not so awfully busy all the
time.Here I am, thrown wholly on your tender mercies, and I am neither a
crop nor a scientific subject."The increasing coolness and
exhilarating vitality of the air made not only labor agreeable, but
out-door sports delightful, and he found time for an occasional gallop,
drive, or ramble along roads and lanes lined with golden-rod and purple
asters; and these recreations had no other drawback than the uncertainty
and anxiety within his heart.The season left nothing to be desired, but
the outer world, even in its perfection, is only an accompaniment of
human life, which is often in sad discord with it.Nature, however, is a harmony of many and varied strains, and the unhappy
are always conscious of a deep minor key even on the brightest days.To
Alf and Johnnie the fall brought unalloyed joy and promise; to those who
were older, something akin to melancholy, which deepened with the autumn
of their life; while to Mr.Alvord every breeze was a sigh, every rising
wind a mournful requiem, and every trace of change a reminder that his
spring and summer had passed forever, leaving only a harvest of bitter
memories.Far different was the dreamy pensiveness with which Mr.Clifford looked back upon their vanished youth and maturity.At the
same time they felt within themselves the beginnings of an immortal
youth.Although it was late autumn with them, not memory, but hope, was
in the ascendant.During damp or chilly days, and on the evenings of late September, the
fire burned cheerily on the hearth of their Franklin stove.The old
gentleman had a curious fancy in regard to his fire-wood.He did not want
the straight, shapely sticks from their mountain land, but gnarled and
crooked billets, cut from trees about the place that had required pruning
and removal."I have associations with such fuel" he said, "and can usually recall the
trees--many of which I planted--from which it came; and as I watch it
burn and turn into coals, I see pictures of what happened many years
ago."One evening he threw on the fire a worm-eaten billet, the sound part of
which was as red as mahogany; then drew Amy to him and said, "I once sat
with your father under the apple-tree of which that piece of wood was a
part, and I can see him now as he then looked."She sat down beside him, and said, softly, "Please tell me how he
looked."In simple words the old man portrayed the autumn day, the fruit as golden
as the sunshine, a strong, hopeful man, who had passed away in a
far-distant land, but who was still a living presence to both.Amy looked
at the picture in the flickering blaze until her eyes were blinded with
tears.But such drops fall on the heart like rain and dew, producing
richer and more beautiful life.The pomp and glory of October were ushered in by days of such surpassing
balminess and brightness that it was felt to be a sin to remain indoors.The grapes had attained their deepest purple, and the apples in the
orchard vied with the brilliant and varied hues of the fast-turning
foliage.The nights were soft, warm, and resonant with the unchecked
piping of insects.From every tree and shrub the katydids contradicted
one another with increasing emphasis, as if conscious that the time was
at hand when the last word must be spoken.The stars glimmered near
through a delicate haze, and in the western sky the pale crescent of the
moon was so inclined that the old Indian might have hung upon it his
powder-horn.On such an evening the young people from the Cliffords' had gathered on
Mr.Hargrove's piazza, and Amy and Gertrude were looking at the new moon
with silver in their pockets, each making her silent wish.Amy had to think before deciding what she wanted most, but
not Miss Hargrove.Her face has grown thinner and paler during the last
few weeks; there is unwonted brilliancy in her eyes to-night, but her
expression is resolute.Times of
weakness, if such they could be called, would come, but they should not
appear in Burt's or Amy's presence.The former had just returned, apparently gayer than ever.His face was
bronzed from his out-door life in the Adirondacks.Its expression was
also resolute, and his eyes turned oftenest toward Amy, with a determined
loyalty.As has been said, not long after the experiences following the
storm, he had yielded to his impulse to go away and recover his poise.He
felt that if he continued to see Miss Hargrove frequently he might reveal
a weakness which would lead not only Amy to despise him, but also Miss
Hargrove, should she become aware of the past.As he often took such
outings, the family, with the exception of Webb and Amy, thought nothing
of it.His brother and the girl he had wooed so passionately now
understood him well enough to surmise his motive, and Amy had thought,
"It will do him good to go away and think awhile, but it will make no
difference; this new affair must run its course also."And yet her heart
began to relent toward him after a sisterly fashion.She wondered if Miss
Hargrove did regard him as other than a friend to whom she owed very
much.If so, she smiled at the idea of standing in the way of their
mutual happiness.She had endured his absence with exceeding tranquillity,
for Webb had given her far more of his society, and she, Alf, and Johnnie
often went out and aided him in gathering the fruit.For some reason these
light tasks had been more replete with quiet enjoyment than deliberate
pleasure-seeking.Burt had been at pains to take, in Amy's presence, a most genial and
friendly leave of Miss Hargrove, but there was no trace of the lover in
his manner.His smiles and cordial words had chilled her heart, and had
strengthened the fear that in some way he was bound to Amy.She knew that
she had fascinated and perhaps touched him deeply, but imagined she saw
indications of an allegiance that gave little hope for the future.If he
felt as she did, and were free, he would not have gone away; and when he
had gone, time grew leaden-footed.Absence is the touchstone, and by its
test she knew that her father was right, and that she, to whom so much
love had been given unrequited, had bestowed hers apparently in like
manner.Then had come an invitation to join a yachting party to Fortress
Monroe, and she had eagerly accepted.With the half-reckless impulse of
pride, she had resolved to throw away the dream that had promised so
much, and yet had ended in such bitter and barren reality.She would
forget it all in one brief whirl of gayety; and she had been the
brilliant life of the party.But how often her laugh had ended in a
stifled sigh!How often her heart told her, "This is not happiness, and
never can be again!"Her brief experience of what is deep and genuine in
life taught her that she had outgrown certain pleasures of the past, as a
child outgrows its toys, and she had returned thoroughly convinced that
her remedy was not in the dissipations of society.The evening after her return Burt, with Webb and Amy, had come to call,
and as she looked upon him again she asked herself, in sadness, "Is there
any remedy?"She was not one to give her heart in a half-way manner.It seemed to her that he had been absent for years, and had grown
indefinitely remote.Never before had she gained the impression so
strongly that he was in some way bound to Amy, and would abide by his
choice.If this were true, she felt that the sooner she left the vicinity
the better, and even while she chatted lightly and genially she was
planning to induce her father to return to the city at an early date.Before parting, Amy spoke of her pleasure at the return of her friend,
who, she said, had been greatly missed, adding: "Now we shall make up for
lost time.The roads are in fine condition for horseback exercise,
nutting expeditions will soon be in order, and we have a bee-hunt on the
programme.""I congratulate you on your prospects," said Miss Hargrove."I wish I
could share in all your fun, but fear I shall soon return to the city."Burt felt a sudden chill at these words, and a shadow from them fell
across his face.Webb saw their effect, and he at once entered on a
rather new role for him."Then we must make the most of the time before
you go," he began."I propose we take advantage of this weather and drive
over to West Point, and lunch at Fort Putnam.""Why, Webb, what a burst of genius!"Let us go to-morrow for we can't count on such weather
long."The temptation was indeed strong, but she felt
it would not be wise to yield, and began, hesitatingly, "I fear my
engagements--" At this moment she caught a glimpse of Burt's face in a
mirror, and saw the look of disappointment which he could not disguise."If I return to the city soon," she resumed, "I ought to be at my
preparations.""Why, Gertrude," said Amy, "I almost feel as if you did not wish to go.I thought you were to remain in the country till
November.I have been planning so much that we could do together!""Surely, Miss Hargrove," added Burt, with a slight tremor in his voice,
"you cannot nip Webb's genius in the very bud.Such an expedition as he
proposes is an inspiration.""But you can do without me," she replied, smiling on him bewilderingly.It was a light arrow, but its aim was true.Never before had he so felt
the power of her beauty, the almost irresistible spell of her fascination.While her lips were smiling, there was an expression in her dark eyes that
made her words, so simple and natural in themselves, a searching question,
and he could not forbear saying, earnestly, "We should all enjoy the
excursion far more if you went with us.""Truly, Miss Hargrove," said Webb, "I shall be quenched if you decline,
and feel that I have none of the talent for which I was beginning to gain
a little credit.""I cannot resist such an appeal as that, Mr.Clifford," she said,
laughingly."I anticipate a marvellous day
to-morrow.Bring Fred also, and let us all vie with each other in
encouraging Webb.""Has that quiet Webb any scheme in his mind?"Miss Hargrove thought,
after they had gone."I wish that tomorrow might indeed be 'a marvellous
day' for us all."An affirmative
answer was slow in coming, though he thought long and late.CHAPTER LI

WEBB'S FATEFUL EXPEDITION


Mr.Hargrove had welcomed the invitation that took his daughter among
some of her former companions, hoping that a return to brilliant
fashionable life would prove to her that she could not give it up.It was
his wish that she should marry a wealthy man of the city.His wife did
not dream of any other future for her handsome child, and she looked
forward with no little complacency to the ordering of a new and elegant
establishment.At the dinner-table Gertrude had given a vivacious account of her
yachting experience, and all had appeared to promise well; but when she
went to the library to kiss her father good-night, he looked at her
inquiringly, and said, "You enjoyed every moment, I suppose?"She shook her head sadly, and, after a moment, said: "I fear I've grown
rather tired of that kind of thing.We made much effort to enjoy
ourselves.Is there not a happiness which comes without so much effort?""I'm sorry," he said, simply.Suppose I find more pleasure in staying with
you than in rushing around?""I think it would be less contrary to _my_ nature than forced gayety
among people I care nothing about."He smiled at her fondly, but admitted to himself that absence had
confirmed the impressions of the summer, instead of dissipating them, and
that if Burt became her suitor he would be accepted.When she looked out on the morning of the excursion to Fort Putnam it was
so radiant with light and beauty that hope sprang up within her heart.Disappointment that might last through life could not come on a day like
this.Silvery mists ascended from the river down among the Highlands.The
lawn and many of the fields were as green as they had been in June, and
on every side were trees like immense bouquets, so rich and varied was
their coloring.There was a dewy freshness in the air, a genial warmth in
the sunshine, a spring-like blue in the sky; and in these was no
suggestion that the November of her life was near."And yet it may be,"
she thought."I must soon face my fate, and I must be true to Amy."Hargrove regarded with discontent the prospect of another long
mountain expedition; but Fred, her idol, was wild for it, and in a day or
two he must return to school in the city, from which, at his earnest
plea, he had been absent too long already; so she smiled her farewell at
last upon the fateful excursion.He, with his sister, was soon at the Cliffords', and found the
rockaway--the strong old carryall with which Gertrude already had tender
associations--in readiness.Maggie had agreed to chaperon the party,
little Ned having been easily bribed to remain with his father.Miss Hargrove had looked wistfully at the Clifford mansion as she drew
near to it.Never had it appeared to her more home-like, with its
embowering trees and laden orchards.The bright hues of the foliage
suggested the hopes that centred there: the ocean, as she had seen
it--cold and gray under a clouded sky--was emblematic of life with no
fulfilment of those hopes.Clifford met her at the door, and
took her in to see the invalid, who greeted her almost as affectionately
as she would have welcomed Amy after absence, Miss Hargrove knew in the
depths of her heart how easily she could be at home there.Never did a pleasure-party start under brighter auspices.Clifford came out, on her husband's arm, to wave them a farewell.The young men had their alpenstocks, for it was their intention to walk
up the steep places.Webb was about to take Alf and Johnnie on the front
seat with him, when Amy exclaimed: "I'm going to drive, Mr.Johnnie
can sit between us, and keep me company when you are walking.You needn't
think that because you are the brilliant author of this expedition you
are going to have everything your own way."Indeed, not a little guile lurked behind her laughing eyes, which ever
kept Webb in perplexity--though he looked into them so often--as to
whether they were blue or gray.Miss Hargrove demurely took her seat with
Maggie, and Burt had the two boys with him.Fred had brought his gun, and
was vigilant for game now that the "law was up."They soon reached the foot of the mountain, and there was a general
unloading, for at first every one wished to walk.Maggie good-naturedly
climbed around to the front seat and took the reins, remarking that she
would soon have plenty of company again.Burt had not recognized Amy's tactics, nor did he at once second them,
even unconsciously.His long ruminations had led to the only possible
conclusion--the words he had spoken must be made good.Pride and honor
permitted no other course.Therefore he proposed to-day to be ubiquitous,
and as gallant to Maggie as to the younger ladies.When Miss Hargrove
returned to the city he would quietly prove his loyalty.Never before had
he appeared in such spirits; never so inexorably resolute.He recalled
Amy's incredulous laugh at his protestation of constancy, and felt that
he could never look her in the face if he faltered.It was known that
Miss Hargrove had received much attention, and her interest in him would
be likely to disappear at once should she learn of his declaration of
undying devotion to another but a few months before.He anathematized
himself, but determined that his weakness should remain unknown.It was
evident that Amy had been a little jealous, but probably that she did not
yet care enough for him to be very sensitive on the subject.He had pledged himself to wait until she did care.Miss Hargrove should be made
to believe that she had added much to the pleasure of the excursion, and
there he would stop.And Burt on his mettle was no bungler.The test
would come in his staying powers.Webb, however, was quietly serene.He had not watched and thought so long
in vain.He had seen Burt's expression the evening before, and knew that
a wakeful night had followed.His own feeling had taught him a
clairvoyance which enabled him to divine not a little of what was passing
in his brother's mind and that of Miss Hargrove.Her frank, sisterly affection was not love, and might never
become love.One of the objects of the expedition was to obtain an abundant supply of
autumn leaves and ferns for pressing."I intend to make the old house
look like a bower this winter," Amy remarked."That would be impossible with our city home," Miss Hargrove said, "and
mamma would not hear of such an attempt.But I can do as I please in my
own room, and shall gather my country _souvenirs_ to-day."The idea of decorating her apartment with feathery ferns and bright-hued
leaves took a strong hold upon her fancy, for she hoped that Burt would
aid her in making the collection.Nor was she disappointed, for Amy said:

"Burt, I have gathered and pressed nearly all the ferns I need already.You know the shady nooks where the most delicate ones grow, and you can
help Gertrude make as good a collection as mine.You'll help too, won't
you, Webb?"added the innocent little schemer, who saw that Burt was
looking at her rather keenly.So they wound up the mountain, making long stops here and there to gather
sylvan trophies and to note the fine views.Amy's manner was so cordial
and natural that Burt's suspicions had been allayed, and the young
fellow, who could do nothing by halves, was soon deeply absorbed in
making a superb collection for Miss Hargrove, and she felt that, whatever
happened, she was being enriched by everything he obtained for her.Amy
had brought a great many newspapers folded together so that leaves could
be placed between the pages, and Webb soon noted that his offerings were
kept separate from those of Burt.The latter tried to be impartial in his
labors in behalf of the two girls, bringing Amy bright-hued leaves
instead of ferns, but did not wholly succeed, and sometimes he found
himself alone with Miss Hargrove as they pursued their search a short
distance on some diverging and shaded path.On one of these occasions he
said, "I like to think how beautiful you will make your room this
winter.""I like to think of it too," she replied."I shall feel that I have a
part of my pleasant summer always present.""Yes, the pleasantest I ever enjoyed.""I should think you would find it exceedingly dull after such brilliant
experiences as that of your yachting excursion.""Do you find to-day exceedingly dull?""But I am used to the quiet country, and a day like this is the
exception.""I do not imagine you have ever lived a tame life.""Isn't that about the same as calling me wild?""There's no harm in beginning a little in that way."You are so favored that I can scarcely imagine life bringing sobering
experiences to you very soon."Have you forgotten what occurred on these very mountains, at no
great distance?I assure you I never forget it;" and her eyes were
eloquent as she turned them upon him."One does not forget the most fortunate event of one's life.Since you
were to meet that danger, I would not have missed being near for the
world.I had even a narrower escape, as you know, on this mountain.The
spot where Webb found me is scarcely more than a mile away."She looked at him very wistfully, and her face grew pale, but she only
said, "I don't think either of us can forget the Highlands.""I shall never forget that little path," he said, in a low tone, and he
looked back at it lingeringly as they came out into the road and
approached the rest of the party.That
spot should be marked for future supplies.Miss Hargrove will share with
you, for you can't have anything so fine as this.""Yes, indeed I have, and I shall call you and Webb to account if you do
not to-day make Gertrude fare as well."Both Miss Hargrove and Burt were bewildered.There was lurking mischief
in Amy's eyes when she first spoke, and yet she used her influence to
keep Burt in her friend's society.Her spirits seemed too exuberant to be
natural, and Miss Hargrove, who was an adept at hiding her feelings under
a mask of gayety, surmised that Amy's feminine instincts had taught her
to employ the same tactics.Conscious of their secret, Miss Hargrove and
Burt both thought, "Perhaps it is her purpose to throw us together as far
as possible, and learn the truth."Amy had a kinder purpose than they imagined.She wanted no more of Burt's
forced allegiance, and was much too good-natured to permit mere pique to
cause unhappiness to others."Let Gertrude win him if she cares for him,"
was her thought, "and if _she_ can't hold him his case is
_hopeless_."She could not resist the temptation, however, to tease
Burt a little.But he gave her slight chance for the next few hours.Her mirthful
question and the glance accompanying it had put him on his guard again,
and he at once became the gay cavalier-general he had resolved on being
throughout the day.They made a long pause to enjoy the view looking out upon Constitution
Island, West Point, the southern mountains, and the winding river, dotted
here and there with sails, and with steamers, seemingly held motionless
by their widely separated train of canal boats."What mountain is this that we are now to descend?""It's the first high mountain that abuts on
the river above West Point, you will remember."I have a song relating to it, and will give you a
verse;" and she sang:

  "'Where Hudson's waves o'er silvery sands
      Wind through the hills afar,
    And Cro' Nest like a monarch stands,
      Crowned with a single star.'"After a round of applause had subsided, Burt, whose eyes had been more
demonstrative than his hands, said, "That's by Morris.We can see from
Fort Putnam his old home under Mount Taurus."He is the poet who entreated the woodman to'spare that tree.'""Which the woodman will never do," Webb remarked, "unless compelled by
law; nor even then, I fear."cried Amy, "with what a thump you drop into prose!""I also advise an immediate descent of the mountain if we are to have any
time at Fort Putnam," he added.They were soon winding down the S's by which the road overcame the steep
declivity.On reaching a plateau, before the final descent, they came
across a wretched hovel, gray and storm-beaten, with scarcely strength to
stand.Rags took the place of broken glass in the windows.A pig was
rooting near the doorstep, on which stood a slatternly woman, regarding
the party with dull curiosity."Talk about the elevating influence of mountain scenery," said Miss
Hargrove; "there's a commentary on the theory.""The theory's correct," persisted Burt."Their height above tide-water
and the amount of bad whiskey they consume keep our mountaineers elevated
most of the time.""Does Lumley live in a place like that?""He did--in a worse one, if possible," Webb replied for Amy, who
hesitated."But you should see how it is changed.He now has a good
vegetable garden fenced in, a rustic porch covered with American ivy,
and--would you believe it?--an actual flower-bed.Within the hut there
are two pictures on the wall, and the baby creeps on a carpeted floor.Lumley says Amy is making a man of him.""You forget to mention how much you have helped me," Amy added."Come, let us break up this mutual admiration society," said Burt."I'm
ready for lunch already, and Fort Putnam is miles away."The road from the foot of the mountain descends gradually through wild,
beautiful scenery to West Point.Cro' Nest rises abruptly on the left,
and there is a wooded valley on the right, with mountains beyond.The
trees overhung the road with a canopy of gold, emerald, and crimson
foliage, and the sunlight came to the excursionists as through
stained-glass windows.Taking a side street at the back of the military
post, they soon reached a point over which frowned the ruins of the fort,
and here they left their horses.After a brief climb to the northward
they entered on an old road, grass-grown and leaf-carpeted, and soon
passed through the gaping sally-port, on either side of which cone-like
cedars stood as sentinels.Within the fort Nature had been busy for a
century softening and obliterating the work of man.Cedar trees--some of
which were dying from age--grew everywhere, even on the crumbling
ramparts.Except where ledges of the native rock cropped out, the ground
was covered with a thick sward.Near the centre of the inclosure is the
rocky basin.In it bubbles the spring at which the more temperate of the
ancient garrison may have softened the asperities of their New England
rum.The most extensive ruins are seen by turning sharply to the left from the
sally-port.Here, yawning like caverns, their entrances partially choked
by the debris, are six casemates, or vaults.They were built of brick,
covered with stone, and are eighteen feet deep and twelve wide, with an
arched roof twelve feet high.On the level rampart above them were long,
withered grass, the wild dwarf-rose, and waving golden-rod.The outer
walls, massy and crumbling, or half torn away by vandal hands, were built
in angles, according to the engineering science of the Revolution, except
on the west, where the high ramparts surmount a mural perpendicular
precipice fifty feet in height.Inland, across the valley, the mountains
were seen, rising like rounded billows in every direction, while from the
north, east, and south the windings of the Hudson were visible for
fifteen miles.All but Amy had visited the spot before, and Burt explored the place with
her while the rest prepared for lunch.She had asked Gertrude to
accompany them, but the latter had sought refuge with Maggie, and at her
side she proposed to remain.She scarcely dared trust herself with Burt,
and as the day advanced he certainly permitted his eyes to express an
interest that promised ill for his inexorable purpose of constancy.It had become clear to Miss Hargrove that he was restrained by something
that had occurred between him and Amy, and both her pride and her sense
of truth to her friend decided her to withdraw as far as possible from
his society, and to return to the city.She and Burt vied with each other in gayety at lunch.When it was over
they all grouped themselves in the shade of a clump of cedars, and looked
away upon the wide prospect, Webb pointing out objects of past and
present interest.Alf and Fred speedily grew restless and started off
with the gun, Johnnie's head sank into her mother's lap, Miss Hargrove
and Burt grew quiet and preoccupied, their eyes looking off into vacancy.Webb was saying, "By one who had imagination how much more could be seen
from this point than meets the eye!There, on the plain below us, would
rise the magnificent rustic colonnade two hundred and twenty feet long
and eighty feet wide, beneath which Washington gave the great banquet in
honor of the birth of the Dauphin of France, and on the evening of the
same day these hills blazed with musketry and rolled back the thunder of
cannon with which the festivities of the evening were begun.Think of the
'Father of his Country' being there in flesh and blood, just as we are
here!In the language of an old military journal, 'He carried down a
dance of twenty couple on the green grass, with a graceful and dignified
air, having Mrs.In almost a direct line across
the river you can see the Beverly Robinson house, from which Arnold
carried on his correspondence with Andre.You can look into the window of
the room to which, after hearing of the capture of Andre, he hastened
from the breakfast-table.To this upper room he immediately summoned his
wife, who had been the beautiful Margaret Shippen, you remember, and told
her of his awful peril, then rushed away, leaving the poor, terror-stricken
woman unconscious on the floor.Would you not like to look through the
glass at the house where the tragedy occurred, Miss Hargrove?"At the sound of her name the young girl started visibly, and Webb saw
that there were tears in her eyes; but she complied without a word, and
he so directed the glass that it covered the historic mansion.thought innocent Webb, taking her
quickly suppressed emotion as a tribute to his moving reminiscences."Oh, Webb, have done with your lugubrious ancient history!"cried Burt,
springing up."It's time we were getting ready for a homeward move," said Maggie."I'll
go and pack the things.""And I'll help you," added Miss Hargrove, hastily following her."Let me look at the house, too," said Amy, taking the glass; then added,
after a moment: "Poor Margaret Arnold!It was indeed a tragedy, as you
said, Webb--a sadder one than these old military preparations can
suggest.In all his career of war and treachery Arnold never inflicted a
more cruel wound.""How much feeling Miss Hargrove showed!""Yes," said Amy, quietly, "she was evidently feeling deeply."Her thought
was, "I don't believe she heard a word that Webb said."Then, seeing that
Burt was helping Maggie and Miss Hargrove, she added, "Please point out
to me some other interesting places."Webb, well pleased, talked on to a listener who did not give him her
whole attention.She could not forget Gertrude's paleness, and her
alternations from extreme gayety to a look of such deep sadness as to
awaken not a little sympathetic curiosity.Amy loved her friend truly,
and it did not seem strange to her that Miss Hargrove was deeply
interested in Burt, since they had been much thrown together, and since
she probably owed her life to him.Amy's resentment toward Burt had
passed away.She had found that her pride, merely, and not her heart, was
wounded by his new passion, and she already began to feel that she never
could have any such regard for him as her friend was possibly cherishing.Therefore it was, perhaps, not unnatural that her tranquil regard should
prove unsatisfying to Burt in contrast with the passion of which Miss
Hargrove was capable.She had seen his vain efforts to remain loyal, and
had smiled at them, proposing to let matters take their course, and to
give little aid in extricating him from his dilemma.But, if she had
interpreted her friend's face aright, she could no longer stand aloof, an
amused and slightly satirical spectator.If Burt deserved some
punishment, Gertrude did not, and she was inclined to guess the cause of
the latter's haste to return to the city.It may thus be seen that Amy was fast losing her unsophisticated
girlhood.While Burt's passionate words had awakened no corresponding
feeling, they had taught her that she was no longer a child, since she
could inspire such words.Her intimacy with Miss Hargrove, and the
latter's early confidences, had enlarged her ideas on some subjects.As
the bud of a flower passes slowly through long and apparently slow stages
of immaturity and at last suddenly opens to the light, so she had reached
that age when a little experience suggests a great deal, and the
influences around her tended to develop certain thoughts very rapidly.She saw that her friend had not been brought up in English seclusion.Admirers by the score had flocked around her, and, as she had often said,
she proposed to marry for love."I have the name of being cold," she once
told Amy, "but I know I can love as can few others, and I shall know it
well when I do love, too."The truth was daily growing clearer to Amy
that under our vivid American skies the grand passion is not a fiction of
romance or a quiet arrangement between the parties concerned.Miss Hargrove had not misjudged herself.Her tropical nature, when once
kindled, burned with no feeble, wavering flame.She had passed the point
of criticism of Burt.She loved him, and to her fond eyes he seemed more
worthy of her love than any man she had ever before known.But she had
not passed beyond her sense of truth and duty, and the feeling came to
her that she must go away at once and engage in that most pathetic of all
struggles that fall to woman's lot.As the conviction grew clear on this
bright October day, she felt that her heart was bleeding internally.Tears would come into her eyes at the dreary prospect.Her former
brilliant society life now looked as does an opera-house in the morning,
when the gilding and tinsel that flashed and sparkled the evening before
are seen to be dull and tarnished.Burt had appeared to especial
advantage in his mountain home.His
tall, fine figure and unconscious, easy manner were as full of grace as
deficient in conventionality, and she thought with disgust of many of her
former admirers, who were nothing if not stylish after the arbitrary mode
of the hour.At the same time he had proved that he could be at home in a
drawing-room on the simple ground of good-breeding, and not because he
had been run through fashion's latest mold.The grand scenery around her
suggested the manhood that kindled her imagination--a manhood strong,
fearless, and not degenerated from that sturdy age which had made these
scenes historic.By the time they were ready to start homeward the southern side of Cro'
Nest was in deep blue shadow.They bowled along rapidly till they came to
the steep ascent, and then the boys and the young men sprang out."Would
you like to walk, Gertrude?"Amy asked, for she was bent on throwing her
friend and Burt together during the witching twilight that was coming on
apace."I fear I am too tired, unless the load is heavy," she replied."Oh, no, indeed," said Webb."It does not take long to reach the top of
the mountain on this side, and then it's chiefly down hill the rest of
the way."Amy, who had been sitting with Webb and Johnnie as before, said to Miss
Hargrove, "Won't you step across the seats and keep me company?"She was so utterly unhappy that she
wished to be left to herself as far as possible.In her realization of a
loss that seemed immeasurable, she was a little resentful toward Amy,
feeling that she had been more frank and confidential than her friend.If
Amy had claims on Burt, why had she not spoken of them?why had she
permitted her for whom she professed such strong friendship to drift
almost wholly unwarned upon so sad a fate?and why was she now clearly
trying to bring together Burt and the one to whom even he felt that he
had no right to speak in more than a friendly manner?While she was
making such immense sacrifices to be true, she felt that Amy was
maintaining an unfair reticence, if not actually beguiling herself and
Burt into a display of weakness for which they would be condemned--or, at
least, he would be, and love identifies itself with its object.These
thoughts, having once been admitted, grew upon her mind rapidly, for it
is hard to suffer through another and maintain a gentle charity.Therefore she was silent when she took her seat by Amy, and when the
latter gave her a look that was like a caress, she did not return it."You are tired, Gertrude," Amy began gently.You
must stay with me to-night, and I'll watch over you like Sairy Gamp."So far from responding to Amy's playful and friendly words, Miss Hargrove
said, hastily,

"Oh, no, I had better go right on home.I don't feel very well, and shall
be better at home; and I must begin to get ready to-morrow for my return
to the city."Amy would not be repulsed, but, putting her arm around her friend, she
looked into her eyes, and asked:

"Why are you so eager to return to New York?Are you tiring of your
country friends?You certainly told me that you expected to stay till
November.""Fred must go back to school to-morrow," said Gertrude, in a constrained
voice, "and I do not think it is well to leave him alone in the city
house.""You are withdrawing your confidence from me," said Amy, sadly.If you had, I should not be the unhappy girl I am-to-night.Well,
since you wish to know the whole truth you shall.You said you could
trust me implicitly, and I promised to deserve your trust.If you had
said to me that Burt was bound to you when I told you that I was
heart-whole and fancy-free, I should have been on my guard.Is it natural
that I should be indifferent to the man who risked his life to save mine?Why have you left me so long in his society without a hint of warning?I shall not try to snatch happiness from
another."Johnnie's tuneful little voice was piping a song, and the rumble of the
wheels over a stony road prevented Maggie, on the last seat, from hearing
anything."Now you _shall_ stay with me
to-night," she said.See, Burt has
turned, and is coming toward us.I pledge you my word he can never be to
me more than a brother.I do not love him except as a brother, and never
have, and you can snatch no happiness from me, except by treating me with
distrust and going away.""Oh, Amy," began Miss Hargrove, in tones and with a look that gave
evidence of the chaotic bewilderment of her mind.We are not very lonely, thank you, Mr.You look, as far as I
can see you through the dusk, as if you were commiserating us as poor
forlorn creatures, but we have some resources within ourselves."We are the forlorn creatures who have
no resources.I assure you we are very simple,
honest people.""In that case I shall have no fears, but clamber in at once.I feel as if
I had been on a twenty-mile tramp.""What an implied compliment to our exhilarating society!""Indeed there is--a very strong one.I've been so immensely exhilarated
that, in the re-action, I'm almost faint.""Maggie," cried Amy, "do take care of Burt; he's going to faint.""He must wait till we come to the next brook, and then we'll put him in
it.""Webb," said Amy, looking over her shoulder at the young man, who was now
following the carriage, "is there anything the matter with you, also?""Oh, your trouble, whatever it may be, is chronic.Well, well, to think
that we poor women may be the only survivors of this tremendous
expedition.""That would be most natural--the survival of the fittest, you know."Science is uppermost in your mind, as
ever.You ought to live a thousand years, Webb, to see the end of all
your theories.""I fear it wouldn't be the millennium for me, and that I should have more
perplexing theories at its end than now.""That's the way with men--they are never satisfied," remarked Miss
Hargrove.Clifford, this is your expedition, and it's getting so
dark that I shall feel safer if you are driving.""Oh, Gertrude, you have no confidence in me whatever.As if I would break
your neck--or heart either!""You are a very mysterious little woman," was the reply, given in like
manner, "and need hours of explanation."Clifford,
I've much more confidence in you than in Amy.Her talk is so giddy that I
want a sober hand on the reins.""I want one to drive who can see his way, not feel it," was the laughing
response.Amy, too, was laughing silently, as she reined in the horses."What are you
two girls giggling about?""The
idea of two such refined creatures giggling!""Well," exclaimed Webb, "what am I to do?I can't stand up between you
and drive.""Gertrude, you must clamber around and sustain Burt's drooping spirits.""Indeed, Amy, you must know best how to do that," was the reply."As
guest, I claim a little of the society of the commander-in-chief."I'll solve the vexed question," said Burt, much nettled, and leaping
out."Now, Burt, the question isn't vexed, and don't you be," cried Amy,
springing lightly over to the next seat."There are Fred and Alf, too,
with the gun.Let us all get home as soon as possible, for it's nearly
time for supper already.Come, I shall feel much hurt if you don't keep
me company."Burt at once realized the absurdity of showing pique, although he felt
that there was something in the air which he did not understand.He came
back laughing, with much apparent good-nature, and saying, "I thought I'd
soon bring one or the other of you to terms."said Amy, with difficulty restraining a
new burst of merriment.They soon reached the summit, and paused to give the horses a breathing.The young moon hung in the west, and its silver crescent symbolized to
Miss Hargrove the hope that was growing in her heart."Amy," she said,
"don't you remember the song we arranged from 'The Culprit Fay'?We
certainly should sing it here on this mountain.Amy sang, in clear soprano:

  "'The moon looks down on old Cro' Nest,
  She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,
  And seems his huge gray form to throw
  In a silver cone on the wave below.'""Imagine the cone and wave, please," said Miss Hargrove; and then, in an
alto rich with her heart's deep feeling, she sang with Amy:

  "'Ouphe and goblin!Ye that love the moon's soft light,
    Hither--hither wend your way;
    Twine ye in a jocund ring;
    Sing and trip it merrily,
    Hand to hand and wing to wing,
    Round the wild witch-hazel tree.'""If I were a goblin, I'd come, for music like that," cried Burt, as they
started rapidly homeward."You are much too big to suggest a culprit fay," said Amy."But the description of the fay's charmer is your portrait," he replied,
in a low tone:

  "'But well I know her sinless mind
    Is pure as the angel forms above,
    Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,
    Such as a spirit well might love.'""Oh, no; you are mistaken, I'm not meek in the least.Think of the
punishment:

  "'Tied to the hornet's shardy wings,
    Toss'd on the pricks of nettles' stings;'

you know the rest.""What witchery has got into you to-night, Amy?""That last song was so good that I, for one, would be glad of more," cried
Webb."You men must help us, then," said Miss Hargrove, and in a moment the wild,
dim forest was full of melody, the rocks and highlands sending back soft
and unheeded echoes.Burt, meantime, was occupied with disagreeable reflections.Perhaps both
the girls at last understood him, and had been comparing notes, to his
infinite disadvantage.His fickleness and the dilemma he was in may have
become a jest between them.Resentment, except against
himself, was impossible.If Amy understood him, in what other way could
she meet any approach to sentiment on his part than by a laughing scorn?If Miss Hargrove had divined the past, or had received a hint concerning
it, why should she not shun his society?He was half-desperate, and yet
felt that any show of embarrassment or anger would only make him appear
more ridiculous.The longer he thought the more sure he was that the
girls were beginning to guess his position, and that his only course was
a polite indifference to both.But this policy promised to lead through a
thorny path, and to what?In impotent rage at himself he ground his teeth
during the pauses between the stanzas that he was compelled to sing.Such
was the discord in his heart that he felt like uttering notes that would
make "night hideous."He was still more distraught when, on their return, they found Mr.Hargrove's carriage in waiting, and Amy, after a brief conference with
her friend in her room, came down prepared to accompany Miss Hargrove
home after supper.In spite of all his efforts at ease and gayety, his
embarrassment and trouble were evident.He had observed Miss Hargrove's
pallor and her effort to keep up at Fort Putnam, and could not banish the
hope that she sympathized with him; but now the young girl was demurely
radiant.Her color had come again, and the lustre of her beautiful eyes
was dazzling.Yet they avoided his, and she had far more to say to Webb
and the others than to him.Webb, too, was perplexed, for during the day
Amy had been as bewildering to him as to Burt.But he was in no
uncertainty as to his course, which was simply to wait.He, with Burt,
saw the girls to the carriage, and the latter said good-night rather
coldly and stiffly.Alf and Fred parted regretfully, with the promise of
a correspondence which would be as remarkable for its orthography as for
its natural history.CHAPTER LII

BURT'S SORE DILEMMA


Mr.Hargrove greeted Amy cordially, but his questioning eyes rested
oftenest on his daughter.Her expression and manner caused him to pace
his study long and late that night.Hargrove was very polite and a
little stately.She felt that she existed on a plane above Amy.The young girls soon pleaded fatigue, and retired.Once in the seclusion
of their room they forgot all about their innocent fib, and there was not
a trace of weariness in their manner.While Burt was staring at his
dismal, tangled fortune, seeing no solution of his difficulties, a
fateful conference relating to him was taking place.Amy did not look
like a scorner, as with a sister's love and a woman's tact she pleaded
his cause and palliated his course to one incapable of harsh judgment.But she felt that she must be honest with her friend, and that the whole
truth would be best and safest.Her conclusion was: "No man who loved
_you_, and whom you encouraged, would ever change.I know now that I
never had a particle of such feeling as you have for Burt, and can see
that I naturally chilled and quenched his regard for me."Miss Hargrove's dark eyes flashed ominously as she spoke of Burt or of
any man proving faithless after she had given encouragement."But it wasn't possible for me to give him any real encouragement," Amy
persisted."I've never felt as you do, and am not sure that I want to for
a long time."Miss Hargrove almost said, but she suppressed the
words, feeling that since he had not revealed his secret she had no right
to do so.Indeed, as she recalled how sedulously he had guarded it she
was sure he would not thank her for suggesting it to Amy before she was
ready for the knowledge.Impetuous as Miss Hargrove was at times, she had
too fine a nature to be careless of the rights and feelings of others.Moreover, she felt that Webb had been her ally, whether consciously or
not, and he should have his chance with all the help she could give him,
but she was wise enough to know that obtrusion and premature aid are
often disastrous.The decision, after this portentous conference, was: "Mr.Bart must seek
me, and seek very zealously.I know you well enough Amy, to be sure that
you will give him no hints.It's bad enough to love a man before I've
been asked to do so.What an utterly perverse and unmanageable thing
one's heart is!I shall do no angling, however, nor shall I permit any.""You may stand up straight, Gertrude," said Amy, laughing, "but don't
lean over backward."Burt entertained half a dozen wild and half-tragic projects before he
fell asleep late that night, but finally, in utter self-disgust, settled
down on the prosaic and not irrational one of helping through with the
fall work on the farm, and then of seeking some business or profession to
which he could give his whole mind."As to ladies' society," he
concluded, savagely, "I'll shun it hereafter till I'm grown up."Burt always attained a certain kind of peace and the power to sleep after
he had reached an irrevocable decision.During the night the wind veered to the east, and a cold, dismal
rain-storm set in.Dull and dreary indeed the day proved to Burt.He
could not go out and put his resolution into force.He fumed about the
house, restless, yet reticent.He would rather have fought dragons than
keep company with his own thoughts in inaction.All the family supposed
he missed Amy, except Webb, who hoped he missed some one else."Why don't you go over and bring Amy home, Burt?"his mother asked, at
the dinner-table."The house seems empty without her, and everybody is
moping.Even father has fretted over his newspaper, and wished Amy was
here.""Why can't they print an edition of the paper for old men and dark days?""Well," remarked Leonard, leaning back in his chair, and looking
humorously at Maggie, "I'm sorry for you young fellows, but I'm finding
the day serene.""Of course you are," snapped Burt."With an armchair to doze in and a
dinner to look forward to, what more do you wish?As for Webb, he can
always get astride of some scientific hobby, no matter how bad the
weather is.""As for Burt, he can bring Amy home, and then every one will be
satisfied," added his mother, smiling.Thus a new phase of his trial presented itself to poor Burt.He must
either face those two girls after their night's conclave, with all its
possible revelations, or else awaken at once very embarrassing surmises.And in a mood of mingled
recklessness and fear he drove through the storm.When his name was
announced the girls smiled significantly, but went down looking as
unconscious as if they had not spoken of him in six months, and Burt
could not have been more suave, non-committal, and impartially polite if
these ladies had been as remote from his thoughts as one of Webb's
theories.At the same time he intimated that he would be ready to return
when Amy was.At parting the friends gave each other a little look of dismay, and he
caught it from the same telltale mirror that persisted in taking a part
in this drama.though the young fellow, "so they have been exchanging confidences,
and my manner is disconcerting--not what was expected.If I have become a
jest between them it shall be a short-lived one.Miss Hargrove, with all
her city experience, shall find that I'm not so young and verdant but that
I can take a hand in this game also.As for Amy, I now know she never cared
for me, and I don't believe she ever would;" and so he went away with
laughing repartee, and did not see the look of deep disappointment with
which he was followed.Her innocent schemes might not be so
easily accomplished if Burt would be wrong-headed.She was aware of the
dash of recklessness in his character, and feared that under the impulse
of pride he might spoil everything, or, at least, cause much needless
delay.With the fatality of blundering which usually attends upon such
occasions, he did threaten to fulfil her fears, and so successfully that
Amy was in anxiety, and Miss Hargrove grew as pale as she was resolute
not to make the least advance, while poor Webb felt that his suspense
never would end.Burt treated Amy in an easy, fraternal manner.He
engaged actively in the task of gathering and preparing for market the
large crop of apples, and he openly broached the subject of going into a
business of some kind away from home, where, he declared, with a special
meaning for Amy, he was not needed, adding: "It's time I was earning my
salt and settling down to something for life.Webb and Len can take care
of all the land, and I don't believe I was cut out for a farmer."He not only troubled Amy exceedingly, but he perplexed all the family,
for it seemed that he was decidedly taking a new departure.One evening,
a day or two after he had introduced the project of going elsewhere, his
father, to Amy's dismay, suggested that he should go to the far West and
look after a large tract of land which the old gentleman had bought some
years before.It was said that a railroad was to be built through it,
and, if so, the value of the property would be greatly enhanced, and
steps should be taken to get part of it into the market.Burt took hold
of the scheme with eagerness, and was for going as soon as possible.Looking to note the effect of his words upon Amy, he saw that her
expression was not only reproachful, but almost severe.Leonard heartily
approved of the plan.Webb was silent, and in deep despondency, feeling
that if Bart went now nothing would be settled.He saw Amy's aversion to
the project also, and misinterpreted it.She was compelled to admit that the prospects were growing very dark.Burt might soon depart for an indefinite absence, and Miss Hargrove
return to the city.Amy, who had looked upon the mutations in her own
prospects so quietly, was almost feverishly eager to aid her friend.She
feared she had blundered on the mountain ride.Burt's pride had been
wounded, and he had received the impression that his April-like moods had
been discussed satirically.It was certain that he had been very deeply
interested in Gertrude, and that he was throwing away not only his
happiness, but also hers; and Amy felt herself in some degree to blame.Therefore she was bent upon ending the senseless misunderstanding, but
found insurmountable embarrassments on every side.Miss Hargrove was
prouder than Burt.Wild horses could not draw her to the Cliffords', With
a pale, resolute face, she declined even to put herself in the way of
receiving the least advance.Amy would gladly have taken counsel of Webb,
but could not do so without revealing her friend's secret, and also
disclosing mere surmises about Burt, which, although amounting to
conviction in her mind, could not be mentioned.Therefore, from the very
delicacy of the situation, she felt herself helpless.Nature was her
ally, however, and if all that was passing in Burt's mind had been
manifest, the ardent little schemer would not have been so despondent.The best hope of Burt had been that he had checkmated the girls in their
disposition to make jesting comparisons, He would retire with so much
nonchalance as to leave nothing to be said.They would find complete
inaction and silence hard to combat.But the more he thought of it the
less it seemed like an honorable retreat.He had openly wooed one girl,
he had since lost his heart to another, and she had given him a glimpse
of strong regard, if not more.His thoughts were busy with her every word
and glance.How much had his tones and eyes revealed to her?Might she
not think him a heartless flirt if he continued to avoid her and went
away without a word?Would it not be better to be laughed at as one who
did not know his own mind than be despised for deliberate trifling?Amy
had asked him to go and spend an evening with her friend, and he had
pleaded weariness as an excuse.Her incredulous look and rather cool
manner since had not been reassuring.She had that very morning broached
the subject of a chestnutting party for the following day, and he had
promptly said that he was going to the city to make inquiries about
routes to the West."Why, Burt, you can put off your trip to town for a day," said his
mother."If you are to leave us so soon you should make the most of the
days that are left.""That is just what he is doing," Amy remarked, satirically."He has
become absorbed in large business considerations.Those of us who have
not such resources are of no consequence."The old people and Leonard believed that Amy was not pleased with the
idea of Burt's going away, but they felt that she was a little
unreasonable, since the young fellow was rather to be commended for
wishing to take life more seriously.But her words rankled in Burt's
mind.He felt that she understood him better than the others, and that he
was not winning respect from her.In the afternoon he saw her, with Alf
and Johnnie, starting for the chestnut-trees, and although she passed not
far away she gave him only a slight greeting, and did not stop for a
little merry banter, as usual.The young fellow was becoming very
unhappy, and he felt that his position was growing intolerable.That Amy
should be cold toward him, or, indeed, toward any one, was an unheard-of
thing, and he knew that she must feel that there was good reason for her
manner."What are she and
Miss Hargrove thinking about me?"The more he thought upon the past the more awkward and serious appeared
his dilemma, and his long Western journey, which at first he had welcomed
as promising a diversion of excitement and change, now began to appear
like exile.He dreaded to think of the memories he must take with him;
still more he deprecated the thoughts he would leave behind him.His
plight made him so desperate that he suddenly left the orchard where he
was gathering apples, went to the house, put on his riding-suit, and in a
few moments was galloping furiously away on his black horse.With a
renewal of hope Webb watched his proceedings, and with many surmises,
Amy, from a distant hillside, saw him passing at a break-neck pace.CHAPTER LIII

BURT'S RESOLVE


For the first two or three miles Burt rode as if he were trying to leave
care behind him, scarcely heeding what direction he took.When at last he
reined his reeking horse he found himself near the entrance of the lane
over which willows met in a Gothic arch.He yielded to the impulse to visit
the spot which had seen the beginning of so fateful an acquaintance, and
had not gone far when a turn in the road revealed a group whose presence
almost made his heart stand still for a moment.Miss Hargrove had stopped
her horse on the very spot where he had aided her in her awkward
predicament.Her back was toward him, and her great dog was at her side,
looking up into her face, as if in mute sympathy with his fair mistress.She could not be there with bowed head if
she despised him.Her presence seemed in harmony with that glance by
which, when weak and unnerved after escaping from deadly peril, she had
revealed possibly more than gratitude to the one who had rescued her.His
love rose like an irresistible tide, and he resolved that before he left
his home Amy and Miss Hargrove should know the whole truth, whatever
might be the result.Meanwhile he was rapidly approaching the young girl,
and the dog's short bark of recognition was her first intimation of
Hurt's presence.Her impulse was to fly, but in a second she saw the
absurdity of this course, and yet she was greatly embarrassed, and would
rather have been discovered by him at almost any other point of the
globe.She was going to the city on the morrow, and as she had drawn rein
on this spot and realized the bitterness of her disappointment, tears
would come.She wiped them hastily away, but dreaded lest their traces
should be seen.Turning her horse, she met Burt with a smile that her moist eyes belied,
and said: "I'm glad you do not find me in such an awkward plight as when
we first met here.and away like the wind she started homeward.Burt easily kept at her side, but conversation was impossible.At last he
said: "My horse is very tired, Miss Hargrove.At this pace you will soon
be home, and I shall feel that you are seeking to escape from me.Have I
fallen so very low in your estimation?""Why," she exclaimed, in well-feigned surprise, as she checked her horse,
"what have you done that you should fall in my estimation?""I shall tell you before very long," he said, with an expression that
seemed almost tragic.Surely
this brief gallop cannot have so tried your superb beast."Oh, no," he replied, with a grim laugh.I had been riding rapidly before I met you.My horse has been
idle for some days, and I had to run the spirit out of him.Amy wishes to
have a chestnutting party to-morrow.Clifford, but I return to the city tomorrow afternoon,
and was coming over in the morning to say good-by to Amy and your father
and mother.""I am very sorry too," he said, in tones that gave emphasis to his words.She turned upon him a swift, questioning glance, but her eyes instantly
fell before his intense gaze."Oh, well," she said, lightly, "we've had a very pleasant summer, and all
things must come to an end, you know."Then she went on speaking, in a
matter-of-fact way, of the need of looking after Fred, who was alone in
town, and of getting the city house in order, and of her plans for the
winter, adding: "As there is a great deal of fruit on the place, papa
does not feel that he can leave just yet.You know he goes back and forth
often, and so his business does not suffer.But I can just as well go
down now, and nearly all my friends have returned to town.""All your friends, Miss Hargrove?""Amy has promised to visit me soon," she said, hastily."It would seem that I am not down on your list of friends," he began,
gloomily.Clifford, I'm sure papa and I would be glad to have you call
whenever you are in town.""I fear I shall have to disappoint Mr.Hargrove," he said, a little
satirically."I'm going West the last of this month, and may be absent
much of the winter.I expect to look about in that section for some
opening in business.""Indeed," she replied, in tones which were meant to convey but little
interest, yet which had a slight tremor in spite of her efforts."It will
be a very great change for you.""Perhaps you think that constitutes its chief charm."Clifford," she said, "what chance have I had to think about it at
all?(Amy had, however, and
Gertrude had not only thought about it, but dreamed of it, as if she had
been informed that on a certain date the world would end.)"Is it not a
rather sudden plan?"My father has a large tract of land in the West, and it's
time it was looked after.Isn't it natural that I should think of doing
something in life?I fear there is an impression in your mind that I
entertain few thoughts beyond having a good time.""To have a good time in life," she said, smiling at him, "is a very
serious matter, worthy of any one's attention.It would seem that few
accomplish it.""And I greatly fear that I shall share in the ill-success of the
majority."You will soon be
enjoying the excitement of travel and enterprise in the West.""And you the excitement of society and conquest in the city.Conquests,
however, must be almost wearisome to you, Miss Hargrove, you make them so
easily."I certainly should soon weary of conquests were I
making them.Where in
history do we read of a man who was satiated with conquest?"Are you going to the city to-morrow?""Will you forgive me if I come alone?"I suppose Amy will be tired from nutting."He did not reply, but lifted his hat gravely, mounted his horse, and
galloped away as if he were an aid bearing a message that might avert a
battle.Miss Hargrove hastened to her room, and took off her hat with trembling
hands.Burt's pale, resolute face told her that the crisis in her life
had come.If he meant to speak,
why had he not done so?why had he not asked permission to consult her
father?Hargrove, from his library window, saw Burt's formal parting, and
concluded that his fears or hopes--he scarcely knew which were uppermost,
so deep was his love for his daughter, and so painful would it be to see
her unhappy--were not to be fulfilled.By a great effort Gertrude
appeared not very _distraite_ at dinner, nor did she mention Burt,
except in a casual manner, in reply to a question from her mother, but
her father thought he detected a strong and suppressed excitement.She excused herself early from the table, and said she must finish
packing for her departure.CHAPTER LIV

A GENTLE EXORCIST


Burt's black horse was again white before he approached his home.In the
distance he saw Amy returning, the children running on before, Alf
whooping like a small Indian to some playmate who was answering further
away.The gorgeous sunset lighted up the still more brilliant foliage,
and made the scene a fairyland.But Burt had then no more eye for nature
than a man would have who had staked his all on the next throw of the
dice.Amy was alone, and now was his chance to intercept her before she
reached the house.Imagine her surprise as she saw him make his horse
leap the intervening fences, and come galloping toward her."Burt," she cried, as he, in a moment or two, reined up near her, "you
will break your neck!""It wouldn't matter much," he said, grimly."I fear a worse fate than
that."He threw the bridle over a stake in the fence, and the horse was glad to
rest, with drooping head.Then he came and stood beside her, his face
flushed, and his mouth twitching with excitement and strong feeling."Burt," she said, "what is the matter?"I fear your scorn, Amy," he began, impetuously; "I fear I shall lose
your respect forever.But I can't go on any longer detesting myself and
feeling that you and Miss Hargrove despise me.I may seem to you and her
a fickle fool, a man of straw, but you shall both know the truth.I
shan't go away a coward.I can at least be honest, and then you may think
what you please of my weakness and vacillation.You cannot think worse
things than I think myself, but you must not imagine that I am a
cold-blooded, deliberate trifler, for that has never been true.I know
you don't care for me, and never did.""Indeed, Burt, you are mistaken.I do care for you immensely," said Amy,
eagerly clasping his arm with both her hands."Amy, Amy," said Burt, in a low, desperate tone, "think how few short
months have passed since I told you I loved you, and protested I would
wait till I was gray.You have seen me giving my thoughts to another, and
in your mind you expect to see me carried away by a half-dozen more.You
are mistaken, but it will take a long time to prove it.""No, Burt, I understand you better than you think.Gertrude has inspired
in you a very different feeling from the one you had for me.I think you
are loving now with a man's love, and won't get over it very soon, if you
ever do.You have seen, you must have felt, that my love for you was only
that of a sister, and of course you soon began to feel toward me in the
same way.I don't believe I would have married you had you waited an age.Don't fret, I'm not going to break my heart about you.""I should think not, nor will any one else.Oh, Amy, I so despised myself
that I have been half-desperate.""Despised yourself because you love a girl like Gertrude Hargrove!I
never knew a man to do a more natural and sensible thing, whether she
gave you encouragement or not.If I were a man I would make love to her,
rest assured, and she would have to refuse me more than once to be rid of
me."Burt took a long breath of immense relief."You are heavenly kind," he
said."Are you sure you won't despise me?It seems
to me that I have done such an awfully mean thing in making love to you
in my own home, and then in changing.""Fate has been too strong for you, and I
think--I mean--I hope, it has been kind.Bless you, Burt, I could never
get up any such feeling as sways you.I should always be disappointing,
and you would have found out, sooner or later, that your best chance
would be to discover some one more responsive.Since you have been so
frank, I'll be so too.I was scarcely more ready for your words last
spring than Johnnie, but I was simple enough to think that in half a
dozen years or so we might be married if all thought it was best, and my
pride was a little hurt when I saw what--what--well, Gertrude's influence
over you.But I've grown much older the last few months, and know now
that my thoughts were those of a child.My feeling for you is simply that
of a sister, and I don't believe it would ever have changed.I
might eventually have an acute attack also, and then I should be in a
worse predicament than yours.""But you will be my loving sister as long as you live, Amy?You will
believe that I have a little manhood if given a chance to show it?""I believe it now, Burt, and I can make you a hundredfold better sister
than wife.It seems but the other day I was playing with dolls.You have judged yourself too harshly;" and she
looked at him so smilingly and affectionately that he took her in his
arms and kissed her again and again, exclaiming, "You can count on one
brother to the last drop of his blood.Oh, Amy, whatever happens now, I
won't lose courage.Miss Hargrove will have to say no a dozen times
before she is through with me."At this moment Webb, from the top of a tall ladder in the orchard,
happened to glance that way, and saw the embrace.He instantly descended,
threw down his basket of apples, and with it all hope.The coolness between them had been but a misunderstanding, which
apparently had been banished most decidedly.He mechanically took down
his ladder and placed it on the ground, then went to his room to prepare
for supper."Burt," cried Amy, when they were half-way home, "you have forgotten your
horse.""If he were Pegasus, I should have forgotten him to-day."Oh, yes, I'll do anything for you.""Will you tell me if you think Miss
Hargrove--"

"No, I won't tell you anything.After she has refused you half
a dozen times, I may, out of pity, intercede a little.Go get your horse,
smooth your brow, and be sensible, or you'll have Webb and Leonard poking
fun at you.Suppose they have seen you galloping over fences and ditches
like one possessed.""Well, I was possessed, and never was there such a kind, gentle exorcist.I have seen Miss Hargrove to-day; I had just parted from her."How could I, until I had told you?I felt I was bound to you by
all that can bind a man.""Oh, Burt, suppose I had not released you, but played Shylock, what would
you have done?"and her laugh rang out again in intense merriment."I had no fears of that," he replied, ruefully."You are the last one to
practice Mrs.My fear was that you and Miss
Hargrove both would send me West as a precious good riddance.""Well, it was square of you, as Alf says, to come to me first, and I
appreciate it, but I should not have resented the omission.Will you
forgive my curiosity if I ask what is the next move in the campaign?I've
been reading about the war, you know, and I am quite military in my
ideas.""I have Miss Hargrove's permission to call to-night.It wasn't given very
cordially, and she asked me to bring you.""Oh, I told her she would have to forgive me if I came alone.I meant to
have it out to-day, if old Chaos came again."When Amy's renewed laughter
so subsided that he could speak, he resumed: "I'm going over there after
supper, to ask her father for permission to pay my addresses, and if he
won't give it, I shall tell him I will pay them all the same--that I
shall use every effort in my power to win his daughter.I don't want a
dollar of his money, but I'm bound to have the girl if she'll ever listen
to me after knowing all you know."Amy's laugh ceased, and she again clasped her hands on his arm."Dear
Burt," she said, "your course now seems to me manly and straightforward.I saw the strait you were in, but did not think you felt it so keenly.In
going West I feared you were about to run away from it.However Gertrude
may treat you, you have won my respect by your downright truth.She may
do as she pleases, but she can't despise you now.He has learned this afternoon that you are in no state of
mind to take care of him."CHAPTER LV

BURT TELLS HIS LOVE AGAIN


Webb appeared at the supper-table the personification of quiet geniality,
but Amy thought she had never seen him look so hollow-eyed.The long
strain was beginning to tell on him, decidedly, and to-night he felt as
if he had received a mortal blow.But with indomitable courage he hid his
wound, and seemed absorbed in a conversation with Leonard and his father
about the different varieties of apples, and their relative value.Amy
saw that his mother was looking at him anxiously, and she did not wonder.He was growing thin even to gauntness.Burt also was an arrant dissembler, and on rising from the table remarked
casually that he was going over to bid Miss Hargrove good-by, as she
would return to town on the morrow."She'll surely come and see us before she goes," Mrs."It seems to me she hasn't been very sociable of late."She told me she
was coming to say good-by to us all, and she has asked me to visit her.Come, Webb, you look all tired out to-night.I'll
stumble through the dryest scientific treatise you have if I can see you
resting on the sofa.""That's ever so kind of you, Amy, and I appreciate it more than you
imagine, but I'm going out this evening.""Oh, of course, sisters are of no account.What girl are _you_ going
to see?"I am too old and dull to entertain the pretty
creatures."You know one you could entertain if she isn't a pretty
creature, but then she's only a sister who doesn't know much.""I'm sorry--I must go," he said, a little abruptly, for her lovely,
half-laughing, half-reproachful face, turned to his, contained such
mocking promise of happiness that he could not look upon it.His rapid steps as he walked mile after mile indicated
that the matter was pressing indeed; but, although it was late before he
returned, he had spoken to no one.The house was dark and silent except
that a light was burning in Burt's room.And his momentous fortunes the
reader must now follow.Miss Hargrove, with a fluttering heart, heard the rapid feet of his horse
as he rode up the avenue.Truly, he was coming at a lover's pace.The
door-bell rang, she heard him admitted, and expected the maid's tap at
her door to follow.Were the tumultuous throbs of
her heart so loud that she could not hear it?She opened her door slightly; there was no
sound.There below, like a shadow, stood a
saddled horse.Had the stupid girl shown him into
the drawing-room and left him there?Surely the well-trained servant had
never been guilty of such a blunder before.Could it have been some one
else who had come to see her father on business?She stole down the
stairway in a tremor of apprehension, and strolled into the parlor in the
most nonchalant manner imaginable.It was lighted, but empty, and her
expression suddenly became one of troubled perplexity.She returned to
the hall, and started as if she had seen an apparition.There on the rack
hung Burt's hat, as natural as life.Voices reached her ear from her
father's study.She took a few swift steps toward it, then fled to her
room, and stood panting before her mirror, which reflected a young lady
in a costume charmingly ill adapted to "packing.""It was honorable in
him to speak to papa first, and papa would not, could not, answer him
without consulting me.I cannot be treated as a child any longer," she
muttered, with flashing eyes."Papa loves me," she murmured, in swift
alternation of gentle feeling."He could not make my happiness secondary
to a paltry sum of money."Hargrove had greeted him with
no little surprise.The parting of the young people had not promised any
such interview."Have you spoken to my daughter on this subject?"Hargrove asked,
gravely, after the young fellow had rather incoherently made known his
errand."No, sir," replied Burt, "I have not secured your permission.At the same
time," he added, with an ominous flash in his blue eyes, "sincerity
compels me to say that I could not take a final refusal from any lips
except those of your daughter, and not readily from hers.I would not
give up effort to win her until convinced that any amount of patient
endeavor was useless.I should not persecute her, but I would ask her to
reconsider an adverse answer as often as she would permit, and I will try
with all my soul to render myself more worthy of her."Hargrove, severely, "if I should decline this
honor, I should count for nothing.""No, sir, I do not mean that, and I hope I haven't said it, even by
implication.Your consent that I should have a fair field in which to do
my best would receive from me boundless gratitude.What I mean to say is,
that I could not give her up; I should not think it right to do so.This
question is vital to me, and I know of no reason," he added, a little
haughtily, "why I should be refused a privilege which is considered the
right of every gentleman.""I have not in the slightest degree raised the question of your being a
gentleman, Mr.Your course in coming to me before revealing
your regard to my daughter proves that you are one.But you should
realize that you are asking a great deal of me.My child's happiness is
my first and only consideration.You know the condition of life to which
my daughter has been accustomed.It is right and natural that I should
also know something of your prospects, your ability to meet the
obligations into which you wish to enter."After a moment he answered,
with a dignity and an evident sincerity which won golden opinions from
Mr.Hargrove: "I shall not try to mislead you in the least on this point.For my own sake I wish that your daughter were far poorer than I am.I
can say little more than that I could give her a home now and every
comfort of life.I could not now provide for her the luxury to which she
has been accustomed.But I am willing to wait and eager to work.In youth
and health and a fair degree of education I have some capital in addition
to the start in life which my father has promised to his sons.What could
not Miss Hargrove inspire a man to do?"The man of experience smiled in spite of himself at Burt's frank
enthusiasm and naivete.The whole affair was so different from anything
that he had ever looked forward to!Instead of a few formalities between
himself and a wealthy suitor whom his wife, and therefore all the world,
would approve of, here he was listening to a farmer's son, with the
consciousness that he must yield, and not wholly unwilling to do so.Moreover, this preposterous young man, so far from showing any awe of
him, had almost defied him from the start, and had plainly stated that
the father's wealth was the only objection to the daughter.Having seen
the drift of events, Mr.Hargrove had long since informed himself
thoroughly about the Clifford family, and had been made to feel that the
one fact of his wealth, which Burt regretted, was almost his only claim
to superiority.Burt was as transparent as a mountain brook, and quite as
impetuous.The gray-haired man sighed, and felt that he would give all
his wealth in exchange for such youth.He knew his daughter's heart, and
felt that further parleying was vain, although he foresaw no easy task in
reconciling his wife to the match.He was far from being heartbroken
himself, however, for there was such a touch of nature in Burt, and in
the full, strong love waiting to reward the youth, that his own heart was
stirred, and in the depths of his soul he knew that this was better than
giving his child to a jaded millionaire."I have money enough for both,"
he thought."As she said, she is rich enough to follow her heart.It's a
pity if we can't afford an old-fashioned love-match."Hargrove's deep thought and
silence.At last the father arose and gave him his hand, saying: "You have been
honest with me, and that, with an old merchant, counts for a great deal.I also perceive you love my daughter for herself.If she should ever
inform me that you are essential to her happiness I shall not withhold my
consent."Burt seized his hand with a grasp that made it ache, as he said, "Every
power I have, sir, shall be exerted that you may never regret this
kindness.""If you make good that promise, Mr.Clifford, I shall become your friend
should your wooing prove successful.If you will come to the parlor I
will tell Miss Hargrove that you are here."He went up the stairs slowly, feeling that he was crossing the threshold
of a great change.How many thoughts passed through his mind as he took
those few steps!He saw his child a little black-eyed baby in his arms;
she was running before him trundling her hoop; she came to him with
contracted brow and half-tearful eyes, bringing a knotty sum in
fractions, and insisting petulantly that they were very "vulgar" indeed;
she hung on his arm, a shy girl of fifteen, blushingly conscious of the
admiring eyes that followed her; she stood before him again in her first
radiant beauty as a _debutante_, and he had dreamed of the proudest
alliance that the city could offer; she looked into his eyes, a pale,
earnest woman, and said, "Papa, he saved my life at the risk of his own."Clifford had not spoken of that, and Mr.Hargrove had not
thought of it in the interview so crowded with considerations.His heart
relented toward the youth as it had not done before.Well, well, since it
was inevitable, he was glad to be the one who should first bring the
tidings of this bold wooer's purpose."Trurie will never forget this
moment," he mattered, as he knocked at her door, "nor my part in her
little drama."O love, how it craves even the crumbs that fall from the
table of its idol!"Trurie," he began, as he entered, "you had better dress.Bless me, I
thought you were packing!"Clifford said he would call--to bid me good-by, I suppose.""Was that all you supposed, Trurie?""Indeed, papa, I told him I was going to town to-morrow, and he asked if
he might call."I'm sure it's quite natural he should call, and I have been
packing.""Well, I can assure you that he has a very definite object.He has asked
me if he might pay his addresses to you, and in the same breath assured
me that he would in any event.""Oh, papa," she said, hiding her face on his shoulder, "he was not so
unmannerly as that!""Indeed, he went much further, declaring that he would take no refusal
from you, either; or, rather, that he would take it so often as to wear
out your patience, and secure you by proving that resistance was useless.He had one decided fault to find with you, also."Oh, papa, tell me what he did say;" and he felt her heart fluttering
against his side like that of a frightened bird."Why, Trurie, men have offered you love before.""But I never loved before, nor knew what it meant," she whispered.This is all so strange, so sacred to
me.""Well, Trurie, I hope your match may be one of those that are made in
heaven.Your mother will think it anything but worldly wise.However, I
will reconcile her to it, and I'm glad to be the one with whom you will
associate this day.Long after I am gone it may remind you how dear your
happiness was to me, and that I was willing to give up my way for yours.Clifford has been straightforward and manly, if not conventional, and
I've told him that if he could win you and would keep his promise to do
his best for you and by you, I would be his friend, and that, you know,
means much.Of course, it all depends upon whether you accept him.Here is an organ"--with her hand upon her heart--"that
knows better."Oh, no, I can excuse you," he said, with smiling lips but moist eyes."Dear papa, I will, indeed, associate you with this hour and every
pleasant thing in life.You will find that you have won me anew instead
of losing me;" and looking back at him with her old filial love shining
in her eyes, she went slowly away to meet the future under the sweet
constraint of Nature's highest law.If Burt had been impatient in the library, he grew almost desperate in
the parlor.Might not Miss
Hargrove's pride rise in arms against him?Might she not even now be
telling her father of his fickleness, and declaring that she would not
listen to a "twice-told tale"?Every moment of delay seemed ominous, and
many moments passed.The house grew sepulchral in its silence, and the
wind without sighed and moaned as if Nature foreboded and pitied him in
view of the overwhelming misfortune impending.At last he sprang up and
paced the room in his deep perturbation.As he turned toward the entrance
he saw framed in the doorway a picture that appeared like a radiant
vision.Miss Hargrove stood there, looking at him so intently that, for a
second or two, he stood spell-bound.She was dressed in some white,
clinging material, and, with her brilliant eyes, appeared in the
uncertain light too beautiful and wraith-like to be human.She saw her
advantage, and took the initiative instantly.Clifford," she
exclaimed, "do I seem an apparition?""Yes, you do," he replied, coming impetuously toward her.She held out
her hand, proposing that their interview should at least begin at arm's
length.Nevertheless, the soft fire in his eyes and the flush on his
handsome face made her tremble with a delicious apprehension.Even while
at a loss to know just how to manage the preliminaries for a decorous
yielding, she exulted over the flame-like spirit of her lover.Clifford," she cried, "you ought to know that you are not
crushing a ghost's hand."What I meant was that I thought I had seen you before, but
you are a new revelation every time I see you.""Please don't say that, for I must ask you to interpret one to-night.What does Shakespeare say about those who have power?I hope you will use
yours mercifully.Oh, Miss Hargrove, you are so beautiful that I believe
I should lose my reason if you sent me away without hope."Clifford, you are talking wildly," was her faint response.I am almost desperate from fear, for I have a terribly hard
duty to perform."she said, withdrawing her hand, which he relinquished most
reluctantly, dreading that he might never receive it again."Do not assume that attitude, Miss Hargrove, or I shall lose courage
utterly."Clifford," she said, a little satirically, seating herself on
a sofa, "I never imagined you deficient in courage.Is it a terrible duty
to entertain me for a half-hour, and say good-by?"Nothing could be worse than that, if that were all;" and he looked
at her appealingly and in such perplexed distress that she laughed
outright."I am very much in earnest, Miss Hargrove.""You are very enigmatical, Mr.Must I be present while you
perform this terrible duty?""I think you know what I must confess already, and have a world of scorn
in store for me.Whatever the end may be, and my
sense of ill-desert is heavy indeed, I shall begin on the basis of
absolute truth.I've asked your father for the
privilege of winning your love;" and then he hesitated, not knowing how
to go on."No, I fear it will be the best, for he kindly gave his consent, and I
know it would be hard for him to do as much for any man, much more so for
one not wholly to his mind.Miss Hargrove, I must appear awkwardness and
incoherency personified.I shall appear to
you fickle and unmanly.How can I excuse myself to you when I have no
excuse except the downright truth that I love you better than my life,
better than my own soul, better than all the world and everything in it.I never knew what love was until you became unconscious in my arms on the
mountain.I'm only trying to explain
myself; and yet I had thought that I knew, and had spoken words of love
to your friend, Amy Winfield, who is worthy of the love of the best and
noblest man that ever breathed.She did not welcome my words--they only
wounded her--and she has never eared for me except as a true and gentle
sister cares.But I promised to wait till she did care.You fascinated me from the first hour of our meeting.I feel now
that I cherished an unworthy purpose toward you.I thought that, by
attentions to you, I could make Amy care; I thought that you were but a
brilliant society girl; but every hour I spent with you increased my
admiration, my respect; I saw that you were better and stronger than I
was.On the first day we went into camp on the mountain I saw whither my
heart was leading me, and from that hour until to-day I have tried to
conquer my love, feeling that I had no right to give it, that you would
despise it if I did.You can't have any confidence in me now.All my hope
is that you will give me a chance to prove that I am not a fickle wretch.I will accept of any probation, I will submit to any terms.I can't take
an absolute refusal now, for I feel you are seeing me at my worst, and I
know that you could do with me anything you pleased."Her head bowed lower and lower as he poured out these words like a
torrent."Does Amy--have you told her that you cannot keep your promise
to her?""Oh, yes, I told her so a few hours ago--since I met you this afternoon.I was going away to the West, like a coward, to escape from my dilemma,
for I felt you would never listen to me after you knew that I had broken
my word to Amy.I feared that I had already become a by-word between you
for all that was weak and fickle.But after I saw you I could not go till
I spoke.I determined to reveal the whole truth, and if you ever gave me
a chance to retrieve myself, gratitude would be no name for my deep
feeling.She told me in good plain English that she
wanted neither me nor my promise; that she didn't think that she ever
could have loved me, no matter how long I might have waited.But I could
not look into your clear eyes and say, 'I love you,' and know that you
might learn from her or any one that I had said this before.If you won't
trust me, having had the whole truth, then I must bear my hard fate as
best I can.""How long would you be willing to wait for me?"she asked, in tones so
low that he could scarcely catch the words.He bounded to her side, and took her unresisting hand."Oh, Gertrude," he
pleaded, "prove me, give me a chance, let me show that I am not without
manhood and constancy.Believe me, I know the priceless gift I'm asking,
but what else can I do?I have tried for weeks to conquer the feeling you
have inspired, tried with all the help that pride and sense of duty and
honor could give, but it has been utterly useless.I now am free; I have
the right to speak.At last she raised her downcast eyes and averted face to his, and for a
moment he was dazed at their expression.In tones sweet, low, and deep
with her strong emotion, she said, "Burt, how glad I am that you men are
blind!I found out that I loved you before we went to our mountain camp."She sprang up and gave him her other hand as she continued: "Can love
impose such hard conditions as you suggest--months of doubtful waiting
for one who risked his life for me without a second's hesitation?That is
not my nature, Burt.If I have power over you, I shall show it in another
way."She would never forget his look as he listened to these words, nor his
humility as he lowered his head upon her shoulder, and murmured, "I am
not worthy of this."It touched the deepest and tenderest chord in her
heart.His feeling was not the exultation of success, but a gratitude too
deep for words, and a half-conscious appeal that she would use her
woman's power to evoke a better manhood.It was not mere acknowledgment
of her beauty, or the impulse of his passion; it was homage to the best
and noblest part of her nature, the expression of his absolute trust.Never had she received such a tribute, and she valued it more than if
Burt had laid untold wealth at her feet.A great joy is often as sobering as a great sorrow, and they talked long
and earnestly together.Gertrude would not become engaged until she had
told her mother, and shown her the respect that was her due."You must
not be resentful," the young girl said, "if mamma's consent is not easily
won.She has set her heart on an establishment in town, I've set my heart
on you; so there we differ, and you must give me time to reconcile her to
a different programme."The clock on the mantel chimed eleven, and Burt started up, aghast at the
flight of time.Gertrude stole to her father's library, and found that he
was pacing the floor."I should not have left him alone so long
to-night," she thought, with compunction."Papa," she said, "Mr.He looked into his daughter's flushed, happy face, and needed no further
explanation, and with her hands on his arm he went to the drawing-room.Burt said but few and very simple words, and the keen judge of men liked
him beter than if he had been more exuberant.There was evidence of
downright earnestness now that seemed a revelation of a new trait."You spoke of going to the West soon," Mr.Hargrove remarked, as they
lingered in parting."Have you any objection to telling me of your
purpose?"Hargrove's face soon expressed unusual interest."I
must talk with you further about this," he said."I have land in the same
locality, and also an interest in the railroad to which you refer.Perhaps I can make your journey of mutual service.""Oh, papa," cried his daughter, "you are my good genius!"for she well
understood what that mutual service meant.Hargrove said, "Well, well, this Western-land
business puts a new aspect on the affair, and mamma may have little
ground for complaint.It's my impression that the Cliffords will realize
a very respectable fortune out of that land.""Papa," said the young girl, "Burt gave me something better than wealth
to-night--better even than love, in the usual sense of the word.He acted as if he saw in me the power to help him to be a
true man, and what higher compliment can a woman receive?He did not
express it so much by word as by an unconscious manner, that was so
sincere and unpremeditated that it thrilled my very soul.Oh, papa, you
have helped me to be so very happy!"CHAPTER LVI

WEBB'S FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER


Webb's silent entrance had not been so quiet but that Burt heard him.Scarcely had he gained his room before the younger brother knocked, and
followed him in without waiting."Where have you been at this time of
night?""You are infringing on ghostly hours, and are
beginning to look like a ghost;" for Webb had thrown himself into a
chair, and was haggard from the exhaustion of his long conflict.The
light and kindly way in which he answered his brother proved that he was
victor."Webb," said Burt, putting his hand on the elder brother's shoulder, "you
saved my life last winter, and life has become of immense value to me.If
you had not found me, I should have missed a happiness that falls to the
lot of few--a happiness of which all your science can never give you, you
old delver, even an idea.I meant to tell mother and father first, but I
feel to-night how much I owe to your brave, patient search, and I want
your congratulations.""I think you might have told father and mother last night, for I suppose
it's morning now.""I did not get home in time, and did not wish to excite mother, and spoil
her rest.""Well, then, you might have come earlier or gone later.I think not, if you know all about what I didn't know, and
could scarcely believe possible myself, till an hour or two since."I think you might have stayed at home
with Amy to-night, of all times.An accident, Burt, revealed to me your
success, and I do congratulate you most sincerely.You have now the
truest and loveliest girl in the world.""That's true, but what possible accident could have revealed the fact to
you?""Don't think I was spying upon you.From the top of a ladder in the
orchard I saw, as the result of a casual glance, your reward to Amy for
words that must have been very satisfactory."Burt began to laugh as if he could not control himself."What a surprise
I have for you all!""I went where I did last night with Amy's
full knowledge and consent.She never cared a rap for me, but the only
other girl in the world who is her equal does, and her name is Gertrude
Hargrove."Webb gave a great start, and sank into a chair."Don't be so taken aback, old fellow.I suppose you and the rest had set
your hearts on my marrying Amy.You have only to follow Amy's example,
and give me your blessing.Yes, you saw me give Amy a very grateful and
affectionate greeting last evening.She's the dearest little sister that
ever a man had, and that's all she ever wanted to be to me.I felt
infernally mean when I came to her yesterday, for I was in an awkward
strait.I had promised to wait for her till she did care, but she told me
that there was no use in waiting, and I don't believe there would have
been.She would have seen some one in the future who would awaken a very
different feeling from any that I could inspire, and then, if she had
promised herself to me, she would have been in the same predicament that
I was.She is the best and most sensible little girl that ever breathed,
and feels toward me just as she does toward you, only she very justly
thinks you have forgotten more than lever knew.As for Gertrude--Hang it
all!You'll say I'm at my old
tricks, but I'm not.You've seen how circumstances have brought us
together, and I tell you my eye and heart are filled now for all time.She will be over to-morrow, and I want her to receive the greeting she
deserves."The affair seemed of such tremendous importance to Burt that he was not
in the least surprised that Webb was deeply moved, and fortunately he
talked long enough to give his brother time to regain his self-control.Webb did congratulate him in a way that was entirely satisfactory, and
then bundled him out of the room in the most summary manner, saying,
"Because you are a hare-brained lover, you shouldn't keep sane people
awake any longer."It were hard to say, however, who was the less sane
that night, Webb or Burt.The former threw open his window, and gazed at
the moonlit mountains in long, deep ecstasy.Unlike Burt's, his more
intense feeling would find quiet expression.All he knew was that there
was a chance for him--that he had the right to put forth the best effort
of which he was capable--and he thanked God for that.At the same time he
remembered Amy's parable of the rose.He would woo as warily as
earnestly.With Burt's experience before his eyes, he would never stun
her with sudden and violent declarations.His love, like sunshine, would
seek to develop the flower of her love.He was up and out in the October dawn, too happy and excited for sleep.His weariness was gone; his sinews seemed braced with steel as he strode
to a lofty eminence.No hue on the richly tinted leaves nor on the rival
chrysanthemums was brighter than his hope, and the cool, pure air, in
which there was as yet no frostiness, was like exhilarating wine.From
the height he looked down on his home, the loved casket of the more
dearly prized jewel.He viewed the broad acres on which he had toiled,
remembering with a dull wonder that once he had been satisfied with their
material products.Now there was a glamour upon them, and upon all the
landscape.The river gleamed and sparkled; the mountains flamed like the
plumage of some tropical bird.The earth and
his old materiality became the foundation-stones on which his awakened
mind, kindled and made poetic, should rear an airy, yet enduring,
structure of beauty, consecrated to Amy.He had loved nature before, but
it had been to him like a palace in which, as a dull serving-man, he had
employed himself in caring for its furniture and the frames of its
paintings.But he had been touched by a magic wand, and within the frames
glowed ever-changing pictures, and the furniture was seen to be the work
of divine art.The palace was no longer empty, but enshrined a living
presence, a lovely embodiment of Nature's purest and best manifestation.The development of no flower in all the past summer was so clear to him
as that of the girl he loved.He felt as if he had known her thoughts
from childhood.Her young womanhood was like that of the roses he had
shown to her in the dewy June dawn that seemed so long ago.It was still like a bud of his favorite
mossrose, wrapped in its green calyx.Oh, what a wealth of fragrant
beauty would be revealed!But she should
waken in her own time; and if he had not the power to impart the deep,
subtile impulse, then that nearest to her, Nature, should be his bride.They were all at the breakfast-table when he returned, and this plotter
against Amy's peace entered and greeted her with a very quiet
"Good-morning," but he laid beside her plate a four-leaved clover which
he had espied on his way back."Thanks, Webb," she said, with eyes full of merriment; "I foresee an
amazing amount of good luck in this little emblem.Indeed, I feel sure
that startling proofs of it will occur to-day;" and she looked
significantly at Burt, who laughed very consciously."What mischief has Burt been up to, Amy?""He was
ready to explode with suppressed something last evening at supper, and
now he is effervescing in somewhat different style, but quite as
remarkably.You boys needn't think you can hide anything from mother very
long; she knows you too well."Both Webb and Burt, with Amy, began to laugh, and they looked at each
other as if there were a good deal that mother did not know."Webb and Amy have evidently some joke on Burt," remarked Leonard."Webb
was out last night, and I bet a pippin he caught Burt flirting with Miss
Hargrove.""Burt is going to settle down now and be
steady.We'll make him sign a pledge before he goes West, won't we, Amy?""Yes, indeed," gasped Amy, almost beside herself with merriment; "he'll
have to sign one in big capitals.""Burt," said his father, looking at him over his spectacles, "you've been
getting yourself into some scrape as sure as the world.That's right,
Amy; you laugh at him well, and--"

"A truce!""If I'm in a scrape, I don't propose to get
out of it, but rather to make you all share in it.As Amy says, her
four-leaved clover will prove a true prophet, green as it looks.I now
beg off, and shall prove that my scrape has not spoiled my appetite.""Well," said Leonard, "I never could find any four-leaved clovers, but
I've had good luck, haven't I, Maggie?""You had indeed, when you came courting me.""I am satisfied," began Webb, "that I could develop acres of four-leaved
clover.I have counted twenty-odd on
one root.If seed from such a plant were sown, and then seed selected
again from the new plants most characterized by this'sport,' I believe
the trait would become fixed, and we could have a field of four-leaved
clover.New varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers are often thus
developed from chance'sports' or abnormal specimens.""He would turn this ancient symbol of fortune
into a marketable commodity.""Pardon me; I was saying what might be done, not what I proposed to do.I
found this emblem of good chance by chance, and I picked it with the
'wish' attacked to the stem.Thus to the utmost I have honored the
superstition, and you have only to make your wish to carry it out fully.""My wishes are in vain, and all the four-leaved clovers in the world
wouldn't help them.I wish I was a scientific problem, a crop that
required great skill to develop, a rare rose that all the rose-maniacs
were after, a new theory that required a great deal of consideration and
investigation, and accompanied with experiments that needed much
observation, and any number of other t-i-o-n-shuns.Then I shouldn't be
left alone evenings by the great inquiring mind of the family.Burt's
going away, and, as his father says, has got into a scrape; so what's to
become of me?"They all arose from the table amid general laughter, of which Webb and
Burt were equally the objects, and on the faces of those not in the
secret there was much perplexed curiosity.exclaimed Maggie, "if Webb should concentrate his mind
on you as you suggest, it would end by his falling in love with you."This speech was received with shouts of merriment, and Amy felt the color
rushing into her face, but she scouted the possibility."The idea of
Webb's falling in love with any one!""I should as soon expect
to see old Storm King toppling over.""Still waters run--" began Maggie, but a sudden flash from Webb's eyes
checked her."Some still waters don't run at all.Not
for the world would I have Webb incur the dreadful risk that you suggest.""I think I'm almost old enough to take care of myself, sister Amy, and I
promise you to try to be as entertaining as such an old fellow can be.As
to falling in love with you, that happened long ago--the first evening
you came, when you stood in the doorway blushing and frightened at the
crowd of your new relations.""Haven't I got over being afraid of them remarkably?I never was a bit
afraid of you even at first.It took me a long time, however, to find out
how learned you were, and what deep subjects are required to interest
you.Alas, I shall never be a deep subject."Clifford, putting his arm around her, "you have
come like sunshine into the old home, and we old people can't help
wishing you may never go out of it while we are alive.""I'm not a bit jealous, Amy," said Maggie."I think it's time this mutual admiration society broke up," the young
girl said, with tears trembling in her eyes."When I think of it all, and
what a home I've found, I'm just silly enough to cry.I think it's time,
Burt, that you obtained your father's and mother's forgiveness or
blessing, or whatever it is to be.""You are right, Amy, as you always are.and
if you will accompany us, sir (to his father), you shall learn the
meaning of Amy's four-leaved clover.""You needn't think you are going to get Amy without my consent," Leonard
called after him."I've known her longer than any of you--ever since she
was a little girl at the depot."Amy and Webb began laughing so heartily at the speaker that he went away
remarking that he could pick apples if he couldn't solve riddles."Come up to my room, Amy," said Maggie, excitedly."No, no, Mother Eve, I shall go to my own room, and dress for company.""Burt said something more than
good-by to Miss Hargrove last evening."Amy would not answer, and the sound of a mirthful snatch of song died
musically away in the distance.Webb," Maggie resumed, "what did _you_ mean by that ominous
flash from your cavern-like eyes?""It meant that Amy has probably been satisfied with one lover in the
family and its unexpected result.I don't wish our relations embarrassed
by the feeling that she must be on her guard against another.""Oh, I see, you don't wish her to be on her guard.""Dear Maggie, whatever you may see, appear blind.Heaven only knows what
you women don't see."I've suspected you for
some time, but thought Burt and Amy were committed to each other.""Amy does not suspect anything, and she must not.She is not ready for
the knowledge, and may never be.All the help I ask is to keep her
unconscious.I've been expecting you would find me out, for you married
ladies have had an experience which doubles your insight, and I'm glad of
the chance to caution you.Amy is happy in loving me as a brother.She
shall never be unhappy in this home if I can prevent it."Maggie entered heart and soul into Webb's cause, for he was a great
favorite with her.He was kind to her children, and in a quiet way taught
them almost as much as they learned at school.He went to his work with
mind much relieved, for she and his mother were the only ones that he
feared might surmise his feeling, and by manner or remark reveal it to
Amy, thus destroying their unembarrassed relations, and perhaps his
chance to win the girl's heart.CHAPTER LVII

OCTOBER HUES AND HARVESTS


Burt's interview with his parents, their mingled surprise, pleasure, and
disappointment, and their deep sympathy, need not be dwelt upon.Clifford was desirous of first seeing Amy, and satisfying himself that
she did not in the slightest degree feel herself slighted or treated in
bad faith, but his wife, with her low laugh, said: "Rest assured, father,
Burt is right.He has won nothing more from Amy than sisterly love,
though I had hoped that he might in time.We shall keep Amy, and gain a new daughter that we have already learned
to admire and love."Burt's mind was too full of the one great theme to remember what Mr.Hargrove had said about the Western land, and when at last Miss Hargrove
came to say good-by, with a blushing consciousness quite unlike her usual
self-possession, he was enchanted anew, and so were all the household.The old people's reception seemed like a benediction; Amy banished the
faintest trace of doubt by her mirthful ecstasies; and after their
mountain experience there was no ice to break between Gertrude and
Maggie.The former was persuaded to defer her trip to New York until the morrow,
and so Amy would have her nutting expedition after all.When Leonard came
down to dinner, Burt took Gertrude's hand, and said, "Now, Len, this is
your only chance to give your consent.You can't have any dinner till you
do."His swift, deprecating look at Amy's laughing face reassured him."Well,"
he said, slowly, as if trying to comprehend it all, "I do believe I'm
growing old.When _did_ all this take
place?""Your eyesight is not to blame, Leonard," said his wife, with much
superiority."It's because you are only a man.""That's all I ever pretended to be."Then, with a dignity that almost
surprised Gertrude, he, as eldest brother, welcomed her in simple,
heartfelt words.At the dinner-table Miss Hargrove referred to the Western land.Burt laid
down his knife and fork, and exclaimed, "I declare, I forgot all about
it!"Miss Hargrove laughed heartily as she said, "A high tribute to me!"and
then made known her father's statement that the Clifford tract in the
West adjoined his own, that it would soon be very valuable, and that he
was interested in the railroad approaching it."I left him," she
concluded, "poring over his maps, and he told me to say to you, sir" (to
Mr.Clifford), "that he wished to see you soon.""How about the four-leaved clover now?"In the afternoon they started for the chestnut-trees.Webb carried a light
ladder, and both he and Burt had dressed themselves in close-fitting
flannel suits for climbing.The orchard, as they passed through it,
presented a beautiful autumn picture.Great heaps of yellow and red cheeked
apples were upon the ground; other varieties were in barrels, some headed
up and ready for market, while Mr.Clifford was giving the final cooperage
to other barrels as fast as they were filled."Father can still head up a barrel better than any of us," Leonard
remarked to Miss Hargrove."Well, my dear," said the old gentleman, "I've had over half a century's
experience.""It's time I obtained some idea of rural affairs," said Gertrude to Webb."There seem to be many different kinds of apples here."Yes, as easily as you know different dress fabrics at Arnold's.Those
umbrella-shaped trees are Rhode Island greenings; those that are rather
long and slender branching are yellow bell-flowers; and those with short
and stubby branches and twigs are the old-fashioned dominies.Don't you see how green the fruit is?It will not be
in perfection till next March.Not only a summer, but an autumn and a
winter are required to perfect that superb apple, but then it becomes one
of Nature's triumphs.Some of those heaps on the ground will furnish
cider and vinegar.Nuts, cider, and a wood fire are among the privations
of a farmer's life.""Farming, as you carry it on, appears to me a fine art.How very full
some of the trees are!and others look as if they had been half picked
over."The largest and ripest apples are taken
off first, and the rest of the fruit improves wonderfully in two or three
weeks.By this course we greatly increase both the quality and the bulk
of the crop.""You are very happy in your calling, Webb.How strange it seems for me to
be addressing you as Webb!""It does not seem so strange to me; nor does it seem strange that I am
talking to you in this way.I soon recognized that you were one of those
fortunate beings in whom city life had not quenched nature."They had fallen a little behind the others, and were out of ear-shot."I think," she said, hesitatingly and shyly, "that I had an ally in you
all along."He laughed and replied, "At one time I was very dubious over my
expedition to Fort Putnam.""I imagine that in suggesting that expedition you put in two words for
yourself.""I wish you might be as happy as I am.I'm not blind either, and I wonder
that Amy is so unconscious.""I hope she will remain so until she awakens as naturally as from sleep.She has never had a brother, and as such I try to act toward her.My one
thought is her happiness, and, perhaps, I can secure it in no other way.I feared long since that you had guessed my secret, and am grateful that
you have not suggested it to Amy.Few would have shown so much delicacy
and consideration.""I'm not sure that you are right, Webb.If Amy knew of your feeling, it
would influence her powerfully."Yes, it was necessary that she should misunderstand me, and think of me
as absorbed in things remote from her life.The knowledge you suggest
might make her very sad, for there never was a gentler-hearted girl.Please use it to prevent the constraint which might
arise between us."Burt now joined them with much pretended jealousy, and they soon reached
the trees, which, under the young men's vigorous blows, rained down the
prickly burrs, downy chestnuts, and golden leaves.Blue jays screamed
indignantly from the mountain-side, and squirrels barked their protest at
the inroads made upon their winter stores.As the night approached the
air grew chilly, and Webb remarked that frost was coming at last.He
hastened home before the others to cover up certain plants that might be
sheltered through the first cold snap.The tenderer ones had long since
been taken up and prepared for winter blooming.To Amy's inquiry where Johnnie was, Maggie had replied that she had gone
nutting by previous engagement with Mr.Alvord, and as the party returned
in the glowing evening they met the oddly assorted friends with their
baskets well filled.In the eyes of the recluse there was a gentler
expression, proving that Johnnie's and Nature's ministry had not been
wholly in vain.He glanced swiftly from Burt to Miss Hargrove, then at
Amy, and a faint suggestion of a smile hovered about his mouth.He was
about to leave them abruptly when Johnnie interposed, pleading: "Mr.Alvord, don't go home till I pick you some of your favorite heart's-ease,
as you call my <DW29>s.They have grown to be as large and beautiful as
they were last spring.Do you know, in the hot weather they were almost
as small as johnny-jumpers?but I wouldn't let 'em be called by that
name.""They will ever be heart's-ease to me, Johnnie-doubly so when you give
them," and he followed her to the garden.In the evening a great pitcher of cider fresh from the press, flanked by
dishes of golden fall pippins and grapes, was placed on the table.The
young people roasted chestnuts on hickory coals, and every one, even to
the invalid, seemed to glow with a kindred warmth and happiness.The city
belle contrasted the true home-atmosphere with the grand air of a city
house, and thanked God for her choice.At an early hour she said good-by
for a brief time and departed with Burt.He was greeted with stately
courtesy by Mrs.Hargrove herself, whom her husband and the prospective
value of the Western land had reconciled to the momentous event.Burt and
Gertrude were formally engaged, and he declared his intention of
accompanying her to the city to procure the significant diamond.After the culminating scenes of Burt's little drama, life went on very
serenely and quietly at the Clifford home.Out of school hours Alf,
Johnnie, and Ned vied with the squirrels in gathering their hoard of
various nuts.The boughs in the orchard grew lighter daily.Frost came as
Webb had predicted, and dahlias, salvias, and other flowers, that had
flamed and glowed till almost the middle of October, turned black in one
morning's sun.The butternut-trees had lost their foliage, and countless
leaves were fluttering down in every breeze like many-hued gems.The
richer bronzed colors of the oak were predominating in the landscape, and
only the apple, cherry, and willow trees about the house kept up the
green suggestion of summer.CHAPTER LVIII

THE MOONLIGHT OMEN


Webb permitted no marked change in his manner.He toiled steadily with
Leonard in gathering the fall produce and in preparing for winter, but
Amy noticed that his old preoccupied look was passing away.Daily he
appeared to grow more genial and to have more time and thought for her.With increasing wonder she learned the richness and fulness of his mind.In the evenings he read aloud to them all with his strong, musical
intonation, in which the author's thought was emphasized so clearly that
it seemed to have double the force that it possessed when she read the
same words herself.He found time for occasional rambles and horseback
excursions, and was so companionable during long rainy days that they
seemed to her the brightest of the week.Maggie smiled to herself and saw
that Webb's spell was working.He was making himself so quietly and
unobtrusively essential to Amy that she would find half of her life gone
if she were separated from him.Gertrude returned for a short time, and then went to the city for the
winter.He was much in New York, and
often with Mr.Hargrove, from whom he was receiving instructions in
regard to his Western expedition.That gentleman's opinion of Burt's
business capacity grew more favorable daily, for the young fellow now
proposed to show that he meant to take life in earnest."If this lasts he
will make a trusty young lieutenant," the merchant thought, "and I can
make his fortune while furthering mine."Burt had plenty of brains and
good executive ability to carry out the wiser counsels of others, while
his easy, vivacious manner won him friends and acceptance everywhere.It was arranged, after his departure, that Amy should visit her friend in
the city, and Webb looked forward to her absence with dread and
self-depreciation, fearing that he should suffer by contrast with the
brilliant men of society, and that the quiet country life would seem
dull, indeed, thereafter.Before Amy went on this visit there came an Indian summer morning in
November, that by its soft, dreamy beauty wooed every one out of doors."Amy," said Webb, after dinner, "suppose we drive over to West Point and
return by moonlight."She was delighted with the idea, and they were soon
slowly ascending the mountain.He felt that this was his special
opportunity, not to break her trustful unconsciousness, but to reveal his
power to interest her and make impressions that should be enduring.He
exerted every faculty to please, recalling poetic and legendary allusions
connected with the trees, plants, and scenes by which they were passing."Oh, Webb, how you idealize nature!""You make every object
suggest something fanciful, beautiful, or entertaining.How have you
learned to do it?""As I told you last Easter Sunday--how long ago it seems--if I have any
power for such idealization it is largely through your influence.My
knowledge was much like the trees as they then appeared.I was prepared
for better things, but the time for them had not yet come.I had studied
the material world in a material sort of way, employing my mind with
facts that were like the bare branches and twigs.You awakened in me a
sense of the beautiful side of nature.Who can
explain the rapid development of foliage and flowers when all is ready?""But, Webb, you appeared, during the summer, to go back to your old
materiality worse than ever.You made me feel that I had no power to do
anything for you.You treated me as if I were your very little sister who
would have to go to school a few years before I could be your companion.""Those were busy days," he replied, laughing."Besides," he added,
hesitatingly, "Burt was at one time inclined to be jealous.Of course, it
was very absurd in him, but I suppose lovers are always a little absurd."I saw whither Burt was drifting long
ago--at the time of the great flood which swept away things of more value
than my silly expectations.What an unsophisticated little goose I was!I
suppose Johnnie expects to be married some day, and in much the same way
I looked forward to woman's fate; and since you all seemed to wish that
it should be Burt, I thought, 'Why not?'Wasn't it lucky for Burt, and,
indeed, for all of you, that I was not a grown-up and sentimental young
woman?Hargrove, by uniting his interests with yours in the West,
will make your fortunes, and Burt will bring you a lovely sister.It
pleases me to see how Gertrude is learning to like you.I used to be
provoked with her at first, because she didn't appreciate you.Do you
know, I think you ought to write?You could make people fall in love with
nature.Americans don't care half as much for out-door life and pursuits
as the English.It seems to me that city life cannot compare with that of
the country.""You may think differently after you have been a few weeks in Gertrude's
elegant home."They had paused again on the brow of Cro' Nest, and were looking out on
the wide landscape."No, Webb," she said; "her home, no doubt, is
elegant, but it is artificial.This is simple and grand, and to-day, seen
through the soft haze, is lovely to me beyond all words.I honestly half
regret that I am going to town.Of course, I shall enjoy myself--I always
do with Gertrude--but the last few quiet weeks have been so happy and
satisfying that I dread any change.""Think of the awful vacuum that your absence will make in the old home!""Well, I'm a little glad; I want to be missed.But I shall write to you
and tell you of all the frivolous things we are doing.Besides, you must
come to see me as often as you can."They saw evening parade, the moon rising meanwhile over Sugarloaf
Mountain, and filling the early twilight with a soft radiance.The music
seemed enchanting, for their hearts were attuned to it.As the long line
of cadets shifted their guns from "carry arms" to "shoulder arms" with
instantaneous action, Webb said that the muskets sent out a shivering
sound like that of a tree almost ready to fall under the last blows of an
axe.Webb felt that should he exist millions of ages he should never forget the
ride homeward.The moon looked through the haze like a veiled beauty, and
in its softened light Amy's pure, sweet profile was endowed with ethereal
beauty.The beech trees, with their bleached leaves still clinging to them,
were almost spectral, and the oaks in their bronzed foliage stood like
black giants by the roadside.There were suggestive vistas of light and
shadow that were full of mystery, making it easy to believe that on a night
like this the mountain was haunted by creatures as strange as the fancy
could shape.The supreme gift of a
boundless love overflowed his heart to his very lips.She was so near, and
the spell of her loveliness so strong, that at times he felt that he must
give it expression, but he ever restrained himself.His words might bring
pain and consternation to the peaceful face.She was alone with him, and
there would be no escape should he speak now.No; he had resolved to wait
till her heart awoke by its own impulses, and he would keep his purpose
even through the witchery of that moonlight drive."How strangely isolated
we are," he thought, "that such feeling as mine can fill my very soul with
its immense desire, and she not be aware of anything but my quiet,
fraternal manner!"As they were descending the home <DW72> of the mountain they witnessed a
rare and beautiful sight.A few light clouds had gathered around the
moon, and these at last opened in a rift.The rays of light through the
misty atmosphere created the perfect colors of a rainbow, and this
phenomenon took the remarkable form of a shield, its base resting upon
one cloud, and its point extending into a little opening in the cloud
above."Was there ever anything so
strange and lovely?"Webb checked his horse, and they looked at the vision with wonder."I
never saw anything to equal that," said Webb.she asked, turning a little from him that she
might look upward, and leaning on his shoulder with the unconsciousness
of a child."Let us make it one, dear sister Amy," he said, drawing her nearer to
him."Let it remind you, as you recall it, that as far as I can I will
ever shield you from every evil of life."As he spoke the rainbow colors
became wonderfully distinct, and then faded slowly away.Her head drooped
lower on his shoulder, and she said, dreamily:

"It seems to me that I never was so happy before in my life as I am now.You are so different, and can be so much to me, now that your old absurd
constraint is gone.Oh, Webb, you used to make me so unhappy!You made me
feel that you had found me out--how little I knew, and that it was a bore
to have to talk with me and explain.I went everywhere with papa, and he always appeared to think
of me as a little girl.And then during the last year or two of his life
he was so ill that I did not do much else than watch over him with fear
and trembling, and try to nurse him and beguile the hours that were so
full of pain and weakness.But I'm not contented to be ignorant, and you
can teach me so much.I fairly thrill with excitement and feeling
sometimes when you are reading a fine or beautiful thing.If I can feel
that way I can't be stupid, can I?""Think how much faster I could learn this winter if you would direct my
reading, and explain what is obscure!""I will very gladly do anything you wish.There is a stupidity of heart which is
far worse than that of the mind, a selfish callousness in regard to
others and their rights and feelings, which mars the beauty of some women
worse than physical deformity.From the day you entered our home as a
stranger, graceful tact, sincerity, and the impulse of ministry have
characterized your life.Can you imagine that mere cleverness, trained
mental acuteness, and a knowledge of facts can take the place of these
traits?No man can love unless he imagines that a woman has these
qualities, and bitter will be his disappointment if he finds them
wanting."Her laugh rang out musically on the still air."I believe you have constructed an ideally perfect
creature out of nature, and that you hold trysts with her on moonlight
nights, you go out to walk so often alone.Well, well, I won't be jealous
of such a sister-in-law, but I want to keep you a little while longer
before you follow Burt's example.""I shall never give you a sister-in-law, Amy.""You don't know what you'll do.If you ever love, it will be for always; and I don't
like to think of it.I'd like to keep you just as you are.Now that you
see how selfish I am, where is woman's highest charm?"Webb laughed, and urged his horse into a sharp trot."I am unchangeable
in my opinions too, as far as you are concerned," he remarked."She is
not ready yet," was his silent thought.When she came down to the late supper her eyes were shining with
happiness, and Maggie thought the decisive hour had come; but in answer
to a question about the drive, Amy said, "I couldn't have believed that
so much enjoyment was to be had in one afternoon.Webb is a brother worth
having, and I'm sorry I'm going to New York.""Oh, you are excellent, as far as you go, but you are so wrapped up in
Maggie that you are not of much account; and as for Burt, he is more over
head and ears than you are.Even if a woman was in love, I should think
she would like a man to be sensible."you don't know what you are talking About," said Maggie.I suppose it is a kind of disease, and that all are more
or less out of their heads.""We've been out of our heads a good many years, mother, haven't we?""Well," said Leonard, "I just hope Amy will catch the disease, and have
it very bad some day."When I do, I'll send for Dr.A few days later Webb took her to New York, and left her with her friend."Don't be persuaded into staying very long," he found opportunity to say,
in a low tone."Indeed I won't; I'm homesick already;" and she looked after him very
wistfully.Gertrude looked so hurt and disappointed
when she spoke of returning, and had planned so much, that days
lengthened into weeks.CHAPTER LIX

THE HOSE REVEALS ITS HEART


Webb returned to a region that was haunted.Wherever he went, a presence
was there before him.In every room, on the lawn, in the garden, in lanes
no longer shaded, but carpeted with brown, rustling leaves, on mountain
roads, he saw Amy with almost the vividness of actual vision, as he had
seen her in these places from the time of her first coming.At church he
created her form in her accustomed seat, and his worship was a little
confused.She had asked him to write, and he made home life and the
varying aspects of nature real to her.His letters, however, were so
impersonal that she could read the greater part of them to Gertrude, who
had resolved to be pleased out of good-will to Webb, and with the
intention of aiding his cause.But she soon found herself expressing
genuine wonder and delight at their simple, vigorous diction, their
subtile humor, and the fine poetic images they often suggested."Oh,
Amy," she said, "I couldn't have believed it.I don't think he himself is
aware of his power of expression.""He has read and observed so much," Amy replied, "that he has much to
express.""It's more than that," said Gertrude; "there are touches here and there
which mere knowledge can't account for.They have a delicacy and beauty
which seem the result of woman's influence, and I believe it is yours.I
should think you would be proud of him.""I am," she answered, with exultation and heightened color, "but it seems
absurd to suppose that such a little ignoramus as I am can help him
much."Meanwhile, to all appearance, Webb maintained the even tenor of his way.He had been so long schooled in patience that he waited and hoped on in
silence as before, and busied himself incessantly.The last of the corn
was husked, and the golden treasure stored.The stalks were stacked near
the barn for winter use, and all the labors of the year were rounded out
and completed.Twice he went to the city to see Amy, and on one of these
occasions he was a guest at a large party given in her honor.During much
of the evening he was dazzled by her beauty, and dazed by her
surroundings.Her father had had her instructed carefully in dancing, and
she and Burt had often waltzed together, but he could scarcely believe
his eyes as she appeared on the floor unsurpassed in beauty and grace,
her favor sought by all.Was that the simple girl who on the shaggy sides
of Storm King had leaned against his shoulder?Miss Hargrove gave him little time for such musings.She, as hostess,
often took his arm and made him useful.The ladies found him reserved
rather than shy, but he was not long among the more mature and thoughtful
men present before a knot gathered around him, and some of Mr.Hargrove's
more intimate friends ventured to say, "There seems to be plenty of
brains in the family into which your daughter is to enter."After an hour or two had passed, and Amy had not had a chance to speak to
him, he began to look so disconsolate that she came and whispered,
"What's the matter, old fellow?""Oh, Amy," he replied, discontentedly, "I wish we were back on Storm
King."So do I," she said, "and so we will be many a time again.But you are
not out of place here.I heard one lady remarking how'reserved and
_distingue_ you were, and another," she added, with a flash of her
ever-ready mirthfulness, "said you were 'deliciously homely.'I was just
delighted with that compliment," and she flitted away to join her partner
in the dance.Webb brightened up amazingly after this, and before he
departed in the "wee sma' hours," when the rooms were empty, Gertrude
gave him a chance for a brief, quiet talk, which proved that Amy's heart
was still in the Highlands, even if he did not yet possess it.Burt would not return till late in December; but Amy came home about the
middle of the month, and received an ovation that was enough "to turn any
one's head," she declared.Their old quiet life was resumed, and Webb
watched keenly for any discontent with it."I've had my little fling," she said, "and I suppose it was
time I saw more of the world and society, but oh, what a refuge and haven
of rest the old place is!Gertrude is lovely, her father very gallant and
polite, but Mrs.Hargrove's stateliness oppresses me, and in society I
felt that I had to take a grain of salt with everything said to me.Gertrude showed her sense in preferring a home.I was in some superb
houses in the city that did not seem like homes."Webb, in his solicitude that the country-house should not appear dull,
found time to go out with her on pleasant days, and to interest her
deeply in a course of reading.It was a season of leisure; but his mother
began to smile to herself as she saw how absorbed he was in his pupil.The nights grew colder, the stars gained a frosty glitter, the ground was
rock-like, and the ponds were covered with a glare of black ice.Amy was
eager to learn to skate, and Webb found his duty of instructor
delightful.Little danger of her falling, although, with a beginner's
awkwardness, she essayed to do so often; strong arms were ever near and
ready, and any one would have been glad to catch Amy in such peril.They were now looking forward to Burt's return and the holiday season,
which Gertrude would spend with them.Not merely the shops, but busy and stealthy fingers, would furnish the
gifts.Webb had bought his present for Amy, but had also burned the
midnight oil in the preparation of another--a paper for a magazine, and
it had been accepted.He had planned and composed it while at work
stripping the husks from the yellow corn, superintending the wood teams
and the choppers in the mountain, and aiding in cutting from an adjacent
pond the crystal blocks of ice--the stored coolness for the coming
summer.Then while others thought him sleeping he wrote and rewrote the
thoughts he had harvested during the day.One of his most delightful tasks, however, was in aiding Amy to embower
the old house in wreaths and festoons of evergreens.The rooms grew into
aromatic bowers.Autumn leaves and ferns gave to the heavier decorations
a light, airy beauty which he had never seen before.Grace itself Amy
appeared as she mounted the step-ladder and reached here and there,
twining and coaxing everything into harmony.What was the effect of all this companionship on her mind?She least of
all could have answered: she did not analyze.She was being carried forward on a shining tide of happiness, and
yet its motion was so even, quiet, and strong that there was nothing to
disturb her maidenly serenity.If Webb had been any one but Webb, and if
she had been in the habit of regarding all men as possible admirers, she
would have understood herself long before this.If she had been brought
up with brothers in her own home she would have known that she welcomed
this quiet brother with a gladness that had a deeper root than sisterly
affection.But the fact that he was Webb, the quiet, self-controlled man
who had called her sister Amy for a year, made his presence, his deep
sympathy with her and for her, seem natural.His approaches had been so
gradual that he was stealing into her heart as spring enters a flower.You can never name the first hour of its presence; you take no note of
the imperceptible yet steady development.The process is quiet, yet vital
and sure, and at last there comes an hour when the bud is ready to open.That time was near, and Webb hoped that it was.His tones were now and
then so tender and gentle that she looked at him a little wonderingly,
but his manner was quiet and far removed from that of the impetuous Burt.There was a warmth in it, however, like the increasing power of the sun,
and in human hearts bleak December can be the spring-time as truly as
May.It was the twenty-third--one of the stormiest days of a stormy month.The
snowflakes were whirling without, and making many a circle in the gale
before joining their innumerable comrades that whitened the ground.The
wind sighed and soughed about the old house as it had done a year before,
but Webb and Amy were armed against its mournfulness.They were in the
parlor, on whose wide hearth glowed an ample fire.Burt and Gertrude were
expected on the evening train."Gertie is coming home through the snow just as I did," said Amy,
fastening a spray of mistletoe that a friend had sent her from England to
the chandelier; "and the same old warm welcome awaits her.""What a marvellous year it has been!"Burt is engaged to one of whose
existence he did not know a year ago.He has been out West, and found
that you have land that will make you all rich.""Are these the greatest marvels of the year, Amy?"I didn't know you a year ago to-day, and now
I seem to have known you always, you great patient, homely old
fellow--'deliciously homely.'"The eyes of scores of young fellows looked at you that evening as if you
were deliciously handsome.""And you looked at me one time as if you hadn't a friend in the world,
and you wanted to be back in your native wilds.""Not without you, Amy; and you said you wished you were looking at the
rainbow shield with me again.""Oh, I didn't say all that; and then I saw you needed heartening up a
little."You were dancing with a terrible swell, worth, it was
said, half a million, who was devouring you with his eyes.""I'm all here, thank you, and you look as if you were doing some
devouring yourself."Yes, some color, but it's just as Nature arranged it, and you know
Nature's best work always fascinates me."There, don't you think that is arranged
well?"and she stood beneath the mistletoe looking up critically at it."Let me see if it is," and he advanced to her side."This is the only
test," he said, and quick as a flash he encircled her with his arm and
pressed a kiss upon her lips.She sprang aloof and looked at him with dilating eyes.He had often
kissed her before, and she had thought nothing more of it than of a
brother's salute.Was it a subtile, mysterious power in the mistletoe
itself with which it had been endowed by ages of superstition?Was that
kiss like the final ray of the Jane sun that opens the heart of the rose
when at last it is ready to expand?She looked at him wonderingly,
tremblingly, the color of the rose mounting higher and higher, and
deepening as if the blood were coming from the depths of her heart.In answer to her wondering, questioning look, he only bent
full upon her his dark eyes that had held hers once before in a moment of
terror.She saw his secret in their depths at last, the devotion, the
love, which she herself had unsuspectingly said would "last always."She
took a faltering step toward him, then covered her burning face with her
hands."Amy," he said, taking her gently in his arms, "do you understand me now?Dear, blind little girl, I have been worshipping all these months, and
you have not known it.""I--I thought you were in love with nature," she whispered."So I am, and you are nature in its sweetest and highest embodiment.Every beautiful thing in nature has long suggested you to me.It seems to me now that I
have loved you almost from the first hour I saw you.I have known that I
loved you ever since that June evening when you left me in the rose
garden.Have I not proved that I can be patient and wait?"She only pressed her burning face closer upon his shoulder."It's all
growing clear now," she again whispered."I can be 'only your brother,' if you so wish," he said, gravely."Your
happiness is my first thought."She looked up at him shyly, tears in her eyes, and a smile hovering about
her tremulous lips."I don't think I understood myself any better than I
did you.I never had a brother, and--and--I don't believe I loved you
just right for a brother;" and her face was hidden again.His eyes went up to heaven, as if he meant that his mating should be
recognized there.Then gently stroking her brown hair, he asked, "Then I
shan't have to wait, Amy?"cried Webb, lifting the dewy, flower-like
face and kissing it again and again."Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn't know," began Mr.Clifford from the
doorway, and was about to make a hasty and excited retreat."A year ago you received this dear girl as
your daughter.She has consented to make the tie closer still if
possible."The old gentleman took Amy in his arms for a moment, and then said, "This
is too good to keep to myself for a moment," and he hastened the
blushing, laughing girl to his wife, and exclaimed, "See what I've
brought you for a Christmas present.See what that sly, silent Webb has
been up to.He has been making love to our Amy right under our noses, and
we didn't know it.""_You_ didn't know it, father; mother's eyes are not so blind.Amy,
darling, I've been hoping and praying for this.You have made a good
choice, my dear, if it is his mother that says it.Webb will never
change, and he will always be as gentle and good to you as he has been to
me.""Well, well, well," said Mr.Clifford, "our cup is running over, sure
enough.Maggie, come here," he called, as he heard her step in the hall.I once felt a little like grumbling because we
hadn't a daughter, and now I have three, and the best and prettiest in
the land."Didn't I, Webb--as long ago as last October, too?""Oh, Webb, you ought to have told me first," said Amy, reproachfully,
when they were alone."I did not tell Maggie; she saw," Webb answered.Then, taking a rosebud
which she had been wearing, he pushed open the petals with his finger,
and asked, "Who told me that 'this is no way for a flower to bloom'?I've
watched and waited till your heart was ready, Amy."And so the time flew
in mutual confidences, and the past grew clear when illumined by love.said Amy, with a mingled sigh and laugh."There you were
growing as gaunt as a scarecrow, and I loving you all the time.If you had looked at Gertrude as Burt did I should
have found myself out long ago.Why hadn't you the sense to employ Burt's
tactics?""Because I had resolved that nature should be my sole ally.Was not my
kiss under the mistletoe a better way of awakening my sleeping beauty
than a stab of jealousy?""Yes, Webb, dear, patient Webb.The rainbow shield was a true omen, and I
am sheltered indeed."CHAPTER LX

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS


Leonard had long since gone to the depot, and now the chimes of his
returning bells announced that Burt and Gertrude were near.To them both
it was in truth a coming home.Gertrude rushed in, followed by the
exultant Burt, her brilliant eyes and tropical beauty rendered tenfold
more effective by the wintry twilight without; and she received a welcome
that accorded with her nature.She was hardly in Amy's room, which she
was to share, before she looked in eager scrutiny at her friend.Oh, you little
wild-flower, you've found out that he is saying his prayers to you at
last, have you?Evidently he hasn't said them in vain.Oh, Amy darling, I was true to you and didn't
lose Burt either."Maggie had provided a feast, and Leonard beamed on the table and on every
one, when something in Webb and Amy's manner caught his attention."This
occasion," he began, "reminds me of a somewhat similar one a year ago
to-morrow night.It is my good fortune to bring lovely women into this
household.My first and best effort was made when I brought Maggie.Then
I picked up a little girl at the depot, and she grew into a tall, lovely
creature on the way home, didn't she, Johnnie?And now to-night I've
brought in a princess from the snow, and one of these days poor Webb will
be captured by a female of the MacStinger type, for he will never muster
up courage enough--What on earth are you all laughing about?""Thank you," said Amy, looking like a peony."You had better put your head under Maggie's wing and subside," Webb
added.Then, putting his arm about Amy, he asked, "Is this a female of
the MacStinger type?""Well," said he, at last, "when
_did_ this happen?When I was
courting, the whole neighborhood was talking about it, and knew I was
accepted long before I did.Did you see all this going on, Maggie?""Now, I don't believe Amy saw it herself," cried Leonard, half
desperately, and laughter broke out anew."Oh, Amy, I'm so glad!"said Burt, and he gave her the counterpart of the
embrace that had turned the bright October evening black to Webb."To think that Webb should have got such a prize!""Well, well, the boys in this family are in luck.""It will be my turn next," cried Johnnie."No, sir; I'm the oldest," Alf protested."Let's have supper," Ned remarked, removing his thumb from his mouth."Score one for Ned," said Burt."There is at least one member of the
family whose head is not turned by all these marvellous events."Can the sunshine and fragrance of a June day be photographed?No more can
the light and gladness of that long, happy evening be portrayed.Clifford held Gertrude's hand as she had Amy's when receiving her as a
daughter.The beautiful girl, whose unmistakable metropolitan air was
blended with gentle womanly grace, had a strong fascination for the
invalid.She kindled the imagination of the recluse, and gave her a
glimpse into a world she had never known."Webb," said Amy, as they were parting for the night, "I can see a sad,
pale orphan girl clad in mourning.I can see you kissing her for the
first time.I had a strange little thrill at heart
then, and you said, 'Come to me, Amy, when you are in trouble.'There is
one thing that troubles me to-night.All whom I so dearly love know of my
happiness but papa."Tell it to him, Amy," he answered, gently, "and tell it to God."There were bustle and renewed mystery on the following day.Astonishing-looking packages were smuggled from one room to another.Ned created a succession of panics, and at last the ubiquitous and
garrulous little urchin had to be tied into a chair.Johnnie and Alf
were in the seventh heaven of anticipation, and when Webb brought Amy
a check for fifty dollars, and told her that it was the proceeds of
his first crop from his brains, and that she must spend the money, she
went into Mr.Clifford's room waving it as if it were a trophy such as
no knight had ever brought to his lady-love."Of course, I'll spend it," she cried.It
shall go into books that we can read together.What's that agricultural
jargon of yours, Webb, about returning as much as possible to the soil?We'll return this to the soil," she said, kissing his forehead, "although
I think it is too rich for me already."In the afternoon she and Webb, with a sleigh well laden, drove into the
mountains on a visit to Lumley.He had repaired the rough, rocky lane
leading through the wood to what was no longer a wretched hovel.The
inmates had been expecting this visit, and Lumley rushed bareheaded
out-of-doors the moment he heard the bells.Although he had swept a path
from his door again and again, the high wind would almost instantly drift
in the snow.Poor Lumley had never heard of Sir Walter Raleigh or Queen
Elizabeth, but he had given his homage to a better queen, and with loyal
impulse he instantly threw off his coat, and laid it on the snow, that
Amy might walk dry-shod into the single room that formed his home.She
and Webb smiled significantly at each other, and then the young girl put
her hand into that of the mountaineer as he helped her from the sleigh,
and said "Merry Christmas!"with a smile that brought tears into the eyes
of the grateful man."Yer making no empty wish, Miss Amy.I never thought sich a Christmas 'ud
ever come to me or mine.But come in, come in out of the cold wind, an'
see how you've changed everything.Webb, and I'll tie
an' blanket your hoss.Lord, to think that sich a May blossom 'ud go into
my hut!"Lumley, neatly clad in some dark woollen material,
made a queer, old-fashioned courtesy that her husband had had her
practice for the occasion.But the baby, now grown into a plump, healthy
child, greeted her benefactress with nature's own grace, crowing,
laughing, and calling, "Pitty lady; nice lady," with exuberant welcome.The inmates did not now depend for precarious warmth upon two logs,
reaching across a dirty floor and pushed together, but a neat box,
painted green, was filled with billets of wood.The carpeted floor was
scrupulously clean, and so was the bright new furniture.A few evergreen
wreaths hung on the walls with the pictures that Amy had given, and on
the mantel was her photograph--poor Lumley's patron saint.Webb brought in his armful of gifts, and Amy took the child on her lap
and opened a volume of dear old "Mother Goose," profusely illustrated in
 prints--that classic that appeals alike to the hearts of
children, whether in mountain hovels or city palaces.The man looked on
as if dazed.Webb," he said, in his loud whisper, "I once saw a
picter of the Virgin and Child.Oh, golly, how she favors it!"Lumley," Amy began, "I think your housekeeping does you much
credit.I've not seen a neater room anywhere.""Well, mum, my ole man's turned over a new leaf sure nuff.There's no
livin' with him unless everythink is jesso, an, I guess it's better so,
too.Ef I let things git slack, he gits mighty savage.""You must try to be patient, Mr.You've made great changes for
the better, but you must remember that old ways can't be broken up in a
moment.""Lor' bless yer, Miss Amy, there's no think like breakin' off short,
there's nothink like turnin' the corner sharp, and fightin' the devil
tooth and nail.It's an awful tussle at first, an' I thought I was goin'
to knuckle under more'n once.So I would ef it hadn't 'a ben fer you, but
you give me this little ban', Miss Amy, an' looked at me as if I wa'n't a
beast, an' it's ben a liftin' me up ever sence.Oh, I've had good folks
talk at me an' lecter, an' I ben in jail, but it all on'y made me mad.The best on 'em wouldn't 'a teched me no more than they would a rattler,
sich as we killed on the mountain.But you guv me yer han', Miss Amy, an'
thar's mine on it agin; I'm goin' to be a _man_."She took the great horny palm in both her hands."You make me very
happy," she said, simply, looking at him above the head of his child,
"and I'm sure your wife is going to help you.I shall enjoy the holidays
far more for this visit.You've told us good news, and we've got good
news for you and your wife."Yes, Lumley," said Webb, clapping the man on the shoulder, "famous news.This little girl has been helping me just as much as she has you, and she
has promised to help me through life.One of these days we shall have a
home of our own, and you shall have a cottage near it, and the little
girl here that you've named Amy shall go to school and have a better
chance than you and your wife have had."exclaimed the man, almost breaking out into a
hornpipe."The Lord on'y knows what will happen ef things once git a
goin' right!Webb, thar's my han' agin'.Ef yer'd gone ter heaven fer
her, yer couldn't 'a got sich a gell.Well, well, give me a chance on yer
place, an' I'll work fer yer all the time, even nights an' Sundays."The child dropped her books and toys,
and clung to Amy."She knows yer; she knows all about yer," said the
delighted father."Well, ef yer must go, yer'll take suthin' with us;"
and from a great pitcher of milk he filled several goblets, and they all
drank to the health of little Amy."Yer'll fin' half-dozen pa'triges
under the seat, Miss Amy," he said, as they drove away."I was bound I'd
have some kind of a present fer yer."She waved her hand back to him, and saw him standing bareheaded in the
cutting wind, looking after her."Poor old Lumley was right," said Webb, drawing her to him; "I do feel as
if I had received my little girl from heaven.We will give those people a
chance, and try to turn the law of heredity in the right direction."Alvord sat over his lonely hearth,
his face buried in his hands.The day had been terribly long and
torturing; memory had presented, like mocking spectres, his past and what
it might have been.A sense of loneliness, a horror of great darkness,
overwhelmed him.Nature had grown cold and forbidding, and was losing its
power to solace.Johnnie, absorbed in her Christmas preparations, had not
been to see him for a long time.He had gone to inquire after her on the
previous evening, and through the lighted window of the Clifford home had
seen a picture that had made his own abode appear desolate indeed.In
despairing bitterness he had turned away, feeling that that happy home
was no more a place for him than was heaven.He had wandered out into the
storm for hours, like a lost spirit, and at last had returned and slept
in utter exhaustion.On the morning preceding Christmas memory awoke with
him, and as night approached he was sinking into sullen, dreary apathy.There was a light tap at the door, but he did not hear it.A child's face
peered in at his window, and Johnnie saw him cowering over his dying
fire.She had grown accustomed to his moods, and had learned to be
fearless, for she had banished his evil spells before.Therefore she
entered softly, laid down her bundles and stood beside him.she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.He started up,
and at the same moment a flickering blaze rose on the hearth, and
revealed the sunny-haired child standing beside him.If an angel had
come, the effect could not have been greater.Like all who are morbid, he
was largely under the dominion of imagination; and Johnnie, with her
fearless, gentle, commiserating eyes, had for him the potency of a
supernatural visitor.But the healthful, unconscious child had a better
power.Her words and touch brought saneness as well as hope.Alvord," she cried, "were you asleep?your fire is going
out, and your lamp is not lighted, and there is nothing ready for your
supper.What a queer man you are, for one who is so kind!Mamma said I
might come and spend a little of Christmas-eve with you, and bring my
gifts, and then that you would bring me home.I know how to fix up your
fire and light your lamp.and she bustled around, the embodiment of beautiful life.he said, taking her sweet face in his hands, and looking
into her clear eyes, "Heaven must have sent you.I was so lonely and sad
that I wished I had never lived."See what I've brought you,"
and she opened a book with the angels' song of "peace and good-will"
illustrated."Mamma says that whoever believes that ought to be happy,"
said the child."Yes, it's true for those who are like you and your mother."She leaned against him, and looked over his shoulder at the pictures.Alvord, mamma said the song was for you, too.Of course, mamma's
right.What else did He come for but to help people who are in trouble?I
read stories about Him every Sunday to mamma, and He was always helping
people who were in trouble, and who had done wrong.That's why we are
always glad on Christmas.You look at the book while I set your table."He did look at it till his eyes were blinded with tears, and like a sweet
refrain came the words.Half an hour later Leonard, with a kindly impulse, thought he would go to
take by the hand Johnnie's strange friend, and see how the little girl
was getting on.The scene within, as he passed the window, checked his
steps.Alvord's table, pouring tea for
him, chattering meanwhile with a child's freedom, and the hermit was
looking at her with such a smile on his haggard face as Leonard had never
seen there.He walked quietly home, deferring his call till the morrow,
feeling that Johnnie's spell must not be broken.Alvord put Johnnie down at her home, for he had
insisted on carrying her through the snow, and for the first time kissed
her, as he said:

"Good-by.You, to-night, have been like one of the angels that brought
the tidings of 'peace and good-will.'""I'm sorry for him, mamma!"said the little girl, after telling her
story, "for he's very lonely, and he's such a queer, nice man.Isn't it
funny that he should be so old, and yet not know why we keep Christmas?"Amy sang again the Christmas hymn that her own father and the father who
had adopted her had loved so many years before.Clifford, as he was fondly bidding her good-night, "how sweetly you have
fulfilled the hopes you raised one year ago!"Clifford had gone to her room, leaning on the arm of Gertrude.As
the invalid kissed her in parting, she said:

"You have beautiful eyes, my dear, and they have seen far more of the
world than mine, but, thank God, they are clear and true.Keep them so,
my child, that I may welcome you again to a better home than this."Once more "the old house stood silent and dark in the pallid landscape."The winds were hushed, as if the peace within had been breathed into the
very heart of Nature, and she, too, could rest in her wintry sleep.The
moon was obscured by a veil of clouds, and the outlines of the trees were
faint upon the snow.A shadowy form drew near; a man paused, and looked
upon the dwelling."If the angels' song could be heard anywhere to-night,
it should be over that home," Mr.Alvord murmured; but, even to his
morbid fancy, the deep silence of the night remained unbroken.He
returned to his home, and sat down in the firelight.A golden-haired
child again leaned upon his shoulder, and asked, "What else did He come
for but to help people who are in trouble, and who have done wrong?"Was it a voice deep in his own soul that was longing to
escape from evil?or was it a harmony far away in the sky, that whispered
of peace at last?That message from heaven is clearest where the need is
greatest.Hargrove's home was almost a palace, but its stately rooms were
desolate on Christmas-eve.He wandered restlessly through their
magnificence.He paid no heed to the costly furniture and costlier works
of art."Trurie was right," he muttered."What power have these things to
satisfy when the supreme need of the heart is unsatisfied?It seems as if
I could not sleep to-night without seeing her.There is no use in
disguising the truth that I'm losing her.Even on Christmas-eve she is
absent.It's late, and since I cannot see her, I'll see her gift;" and he
went to her room, where she had told him to look for her remembrance.To his surprise, he found that, according to her secret instructions, it
was lighted.He entered the dainty apartment, and saw the glow of autumn
leaves and the airy grace of ferns around the pictures and windows.He
started, for he almost saw herself, so true was the life-size and
lifelike portrait that smiled upon him.Beneath it were the words, "Merry
Christmas, papa!You have not lost me; you have only made me happy."The moon is again rising over old Storm King; the crystals that cover the
white fields and meadows are beginning to flash in its rays; the great
pine by the Clifford home is sighing and moaning.What heavy secret has
the old tree that it can sigh with such a group near as is now gathered
beneath it?Burt's black horse rears high as he reins him in, that
Gertrude may spring into the cutter, then speeds away like a shadow
through the moonlight Webb's steed is strong and quiet, like himself, and
as tireless.Amy steps to Webb's side, feeling it to be her place in very
truth.Sable Abram draws up next, with the great family sleigh, and in a
moment Alf is perched beside him.Then Leonard half smothers Johnnie and
Ned under the robes, and Maggie, about to pick her way through the snow,
finds herself taken up in strong arms, like one of the children, and is
with them.The chime of bells dies away in the distance.Wedding-bells
will be their echo.*       *       *       *       *

The merry Christmas-day has passed.Barkdale, and other friends have come and gone with their greetings;
the old people are left alone beside their cheery fire."Here we are, mother, all by ourselves, just as we were once before on
Christmas night, when you were as fair and blooming as Amy or Gertrude.Well, my dear, the long journey seems short to-night.I suppose the
reason is that you have been such good company.""Dear old father, the journey would have been long and weary indeed, had
I not had your strong arm to lean upon, and a love that didn't fade with
my roses.There is only one short journey before us now, father, and then
we shall know fully the meaning of the 'good tidings of great joy'
forever."He bids his charioteer pause; he cannot fight those he loves.His
charioteer turns: 't is the radiant face of divine Chrishna, his
Saviour!Even He has led him to this grievous contention with kinsmen,
and those to whose welfare he was devoted.Chrishna instructs his
disciple that the war is an illusion; it is the conflict by which,
from age to age, the divine life in the world is preserved."This
imperishable devotion I declared to the sun, the sun delivered it to
Manu, Manu to Ikshaku; handed down from one to another it was studied by
the royal sages.In the lapse of time that devotion was lost.It is even
the same discipline which I this day communicate to thee, for thou
art my servant and my friend.Both thou and I have passed through many
births.Mine are known to me; thou knowest not of thine.I am made
evident by my own power: as often as there is a decline of virtue, and
an insurrection of wrong and injustice in the world, I appear."Paine could not indeed know his former births; and, indeed, each former
self of his--Wycliffe, Fox, Roger Williams--was sectarianized beyond
recognition.He could hardly see kinsmen in the Unitarians, who were
especially eager to disown the heretic affiliated on them by opponents;
nor in the Wesleyans, though in him was the blood of their apostle, who
declared salvation a present life, free to all.In a profounder sense,
Paine was George Fox.Here was George Fox disowned, freed from his
accidents, naturalized in the earth and humanized in the world of men.Paine is explicable only by the intensity of his Quakerism, consuming
its own traditions as once the church's ceremonies and sacraments.On
him, in Thetford meeting-house, rolled the burden of that Light that
enlighteneth every man, effacing distinctions of rank, race, sex, making
all equal, clearing away privilege, whether of priest or mediator,
subjecting all scriptures to its immediate illumination.This faith was a fearful heritage to carry, even in childhood, away from
the Quaker environment which, by mixture with modifying "survivals," in
habit and doctrine, cooled the fiery gospel for the average tongue.The intermarriage of Paine's father with a family in the English Church
brought the precocious boy's Light into early conflict with his kindred,
his little lamp being still fed in the meeting-house.A child brought up
without respect for the conventional symbols of religion, or even with
pious antipathy to them, is as if born with only one spiritual skin; he
will bleed at a touch."I well remember, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing
a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great devotee of the
Church, upon the subject of what is called _redemption by the death of
the Son of God_.After the sermon was ended I went into the garden,
and as I was going down the garden steps, (for I perfectly remember the
spot), I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought
to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man,
that killed his son when he could not revenge himself in any other way;
and, as I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could
not see for what purpose they preached such sermons.This was not one of
that kind of thoughts that had anything in it of childish levity; it was
to me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was
too good to do such an action, and also too almighty to be under any
necessity of doing it.I believe in the same manner at this moment; and
I moreover believe that any system of religion that has anything in it
which shocks the mind of a child, cannot be a true system."The child took his misgivings out into the garden; he would not by a
denial shock his aunt Cocke's faith as his own had been shocked.For
many years he remained silent in his inner garden, nor ever was drawn
out of it until he found the abstract dogma of the death of God's Son an
altar for sacrificing men, whom he reverenced as all God's sons.What he
used to preach at Dover and Sandwich cannot now be known.His ignorance
of Greek and Latin, the scholastic "humanities," had prevented his
becoming a clergyman, and introduced him to humanities of another kind.His mission was then among the poor and ignorant.*

     * "Old John Berry, the late Col.Hay's servant, told me he
     knew Paine very well when he was at Dover--had heard him
     preach there--thought him a staymaker by trade."--W.Weedon,
     of Glynde, quoted in Notes and Queries (London), December
     29, 1866.Sixteen years later he is in Philadelphia, attending the English Church,
in which he had been confirmed.There were many deists in that Church,
whose laws then as now were sufficiently liberal to include them.In his
"Common Sense" (published January 10, 1776) Paine used the reproof of
Israel (I. Samuel) for desiring a King.John Adams, a Unitarian and
monarchist, asked him if he really believed in the inspiration of the
Old Testament.Paine said he did not, and intended at a later period to
publish his opinions on the subject.There was nothing inconsistent in
Paine's believing that a passage confirmed by his own Light was a
divine direction, though contained in a book whose alleged inspiration
throughout he did not accept.Before
that, soon after his arrival in the country, when he found African
Slavery supported by the Old Testament, Paine had repudiated the
authority of that book; he declares it abolished by "Gospel light,"
which includes man-stealing among the greatest crimes.When, a year
later, on the eve of the Revolution, he writes "Common Sense," he has
another word to say about religion, and it is strictly what the human
need of the hour demands.Whatever his disbeliefs, he could never
sacrifice human welfare to them, any more than he would, suffer dogmas
to sacrifice the same.It would have been a grievous sacrifice of the
great cause of republican independence, consequently, of religious
liberty, had he introduced a theological controversy at the moment
when it was of vital importance that the sects should rise above their
partition-walls and unite for a great common end.The Quakers, deistical
as they were, preserved religiously the separatism once compulsory; and
Paine proved himself the truest Friend among them when he was "moved"
by the Spirit of Humanity, for him at length the Holy Spirit, to utter
(1776) his brave cheer for Catholicity."As to religion, I hold it to be the indispensable duty of all
governments to protect all conscientious professors thereof, and I know
of no other business which government hath to do therewith.Let a man
throw aside that narrowness of soul, that selfishness of principle,
which the niggards of all professions are so unwilling to part with, and
he will be at once delivered of his fears on that head.Suspicion is the
companion of mean souls, and the bane of all good society.For myself,
I fully and conscientiously believe, that it is the will of the Almighty
that there should be a diversity of religious opinions amongst us: it
affords a larger field for our Christian kindness.Were we all of
one way of thinking, our religious dispositions would want matter
for probation; and, on this liberal principle, I look on the various
denominations among us to be like children of the same family, differing
only in what is called their Christian names."There was no pedantry whatever about Paine, this obedient son of
Humanity.He would defend Man against men, against sects and parties;
he would never quarrel about the botanical label of a tree bearing such
fruits as the Declaration of Independence.But no man better knew the
power of words, and that a botanical error may sometimes result in
destructive treatment of the tree.For this reason he censured the
Quakers for opposing the Revolution on the ground that, in the words
of their testimony (1776), "the setting up and putting down kings and
governments is God's peculiar prerogative."Kings, he answers, are not
removed by miracles, but by just such means as the Americans were using.Charles, then, died not by the hands of
man; and should the present proud imitator of him come to the same
untimely end, the writers and publishers of the Testimony are bound, by
the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact."In his "Epistle to Quakers" he speaks of the
dispersion of the Jews as "foretold by our Saviour."In his famous first
_Crisis_ he exhorts the Americans not to throw "the burden of the day
upon Providence, but'show your faith by your works,' that God may bless
you."For in those days there was visible to such eyes as his, as to
anti-slavery eyes in our civil war,

     "A fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel."The Republic, not American but Human, became Paine's religion."Divine
Providence intends this country to be the asylum of persecuted
virtue from every quarter of the globe."So he had written before the
Declaration of Independence.In 1778 he finds that there still survives
some obstructive superstition among English churchmen in America about
the connection of Protestant Christianity with the King.In his seventh
_Crisis_(November 21, 1778) he wrote sentences inspired by his new
conception of religion."In a Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood
still at individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the
original rudeness of nature.... As individuals we profess ourselves
Christians, but as nations we are heathens, Romans, and what not.I
remember the late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons,
and that in the time of peace, 'That the city of Madrid laid in ashes
was not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder
of an English sloop of war.'...The arm of Britain has been spoken of as
the arm of the Almighty, and she has lived of late as if she thought
the whole world created for her diversion.Her politics, instead
of civilizing, has tended to brutalize mankind, and under the vain
unmeaning title of 'Defender of the Faith,' she has made war like an
Indian on the Religion of Humanity."'Thus, forty years before Auguste Comte sat, a youth of twenty, at the
feet of Saint Simon, learning the principles now known as "The Religion
of Humanity,"* Thomas Paine had not only minted the name, but with it
the idea of international civilization, in which nations are to treat
each other as gentlemen in private life.National honor was, he said,
confused with "bullying"; but "that which is the best character for an
individual is the best character for a nation."The great and pregnant
idea was, as in the previous instances, occasional.It was a sentence
passed upon the "Defender-of-the-Faith" superstition, which detached
faith from humanity, and had pressed the Indian's tomahawk into the
hands of Jesus.Thaddeus B. Wakeman, an eminent representative of the
     "Religion of Humanity," writes me that he has not found this
     phrase in any work earlier than Paine's _Crisis_, vii.At the close of the American Revolution there appeared little need for
a religious reformation.The people were happy, prosperous, and, there
being no favoritism toward any sect under the new state constitutions,
but perfect equality and freedom, the Religion of Humanity meant
sheathing of controversial swords also.It summoned every man to lend a
hand in repairing the damages of war, and building the new nationality.Paine therefore set about constructing his iron bridge of thirteen
symbolic ribs, to overleap the ice-floods and quicksands of rivers.His
assistant in this work, at Bordentown, New Jersey, John Hall, gives us
in his journal, glimpses of the religious ignorance and fanaticism of
that region.But Paine showed no aggressive spirit towards them."My
employer," writes Hall (1786), "has _Common Sense_ enough to disbelieve
most of the common systematic theories of Divinity, but does not seem
to establish any for himself."In all of his intercourse with Hall (a
Unitarian just from England), and his neighbors, there is no trace
of any disposition to deprive any one of a belief, or to excite any
controversy.Humanity did not demand it, and by that direction he left
the people to their weekly toils and Sunday sermons.But when (1787) he was in England, Humanity gave another command.It was
obeyed in the eloquent pages on religious liberty and equality in "The
Rights of Man."Burke had alarmed the nation by pointing out that the
Revolution in France had laid its hand on religion.The cry was raised
that religion was in danger.Paine then uttered his impressive paradox:

"Toleration is not the opposite of intoleration, but the counterfeit
of it.The one assumes the right of withholding
liberty of conscience, and the other of granting it.The one is the pope
armed with fire and <DW19>, the other is the pope selling or granting
indulgences.... Toleration by the same assumed authority by which it
tolerates a man to pay his worship, presumptuously and blasphemously
sets itself up to tolerate the Almighty to receive it.... Who then art
thou, vain dust and ashes, by whatever name thou art called, whether a
king, a bishop, a church or a state, a parliament or anything else, that
obtrudest thine insignificance between the soul of man and his maker?If he believes not as thou believest, it is a
proof that thou believest not as he believeth, and there is no earthly
power can determine between you.... Religion, without regard to names,
as directing itself from the universal family of mankind to the divine
object of all adoration, is man bringing to his maker the fruits of his
heart; and though these fruits may differ like the fruits of the earth,
the grateful tribute of every one is accepted."This, which I condense with reluctance, was the affirmation which the
Religion of Humanity needed in England.But when he came to sit in the
French Convention a new burden rolled upon him.There was Marat with the
Bible always before him, picking out texts that justified his murders;
there were Robespierre and Couthon invoking the God of Nature to
sanction just such massacres as Marat found in his Bible; and there were
crude "atheists" consecrating the ferocities of nature more dangerously
than if they had named them Siva, Typhon, or Satan.Paine had published
the rights of man for men; but here human hearts and minds had been
buried under the superstitions of ages.The great mischief had ensued,
to use his own words, "by the possession of power before they understood
principles: they earned liberty in words but not in fact" Exhumed
suddenly, as if from some Nineveh, resuscitated into semi-conscious
strength, they remembered only the methods of the allied inquisitors and
tyrants they were overthrowing; they knew no justice but vengeance; and
when on crumbled idols they raised forms called "Nature" and "Reason,"
old idols gained life in the new forms.These were the gods which had
but too literally created, by the slow evolutionary force of human
sacrifices, the new revolutionary priesthood.Their massacres could not
be questioned by those who acknowledged the divine hand in the slaughter
of Canaanites.*

     * On August 10, 1793, there was a sort of communion of the
     Convention around the statue of Nature, whose breasts were
     fountains of water.Herault de Sechelles, at that time
     president, addressed the statue: "Sovereign of the savage
     and of the enlightened nations, O Nature, this great people,
     gathered at the first beam of day before thee, is free!It
     is in thy bosom, it is in thy sacred sources, that it has
     recovered its rights, that it has regenerated itself after
     traversing so many ages of error and servitude: it must
     return to the simplicity of thy ways to rediscover liberty
     and equality.receive the expression of the
     eternal attachment of the French people for thy laws; and
     may the teeming waters gushing from thy breasts, may this
     pure beverage which refreshed the first human beings,
     consecrate in this Cup of Fraternity and Equality the vows
     that France makes thee this day,--the most beautiful that
     the sun has illumined since it was suspended in the
     immensity of space."The cup passed around from lip to lip,
     amid fervent ejaculations.Next year Nature's breasts
     issued Herault's blood.The Religion of Humanity again issued its command to its minister.The
"Age of Reason" was written, in its first form, and printed in French."Couthon," says Lanthenas, "to whom I sent it, seemed offended with me
for having translated it"* Couthon raged against the priesthood, but
could not tolerate a work which showed vengeance to be atheism, and
compassion--not merely for men, but for animals--true worship of God.*  The letter of Lanthenas to Merlin de Thionville, of which
     the original French is before me, is quoted in an article in
     Scribner, September, 1880, by Hon.E. B. Washbarne (former
     Minister to France); it is reprinted in Remsburg's
     compilation of testimonies: "Thomas Paine, the Apostle of
     Religions and Political Liberty" (1880).135
     of this volume.On the other hand, Paine's opposition to atheism would appear to have
brought him into danger from another quarter, in which religion could
not be distinguished from priestcraft.In a letter to Samuel Adams Paine
says that he endangered his life by opposing the king's execution, and
"a second time by opposing atheism."Those who denounce the "Age of
Reason" may thus learn that red-handed Couthon, who hewed men to pieces
before his Lord, and those who acknowledged no Lord, agreed with
them.Under these menaces the original work was as I have inferred,
suppressed.But the demand of Humanity was peremptory, and Paine
re-wrote it all, and more.When it appeared he was a prisoner; his
life was in Couthon's hands.He had personally nothing to gain by its
publication--neither wife, child, nor relative to reap benefit by its
sale.It was published as purely for the good of mankind as any work
ever written.Nothing could be more simply true than his declaration,
near the close of life:

"As in my political works my motive and object have been to give man an
elevated sense of his own character, and free him from the slavish and
superstitious absurdity of monarchy and hereditary government, so, in my
publications on religious subjects, my endeavors have been directed
to bring man to a right use of the reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, and
mercy, and a benevolent disposition to all men, and to all creatures;
and to inspire in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation, in
his Creator, unshackled by the fables of books pretending to be the word
of God."It is misleading at the present day to speak of Paine as an opponent
of Christianity.This would be true were Christianity judged by the
authorized formulas of any church; but nothing now acknowledged as
Christianity by enlightened Christians of any denomination was known
to him.In our time, when the humanizing wave, passing through all
churches, drowns old controversies, floats the dogmas, till it seems
ungenerous to quote creeds and confessions in the presence of our
"orthodox" lovers of man--even "totally depraved" and divinely doomed
man--the theological eighteenth century is inconceivable.Could one
wander from any of our churches, unless of the Christian Pagans or
remote villagers (_pagani_), into those of the last century, he would
find himself moving in a wilderness of cinders, with only the plaintive
song of John and Charles Wesley to break the solitude.If he would hear
recognition of the human Jesus, on whose credit the crowned Christ is
now maintained, he would be sharply told that it were a sin to "know
Christ after the flesh," and must seek such recognition among those
stoned as infidels.Three noble and pathetic tributes to the Man of
Nazareth are audible from the last century--those of Rousseau, Voltaire,
and Paine.From its theologians and its pulpits not one!Should the
tribute of Paine be to-day submitted, without his name, to our most
eminent divines, even to leading American and English Bishops, beside
any theological estimate of Christ from the same century, the Jesus of
Paine would be surely preferred.Should our cultured Christian of to-day press beyond those sectarian,
miserable controversies of the eighteenth century, known to him now as
cold ashes, into the seventeenth century, he would find himself in a
comparatively embowered land; that is, in England, and in a few oases
in America--like that of Roger Williams in Rhode Island.In England he
would find brain and heart still in harmony, as in Tillotson and South;
still more in Bishop Jeremy Taylor, "Shakespeare of divines."He would
hear this Jeremy reject the notions of original sin and transmitted
guilt, maintain the "liberty of prophesying," and that none should
suffer for conclusions concerning a book so difficult of interpretation
as the Bible.In those unsophisticated years Jesus and the disciples
and the Marys still wore about them the reality gained in miracle-plays.What Paine need arise where poets wrote the creed, and men knew the
Jesus of whom Thomas Dekker wrote:

                    "The best of men
     That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer;
     A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,
     The first true gentleman that ever breathed."Dean Swift, whose youth was nourished in that living age, passed into
the era of dismal disputes, where he found the churches "dormitories of
the living as well as of the dead."Some ten years before Paine's birth
the Dean wrote: "Since the union of Divinity and Humanity is the great
Article of our Religion, 't is odd to see some clergymen, in their
writings of Divinity, wholly devoid of Humanity."Men have, he said,
enough religion to hate, but not to love.Had the Dean lived to the
middle of the eighteenth century he might have discovered exceptions
to this holy heartlessness, chiefly among those he had traditionally
feared--the Socinians.These, like the Magdalene, were seeking the lost
humanity of Jesus.He would have sympathized with Wesley, who escaped
from "dormitories of the living" far enough to publish the Life of a
Socinian (Firmin), with the brave apology, "I am sick of opinions, give
me the life."But Socianism, in eagerness to disown its bolder children,
presently lost the heart of Jesus, and when Paine was recovering it the
best of them could not comprehend his separation of the man from the
myth.So came on the desiccated Christianity of which Emerson said,
even among the Unitarians of fifty years ago, "The prayers and even the
dogmas of our church are like the zodiac of Denderah, wholly insulated
from anything now extant in the life and business of the people."Emerson may have been reading Paine's idea that Christ and the Twelve
were mythically connected with Sun and Zodiac, this speculation being
an indication of their distance from the Jesus he tenderly revered.If
Paine rent the temple-veils of his time, and revealed the stony images
behind them, albeit with rudeness, let it not be supposed that those
forms were akin to the Jesus and the Marys whom skeptical criticism is
re-incarnating, so that they dwell with us.Outside Paine's heart the
Christ of his time was not more like the Jesus of our time than Jupiter
was like the Prometheus he bound on a rock.The English Christ was not
the Son of Man, but a Prince of Dogma, bearing handcuffs for all who
reasoned about him; a potent phantasm that tore honest thinkers
from their families and cast them into outer darkness, because they
circulated the works of Paine, which reminded the clergy that the Jesus
even of their own Bible sentenced those only who ministered not to the
hungry and naked, the sick and in prison.There the brain had retreated to deistic caves, the heart had
gone off to "Salvationism" of the time; the churches were given over
to the formalist and the politician, who carried divine sanction to the
repetition of biblical oppressions and massacres by Burke and Pitt.And
in all the world there had not been one to cry _Sursum Corda_ against
the consecrated tyranny until that throb of Paine's heart which
brought on it the vulture.But to-day, were we not swayed by names and
prejudices, it would bring on that prophet of the divine humanity, even
the Christian dove.Soon after the appearance of Part First of the "Age of Reason" it
was expurgated of its negative criticisms, probably by some English
Unitarians, and published as a sermon, with text from Job xi., 7: "Canst
thou by searching find out God?Canst thou find out the Almighty to
perfection?"It was printed anonymously; and were its sixteen pages
read in any orthodox church to-day it would be regarded as admirable.It might be criticised by left wings as somewhat old-fashioned in the
warmth of its theism.It is fortunate that Paine's name was not appended
to this doubtful use of his work, for it would have been a serious
misrepresentation.*

     * "A Lecture on the Existence and Attributes of the Deity,
     as Deduced from a Contemplation of His Works.The copy in my possession is inscribed with pen: "This was
     J. Joyce's copy, and noticed by him as Paine's work."It is probable that the
     suppression of Paine's name was in deference to his
     outlawry, and to the dread, by a sect whose legal position
     was precarious, of any suspicion of connection with
     "Painite" principles.That his Religion of Humanity took the deistical form was an
evolutionary necessity.English deism was not a religion, but at first a
philosophy, and afterwards a scientific generalization.Its founder, as
a philosophy, Herbert of Cherbury, had created the matrix in which
was formed the Quaker religion of the "inner light," by which Paine's
childhood was nurtured; its founder as a scientific theory of creation,
Sir Isaac Newton, had determined the matrix in which all unorthodox
systems should originate.The real issue was between a sanctified
ancient science and a modern science.The utilitarian English race,
always the stronghold of science, had established the freedom of the
new deism, which thus became the mould into which all unorthodoxies ran.From the time of Newton, English and American thought and belief have
steadily become Unitarian.The dualism of Jesus, the thousand years
of faith which gave every soul its post in a great war between God
and Satan, without which there would have been no church, has steadily
receded before a monotheism which, under whatever verbal disguises,
makes the deity author of all evil.English Deism prevailed only to be
reconquered into alliance with a tribal god of antiquity, developed
into the tutelar deity of Christendom.And this evolution involved the
transformation of Jesus into Jehovah, deity of a "chosen" or "elect"
people.It was impossible for an apostle of the international republic,
of the human brotherhood, whose Father was degraded by any notion of
favoritism to a race, or to a "first-born son," to accept a name in
which foreign religions had been harried, and Christendom established on
a throne of thinkers' skulls.The philosophical and scientific deism of
Herbert and Newton had grown cold in Paine's time, but it was detached
from all the internecine figure-heads called gods; it appealed to the
reason of all mankind; and in that manger, amid the beasts, royal and
revolutionary, was cradled anew the divine humanity.Paine wrote "Deism" on his banner in a militant rather than an
affirmative way.He was aiming to rescue the divine Idea from
traditional degradations in order that he might with it confront a
revolutionary Atheism defying the celestial monarchy.In a later work,
speaking of a theological book, "An Antidote to Deism," he remarks: "An
antidote to Deism must be Atheism."So far as it is theological, the
"Age of Reason" was meant to combat Infidelity.It raised before the
French the pure deity of Herbert, of Newton, and other English deists
whose works were unknown in France.But when we scrutinize Paine's
positive Theism we find a distinctive nucleus forming within the
nebulous mass of deistical speculations.Paine recognizes a deity only
in the astronomic laws and intelligible order of the universe, and in
the corresponding reason and moral nature of man.Like Kant, he was
filled with awe by the starry heavens and man's sense of right*.The
first part of the "Age of Reason" is chiefly astronomical; with those
celestial wonders he contrasts such stories as that of Samson and the
foxes."When we contemplate the immensity of that Being who directs and
governs the incomprehensible Whole, of which the utmost ken of human
sight can discover but a part, we ought to feel shame at calling such
paltry stories the word of God."Then turning to the Atheist he says:
"We did not make ourselves; we did not make the principles of science,
which we discover and apply but cannot alter."The only revelation of
God in which he believes is "the universal display of himself in the
works of creation, and that repugnance we feel in ourselves to bad
actions, and disposition to do good ones.""The only idea we can have
of serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living
creation that God has made."* Astronomy, as we know, he had studied profoundly.In early
     life he had studied astronomic globes, purchased at the cost
     of many a dinner, and the orrery(sp), and attended lectures
     at the Royal Society.In the "Age of Reason" he writes,
     twenty-one years before Herschel's famous paper on the
     Nebulae: "The probability is that each of those fixed stars
     is also a sun, round which another system of worlds or
     planets, though too remote for as to discover, performs its
     revolutions."It thus appears that in Paine's Theism the deity is made manifest, not
by omnipotence, a word I do not remember in his theories, but in this
correspondence of universal order and bounty with rcason and conscience,
and the humane heart In later works this speculative side of his Theism
presented a remarkable Zoroastrian variation.When pressed with Bishop
Butler's terrible argument against previous Deism,--that the God of
the Bible is no more cruel than the God of Nature,--Paine declared his
preference for the Persian religion, which exonerated the deity from
responsibility for natural evils, above the Hebrew which attributed
such things to God.He was willing to sacrifice God's omnipotence to
his humanity.He repudiates every notion of a devil, but was evidently
unwilling to ascribe the unconquered realms of chaos to the divine Being
in whom he believed.Thus, while theology was lowering Jesus to a mere King, glorying in
baubles of crown and throne, pleased with adulation, and developing
him into an authorizor of all the ills and agonies of the world, so
depriving him of his humanity, Paine was recovering from the universe
something like the religion of Jesus himself."Why even of yourselves
judge ye not what is right" In affirming the Religion of Humanity, Paine
did not mean what Comte meant, a personification of the continuous life
of our race*; nor did he merely mean benevolence towards all living
creatures.* Paine's friend and fellow-prisoner, Anacharsis Clootz, was
     the first to describe Humanity as "L'Etre Supreme."He affirmed a Religion based on the authentic divinity of that which
is supreme in human nature and distinctive of it The sense of right,
justice, love, mercy, is God himself in man; this spirit judges all
things,--all alleged revelations, all gods.In affirming a deity too
good, loving, just, to do what is ascribed to Jahve, Paine was animated
by the same spirit that led the early believer to turn from heartless
elemental gods to one born of woman, bearing in his breast a human
heart.Pauline theology took away this human divinity, and effected a
restoration, by making the Son of Man Jehovah, and commanding the heart
back from its seat of judgment, where Jesus had set it."Shall the clay
say to the potter, why hast thou formed me thus?""Yes," answered
Paine, "if the thing felt itself hurt, and could speak."He knew as did
Emerson, whom he often anticipates, that "no god dare wrong a worm."The force of the "Age of Reason" is not in its theology, though this
ethical variation of Deism in the direction of humanity is of exceeding
interest to students who would trace the evolution of avatars and
incarnations.Paine's theology was but gradually developed, and in this
work is visible only as a tide beginning to rise under the fiery orb of
his religious passion."If the
belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief, it would make no part
of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them."He evinces regret
that the New Testament, containing so many elevated moral precepts,
should, by leaning on supposed prophecies in the Old Testament, have
been burdened with its barbarities."It must follow the fate of its
foundation."This fatal connection, he knows, is not the work of Jesus;
he ascribes it to the church which evoked from the Old Testament a
crushing system of priestly and imperial power reversing the benign
principles of Jesus.It is this oppression, the throne of all
oppressions, that he assails.His affirmations of the human deity are
thus mainly expressed in his vehement denials.This long chapter must now draw to a close.It would need a volume to
follow thoroughly the argument of this epoch-making book, to which
I have here written only an introduction, calling attention to its
evolutionary factors, historical and spiritual.Such then was the new
Pilgrim's Progress.As in that earlier prison, at Bedford, there shone
in Paine's cell in the Luxembourg a great and imperishable vision, which
multitudes are still following.The Christian teacher of to-day may well ponder this fact.The atheists
and secularists of our time are printing, reading, revering a work that
opposes their opinions.For above its arguments and criticisms they see
the faithful heart contending with a mighty Apollyon, girt with all the
forces of revolutionary and Royal Terrorism.Just this one Englishman,
born again in America, confronting George III.and Robespierre on earth
and tearing the like of them from the throne of the universe!Were it
only for the grandeur of this spectacle in the past Paine would maintain
his hold on thoughtful minds.But in America the hold is deeper than that.In this self-forgetting
insurrection of the human heart against deified Inhumanity there is an
expression of the inarticulate wrath of humanity against continuance of
the same wrong.In the circulation throughout the earth of the Bible as
the Word of God, even after its thousand serious errors of translation
are turned, by exposure, into falsehoods; in the deliverance to savages
of a scriptural sanction of their tomahawks and poisoned arrows; in the
diffusion among cruel tribes of a religion based on human sacrifice,
after intelligence has abandoned it; in the preservation of costly
services to a deity who "needs nothing at men's hands," beside hovels
of the poor who need much; in an exemption of sectarian property from
taxation which taxes every man to support the sects, and continues the
alliance of church and state; in these things, and others--the list is
long--there is still visible, however refined, the sting and claw of the
Apollyon against whom Paine hurled his far-reaching dart.The "Age of
Reason" was at first published in America by a religious house, and as
a religious book.It was circulated in Virginia by Washington's old
friend, Parson Weems.It is still circulated, though by supposed
unbelievers, as a religious book, and such it is.Its religion is expressed largely in those same denunciations which
theologians resent.I have explained them; polite agnostics apologize
for them, or cast Paine over as a Jonah of the rationalistic ship.But
to make one expression more gentle would mar the work.As it stands,
with all its violences and faults, it represents, as no elaborate or
polite treatise could, the agony and bloody sweat of a heart breaking in
the presence of crucified Humanity.What dear heads, what noble hearts
had that man seen laid low; what shrieks had he heard in the desolate
homes of the Condorcets, the Brissots; what Canaanite and Midianite
massacres had he seen before the altar of Brotherhood, erected by
himself!And all because every human being had been taught from his
cradle that there is something more sacred than humanity, and to which
man should be sacrificed.Of all those mas-sacred thinkers not one voice
remains: they have gone silent: over their reeking guillotine sits
the gloating Apollyon of Inhumanity.But here is one man, a prisoner,
preparing for his long silence.He alone can speak for those slain
between the throne and the altar.In these outbursts of laughter and
tears, these outcries that think not of literary style, these appeals
from surrounding chaos to the starry realm of order, from the tribune of
vengeance to the sun shining for all, this passionate horror of cruelty
in the powerful which will brave a heartless heaven or hell with its
immortal indignation,--in all these the unfettered mind may hear the
wail of enthralled Europe, sinking back choked with its blood, under the
chain it tried to break.So long as a link remains of the same chain,
binding reason or heart, Paine's "Age of Reason" will live.It is not a
mere book--it is a man's heart.FRIENDSHIPS

Baron Pichon, who had been a sinuous Secretary of Legation in America
under Genet and Fauchet, and attached to the Foreign Office in France
under the Directory, told George Ticknor, in 1837, that "Tom Paine, who
lived in Monroe's house at Paris, had a great deal too much influence
over Monroe."*

     *  "Life of George Ticknor," ii., p.223

The Baron, apart from his prejudice against republicanism (Talleyrand
was his master), knew more about American than French politics at the
time of Monroe's mission in France.The agitation caused in France
by Jay's negotiations in England, and rumors set afloat by their
secrecy,--such secrecy being itself felt as a violation of good
faith--rendered Monroe's position unhappy and difficult.After Paine's
release from prison, his generous devotion to France, undiminished
by his wrongs, added to the painful illness that reproached the
Convention's negligence, excited a chivalrous enthusiasm for him.Monroe for him, the fact that this faithful
friend of France was in their house, were circumstances of international
importance.Of Paine's fidelity to republican principles, and his
indignation at their probable betrayal in England, there could be no
doubt in any mind.He was consulted by the French Executive, and was
virtually the most important _attache_ of the United States Legation.The "intrigue" of which Thibaudeau had spoken, in Convention, as having
driven Paine from that body, was not given to the public, but it was
well understood to involve the American President.If Paine's suffering
represented in London Washington's deference to England, all the more
did he stand to France as a representative of those who in America
were battling for the Alliance.He was therefore a tower of strength
to Monroe.It will be seen by the subjoined letter that while he was
Monroe's guest it was to him rather than the Minister that the Foreign
Office applied for an introduction of a new Consul to Samuel Adams,
Governor of Massachusetts--a Consul with whom Paine was not personally
acquainted.The general feeling and situation in France at the date of
this letter (March 6th), and the anger at Jay's secret negotiations in
England, are reflected in it:

"My Dear Friend,--Mr.Mozard, who is appointed Consul, will present you
this letter.He is spoken of here as a good sort of man, and I can have
no doubt that you will find him the same at Boston.When I came from
America it was my intention to return the next year, and I have intended
the same every year since.The case I believe is, that as I am embarked
in the revolution, I do not like to leave it till it is finished,
notwithstanding the dangers I have run.I am now almost the only
survivor of those who began this revolution, and I know not how it is
that I have escaped.I know however that I owe nothing to the government
of America.The executive department has never directed either the
former or the present Minister to enquire whether I was dead or alive,
in prison or in liberty, what the cause of the imprisonment was, and
whether there was any service or assistance it could render.Monroe
acted voluntarily in the case, and reclaimed me as an American citizen;
for the pretence for my imprisonment was that I was a foreigner, born in
England."The internal scene here from the 31 of May 1793 to the fall of
Robespierre has been terrible.I was shut up in the prison of the
Luxembourg eleven months, and I find by the papers of Robespierre
that have been published by the Convention since his death, that I
was designed for a worse fate.The following memorandum is in his own
handwriting; 'Demander que Thomas Paine soit decrete d'accusation pour
les interets de l'Amerique autant que de la France.'"You will see by the public papers that the successes of the French arms
have been and continue to be astonishing, more especially since the fall
of Robespierre, and the suppression of the system of Terror.They
have fairly beaten all the armies of Austria, Prussia, England, Spain,
Sardignia, and Holland.Holland is entirely conquered, and there is now
a revolution in that country."I know not how matters are going on your side the water, but I think
everything is not as it ought to be.The appointment of G. Morris to
be Minister here was the most unfortunate and the most injudicious
appointment that could be made.Jefferson at
the time, and I said the same to Morris.Had he not been removed at
the time he was I think the two countries would have been involved in a
quarrel, for it is a fact, that he would either have been ordered away
or put in arrestation; for he gave every reason to suspect that he was
secretly a British Emissary.Jay is about in England I know not; but is it possible that
any man who has contributed to the Independence of America, and to free
her from the tyranny of the British Government, can read without shame
and indignation the note of Jay to Grenville?That the _United States
has no other resource than in the justice and magnanimity of his
Majesty_, is a satire upon the Declaration of Independence, and exhibits
[such] a spirit of meanness on the part of America, that, were it true,
I should be ashamed of her.Such a declaration may suit the spaniel
character of Aristocracy, but it cannot agree with manly character of a
Republican.Mozard is this moment come for this letter, and he sets off
directly.--God bless you, remember me among the circle of our friends,
and tell them how much I wish to be once more among them."*

     * Mr.Spofford, Librarian of Congress, has kindly copied
     this letter for me from the original, among the papers of
     George Bancroft.There are indications of physical feebleness as well as haste in this
letter.The spring and summer brought some vigor, but, as we have seen
by Monroe's letter to Judge Jones, he sank again and in the autumn
seemed nearing his end.Once more the announcement of his death appeared
in England, this time bringing joy to the orthodox.From the same
quarter, probably, whence issued, in 1793, "Intercepted Correspondence
from Satan to Citizen Paine," came now ( 1795 ) a folio sheet: "Glorious
News for Old England.The British Lyon rous'd; or John Bull for ever."The Fox has lost his Tail
     The Ass has done his Braying,
     The Devil has got Tom Paine."Good-hearted as Paine was, it must be admitted that he was cruelly
persistent in disappointing these British obituaries.Despite anguish,
fever, and abscess--this for more than a year eating into his side,--he
did not gratify those prayerful expectations by becoming a monument of
divine retribution.Nay, amid all these sufferings he had managed to
finish Part Second of the "Age of Reason," write the "Dissertation on
Government," and give the Address before the Convention, Nevertheless
when, in November, he was near death's door, there came from England
tidings grievous enough to crush a less powerful constitution.It was
reported that many of his staunchest old friends had turned against
him on account of his heretical book.This report seemed to find
confirmation in the successive volumes of Gilbert Wakefield in reply to
the two Parts of Paine's book.Wakefield held Unitarian opinions, and
did not defend the real fortress besieged by Paine.He was enraged that
Paine should deal with the authority of the Bible, and the orthodox
dogmas, as if they were Christianity, ignoring unorthodox versions
altogether.This, however, hardly explains the extreme and coarse
vituperation of these replies, which shocked Wakefield's friends.*

     * "The office of 'castigation' was unworthy of our friend's
     talents, and detrimental to his purpose of persuading
     others.Such a contemptuous treatment, even of an unfair
     disputant, was also too well calculated to depredate in the
     public estimation that benevolence of character by which Mr.--"Life of Gilbert
     Wakefield," 1804, ii., p.Although in his thirty-eighth year at this time, Wakefield was not old
enough to escape the _sequelae_ of his former clericalism.He had been a
Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge, afterwards had a congregation, and
had continued his connection with the English Church after he was
led, by textual criticism, to adopt Unitarian opinions.He had
great reputation as a linguist, and wrote Scriptural expositions and
retranslations.But few read his books, and he became a tutor in a
dissenting college at Hackney, mainly under influence of the Unitarian
leaders, Price and Priestley.Wakefield would not condescend to any
connection with a dissenting society, and his career at Hackney was
marked by arrogant airs towards Unitarians, on account of a university
training, then not open to dissenters.He attacked Price and Priestley,
his superiors in every respect, apart from their venerable position
and services, in a contemptuous way; and, in fact, might be brevetted a
prig, with a fondness for coarse phrases, sometimes printed with blanks.He flew at Paine as if he had been waiting for him; his replies, not
affecting any vital issue, were displays of linguistic and textual
learning, set forth on the background of Paine's page, which he
blackened.He exhausts his large vocabulary of vilification on a book
whose substantial affirmations he concedes; and it is done in the mean
way of appropriating the credit of Paine's arguments.Gilbert Wakefield was indebted to the excitement raised by Paine for
the first notice taken by the general public of anything he ever
wrote.Paine, however, seems to have been acquainted with a sort of
autobiography which he had published in 1792.In this book Wakefield
admitted with shame that he had subscribed the Church formulas when he
did not believe them, while indulging in flings at Price, Priestley, and
others, who had suffered for their principles.At the same time there
were some things in Wakefield's autobiography which could not fail to
attract Paine: it severely attacked slavery, and also the whole course
of Pitt towards France.It
was consequently a shock when Gilbert Wakefield's outrageous abuse
of himself came to the invalid in his sick-room.It appeared to be an
indication of the extent to which he was abandoned by the Englishmen
who had sympathized with his political principles, and to a large extent
with his religious views.This acrimonious repudiation added groans to
Paine's sick and sinking heart, some of which were returned upon his
Socinian assailant, and in kind.This private letter my reader must
see, though it was meant for no eye but that of Gilbert Wakefield.It is
dated at Paris, November 19, 1795."Dear Sir,--When you prudently chose, like a starved apothecary,
to offer your eighteenpenny antidote to those who had taken my
two-and-sixpenny Bible-purge,* you forgot that although my dose
was rather of the roughest, it might not be the less wholesome for
possessing that drastick quality; and if I am to judge of its salutary
effects on your infuriate polemic stomach, by the nasty things it has
made you bring away, I think you should be the last man alive to take
your own panacea.As to the collection of words of which you boast the
possession, nobody, I believe, will dispute their amount, but every one
who reads your answer to my 'Age of Reason' will wish there were not so
many scurrilous ones among them; for though they may be very usefull
in emptying your gallbladder they are too apt to move the bile of other
people.* These were the actual prices of the books."Those of Greek and Latin are rather foolishly thrown away, I think, on
a man like me, who, you are pleased to say, is 'the greatest ignoramus
in nature': yet I must take the liberty to tell you, that wisdom does
not consist in the mere knowledge of language, but of things."You recommend me to _know myself_--a thing very easy to advise, but
very difficult to practice, as I learn from your own book; for you take
yourself to be a meek disciple of Christ, and yet give way to passion
and pride in every page of its composition."You have raised an ant-hill about the roots of my sturdy oak, and it
may amuse idlers to see your work; but neither its body nor its branches
are injured by you; and I hope the shade of my Civic Crown may be able
to preserve your little contrivance, at least for the season."When you have done as much service to the world by your writings, and
suffered as much for them, as I have done, you will be better entitled
to dictate: but although I know you to be a keener politician than Paul,
I can assure you, from my experience of mankind, that you do not much
commend the Christian doctrines to them by announcing that it requires
the labour of a learned life to make them understood."May I be permitted, after all, to suggest that your truly vigorous
talents would be best employed in teaching men to preserve their
liberties exclusively,--leaving to that God who made their immortal
souls the care of their eternal welfare."I am, dear Sir,

"Your true well-wisher,

"Tho.After a first perusal of this letter has made its unpleasant impression,
the reader will do well to read it again.Paine has repaired to his
earliest Norfolk for language appropriate to the coarser tongue of his
Nottinghamshire assailant; but it should be said that the offensive
paragraph, the first, is a travesty of one written by Wakefield.In his
autobiography, after groaning over his books that found no buyers,
a veritable "starved apothecary," Wakefield describes the uneasiness
caused by his pamphlet on "Religious Worship" as proof that the disease
was yielding to his "potion."He says that "as a physician of spiritual
maladies" he had seconded "the favourable operation of the first
prescription,"--and so forth.Paine, in using the simile, certainly
allows the drugs and phials of his sick-room to enter it to a
disagreeable extent, but we must bear in mind that we are looking over
his shoulder.We must also, by the same consideration of its privacy,
mitigate the letter's egotism.Wakefield's ant-hill protected by
the foliage, the "civic crown," of Paine's oak which it has
attacked,--gaining notice by the importance of the work it
belittles,--were admirable if written by another; and the egotism is
not without some warrant.It is the rebuke of a scarred veteran of the
liberal army to the insults of a subaltern near twenty years his junior.It was no doubt taken to heart For when the agitation which Gilbert
Wakefield had contributed to swell, and to lower, presently culminated
in handcuffs for the circulators of Paine's works, he was filled with
anguish.He vainly tried to resist the oppression, and to call back the
Unitarians, who for twenty-five years continued to draw attention from
their own heresies by hounding on the prosecution of Paine's adherents.*

     * "But I would not forcibly suppress this book ["Age of
     Reason"]; much less would I punish (O my God, be such
     wickedness far from me, or leave me destitute of thy favour
     in the midst of this perjured and sanguinary generation!)much less would I punish, by fine or imprisonment, from any
     possible consideration, the publisher or author of these
     pages."--Letter of Gilbert Wakefield to Sir John Scott,
     Attorney General, 1798.For evidence of Unitarian
     intolerance see the discourse of W, J. Fox on "The Duties of
     Christians towards Deists" (Collected Works, vol.In
     this discourse, October 24, 1819, on the prosecution of
     Carlile for publishing the "Age of Reason," Mr.Fox
     expresses his regret that the first prosecution should have
     been conducted by a Unitarian."Goaded," he says, "by the
     calumny which would identify them with those who yet reject
     the Saviour, they have, in repelling so unjust an
     accusation, caught too much of the tone of their opponents,
     and given the most undesirable proof of their affinity to
     other Christians by that unfairness towards the disbeliever
     which does not become any Christian."Fox
     became the champion of all the principles of "The Age of
     Reason" and "The Rights of Man."The prig perished; in his place stood a martyr of the freedom bound up
with the work he had assailed.Paine's other assailant, the Bishop of
Llandaff, having bent before Pitt, and episcopally censured the humane
side he once espoused, Gilbert Wakefield answered him with a boldness
that brought on him two years' imprisonment When he came out of prison
(1801) he was received with enthusiasm by all of Paine's friends, who
had forgotten the wrong so bravely atoned for.Had he not died in the
same year, at the age of forty-five, Gilbert Wakefield might have become
a standard-bearer of the freethinkers.Paine's recovery after such prolonged and perilous suffering was a
sort of resurrection.In April (1796) he leaves Monroe's house for the
country, and with the returning life of nature his strength is steadily
recovered.What to the man whose years of anguish, imprisonment,
disease, at last pass away, must have been the paths and hedgerows of
Versailles, where he now meets the springtide, and the more healing
sunshine of affection!Risen from his thorny bed of pain--

     "The meanest floweret of the vale,
     The simplest note that swells the gale,
     The common sun, the air, the skies,
     To him are opening paradise."So had it been even if nature alone had surrounded him.But Paine had
been restored by the tenderness and devotion of friends.Had it not been
for friendship he could hardly have been saved.We are little able, in
the present day, to appreciate the reverence and affection with which
Thomas Paine was regarded by those who saw in him the greatest apostle
of liberty in the world.Elihu Palmer spoke a very general belief when
he declared Paine "probably the most useful man that ever existed upon
the face of the earth."This may sound wild enough on the ears of those
to whom Liberty has become a familiar drudge.There was a time when she
was an ideal Rachel, to win whom many years of terrible service were
not too much; but now in the garish day she is our prosaic Leah,--a
serviceable creature in her way, but quite unromantic.In Paris there
were ladies and gentlemen who had known something of the cost of
Liberty,--Colonel and Mrs.Monroe, Sir Robert and Lady Smith, Madame
Lafayette, Mr.Barlow, M. and Madame De Bonneville.They
had known what it was to watch through anxious nights with terrors
surrounding them.He who had suffered most was to them a sacred person.He had come out of the succession of ordeals, so weak in body, so
wounded by American ingratitude, so sore at heart, that no delicate
child needed more tender care.Set those ladies and their charge a
thousand years back in the poetic past, and they become Morgan le Fay,
and the Lady Nimue, who bear the wounded warrior away to their Avalon,
there to be healed of his grievous hurts.Men say their Arthur is dead,
but their love is stronger than death.And though the service of
these friends might at first have been reverential, it had ended with
attachment, so great was Paine's power, so wonderful and pathetic his
memories, so charming the play of his wit, so full his response to
kindness.One especially great happiness awaited him when he became convalescent.Sir Robert Smith, a wealthy banker in Paris, made his acquaintance, and
he discovered that Lady Smith was no other than "The Little Corner of
the World," whose letters had carried sunbeams into his prison.* An
intimate friendship was at once established with Sir Robert and his
lady, in whose house, probably at Versailles, Paine was a guest after
leaving the Monroes.To Lady Smith, on discovering her, Paine addressed
a poem,--"The Castle in the Air to the Little Corner of the World":

     * Sir Robert Smith (Smythe in the Peerage List) was born in
     1744, and married, first, Miss Blake of London (1776).The
     name of the second Lady Smith, Paine's friend, before her
     marriage I have not ascertained."In the region of clouds, where the whirlwinds arise,
     My Castle of Fancy was built;
     The turrets reflected the blue from the skies,
     And the windows with sunbeams were gilt."The rainbow sometimes, in its beautiful state,
     Enamelled the mansion around;
     And the figures that fancy in clouds can create
     Supplied me with gardens and ground."I had grottos, and fountains, and orange-tree groves,
     I had all that enchantment has told;
     I had sweet shady walks for the gods and their loves,
     I had mountains of coral and gold."But a storm that I felt not had risen and rolled,
     While wrapped in a slumber I lay;
     And when I looked out in the morning, behold,
     My Castle was carried away."It passed over rivers and valleys and groves,
     The world it was all in my view;
     I thought of my friends, of their fates, of their loves,
     And often, full often, of you."At length it came over a beautiful scene,
     That nature in silence had made;
     The place was but small, but't was sweetly serene,
     And chequered with sunshine and shade."I gazed and I envied with painful good will,
     And grew tired of my seat in the air;
     When all of a sudden my Castle stood still,
     As if some attraction were there."Like a lark from the sky it came fluttering down,
     And placed me exactly in view,
     When whom should I meet in this charming retreat
     This corner of calmness, but--you."Delighted to find you in honour and ease,
     I felt no more sorrow nor pain;
     But the wind coming fair, I ascended the breeze,
     And went back with my Castle again."The kindness that rescued him from death was
followed by the friendship that beguiled him from horrors of the past.From gentle ladies he learned that beyond the Age of Reason lay the
forces that defeat Giant Despair."To reason [so he writes to Lady Smith] against feelings is as vain as
to reason against fire: it serves only to torture the torture, by adding
reproach to horror.All reasoning with ourselves in such cases acts upon
us like the reasoning of another person, which, however kindly done,
serves but to insult the misery we suffer.If Reason could remove the
pain, Reason would have prevented it.If she could not do the one, how
is she to perform the other?In all such cases we must look upon Reason
as dispossessed of her empire, by a revolt of the mind.She retires to a
distance to weep, and the ebony sceptre of Despair rules alone.All that
Reason can do is to suggest, to hint a thought, to signify a wish, to
cast now and then a kind of bewailing look, to hold up, when she
can catch the eye, the miniature shaded portrait of Hope; and though
dethroned, and can dictate no more, to wait upon us in the humble
station of a handmaid."The mouth of the rescued and restored captive was filled with song.Several little poems were circulated among his friends, but not printed;
among them the following:

"Contentment; or, if you please, Confession.Barlow, on
her pleasantly telling the author that, after writing against the
superstition of the Scripture religion, he was setting up a religion
capable of more bigotry and enthusiasm, and more dangerous to its
votaries--that of making a religion of Love._

     "O could we always live and love,
     And always be sincere,
     I would not wish for heaven above,
     My heaven would be here."Though many countries I have seen,
     And more may chance to see,
     My Little Corner of the World
     Is half the world to me."The other half, as you may guess,
     America contains;
     And thus, between them, I possess
     The whole world for my pains."I'm then contented with my lot,
     I can no happier be;
     For neither world I'm sure has got
     So rich a man as me."Then send no fiery chariot down
     To take me off from hence,
     But leave me on my heavenly ground--
     This prayer is _common sense_."Let others choose another plan,
     I mean no fault to find;
     The true theology of man
     Is happiness of mind."Paine gained great favor with the French government and fame throughout
Europe by his pamphlet, "The Decline and Fall of the English System of
Finance," in which he predicted the suspension of the Bank of England,
which followed the next year.He dated the pamphlet April 8th, and the
Minister of Foreign Affairs is shown, in the Archives of that office, to
have ordered, on April 27th, a thousand copies.It was translated in all
the languages of Europe, and was a terrible retribution for the forged
assignats whose distribution in France the English government had
considered a fair mode of warfare.This translation "into all the
languages of the continent" is mentioned by Ralph Broome, to whom the
British government entrusted the task of answering the pamphlet.* As
Broome's answer is dated June 4th, this circulation in six or seven
weeks is remarkable, The proceeds were devoted by Paine to the relief of
prisoners for debt in Newgate, London.**

     * "Observations on Mr.Broome
     escapes the charge of prejudice by speaking of "Mr.Paine,
     whose abilities I admire and deprecate in a breath."Paine's
     pamphlet was also replied to by George Chalmers ("Oldys")
     who had written the slanderous biography.** Richard Carlile's sketch of Paine, p.This large
     generosity to English sufferers appears the more
     characteristic beside the closing paragraph of Paine's
     pamphlet, "As an individual citizen of America, and as far
     as an individual can go, I have revenged (if I may use the
     expression without any immoral meaning) the piratical
     depredations committed on American commerce by the English
     government.I have retaliated for France on the subject of
     finance: and I conclude with retorting on Mr.Pitt the
     expression he used against France, and say, that the English
     system of finance 'is en the verge, nay even in the gulf of
     bankruptcy.'"Concerning the false French assignats forged in  England,
     see  Louis Blanc's "History of the Revolution," vol.xii.,
     p.The concentration of this pamphlet on its immediate subject, which made
it so effective, renders it of too little intrinsic interest in the
present day to delay us long, especially as it is included in all
editions of Paine's works.It possesses, however, much biographical
interest as proving the intellectual power of Paine while still but a
convalescent.He never wrote any work involving more study and mastery
of difficult details.It was this pamphlet, written in Paris, while
"Peter Porcupine," in America, was rewriting the slanders of "Oldys,"
which revolutionized Cobbett's opinion of Paine, and led him to try and
undo the injustice he had wrought.It now so turned out that Paine was able to repay all the kindnesses he
had received.The relations between the French government and Monroe,
already strained, as we have seen, became in the spring of 1796 almost
intolerable.The Jay treaty seemed to the French so incredible that,
even after it was ratified, they believed that the Representatives would
refuse the appropriation needed for its execution.But when tidings came
that this effort of the House of Representatives had been crushed by a
menaced _coup d'etat_, the ideal America fell in France, and was broken
in fragments.Monroe could now hardly have remained save on the credit
of Paine with the French.There was, of course, a fresh accession of
wrath towards England for this appropriation of the French alliance.Paine had been only the first sacrifice on the altar of the new
alliance; now all English families and all Americans in Paris except
himself were likely to become its victims.The English-speaking
residents there made one little colony, and Paine was sponsor for them
all.His fatal blow at English credit proved the formidable power of the
man whom Washington had delivered up to Robespierre in the interest of
Pitt.So Paine's popularity reached its climax; the American Legation
found through him a _modus vivendi_ with the French government; the
families which had received and nursed him in his weakness found in his
intimacy their best credential.Joel Barlow especially, while her
husband was in Algeria, on the service of the American government, might
have found her stay in Paris unpleasant but for Paine s friendship.The
importance of his guarantee to the banker, Sir Robert Smith, appears by
the following note, written at Versailles, August 13th:

"Citizen Minister: The citizen Robert Smith, a very particular friend
of mine, wishes to obtain a passport to go to Hamburg, and I will be
obliged to you to do him that favor.Himself and family have lived
several years in France, for he likes neither the government nor the
climate of England.He has large property in England, but his Banker
in that country has refused sending him remittances.This makes it
necessary for him to go to Hamburg, because from there he can draw his
money out of his Banker's hands, which he cannot do whilst in France.His family remains in France.--_Salut et fraternite._

"Thomas Paine."Amid his circle of cultured and kindly friends Paine had dreamed of a
lifting of the last cloud from his life, so long overcast.His eyes were
strained to greet that shining sail that should bring him a response to
his letter of September to Washington, in his heart being a great hope
that his apparent wrong would be explained as a miserable mistake,
and that old friendship restored.As the reader knows, the hope was
grievously disappointed.The famous public letter to Washington (August
3d), which was not published in France, has already been considered, in
advance of its chronological place.It will be found, however, of more
significance if read in connection with the unhappy situation, in which
all of Paine's friends, and all Americans in Paris, had been brought
by the Jay treaty.From their point of view the deliverance of Paine to
prison and the guillotine was only one incident in a long-planned and
systematic treason, aimed at the life of the French republic.Jefferson
in America, and Paine in France, represented the faith and hope of
republicans that the treason would be overtaken by retribution and
reversal.* Soon after Jefferson became President Paine wrote to him,
     suggesting that Sir Robert's firm might be safely depended
     on as the medium of American financial transactions in
     Europe.THEOPHILANTHROPY

In the ever-recurring controversies concerning Paine and his "Age
of Reason" we have heard many triumphal claims.Christianity and
the Church, it is said, have advanced and expanded, unharmed by such
criticisms.But there are several fallacies implied in
this mode of dealing with the religious movement caused by Paine's work.It assumes that Paine was an enemy of all that now passes under the name
of Christianity--a title claimed by nearly a hundred and fifty different
organizations, with some of which (as the Unitarians, Universalists,
Broad Church, and Hick-site Friends) he would largely sympathize.It
further assumes that he was hostile to all churches, and desired or
anticipated their destruction.Paine desired and
anticipated their reformation, which has steadily progressed.At the
close of the "Age of Reason" he exhorts the clergy to "preach something
that is edifying, and from texts that are known to be true.""The Bible of the creation is inexhaustible in texts.Every part of
science, whether connected with the geometry of the universe, with
the systems of animal and vegetable life, or with the properties of
inanimate matter, is a text for devotion as well as for philosophy--for
gratitude as for human improvement.It will perhaps be said, that, if
such a revolution in the system of religion takes place, every preacher
ought to be a philosopher.And every house of devotion
a school of science.It has been by wandering, from the immutable laws
of science, and the right use of reason, and setting up an invented
thing called revealed religion, that so many wild and blasphemous
conceits nave been formed of the Almighty.The Jews have made him the
assassin of the human species, to make room for the religion of the
Jews.The Christians have made him the murderer of himself, and the
founder of a new religion, to supersede and expel the Jewish religion.And to find pretence and admission for these things they must have
supposed his power and his wisdom imperfect, or his will changeable; and
the changeableness of the will is the imperfection of the judgment.The
philosopher knows that the laws of the Creator have never changed
with respect either to the principles of science, or the properties of
matter.Why then is it to be supposed they have changed with respect to
man?"To the statement that Christianity has not been impeded by the "Age of
Reason," it should be added that its advance has been largely due to
modifications rendered necessary by that work.The unmodified dogmas
are represented in small and eccentric communities.The advance has
been under the Christian name, with which Paine had no concern; but
to confuse the word "Christianity" with the substance it labels is
inadmissible.George and the Dragon; but
English culture has reduced the saint and dragon to a fable.The special wrath with which Paine is still visited, above all other
deists put together, or even atheists is a tradition from a so-called
Christianity which his work compelled to capitulate.That system is
now nearly extinct, and the vendetta it bequeathed should now end.The
capitulation began immediately with the publication of the Bishop of
Llandaff's "Apology for the Bible," a title that did not fail to attract
notice when it appeared (1796).There were more than thirty replies to
Paine, but they are mainly taken out of the Bishop's "Apology," to which
they add nothing.It is said in religious encyclopedias that Paine was
"answered" by one and another writer, but in a strict sense Paine was
never answered, unless by the successive surrenders referred to.As Bishop Watson's "Apology" is adopted by most authorities as the
sufficient "answer," it may be here accepted as a representative of the
rest.Whether Paine's points dealt with by the Bishop are answerable
or not, the following facts will prove how uncritical is the prevalent
opinion that they were really answered.Watson concedes generally to Paine the discovery of some "real
difficulties" in the Old Testament, and the exposure, in the Christian
grove, of "a few unsightly shrubs, which good men had wisely concealed
from public view" (p.* It is not Paine that here calls some
"sacred" things unsightly, and charges the clergy with concealing
them--it is the Bishop.Among the particular and direct concessions made
by the Bishop are the following:

     * Corey's edition.That Moses may not have written every part of the Pentateuch.Some
passages were probably written by later hands, transcribers or editors
(pp.[If human reason and scholarship are admitted to detach
any portions, by what authority can they be denied the right to bring
all parts of the Pentateuch, or even the whole Bible, under their human
judgment?]The law in Deuteronomy giving parents the right, under certain
circumstances, to have their children stoned to death, is excused only
as a "humane restriction of a power improper to be lodged with any
parent" (p.[Granting the Bishop's untrue assertion, that the same
"improper" power was arbitrary among the Romans, Gauls, and Persians,
why should it not have been abolished in Israel?Watson
possessed the right to call any law established in the Bible "improper,"
how can Paine be denounced for subjecting other things in the book
to moral condemnation?The moral sentiment is not an episcopal
prerogative.]The Bishop agrees that it is "the opinion of many learned men and
good Christians" that the Bible, though authoritative in religion, is
fallible in other respects, "relating the ordinary history of the times"
(p.[What but human reason, in the absence of papal authority, is
to draw the line between the historical and religious elements in the
Bible?]It is conceded that "Samuel did not write any part of the second book
bearing his name, and only a part of the first" (p.[One of many
blows dealt by this prelate at confidence in the Bible.]It is admitted that Ezra contains a contradiction in the estimate
of the numbers who returned from Babylon; it is attributed to a
transcriber's mistake of one Hebrew figure for another (p.[Paine's
question here had been: "What certainty then can there be in the Bible
for anything"?It is no answer to tell him how an error involving a
difference of 12,542 people may perhaps have occurred.]It is admitted that David did not write some of the Psalms ascribed
to him (p."It is acknowledged that the order of time is not everywhere
observed" [in Jeremiah]; also that this prophet, fearing for his life,
suppressed the truth [as directed by King Zedekiah]."He was under
no obligation to tell the whole [truth] to men who were certainly his
enemies and no good subjects of the king" (pp.[But how can it
be determined how much in Jeremiah is the "word of God," and how much
uttered for the casual advantage of himself or his king?]It is admitted that there was no actual fulfilment of Ezekie's
prophecy, "No foot of man shall pass through it [Egypt], nor foot of
beast shall pass through it, for forty years" (p.The discrepancies between the genealogies of Christ, in Matthew and
Luke, are admitted: they are explained by saying that Matthew gives the
genealogy of Joseph, and Luke that of Mary; and that Matthew commits "an
error" in omitting three generations between Joram and Ozias (p.[Paine had asked, why might not writers mistaken in the natural
genealogy of Christ be mistaken also in his celestial genealogy?Such are some of the Bishop's direct admissions.There are other admissions in his silences and evasions.For instance,
having elaborated a theory as to how the error in Ezra might occur, by
the close resemblance of Hebrew letters representing widely different
numbers, he does not notice Nehemiah's error in the same matter, pointed
out by Paine,--a self-contradiction, and also a discrepancy with Ezra,
which could not be explained by his theory.He says nothing about
several other contradictions alluded to by Paine.The Bishop's evasions
are sometimes painful, as when he tries to escape the force of Paine's
argument, that Paul himself was not convinced by the evidences of the
resurrection which he adduces for others.The Bishop says: "That Paul
had so far resisted the evidence which the apostles had given of the
resurrection and ascension of Jesus, as to be a persecutor of the
disciples of Christ, is certain; but I do not remember the place where
he declares that he had not believed them."But when Paul says, "I
verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things contrary to
the name of Jesus of Nazareth," surely this is inconsistent with his
belief in the resurrection and ascension.Paul declares that when it
was the good pleasure of God "to reveal his Son in me," immediately he
entered on his mission.He "was not disobedient to the heavenly vision."Clearly then Paul had not been convinced of the resurrection and
ascension until he saw Christ in a vision.In dealing with Paine's moral charges against the Bible the Bishop has
left a confirmation of all that I have said concerning the Christianity
of his time.An "infidel" of to-day could need no better moral arguments
against the Bible than those framed by the Bishop in its defence.He
justifies the massacre of the Canaanites on the ground that they were
sacrificers of their own children to idols, cannibals, addicted to
unnatural lust Were this true it would be no justification; but as no
particle of evidence is adduced in support of these utterly unwarranted
and entirely fictitious accusations, the argument now leaves the
massacre without any excuse at all.The extermination is not in the
Bible based on any such considerations, but simply on a divine command
to seize the land and slay its inhabitants.No legal right to the land
is suggested in the record; and, as for morality, the only persons
spared in Joshua's expedition were a harlot and her household, she
having betrayed her country to the invaders, to be afterwards exalted
into an ancestress of Christ.Of the cities destroyed by Joshua it is
said: "It was of Jehovah to harden their hearts, to come against Israel
in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have
no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Jehovah commanded Moses"
(Joshua xi., 20).As their hearts were thus in Jehovah's power for
hardening, it may be inferred that they were equally in his power for
reformation, had they been guilty of the things alleged by the Bishop.With these things before him, and the selection of Rahab for mercy
above all the women in Jericho--every woman slain save the harlot who
delivered them up to slaughter--the Bishop says: "The destruction of the
Canaanites exhibits to all nations, in all ages, a signal proof of God's
displeasure against sin."The Bishop rages against Paine for supposing that the commanded
preservation of the Midianite maidens, when all males and married women
were slain, was for their "debauchery.""Prove this, and I will allow that Moses was the horrid monster you make
him--prove this, and I will allow that the Bible is what you call it--'a
book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy'--prove this, or excuse my
warmth if I say to you, as Paul said to Elymas the sorcerer, who sought
to turn away Sergius Paulus from the faith, 'O full of all subtilty,
and of all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all
righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the
Lord?'--I did not, when I began these letters, think that I should
have been moved to this severity of rebuke, by anything you could
have written; but when so gross a misrepresentation is made of God's
proceedings, coolness would be a crime."And what does my reader suppose is the alternative claimed by the
prelate's foaming mouth?The maidens, he declares, were not reserved for
debauchery, but for slavery!Little did the Bishop foresee a time when, of the two suppositions,
Paine's might be deemed the more lenient.The subject of slavery was
then under discussion in England, and the Bishop is constrained to add,
concerning this enslavement of thirty-two thousand maidens, from
the massacred families, that slavery is "a custom abhorrent from our
manners, but everywhere practised in former times, and still practised
in countries where the benignity of the Christian religion has not
softened the ferocity of human nature."Thus, Jehovah is represented
as not only ordering the wholesale murder of the worshippers of another
deity, but an adoption of their "abhorrent" and inhuman customs.This connection of the deity of the Bible with "the ferocity of human
nature" in one place, and its softening in another, justified Paine's
solemn rebuke to the clergy of his time."Had the cruel and murderous orders with which the Bible is filled,
and the numberless torturing executions of men, women, and children, in
consequence of those orders, been ascribed to some friend whose memory
you revered, you would have glowed with satisfaction at detecting the
falsehood of the charge, and gloried in defending his injured fame.It is because ye are sunk in the cruelty of superstition, or feel no
interest in the honor of your Creator, that ye listen to the horrid
tales of the Bible, or hear them with callous indifference."This is fundamentally what the Bishop has to answer, and of course he
must resort to the terrible _Tu quoque_ of Bishop Butler, Dr.Watson
says he is astonished that "so acute a reasoner" should reproduce the
argument."You profess yourself to be a deist, and to believe that there is a God,
who created the universe, and established the laws of nature, by which
it is sustained in existence.You profess that from a contemplation
of the works of God you derive a knowledge of his attributes; and you
reject the Bible because it ascribes to God things inconsistent (as you
suppose) with the attributes which you have discovered to belong to
him; in particular, you think it repugnant to his moral justice that
he should doom to destruction the crying and smiling infants of the
Canaanites.Why do you not maintain it to be repugnant to his moral
justice that he should suffer crying or smiling infants to be swallowed
up by an earthquake, drowned by an inundation, consumed by fire, starved
by a famine, or destroyed by a pestilence?"Watson did not, of course, know that he was following Bishop Butler
in laying the foundations of atheism, though such was the case.As was
said in my chapter on the "Age of Reason," this dilemma did not really
apply to Paine, His deity was inferred, despite all the disorders in
nature, exclusively from its apprehensible order without, and from the
reason and moral nature of man.He had not dealt with the problem of
evil, except implicitly, in his defence of the divine goodness, which is
inconsistent with the responsibility of his deity for natural evils, or
for anything that would be condemned by reason and conscience if done by
man.It was thus the Christian prelate who had abandoned the primitive
faith in the divine humanity for a natural deism, while the man he calls
a "child of the devil" was defending the divine humanity.This then was the way in which Paine was "answered," for I am not aware
of any important addition to the Bishop's "Apology" by other opponents.I cannot see how any Christian of the present time can regard it
otherwise than as a capitulation of the system it was supposed to
defend, however secure he may regard the Christianity of to-day.It
subjects the Bible to the judgment of human reason for the determination
of its authorship, the integrity of its text, and the correction of
admitted errors in authorship, chronology, and genealogy; it admits the
fallibility of the writers in matters of fact; it admits that some of
the moral laws of the Old Testament are "improper" and others, like
slavery, belonging to "the ferocity of human nature"; it admits the
non-fulfilment of one prophet's prediction, and the self-interested
suppression of truth by another; and it admits that "good men" were
engaged in concealing these "unsightly" things.Here are gates thrown
open for the whole "Age of Reason."The unorthodoxy of the Bishop's "Apology" does not rest on the judgment
of the present writer alone.If Gilbert Wakefield presently had to
reflect on his denunciations of Paine from the inside of a prison, the
Bishop of Llandaff had occasion to appreciate Paine's ideas on "mental
lying" as the Christian infidelity.The Bishop, born in the same year
(1737) with the two heretics he attacked--Gibbon and Paine--began his
career as a professor of chemistry at Cambridge (1764), but seven years
later became Regius professor of divinity there.His posthumous papers
present a remarkable picture of the church in his time.In replying to
Gibbon he studied first principles, and assumed a brave stand against
all intellectual and religious coercion.On the episcopal bench he
advocated a liberal policy toward France.In undertaking to answer Paine
he became himself unsettled; and at the very moment when unsophisticated
orthodoxy was hailing him as its champion, the sagacious magnates of
Church and State proscribed him.He learned that the king had described
him as "impracticable"; with bitterness of soul he saw prelates of
inferior rank and ability promoted over his head.He tried the effect
of a political recantation, in one of his charges; and when Williams was
imprisoned for publishing the "Age of Reason," and Gilbert Wakefield
for rebuking his "Charge," this former champion of free speech dared not
utter a protest.He seems to
have at length made up his mind that if he was to be punished for his
liberalism he would enjoy it.While preaching on "Revealed Religion" he
saw the Bishop of London shaking his head.In 18111, five years before
his death, he writes this significant note: "I have treated my divinity
as I, twenty-five years ago, treated my chemical papers: I have lighted
my fire with the labour of a great portion of my life."*

     * Patrick Henry's Answer to the "Age of Reason" shared the
     like fate."When, during the first two years of his
     retirement, Thomas Paine's 'Age of Reason' made its
     appearance, the old statesman was moved to write out a
     somewhat elaborate treatise in defence of the truth of
     Christianity.This treatise it was his purpose to have
     published.'He read the manuscript to his family as he
     progressed with it, and completed it a short time before his
     death' (1799).When it was finished, however, 'being
     diffident about his own work,' and impressed also by the
     great ability of the replies to Paine which were then
     appearing in England, 'he directed his wife to destroy' what
     he had written.She 'complied literally with his
     directions,' and thus put beyond the chance of publication a
     work which seemed, to some who heard it, 'the most eloquent
     and unanswerable argument in defence of the Bible which was
     ever written.'"quoted in Tyler's "Patrick
     Henry."Next to the "Age of Reason," the book that did most to advance Paine's
principles in England was, as I believe, Dr.Watson's "Apology for the
Bible."Dean Swift had warned the clergy that if they began to reason
with objectors to the creeds they would awaken skepticism.He pointed out, as Gilbert Wakefield did,
some exegetical and verbal errors in Paine's book, but they no more
affected its main purpose and argument than the grammatical mistakes in
"Common Sense" diminished its force in the American Revolution.David
Dale, the great manufacturer at Paisley, distributed three thousand
copies of the "Apology" among his workmen.The books carried among them
extracts from Paine, and the Bishop's admissions.Robert Owen married
Dale's daughter, and presently found the Paisley workmen a ripe harvest
for his rationalism and radicalism.Thus, in the person of its first clerical assailant, began the march
of the "Age of Reason" in England.In the Bishop's humiliations for
his concessions to truth, were illustrated what Paine had said of his
system's falsity and fraudulence.After the Bishop had observed the
Bishop of London manifesting disapproval of his sermon on "Revealed
Religion" he went home and wrote: "What is this thing called Orthodoxy,
which mars the fortunes of honest men?It is a sacred thing to which
every denomination of Christians lays exclusive claim, but to which no
man, no assembly of men, since the apostolic age, can prove a title."There is now a Bishop of London who might not acknowledge the claim
even for the apostolic age.The principles, apart from the particular
criticisms, of Paine's book have established themselves in the
English Church.They were affirmed by Bishop Wilson in clear language:
"Christian duties are founded on reason, not on the sovereignty of God
commanding what he pleases: God cannot command us what is not fit to be
believed or done, all his commands being founded in the necessities of
our nature."It was on this principle that Paine declared that things
in the Bible, "not fit to be believed or done," could not be divine
commands.His book, like its author, was outlawed, but men more heretical are
now buried in Westminster Abbey, and the lost bones of Thomas Paine are
really reposing in those tombs.It was he who compelled the hard and
heartless Bibliolatry of his time to repair to illiterate conventicles,
and the lovers of humanity, true followers of the man of Nazareth, to
abandon the crumbling castle of dogma, preserving its creeds as archaic
bric-a-brac.As his "Rights of Man" is now the political constitution
of England, his "Age of Reason" is in the growing constitution of its
Church,--the most powerful organization in Christendom because the
freest and most inclusive.The excitement caused in England by the "Age of Reason," and the large
number of attempted replies to it, were duly remarked by the _Moniteur_
and other French journals.The book awakened much attention in France,
and its principles were reproduced in a little French book entitled:
"Manuel des Theoantropophiles."In
January, 1797, Paine, with five families, founded in Paris the church
of Theo-philanthropy,--a word, as he stated in a letter to Erskine
"compounded of three Greek words, signifying God, Love, and Man.The
explanation given to this word is _Lovers of God and Man, or Adorers of
God and Friends of Man._" The society opened "in the street Denis, No."The Theophilanthropists believe in
the existence of God, and the immortality of the soul."The inaugural
discourse was given by Paine.It opens with these words: "Religion
has two principal enemies, Fanaticism and Infidelity, or that which
is called atheism.The first requires to be combated by reason and
morality, the other by natural philosophy."The discourse is chiefly an
argument for a divine existence based on motion, which, he maintains,
is not a property of matter.It proves a Being "at the summit of all
things."At the close he says:

"The society is at present in its infancy, and its means are small; but
I wish to hold in view the subject I allude to, and instead of teaching
the philosophical branches of learning as ornamental branches only, as
they have hitherto been taught, to teach them in a manner that shall
combine theological knowledge with scientific instruction.To do this to
the best advantage, some instruments will be necessary for the purpose
of explanation, of which the society is not yet possessed.But as the
views of the Society extend to public good, as well as to that of the
individual, and as its principles can have no enemies, means may be
devised to procure them.If we unite to the present instruction a series
of lectures on the ground I have mentioned, we shall, in the first
place, render theology the most entertaining of all studies.In the
next place, we shall give scientific instruction to those who could
not otherwise obtain it.The mechanic of every profession will there be
taught the mathematical principles necessary to render him proficient
in his art.The cultivator will there see developed the principles of
vegetation; while, at the same time, they will be led to see the hand of
God in all these things."A volume of 214 pages put forth at the close of the year shows that the
Theophilanthropists sang theistic and humanitarian hymns, and read Odes;
also that ethical readings were introduced from the Bible, and from
the Chinese, Hindu, and Greek authors.A library was established
(rue Neuve-Etienne-l'Estrapade, No.25) at which was issued (1797),
"Instruction Elementaire sur la Morale religieuse,"--this being declared
to be morality based on religion.{1797}

Thus Paine, pioneer in many things, helped to found the first theistic
and ethical society.It may now be recognized as a foundation of the Religion of Humanity.It
was a great point with Paine that belief in the divine existence was the
one doctrine common to all religions.On this rock the Church of Man was
to be built Having vainly endeavored to found the international Republic
he must repair to an ideal moral and human world.Robespierre and Pitt
being unfraternal he will bring into harmony the sages of all races.It is a notable instance of Paine's unwillingness to bring a personal
grievance into the sacred presence of Humanity that one of the four
festivals of Theophilanthropy was in honor of Washington, while its
catholicity was represented in a like honor to St.The
others so honored were Socrates and Rousseau.These selections were no
doubt mainly due to the French members, but they could hardly have been
made without Paine's agreement.It is creditable to them all that, at a
time when France believed itself wronged by Washington, his services to
liberty should alone have been remembered.The flowers of all races, as
represented in literature or in history, found emblematic association
with the divine life in nature through the flowers that were heaped on
a simple altar, as they now are in many churches and chapels.The walls
were decorated with ethical mottoes, enjoining domestic kindness and
public benevolence.Paine's pamphlet of this year (1797) on "Agrarian Justice" should be
considered part of the theophil-anthropic movement.It was written as a
proposal to the French government, at a time when readjustment of landed
property had been rendered necessary by the Revolution.*

     * "Thomas Payne a la Legislature et au Directoire: ou la
     Justice Agraire Opposee a la Loi et aux Privileges
     Agraires."It was suggested by a sermon printed by the Bishop of Llandaff, on "The
wisdom and goodness of God in having made both rich and poor."Paine
denies that God made rich and poor: "he made only male and female, and
gave them the earth for their inheritance."The earth, though naturally
the equal possession of all, has been necessarily appropriated by
individuals, because their improvements, which alone render its
productiveness adequate to human needs, cannot be detached from the
soil.Paine maintains that these private owners do nevertheless owe
mankind ground-rent.He therefore proposes a tithe,--not for God,
but for man.He advises that at the time when the owner will feel
it least,--when property is passing by inheritance from one to
another,--the tithe shall be taken from it.Personal property also owes
a debt to society, without which wealth could not exist,--as in the case
of one alone on an island.By a careful estimate he estimates that a
tithe on inheritances would give every person, on reaching majority,
fifteen pounds, and after the age of fifty an annuity of ten pounds,
leaving a substantial surplus for charity.The practical scheme
submitted is enforced by practical rather than theoretical
considerations.Property is always imperilled by poverty, especially
where wealth and splendor have lost their old fascinations, and awaken
emotions of disgust."To remove the danger it is necessary to remove the antipathies, and
this can only be done by making property productive of a national
blessing, extending to every individual When the riches of one man above
another shall increase the national fund in the same proportion; when it
shall be seen that the prosperity of that fund depends on the prosperity
of individuals; when the more riches a man acquires, the better it shall
be for the general mass; it is then that antipathies will cease, and
property be placed on the permanent basis of national interest and
protection."I have no property in France to become subject to the plan I propose.What I have, which is not much, is in the United States of America.But
I will pay one hundred pounds sterling towards this fund in France, the
instant it shall be established; and I will pay the same sum in England,
whenever a similar establishment shall take place in that country."The tithe was to be given to rich and poor alike, including owners of
the property tithed, in order that there should be no association of
alms with this "agrarian justice."About this time the priesthood began to raise their heads again.A
report favorable to a restoration to them of the churches, the raising
of bells, and some national recognition of public worship, was made by
Camille Jordan for a committee on the subject The Jesuitical report was
especially poetical about church bells, which Paine knew would ring the
knell of the Republic.He wrote a theophilanthropic letter to Camille
Jordan, from which I quote some paragraphs."You claim a privilege incompatible with the Constitution, and with
Rights.The Constitution protects equally, as it ought to do, every
profession of religion; it gives no exclusive privilege to any.The
churches are the common property of all the people; they are national
goods, and cannot be given exclusively to any one profession, because
the right does not exist of giving to any one that which appertains to
all.It would be consistent with right that the churches should be sold,
and the money arising therefrom be invested as a fund for the education
of children of poor parents of every profession, and, if more than
sufficient for this purpose, that the surplus be appropriated to the
support of the aged poor.After this every profession can erect its own
place of worship, if it choose--support its own priests, if it choose to
have any--or perform its worship without priests, as the Quakers do.""It is a want of feeling to talk of priests and bells whilst so many
infants are perishing in the hospitals, and aged and infirm poor in the
streets.The abundance that France possesses is sufficient for every
want, if rightly applied; but priests and bells, like articles of
luxury, ought to be the least articles of consideration.""No man ought to make a living by religion.Religion is not an act that can be performed by proxy.Every person must perform it for himself; and
all that a priest can do is to take from him; he wants nothing but his
money, and then to riot in the spoil and laugh at his credulity.The
only people who, as a professional sect of Christians, provide for the
poor of their society, are people known by the name of Quakers.They assemble quietly in their places of worship,
and do not disturb their neighbors with shows and noise of bells.Religion does not unite itself to show and noise."One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests.If we look
back at what was the condition of France under the _ancien regime_ we
cannot acquit the priests of corrupting the morals of the nation.""Why has the Revolution of France been stained with crimes, while the
Revolution of the United States of America was not?Men are physically
the same in all countries; it is education that makes them different.Accustom a people to believe that priests, or any other class of men,
can forgive sins, and you will have sins in abundance."While Thomas Paine was thus founding; in Paris a religion of love to God
expressed in love to man, his enemies in England were illustrating
by characteristic fruits the dogmas based on a human sacrifice.The
ascendency of the priesthood of one church over others, which he
was resisting in France, was exemplified across the channel in the
prosecution of his publisher, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
which had somehow fallen due to Paine.* The "Age of Reason," amply
advertised by its opponents, had reached a vast circulation, and a
prosecution of its publisher, Thomas Williams, for blasphemy, was
instituted in the King's Bench.Williams being a poor man, the defence
was sustained by a subscription.**

     * This loss, mentioned by Paine in a private note, occurred
     about the time when he had devoted the proceeds of his
     pamphlet on English Finance, a very large sum, to prisoners
     held for debt in Newgate.I suppose the thousand pounds were
     the proceeds of the "Age of Reason."** Subscriptions (says his circular) will be received by J.
     Ashley, Shoemaker, No.6 High Holborn; C. Cooper, Grocer,
     New Compton St., Soho; G. Wilkinson, Printer, No.115
     Shoreditch; J. Rhynd, Printer, Ray St., Clerkenwell; R.
     Hodgson, Hatter, No.It will be
     observed that the defence of free printing had fallen to
     humble people.The extent to which the English reign
of terror had gone was shown in the fact that Erskine was now the
prosecutor; he who five years before had defended the "Rights of Man,"
who had left the court in a carriage drawn by the people, now stood
in the same room to assail the most sacred of rights.He began with a
menace to the defendant's counsel (S. Kyd) on account of a notice served
on the prosecution, foreshadowing a search into the Scriptures.*

     * "The King v. Thomas Williams for Blasphemy.--Take notice
     that the Prosecutors of the Indictment against the above
     named Defendant will upon the Trial of this cause be
     required to produce a certain Book described in the said
     Indictment to be the Holy Bible.--John Martin.Solicitor for
     the Defendant.Dated the 17th day of June 1797.""No man," he cried, "deserves to be upon the Rolls of the Court who
dares, as an Attorney, to put his name to such a notice.It is an insult
to the authority and dignity of the Court of which he is an officer;
since it seems to call in question the very foundations of its
jurisdiction."So soon did Erskine point the satire of the fable he
quoted from Lucian, in Paine's defence, of Jupiter answering arguments
with thunderbolts.Erskine's argument was that the King had taken a
solemn oath "to maintain the Christian Religion as it is promulgated by
God in the Holy Scriptures.""Every man has a right to investigate, with
modesty and decency, controversial points of the Christian religion; but
no man, consistently with a law which only exists under its sanction,
has a right not only broadly to deny its very existence, but to pour
forth a shocking and insulting invective, etc."The law, he said,
permits, by a like principle, the intercourse between the sexes to
be set forth in plays and novels, but punishes such as "address the
imagination in a manner to lead the passions into dangerous excesses."Erskine read several passages from the "Age of Reason," which, their
main point being omitted, seemed mere aimless abuse.In his speech, he
quoted as Paine's words of his own collocation, representing the author
as saying, "The Bible teaches nothing but 'lies, obscenity, cruelty,
and injustice.'"This is his entire and inaccurate rendering of
what Paine,--who always distinguishes the "Bible" from the "New
Testament,"--says at the close of his comment on the massacre of the
Midianites and appropriation of their maidens:

"People in general know not what wickedness there is in this pretended
word of God.Brought up in habits of superstition, they take it for
granted that the Bible [Old Testament] is true, and that it is good;
they permit themselves not to doubt it; and they carry the ideas they
form of the benevolence of the Almighty to the book they have been
taught to believe was written by his authority.it is a book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy;
for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man
to the orders of the Almighty?"Erskine argued that the sanction of Law was the oath by which judges,
juries, witnesses administered law and justice under a belief in
"the revelation of the unutterable blessings which shall attend their
observances, and the awful punishments which shall await upon their
transgressions."The rest of his opening argument was, mainly, that
great men had believed in Christianity.Kyd, in replying, quoted from the Bishop of Llandaff's "Answer to
Gibbon": "I look upon the right of private judgment, in every respect
concerning God and ourselves, as superior to the control of human
authority"; and his claim that the Church of England is distinguished
from Mahometanism and Romanism by its permission of every man to utter
his opinion freely.Waddington,
the Bishop of Chichester, who declared that Woolston "ought not to be
punished for being an infidel, nor for writing against the Christian
religion."He quoted Paine's profession of faith on the first page of
the incriminated book: "I believe in one God and no more; I hope for
happiness, beyond this life; I believe in the equality of men, and I
believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy,
and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy."He also quoted
Paine's homage to the character of Jesus.He defied the prosecution to
find in the "Age of Reason" a single passage "inconsistent with the
most chaste, the most correct system of morals," and declared the very
passages selected for indictment pleas against obscenity and cruelty.Kyd pointed out fourteen narratives in the Bible (such as Sarah
giving Hagar to Abraham, Lot and his daughters, etc.)which, if found in
any other book, would be pronounced obscene.He was about to enumerate
instances of cruelty when the judge, Lord Kenyon, indignantly
interrupted him, and with consent of the jury said he could only allow
him to cite such passages without reading them.Kyd gratefully
acknowledged this release from the "painful task" of reading such
horrors from the "Word of God"!)One of the interesting things about
this trial was the disclosure of the general reliance on Butler's
"Analogy," used by Bishop Watson in his reply to Paine,--namely, that
the cruelties objected to in the God of the Bible are equally found
in nature, through which deists look up to their God.When Kyd, after
quoting from Bishop Watson, said, "Gentlemen, observe the weakness of
this answer," Lord Kenyon exclaimed: "I cannot sit in this place and
hear this kind of discussion."Kyd said: "My Lord, I stand here on the
privilege of an advocate in an English Court of Justice: this man has
applied to me to defend him; I have undertaken his defence; and I have
often heard your Lordship declare, that every man had a right to be
defended.I know no other mode by which I can seriously defend him
against this charge, than that which I am now pursuing; if your Lordship
wish to prevent me from pursuing it, you may as well tell me to abandon
my duty to my client at once."Lord Kenyon said: "Go on, Sir."Returning
to the analogy of the divinely ordered massacres in the Bible with the
like in nature, Kyd said:

"Gentlemen, this is reasoning by comparison; and reasoning by comparison
is often fallacious.On the present occasion the fallacy is this: that,
in the first case, the persons perish by the operation of the general
laws of nature, not suffering punishment for a crime; whereas, in the
latter, the general laws of nature are suspended or transgressed, and
God commands the slaughter to avenge his offended will.Is this then
a satisfactory answer to the objection?I think it is not; another may
think so too; which it may be fairly supposed the Author did; and then
the objection, as to him, remains in full force, and he cannot, from
insisting upon it, be fairly accused of malevolent intention."In his answer Erskine said: "The history of man is the history of man's
vices and passions, which could not be censured without adverting to
their existence; many of the instances that have been referred to were
recorded as memorable warnings and examples for the instruction of
mankind."But for this argument Erskine was indebted to his old client,
Paine, who did not argue against the things being recorded, but against
the belief "that the inhuman and horrid butcheries of men, women, and
children, told of in those books, were done, as those books say they
were done, at the command of God."Paine says: "Those accounts are
nothing to us, nor to any other persons, unless it be to the Jews, as
a part of the history of their nation; and there is just as much of
the word of God in those books as there is in any of the histories of
France, or Rapin's 'History of England,' or the history of any other
country."As in Paines own trial in 1792, the infallible scheme of a special jury
was used against Williams.Lord Kenyon closed his charge with the words:
"Unless it was for the most malignant purposes, I cannot conceive how it
was published.It is, however, for you to judge of it, and to do justice
between the Public and the Defendant.""The jury instantly found the Defendant--Guilty."Paine at once wrote a letter to Erskine, which was first printed in
Paris.He calls attention to the injustice of the special jury system,
in which all the jurymen are nominated by the crown.In London a special
jury generally consists of merchants."Talk to some London merchants
about scripture, and they will understand you mean scrip, and tell you
how much it is worth at the Stock Exchange.Ask them about Theology,
and they will say they know no such gentleman upon 'Change."He also
declares that Lord Kenyon's course in preventing Mr.Kyd from reading
passages from the Bible was irregular, and contrary to words, which he
cites, used by the same judge in another case.This Letter to Erskine contains some effective passages.In one of these
he points out the sophistical character of the indictment in declaring
the "Age of Reason" a blasphemous work, tending to bring in contempt
the holy scriptures."The charge should have stated that the work was
intended to prove certain books not the holy scriptures.It is one
thing if I ridicule a work as being written by a certain person; but it
is quite a different thing if I write to prove that such a work was not
written by such person.In the first case I attack the person through
the work; in the other case I defend the honour of the person against
the work."After alluding to the two accounts in Genesis of the creation
of man, according to one of which there was no Garden of Eden and no
forbidden tree, Paine says:

"Perhaps I shall be told in the cant language of the day, as I have
often been told by the Bishop of Llandaff and others, of the great and
laudable pains that many pious and learned men have taken to explain the
obscure, and reconcile the contradictory, or, as they say, the seemingly
contradictory passages of the Bible.It is because the Bible needs such
an undertaking, that is one of the first causes to suspect it is _not_
the word of God: this single reflection, when carried home to the mind,
is in itself a volume.does not the Creator of the Universe, the
Fountain of all Wisdom, the Origin of all Science, the Author of all
Knowledge, the God of Order and of Harmony, know how to write?When
we contemplate the vast economy of the creation, when we behold the
unerring regularity of the visible solar system, the perfection with
which all its several parts revolve, and by corresponding assemblage
form a whole;--when we launch our eye into the boundless ocean of space,
and see ourselves surrounded by innumerable worlds, not one of which
varies from its appointed place--when we trace the power of a Creator,
from a mite to an elephant, from an atom to an universe, can we suppose
that the mind [which] could conceive such a design, and the power
that executed it with incomparable perfection, cannot write without
inconsistence; or that a book so written can be the work of such a
power?The writings of Thomas Paine, even of Thomas Paine, need no
commentator to explain, compound, arrange, and re-arrange their several
parts, to render them intelligible--he can relate a fact, or write an
essay, without forgetting in one page what he has written in another;
certainly then, did the God of all perfection condescend to write or
dictate a book, that book would be as perfect as himself is perfect: The
Bible is not so, and it is confessedly not so, by the attempts to mend
it."Paine admonishes Erskine that a prosecution to preserve God's word, were
it really God's word, would be like a prosecution to prevent the sun
from falling out of heaven; also that he should be able to comprehend
that the motives of those who declare the Bible not God's word
are religious.He then gives him an account of the new church of
Theophilanthropists in Paris, and appends his discourse before that
society.In the following year, Paine's discourse to the Theophilanthropists was
separately printed by Clio Rickman, with a sentence from Shakespeare
in the title-page: "I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the
morality of imprisonment" There was also the following dedication:

"The following little Discourse is dedicated to the enemies of Thomas
Paine, by one who has known him long and intimately, and who is
convinced that he is the enemy of no man.It is printed to do good, by
a well wisher to the world.By one who thinks that discussion should
be unlimited, that all coercion is error; and that human beings should
adopt no other conduct towards each other but an appeal to truth and
reason."Paine wrote privately, in the same sense as to Erskine, to his
remonstrating friends.In one such letter (May 12th) he goes again
partly over the ground."You," he says, "believe in the Bible from the
accident of birth, and the Turks believe in the Koran from the same
accident, and each calls the other _infidel_.This answer to your letter
is not written for the purpose of changing your opinion.It is written
to satisfy you, and some other friends whom I esteem, that my disbelief
of the Bible is founded on a pure and religious belief in God.""All
are infidels who believe falsely of God.""Belief in a cruel God makes a
cruel man."Paine had for some time been attaining unique fame in England.Some
publisher had found it worth while to issue a book, entitled "Tom
Paine's Jests: Being an entirely new and select Collection of Patriotic
Bon Mots, Repartees, Anecdotes, Epigrams, &c, on Political Subjects.There are hardly a half dozen items by Paine in the book
(72 pages), which shows that his name was considered marketable.The
government had made the author a cause.Erskine, who had lost his office
as Attorney-General for the Prince of Wales by becoming Paine's counsel
in 1792, was at once taken back into favor after prosecuting the "Age of
Reason," and put on his way to become Lord Erskine.The imprisonment of
Williams caused a reaction in the minds of those who had turned
against Paine.The terror
manifested at the name of Paine--some were arrested even for showing his
portrait--was felt to be political.None of the aristocratic deists, who
wrote for the upper classes, were dealt with in the same way.Paine had
proclaimed from the housetops what, as Dr.Watson confessed, scholars
were whispering in the ear.There were lampoons of Paine, such as
those of Peter Pindar (Rev.John Wolcott), but they only served to
whet popular curiosity concerning him.* The "Age of Reason" had passed
through several editions before it was outlawed, and every copy of it
passed through many hands.From the prosecution and imprisonment of
Williams may be dated the consolidation of the movement for the
"Rights of Man," with antagonism to the kind of Christianity which
that injustice illustrated.Political liberalism and heresy thenceforth
progressed in England, hand in hand.* "I have preserved," says Royall Tyler, "an epigram of
     Peter Pindar's, written originally in a blank leaf of a copy
     of Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and not inserted in any of his
     works."'Tommy Paine wrote this book to prove that the bible Was an old woman's
dream of fancies most idle; That Solomon's proverbs were made by low
livers, That prophets were fellows who sang semiquavers; That religion
and miracles all were a jest, And the devil in torment a tale of the
priest.Though Beelzebub's absence from hell I 'll maintain!Yet we all
must allow that the Devil's in Paine.'"THE REPUBLICAN ABDIEL

The sight of James Monroe and Thomas Paine in France, representing
Republican America, was more than Gouverneur Morris could stand.He sent
to Washington the abominable slander of Monroe already quoted (ii., p.173), and the Minister's recall came at the close of 1796.* Monroe
could not sail in midwinter with his family, so they remained until
the following spring.Paine made preparations to return to America
with them, and accompanied them to Havre; but he found so many "british
frigates cruising in sight" (so he writes Jefferson) that he did not
"trust [himself] to their discretion, and the more so as [he] had no
confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet" Sure enough this Captain
Clay was friendly enough with the British cruiser which lay in wait
to catch Paine, but only succeeded in finding his letter to Jefferson.Before returning from Havre to Paris he wrote another letter to
Vice-President Jefferson.* This sudden recall involved Monroe in heavy expenses,
     which Congress afterwards repaid.Frederick McGuire, of Washington, for the manuscript of
     Monroe's statement of his expenses and annoyances caused by
     his recall, which he declares due to "the representations
     which were made to him [Washington] by those in whom he
     confided."He states that Paine remained in his house a year
     and a half, and that be advanced him 250 louis d'or.For
     these services to Paine, he adds, "no claims were ever
     presented on my part, nor is any indemnity now desired."This money was repaid ($1,188) to Monroe by an Act of
     Congress, April 7, 1831.The advances are stated in the Act
     to have been made "from time to time," and were no doubt
     regarded by both Paine and Monroe as compensated by the many
     services rendered by the author to the Legation."Havre, May 14th, 1797."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you by the Ship Dublin Packet, Captain Clay,
mentioning my intention to have returned to America by that Vessel, and
to have suggested to some Member of the House of Representatives the
propriety of calling Mr.Monroe before them to have enquired into the
state of their affairs in France.This might have laid the foundation
for some resolves on their part that might have led to an accommodation
with France, for that House is the only part of the American Government
that have any reputation here.Monroe of my design, and
he wishes to be called up."You will have heard before this reaches you that the Emperor has been
obliged to sue for peace, and to consent to the establishment of the new
republic in Lombardy.How France will proceed with respect to England,
I am not, at this distance from Paris, in the way of knowing, but am
inclined to think she meditates a descent upon that Country, and a
revolution in its Government.If this should be the plan, it will keep
me in Europe at least another year."As the british party has thrown the American commerce into wretched
confusion, it is necessary to pay more attention to the appointment of
Consuls in the ports of france, than there was occasion to do in time
of peace; especially as there is now no Minister, and Mr.Skipwith,
who stood well with the Government here, has resigned.Cutting, the
Consul for Havre, does not reside at it, and the business is altogether
in the hands of De la Motte, the Vice Consul, who is a frenchman, [and]
cannot have the full authority proper for the office in the difficult
state matters are now in.I do not mention this to the disadvantage of
Mr.Cutting, for no man is more proper than himself if he thought it an
object to attend to."I know not if you are acquainted with Captain Johnson of
Massachusetts--he is a staunch man and one of the oldest American
Captains in the American employ.He is now settled at Havre and is a
more proper man for a Vice Consul than La Motte.He has written to some of his friends to have
the appointment and if you can see an opportunity of throwing in a
little service for him, you will do a good thing.He would be well received as an
individual, but as an Envoy of John Adams he could do nothing.The following, in Paine's handwriting, is copied from the original in
the Morrison papers, at the British Museum.It was written in the summer
of 1797, when Lord Malmsbury was at Lille in negotiation for peace.The negotiations were broken off because the English commissioners were
unauthorized to make the demanded restorations to Holland and Spain.Paine's essay was no doubt sent to the Directory in the interests of
peace, suggesting as it does a compromise, as regards the Cape of Good
Hope."Cape of Good Hope.--It is very well known that Dun-das, the English
Minister for Indian affairs, is tenacious of holding the Cape of Good
Hope, because it will give to the English East India Company a monopoly
of the commerce of India; and this, on the other hand, is the very
reason that such a claim is inadmissible by France, and by all the
nations trading in India and to Canton, and would also be injurious to
Canton itself.--We pretend not to know anything of the negociations at
Lille, but it is very easy to see, from the nature of the case, what
ought to be the condition of the Cape.It ought to be a free port open
to the vessels of all nations trading to any part of the East Indias.It
ought also to be a neutral port at all times, under the guarantee of
all nations; the expense of keeping the port in constant repair to
be defrayed by a tonnage tax to be paid by every vessel, whether
of commerce or of war, and in proportion to the time of their
stay.--Nothing then remains but with respect to the nation who shall be
the port-master; and this ought to be the Dutch, because they understand
the business best.As the Cape is a half-way stage between Europe and
India, it ought to be considered as a tavern, where travellers on a long
journey put up for rest and refreshment.--T.The suspension of peace negotiations,* and the bloodless defeat of
Pichigru's conspiracy of 18 Fructidor (September 4th) were followed by a
pamphlet addressed to "The People of France and the French Armies."This
little work is of historical value, in connection with 18 Fructidor, but
it was evidently written to carry two practical points.The first was,
that if the war with England must continue it should be directed to the
end of breaking the Anglo-Germanic compact.England has the right to
her internal arrangements, but this is an external matter.While "with
respect to England it has been the cause of her immense national debt,
the ruin of her finances, and the insolvency of her bank," English
intrigues on the continent "are generated by, and act through, the
medium of this Anglo-Germanic compound.Let the elector retire to his electorate, and the world will have
peace."Paine's other main point is, that the neutral nations should
secure, in time of war, an unarmed neutrality.* In a letter to Duane, many years later, Paine relates the
     following story concerning the British Union: "When Lord
     Malmsbury arrived in Paris, in the time of the Directory
     Government, to open a negociation for a peace, his
     credentials ran in the old style of 'George, by the grace of
     God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king.'Malmsbury
     was informed that although the assumed title of king of
     France, in his credentials, would not prevent France opening
     a negociation, yet that no treaty of peace could be
     concluded until that assumed title was removed.Pitt then
     hit on the Union.Bill, under which the assumed title of
     king of France was discontinued.""Were the neutral nations to associate, under an honorable injunction of
fidelity to each other, and publickly declare to the world, that if any
belligerent power shall seize or molest any ship or vessel belonging
to the citizens or subjects of any of the powers composing that
association, that the whole association will shut its ports against the
flag of the offending nation, and will not permit any goods, wares,
or merchandize, produced or manufactured in the offending nation, or
appertaining thereto, to be imported into any of the ports included
in the association, until reparation be made to the injured party; the
reparation to be three times the value of the vessel and cargo; and
moreover that all remittances in money, goods, and bills of exchange, do
cease to be made to the offending nation, until the said reparation be
made.Were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their
direct interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of
neutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would
not But whilst, from want of a common system, they individually permit
England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it, they put
France under the necessity of doing the same thing.The supreme of all
laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation."It is a notable illustration of the wayward course of political
evolution, that the English republic--for it is such--grew largely out
of the very parts of its constitution once so oppressive.The foreign
origin of the royal family helped to form its wholesome timidity about
meddling with politics, allowing thus a development of ministerial
government.The hereditary character of the throne, which George
III.'s half-insane condition associated with the recklessness of
irresponsibility, was by his complete insanity made to serve ministerial
independence.Regency is timid about claiming power, and childhood
cannot exercise it.The decline of royal and aristocratic authority in
England secured freedom to commerce, which necessarily gave hostages to
peace.The protection of neutral commerce at sea, concerning which Paine
wrote so much, ultimately resulted from English naval strength, which
formerly scourged the world.To Paine, England, at the close of 1797, could appear only as a
dragon-guarded prison of fair Humanity.The press was paralyzed,
thinkers and publishers were in prison, some of the old orators like
Erskine were bought up, and the forlorn hope of liberty rested only with
Fox and his fifty in Parliament, overborne by a majority made brutal by
strength.The groans of imprisoned thought in his native land reached
its outlawed representative in Paris.And at the same time the inhuman
decree went forth from that country that there should be no peace with
France.It had long been his conviction that the readiness of Great
Britain to go to war was due to an insular position that kept the
horrors at a distance.This conviction,
which we have several times met in these pages, returned to him with new
force when England now insisted on more bloodshed.He was convinced that
the right course of France would be to make a descent on England, ship
the royal family to Hanover, open the political prisons, and secure the
people freedom to make a Constitution.These views, freely expressed
to his friends of the Directory and Legislature, reached the ears of
Napoleon on his triumphal return from Italy.The great man called upon Paine in his little room, and invited him
to dinner.He made the eloquent professions of republicanism so
characteristic of Napoleons until they became pretenders.He told Paine
that he slept with the "Rights of Man" under his pillow, and that its
author ought to have a statue of gold.*

     * Rickman, p.He consulted Paine about a descent on England, and adopted the plan.He
invited the author to accompany the expedition, which was to consist of
a thousand gun-boats, with a hundred men each.Paine consented, "as
[so he wrote Jefferson] the intention of the expedition was to give the
people of England an opportunity of forming a government for themselves,
and thereby bring about peace."One of the points to be aimed at was
Norfolk, and no doubt Paine indulged a happy vision of standing once
more in Thetford and proclaiming liberty throughout the land!The following letter (December 29, 1797) from Paine to Barras is in the
archives of the Directory, with a French translation:

"Citizen President,--A very particular friend of mine, who had a
passport to go to London upon some family affairs and to return in three
months, and whom I had commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for
I find that the English government has seized upon a thousand pounds
sterling which I had in the hands of a friend), returned two days ago
and gave me the memorandum which I enclose:--the first part relates only
to my publication on the event of the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to
Erskine (who had been counsel for the prosecution against a former
work of mine the 'Age of Reason') both of which I desired my friend to
publish in London.The other part of the memorandum respects the state
of affairs in that country, by which I see they have little or no idea
of a descent being made upon them; tant mieux--but they will be guarded
in Ireland, as they expect a descent there."I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two.As
this is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to the Citizen
Revelliere Le Peaux, I will send it to him.The friend of whom I speak
was a pupil of Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to
you at a public audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan
respecting the Island of Bermuda.--Salut et Respect."{1798}

Thus once again did the great hope of a liberated, peaceful, and
republican Europe shine before simple-hearted Paine.He was rather poor
now, but gathered up all the money he had, and sent it to the Council of
Five Hundred.The accompanying letter was read by Coupe at the sitting
of January 28, 1798:

"Citizens Representatives,--Though it is not convenient to me, in the
present situation of my affairs, to subscribe to the loan towards the
descent upon England, my economy permits me to make a small patriotic
donation.I send a hundred livres, and with it all the wishes of my
heart for the success of the descent, and a voluntary offer of any
service I can render to promote it."There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until
the tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
England, like Italy, become a sister republic.As to those men, whether
in England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are
covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than in
committing more.But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free."Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old
colleague in the dangers we have passed, and on the happy prospect
before us.Coupe added: "The gift which Thomas Paine offers you appears very
trifling, when it is compared with the revolting injustice which this
faithful friend of liberty has experienced from the English government;
but compare it with the state of poverty in which our former colleague
finds himself, and you will then think it considerable."He moved that
the notice of this gift and Thomas Paine's letter be printed."Mention
honorable et impression," adds the Moniteur.The President of the Directory at this time was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, a
friend of the Theophilanthropic Society.To him Paine gave, in English,
which the president understood, a plan for the descent, which was
translated into French, and adopted by the Directory.Two hundred and
fifty gun-boats were built, and the expedition abandoned.To Jefferson,
Paine intimates his suspicion that it was all "only a feint to cover the
expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing."He also states that the
British descent on Ostend, where some two thousand of them were made
prisoners, "was in search of the gun-boats, and to cut the <DW18>s, to
prevent their being assembled."This he was told by Vanhuile, of Bruges,
who heard it from the British officers.After the failure of his attempt to return to America with the Monroes,
Paine was for a time the guest of Nicolas de Bonneville, in Paris,
and the visit ended in an arrangement for his abode with that family.Bonneville was an editor, thirty-seven years of age, and had been one of
the five members of Paine's Republican Club, which placarded Paris with
its manifesto after the king's flight in 1791.An enthusiastic
devotee of Paine's principles from youth, he had advocated them in
his successive journals, _Le Tribun du Peuple, Bouche de Fer, and
Bien Informe_.He had resisted Marat and Robespierre, and suffered
imprisonment during the Terror.He spoke English fluently, and was
well known in the world of letters by some striking poems, also by his
translation into French of German tales, and parts of Shakespeare.He
had set up a printing office at No.4 Rue du Theatre-Francais, where he
published liberal pamphlets, also his _Bien Informe_.Then, in 1794, he
printed in French the "Age of Reason."He also published, and probably
translated into French, Paine's letter to the now exiled Camille
Jordan,--"Lettre de Thomas Paine, sur les Cultes."Paine, unable to
converse in French, found with the Bonnevilles a home he needed.M. and
Madame Bonneville had been married three years, and their second child
had been named after Thomas Paine, who stood as his godfather.Paine,
as we learn from Rickman, who knew the Bonnevilles, paid board, but no
doubt he aided Bonneville more by his pen.With public affairs, either in France or America, Paine now mingled but
little.The election of John Adams to the presidency he heard of with
dismay.He wrote to Jefferson that since he was not president, he was
glad he had accepted the vice-presidency, "for John Adams has such a
talent for blundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye
over him."Finding, by the abandonment of a descent on.England for
one on Egypt, that Napoleon was by no means his ideal missionary of
republicanism, he withdrew into his little study, and now remained so
quiet that some English papers announced his arrival and cool reception
in America.He was, however, fairly bored with visitors from all parts
of the world, curious to see the one international republican left.It became necessary for Madame Bonneville, armed with polite
prevarications, to defend him from such sight-seers.For what with
his visits to and from the Barlows, the Smiths, and his friends of the
Directory, Paine had too little time for the inventions in which he was
again absorbed,--his "Saints."Among his intimate friends at this time
was Robert Fulton, then residing in Paris.Paine's extensive studies
of the steam-engine, and his early discovery, of its adaptability to
navigation, had caused Rumsey to seek him in England, and Fitch to
consult him both in America and Paris.Paine's connection with the
invention of the steamboat was recognized by Fulton, as indeed by all of
his scientific contemporaries.Sandra journeyed to the bathroom.* To Fulton he freely gave his ideas,
and may perhaps have had some hope that the steamboat might prove a
missionary of international republicanism, though Napoleon had failed.* Sir Richard Phillips says: "In 1778 Thomas Paine proposed,
     in America, this application of steam."("Million of Facts,"
     p.As Sir Richard assisted Fulton in his experiments
     on the Thames, he probably heard from him the fact about
     Paine, though, indeed, in the controversy between Rumsey and
     Fitch, Paine's priority to both was conceded.In America,
     however, the priority really belonged to the eminent
     mechanician William Henry, of Lancaster, Pa.When Fitch
     visited Henry, in 1785, he was told by him that he was not
     the first to devise steam-navigation; that he himself had
     thought of it in 1776, and mentioned it to Andrew Ellicott;
     and that Thomas Paine, while a guest at his house in 1778,
     had spoken to him on the subject I am indebted to Mr.John
     W. Jordan, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, for
     notes from the papers of Henry, his ancestor, showing that
     Paine's scheme was formed without knowledge of others, and
     that it contemplated a turbine application of steam to a
     wheel.Both he and Henry, as they had not published their
     plans, agreed to leave Fitch the whole credit.Fitch
     publicly expressed his gratitude to Paine.Thurston adds
     that Paine, in 1788, proposed that Congress should adopt the
     whole matter for the national benefit.("History of the
     Growth of the Steam Engine," pp.It will not be forgotten that in the same year in which Paine startled
William Henry with a plan for steam-navigation, namely in 1778, he wrote
his sublime sentence about the "Religion of Humanity."The steamships,
which Emerson described as enormous shuttles weaving the races of
men into the woof of humanity, have at length rendered possible that
universal human religion which Paine foresaw.In that old Lancaster
mansion of the Henrys, which still stands, Paine left his spectacles,
now in our National Museum; they are strong and far-seeing; through them
looked eyes held by visions that the world is still steadily following.One cannot suppress some transcendental sentiment in view of
the mystical harmony of this man's inventions for human
welfare,--mechanical, political, religious.Of his gunpowder motor,
mention has already been made (i., p.On this he was engaged
about the time that he was answering Bishop Watson's book on the "Age of
Reason."He could not believe, he said,
that the qualities of gunpowder--the small and light grain with maximum
of force--were meant only for murder, and his faith in the divine
humanity is in the sentence.To supersede destroying gunpowder with
beneficent gunpowder, and to supersede the god of battles with the God
of Love, were kindred aims in Paine's heart Through the fiery furnaces
of his time he had come forth with every part of his being welded and
beaten and shaped together for this Human Service.Patriotism, in the
conventional sense, race-pride, sectarianism, partizanship, had been
burnt out of his nature.The universe could not have wrung from his
tongue approval of a wrong because it was done by his own country.It might be supposed that there were no heavier trials awaiting Paine's
political faith than those it had undergone.But it was becoming evident
that liberty had not the advantage he once ascribed to truth over
error,--"it cannot be unlearned."The United States had unlearned it as
far as to put into the President's hands a power of arbitrarily crushing
political opponents, such as even George III.The
British Treaty had begun to bear its natural fruits.Washington signed
the Treaty to avoid war, and rendered war inevitable with both France
and England.The affair with France was happily a transient squall, but
it was sufficient to again bring on Paine the offices of an American
Minister in France.Many an American in that country had occasion to
appreciate his powerful aid and unfailing kindness.Among these was
Captain Rowland Crocker of Massachusetts, who had sailed with a letter
of marque.'His vessel was captured by the French, and its wounded
commander brought to Paris, where he was more agreeably conquered by
kindness.Freeman's "History of Cape Cod" (of which region Crocker was a
native) has the following:

"His [Captain Crocker's] reminiscences of his residence in that country,
during the most extraordinary period of its history, were of a highly
interesting character.He had taken the great Napoleon by the hand; he
had familiarly known Paine, at a time when his society was sought for
and was valuable.Of this noted individual, we may in passing say, with
his uniform and characteristic kindness, he always spoke in terms which
sounded strange to the ears of a generation which has been taught, with
or without justice, to regard the author of 'The Age of Reason' with
loathing and abhorrence.He remembered Paine as a well-dressed and most
gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox republican principles, of a good
heart, a strong intellect, and a fascinating address."{1799}

The _coup d'etat_ in America, which made President Adams virtual
emperor, pretended constitutionality, and was reversible.That which
Napoleon and Sieves--who had his way at last--effected in France
(November 9, 1799) was lawless and fatal.The peaceful Bonneville home
was broken up.Bonneville, in his _Bien Informe_ described Napoleon as
"a Cromwell," and was promptly imprisoned.Paine, either before or soon
after this catastrophe, went to Belgium, on a visit to his old friend
Vanhuile, who had shared his cell in the Luxembourg prison.Vanhuile
was now president of the municipality of Bruges, and Paine got from him
information about European affairs.On his return he found Bonneville
released from prison, but under severe surveillance, his journal being
suppressed.The family was thus reduced to penury and anxiety, but there
was all the more reason that Paine should stand by them.He continued
his abode in their house, now probably supported by drafts on his
resources in America, to which country they turned their thoughts.{1800}

The European Republic on land having become hopeless, Paine turned
his attention to the seas.He wrote a pamphlet on "Maritime Compact,"
including in it ten articles for the security of neutral commerce, to
be signed by the nations entering the "Unarmed Association," which he
proposed.This scheme was substantially the same as that already quoted
from his letter "To the People of France, and to the French Armies."It was translated by Bonneville, and widely circulated in Europe.Paine
sent it in manuscript to Jefferson, who at once had it printed.His
accompanying letter to Jefferson (October i, 1800) is of too much
biographical interest to be abridged.* Oliver Ellsworth, William V. Murray, and William R. Davie,
     were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a
     treaty.There is little doubt that the famous letter of Joel
     Barlow to Washington, October 2, 1798, written in the
     interest of peace, was composed after consultation with
     Paine.Adams, on reading the letter, abused Barlow."Tom
     Paine," he said, "is not a more worthless fellow."But he
     obeyed the letter.The Commissioners he sent were associated
     with the anti-French and British party in America, but peace
     with America was of too much importance to the new despot of
     France for the opportunity to be missed of forming a Treaty."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the
year 1797.It was then my intention to return to America; but there were
so many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after
a few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did
not think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,
as I had no confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).I
mentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'
the hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not
President that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.have been here about eight months,
and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.Their
presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit They
set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived.Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
returning the visits of Mr.Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,
they had not the confidence of the executive.Every known republican was
treated in the same manner.Miller of Philadelphia,
who had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend to
return my visit, if I made one.This I supposed it was intended I should
know, that I might not make one.I told him, I did not come to see him as a
commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to
see him because I had formerly known him in Congress.I mean not, said
I, to press you with any questions, or to engage you in any conversation
upon the business you are come upon, but I will nevertheless candidly
say that I know not what expectations the Government or the people of
America may have of your mission, or what expectations you may have
yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but little.The
treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your business.The
American Government never did two more foolish things than when it
signed that Treaty and recalled Mr.Monroe, who was the only man could
do them any service.Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a Judge,
and was silent.I added, you may perhaps make a treaty like that you
have made with England, which is a surrender of the rights of the
American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make neutral
property must be general or not at all.I then changed the subject, for
I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired after Sam.Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr.Monroe, and
others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow fever,--of
which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been summing
up a case to a Jury.Ellsworth been as
cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my
visit that he might appear insensible of the intention of mine."I now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe.You will, I
suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of
Marengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice
in consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa, etc., to
the french--of the successes of the french army in Germany--and the
extension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of
peace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to
ratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the
french Government in consequence of that refusal--of the 'gallant'
expedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his
pompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put
in all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of
General Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the
Army, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise,
unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within
45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany
(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstad), as security that he would sign them.This is the state things [they] are now in, at the time of writing this
letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign
the preliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be
admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to
by the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,
before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.From
all which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor
is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of
getting out but by a peace.The Congress for the peace is to be held
at Luneville, a town in france.Since the affair of Rastadt the french
commissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.I know not what the Commissioners have
done, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have
some authority, it is not much.The paper as you will perceive is
considerably prior to this letter.I knew that the Commissioners before
this piece appeared intended setting off.It is therefore probable that
what they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which
certainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,
neither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the
business."But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
treaties unnecessary.In the first place I doubt if any peace will be
made with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
the seas.This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.1, without any title, was written in consequence of
a question put to me by Bonaparte.As he supposed I knew England
and English Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of
negociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include
England.Julian was in Paris, on the part of the
Emperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the
Emperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at
Sea_, was written when the English made their insolent and impolitic
expedition to Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No.I shewed it to a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french,
and printed in the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the
foreign Ministers, and persons in the Government.It was immediately
copied into several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper,
the Moniteur.It appeared in this paper one day before the last
dispatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said
respecting Egypt.It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact
proper moment.3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No.It is translating at the time I write this letter,
and I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.The pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential
person, where they will be published."By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
meditating against England.It is now given for certain that Paul has
embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till
some principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral
Nations, and securing the liberty of the Seas.The preparations in
Denmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with
England, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by
England to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided.I send you the
paragraphs upon the subject."The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the
excessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.I attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the
non-circulation of cash, than to any other cause, People in trade
can push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by
continental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity
they endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance."I have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I
trouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the
Commissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,
otherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his
place."In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from
them, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her
while to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of
those circumstances which, if they go on will render partial treaties
useless by deranging them.But if, in the mean time, she enters into
any treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:
Reserving to herself the right of joining in an association of Nations
for the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of
the liberty of the Seas."The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press.They will make a small pamphlet
and the printers are welcome to put my name to it.It is best it should
be put from thence; they will get into the newspapers.I know that the
faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily.It
does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I
am doing America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for nothing.1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends."I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject.Ellsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to
Holland, and in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr.Skipwith
that has been in the habit of transacting business with the french
Government since the revolution began.He is on a good standing with
them, and if the chance of the day should place you in the presidency
you cannot do better than appoint him for any purpose you may have
occasion for in France.He is an honest man and will do his country
Justice, and that with civility and good manners to the government he
is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy
Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never
possessed.Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr.It is upon
the fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not
communicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he
know, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have
intention to do it."I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the
progress of Iron Bridges.Burke's attack
upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works.Since my coming from
England in '92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span versed
sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my
model was, and erected over the river Wear at Sunderland in the county
of Durham in England.The two members in Parliament for the County,
Mr.Milbank, were the principal subscribers; but the
direction was committed to Mr.A very sincere friend of mine,
Sir Robert Smyth, who lives in france, and whom Mr.Monroe well knows,
supposing they had taken their plan from my model wrote to Mr.Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have
by me and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge: 'With
respect to the Bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland it certainly is
a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure, durability
and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was
taken from Mr.Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington.But with respect
to any compensation to Mr.Paine, however desirous of rewarding the
labours of an ingenious man, I see not how it is in my power, having had
nothing to do with his bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr.But if you can point out
any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.P. any
compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from
his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great
satisfaction.'"I have now made two other models, one is pasteboard, five feet span
and five inches of height from the cords.It is in the opinion of every
person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can
behold.I then cast a model in Metal following the construction of that
in pasteboard and of the same dimensions.The whole was executed in my
own Chamber.It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris.I
shall bring those Models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
as I can pass the seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls."I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Landaff's
answer to my second part of the Age of reason.As soon as I got a
copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an answer to the
Bishop; but as soon as the clerical Society for promoting _Christian
Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted,
as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to prevent that
answer appearing.No other reason than this can be assigned for their
prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had been in
circulation above three years and the second part more than one, and
they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their
Champion.Burke's attack on the french
revolution; served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects
upon, with more advantage than if the background was not there.This is
the motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone
on without taking any notice of him.I have made and am still making
additions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an
opportunity arrive for publishing it."If any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of
it fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
returning.The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is
entirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health.This is
the first of October, and Mr.Skipwith has just called to tell me the
Commissioners set off for Havre tomorrow.This will go by the frigate
but not with the knowledge of the Commissioners.Remember me with much
affection to my friends and accept the same to yourself."As the Commissioners did not leave when they expected, Paine added
several other letters to Jefferson, on public affairs.In one (October
1st) he says he has information of increasing aversion in the English
people to their government."It was the hope of conquest, and is now the
hope of peace that keeps it [Pitt's administration] up."When
suspicion wakes the credit vanishes as the dream would.""England has a
large Navy, and the expense of it leads to her ruin."The English nation
is tired of war, longs for peace, "and calculates upon defeat as
it would upon victory."On October 4th, after the Commissioners had
concluded a treaty, Paine alludes to an article said to be in it,
requiring certain expenditures in France, and says that if he,
Jefferson, be "in the chair, and not otherwise," he should offer himself
for this business, should an agent be required "It will serve to defray
my expenses until I can return, but I wish it may be with the condition
of returning.I am not tired of working for nothing, but I cannot afford
it.This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I am now upon
of a law of nations for the protection of neutral commerce."On October
6th he reports to Jefferson that at an entertainment given the American
envoys, Consul Le Brun gave the toast: "A l'union de l'Amerique avec les
puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberte des mers."On October
15th the last of his enclosures to Jefferson is written.He says that
Napoleon, when asked if there would be more war, replied: "Nous
n'aurions plus qu'une guerre d'ecritoire."In all of Paine's writing
about Napoleon, at this time, he seems as if watching a thundercloud,
and trying to make out meteorologically its drift, and where it will
strike.{1801}

On July 15, 1801, Napoleon concluded with Pius VII.Naturally, the first victim offered on the restored altar was
Theophilan-thropy.I have called Paine the founder of this Society,
because it arose amid the controversy excited by the publication of "Le
Siecle de la Raison," its manual and tracts reproducing his ideas and
language; and because he gave the inaugural discourse.Theism was little
known in France save as iconoclasm, and an assault on the Church: Paine
treated it as a Religion.But, as he did not speak French, the practical
organization and management of the Society were the work of others, and
mainly of a Russian named Hauey.There had been a good deal of odium
incurred at first by a society which satisfied neither the pious nor the
freethinkers, but it found a strong friend on the Directory.This
was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, whose secretary, Antoine Vallee, and young
daughter, had become interested in the movement.This statesman never
joined the Society, but he had attended one of its meetings, and, when
a distribution of religious edifices was made, Theophilanthropy was
assigned ten parish churches.It is said that when Larevelliere-Lepeaux
mentioned to Talleyrand his desire for the spread of this Society, the
diplomat said: "All you have to do is to get yourself hanged, and revive
the third day."Paine, who had pretty nearly fulfilled that requirement,
saw the Society spread rapidly, and he had great hopes of its future.also had an interested eye on it, and though the
Concordat did not go into legal operation until 1802, Theophilanthropy
was offered as a preliminary sacrifice in October, 1801.The description of Paine by Walter Savage Landor, and representations
of his talk, in the "Imaginary Conversations," so mix up persons, times,
and places, that I was at one time inclined to doubt whether the two had
met.J. M. Wheeler, a valued correspondent in London, writes
me: "Landor told my friend Mr.Birch of Florence that he particularly
admired Paine, and that he visited him, having first obtained an
interview at the house of General Dumouriez.Landor declared that Paine
was always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a
jolly good fellow."An interview with Paine at the house of Dumouriez
could only have occurred when the General was in Paris, in 1793.This
would account for what Landor says of Paine taking refuge from trouble
in brandy.There had been, as, Rickman testifies, and as all the facts
show, nothing of this kind since that period.It would appear therefore
that Landor must have mixed up at least two interviews with Paine, one
in the time of Dumouriez, the other in that of Napoleon.Not even
such an artist as Landor could invent the language ascribed to Paine
concerning the French and Napoleon."The whole nation may be made as enthusiastic about a salad as about a
constitution; about the colour of a cockade as about a consul or a king.You will shortly see the real strength and figure of Bonaparte.He is
wilful, headstrong, proud, morose, presumptuous; he will be guided no
longer; he has pulled the pad from his forehead, and will break his nose
or bruise his cranium against every table, chair, and brick in the room,
until at last he must be sent to the hospital."Paine prophesies that Napoleon will make himself emperor, and that "by
his intemperate use of power and thirst of dominion" he will cause the
people to "wish for their old kings, forgetting what beasts they were."Normandy" Landor disguises Thomas Poole,
referred to on a preceding page.Normandy's sufferings on account of one
of Paine's books are not exaggerated.Sanford's work is printed
a letter from Paris, July 20, 1802, in which Poole says: "I called one
Morning on Thomas Paine.Striking,
strong physiognomy.Said a great many quaint things, and read us part of
a reply which he intends to publish to Watson's 'Apology.'"* "Thomas Poole and His Friends," ii., p.Paine seems to have had no relation with the ruling powers at this time,
though an Englishman who visited him is quoted by Rickman (p.198) as
remarking his manliness and fearlessness, and that he spoke as freely as
ever after Bonaparte's supremacy.One communication only to any member
of the government appears; this was to the Minister of the Interior
concerning a proposed iron bridge over the Seine.* Political France and
Paine had parted.Under date of March 18, 1801, President Jefferson informs Paine that he
had sent his manuscripts (Maritime Compact) to the printer to be made
into a pamphlet, and that the American people had returned from their
frenzy against France.He adds:

"You expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public
vessel.Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland
to receive and accommodate you back if you can be ready to depart
at such short warning.R. Livingston is appointed minister
plenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till
we receive the ratification of the convention by Mr.** I am in
hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former
times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with
as much effect as any man living.That you may long live to continue
your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of
nations, is my sincere prayer.Accept assurances of my high esteem and
affectionate attachment."*  "The Minister of the Interior to Thomas Paine: I have
     received, Citizen, the observations that you have been so
     good as to address to me upon the construction of iron
     bridges.They will be of the greatest utility to us when the
     new kind of construction goes to be executed for the first
     time.With pleasure I assure you, Citizen, that you have
     rights of more than one kind to the gratitude of nations,
     and I give you, cordially, the expression of my particular
     esteem.--Chaptal."It is rather droll, considering the appropriation of his
     patent in England, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
     belonging to him, to find Paine casually mentioning that at
     this time a person came from London with plans and drawings
     to consult with him about an iron arch of 600 feet, over the
     Thames, then under consideration by a committee of the House
     of Commons.**  "Beau Dawson," an eminent Virginia Congressman.The subjoined notes are from letters of Paine to Jefferson:

_Paris, June 9, 1801_.Dawson gave me
the real sensation of happy satisfaction, and what served to increase
it was that he brought it to me himself before I knew of his arrival.There has been no circumstance
with respect to America since the times of her revolution that excited
so much attention and expectation in France, England, Ireland, and
Scotland as the pending election for President of the United States, nor
any of which the event has given more general joy:

"I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the
Maryland, but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr."The Parliamentaire, from America to Havre,
was taken in going out, and carried into England.The pretence, as the
papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for America.If
I had happened to have been there, I suppose they would have made no
ceremony in conducting me on shore."*




{1802}

_Paris, March 17,1802_."As it is now Peace, though the definitive
Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by the first opportunity from
Havre or Dieppe, after the equinoctial gales are over.I continue in
excellent health, which I know your friendship will be glad to hear
of.--Wishing you and America every happiness, I remain your former
fellow-labourer and much obliged fellow-citizen."Paine's determination not to return to America in a national vessel was
owing to a paragraph he saw in a Baltimore paper, headed "Out at Last."It stated that Paine had written to the President, expressing a wish to
return by a national ship, and that "permission was given."There was
here an indication that Jefferson's invitation to Paine by the Hon.John
Dawson had become known to the President's enemies, and that Jefferson,
on being attacked, had apologized by making the matter appear an act
of charity.Paine would not believe that the President was personally
responsible for the apologetic paragraph, which seemed inconsistent with
the cordiality of the letter brought by Dawson; but, as he afterwards
wrote to Jefferson, "it determined me not to come by a national ship."*
His request had been made at a time when any other than a national
American ship was pretty certain to land him in an English prison.There
was evidently no thought of any _eclat_ in the matter, but no doubt a
regard for economy as well as safety.Jefferson had been charged
     with sending a national ship to France for the sole purpose
     of bringing Paine home, and Paine himself would have been
     the first to condemn such an assumption of power.Although
     the President's adherents thought it right to deny this,
     Jefferson wrote to Paine that he had nothing to do with the
     paragraph."With respect to the letter [offering the ship] I
     never hesitate to avow and justify it in conversation.In no
     other way do I trouble myself to contradict anything which
     is said.At that time, however, there were anomalies in the
     motions of some of our friends which events have at length
     reduced to regularity."The following to the eminent deist lecturer in New York, Elihu Palmer,
bears the date, "Paris, February 21, 1802, since the Fable of Christ":

"Dear Friend, I received, by Mr.Livingston, the letter you wrote me,
and the excellent work you have published ["The Principles of Nature"].I see you have thought deeply on the subject, and expressed your
thoughts in a strong and clear style.The hinting and intimating manner
of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind, produced
skepticism, but not conviction.Some people
can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it.Say a
bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think."There is an intimate friend of mine, Colonel Joseph Kirk-bride of
Bordentown, New Jersey, to whom I would wish you to send your work.He
is an excellent man, and perfectly in our sentiments.You can send it by
the stage that goes partly by land and partly by water, between New York
and Philadelphia, and passes through Bordentown."I expect to arrive in America in May next.I have a third part of the
Age of Reason to publish when I arrive, which, if I mistake not, will
make a stronger impression than any thing I have yet published on the
subject."I write this by an ancient colleague of mine in the French Convention,
the citizen Lequinio, who is going [as] Consul to Rhode Island, and who
waits while I write.The following, dated July 8, 1802, to Consul Rotch, is the last letter I
find written by Paine from Paris:

"My Dear Friend,--The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go
to America.He is willing to do anything on board a ship to lesson the
expense of his passage.If you know any captain to whom such a person
may be usefull I will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted
to take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negociate some
arrangements of Commerce, I have given up that idea.I wait now for the
arrival of a person from England whom I want to see,** after which, I
shall bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe.I am with affectionate
esteem to you and Mrs.Rotch,

"Yours,

"Thomas Paine."* J. M. Lequinio, author of "Prejudices Destroyed," and
     other rationalistic works, especially dealt with in
     Priestley's "Letters to the Philosophers of France."The President's cordial letter had raised a happy vision before the eyes
of one sitting amid the ruins of his republican world.As he said of
Job, he had "determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
upon himself the hard duty of contentment."Of the comrades with whom he
began the struggle for liberty in France but a small circle remained.As he wrote to Lady Smith,--from whom he must now part,--"I might almost
say like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Of the American and
English friends who cared for him when he came out of prison few remain.The President's letter came to a poor man in a small room, furnished
only with manuscripts and models of inventions.Here he was found by
an old friend from England, Henry Redhead Yorke, who, in 1795, had been
tried in England for sedition.Yorke has left us a last glimpse of the
author in "wretched and restless Europe."The "rights of man" had become
so antiquated in Napoleon's France, that Yorke found Paine's name odious
on account of his antislavery writings, the people "ascribing to his
espousal of the rights of the <DW64>s of St.Domingo the resistance
which Leclercq had experienced from them."A "jolly-looking woman" (in whom we recognize
Madame Bonneville) scrutinized Yorke severely, but was smiling enough
on learning that he was Paine's old friend.He was ushered into a little
room heaped with boxes of documents, a chaos of pamphlets and journals.While Yorke was meditating on the contrast between this habitation of a
founder of two great republics and the mansions of their rulers, his old
friend entered, dressed in a long flannel gown."Time seemed to have made dreadful ravages over his whole frame, and a
settled melancholy was visible on his countenance.He desired me to be
seated, and although he did not recollect me for a considerable time,
he conversed with his usual affability.I confess I felt extremely
surprised that he should have forgotten me; but I resolved not to make
myself known to him, as long as it could be avoided with propriety.In
order to try his memory, I referred to a number of circumstances which
had occurred while we were in company, but carefully abstained from
hinting that we had ever lived together.He would frequently put his
hand to his forehead, and exclaim, 'Ah!I know that voice, but my
recollection fails!'At length I thought it time to remove his suspense,
and stated an incident which instantly recalled me to his mind.It
is impossible to describe the sudden change which this effected; his
countenance brightened, he pressed me by the hand, and a silent tear
stole down his cheek.For some
time we sat without a word escaping from our lips.'Thus are we met once
more, Mr.Paine,' I resumed, 'after a long separation of ten years,
and after having been both of us severely weather-beaten.''Aye,' he
replied, 'and who would have thought that we should meet in Paris?'He then enquired what motive had brought me here, and on my explaining
myself, he observed with a smile of contempt, 'They have shed blood
enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection.This is not a
country for an honest man to live in; they do not understand any thing
at all of the principles of free government, and the best way is to
leave them to themselves.You see they have conquered all Europe, only
to make it more miserable than it was before.'Upon this, I remarked
that I was surprised to hear him speak in such desponding language of
the fortune of mankind, and that I thought much might yet be done for
the Republic.he exclaimed, 'do you call this a Republic?Why they are worse off than the slaves of Constantinople; for there,
they expect to be bashaws in heaven by submitting to be slaves below,
but here they believe neither in heaven nor hell, and yet are slaves by
choice.I know of no Republic in the world except America, which is the
only country for such men as you and I. It is my intention to get away
from this place as soon as possible, and I hope to be off in the autumn;
you are a young man and may see better times, but I have done with
Europe, and its slavish politics.'"I have often been in company with Mr.Paine, since my arrival here, and
I was not a little surprised to find him wholly indifferent about the
public spirit in England, or the remaining influence of his doctrines
among its people.Indeed he seemed to dislike the mention of the
subject; and when, one day, in order to provoke discussion, I told him
I had altered my opinions upon many of his principles, he answered, 'You
certainly have the right to do so; but you cannot alter the nature
of things; the French have alarmed all honest men; but still truth is
truth.Though you may not think that my principles are practicable in
England, without bringing on a great deal of misery and confusion, you
are, I am sure, convinced of their justice.'Here he took occasion to
speak in terms of the utmost severity of Mr------, who had obtained
a seat in parliament, and said that 'parsons were always mischievous
fellows when they turned politicians.'This gave rise to an observation
respecting his 'Age of Reason,' the publication of which I said had
lost him the good opinion of numbers of his English advocates.He
became uncommonly warm at this remark, and in a tone of singular energy
declared that he would not have published it if he had not thought it
calculated to 'inspire mankind with a more exalted idea of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, and to put an end to villainous imposture.'He then broke out with the most violent invectives against our received
opinions, accompanying them at the same time with some of the most grand
and sublime conceptions of an Omnipotent Being, that I ever heard or
read of.In the support of his opinion, he avowed himself ready to
lay down his life, and said 'the Bishop of Llandaff may roast me in
Smithfield if he likes, but human torture cannot shake my conviction.'He reached down a copy of the Bishop's work, interleaved with remarks
upon it, which he read me; after which he admitted the liberality of
the Bishop, and regretted that in all controversies among men a similar
temper was not maintained.But in proportion as he appeared listless in
politics, he seemed quite a zealot in his religious creed; of which the
following is an instance.An English lady of our acquaintance, not less
remarkable for her talents than for elegance of manners, entreated me to
contrive that she might have an interview with Mr.In consequence
of this I invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favoured
with her company.But as she is a very rigid Roman Catholic I cautioned
Mr.Paine, beforehand, against touching upon religious subjects,
assuring him at the same time that she felt much interested to make his
acquaintance.With much good nature he promised to be _discreet_.... For
above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and admiration of
his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his numberless
anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of Franklin,
Washington, and even of his Majesty, of whom he told several curious
facts of humour and benevolence.His remarks on genius and taste can
never be forgotten by those present.Thus far everything went on as I
could wish; the sparkling champagne gave a zest to his conversation,
and we were all delighted.an expression relating to his
'Age of Reason' having been mentioned by one of the company, he broke
out immediately.He began with Astronomy,--addressing himself to Mrs.Y.,--he declared that the least inspection of the motion of the stars
was a convincing proof that Moses was a liar.In
vain I attempted to change the subject, by employing every artifice in
my power, and even attacking with vehemence his political principles.He returned to the charge with unabated ardour.I called upon him for a
song though I never heard him sing in my life.He struck up one of
his own composition; but the instant he had finished it he resumed his
favourite topic.I felt extremely mortified, and remarked that he had
forgotten his promise, and that it was not fair to wound so deeply the
opinions of the ladies.said he, 'they 'll come again.What a pity
it is that people should be so prejudiced!'To which I retorted that
their prejudices might be virtues.'If so,' he replied, 'the blossoms
may be beautiful to the eye, but the root is weak.'One of the most
extraordinary properties belonging to Mr.Paine is his power of
retaining everything he has written in the course of his life.It is
a fact that he can repeat word for word every sentence in his 'Common
Sense,' 'Rights of Man,' etc., etc.The Bible is the only book which he
has studied, and there is not a verse in it that is not familiar to him.In shewing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised
he observed that Dr.Franklin once told him that 'books are written to
please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridges
for the people.'These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only
of skill but of taste; and are wrought with extreme delicacy entirely
by his own hands.The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron
works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged
and manufactured by himself.It is intended as the model of a bridge
which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
only one arch.The other is to be erected over a lesser river,
whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own
workmanship, excepting the chains, which, instead of iron, are cut out
of pasteboard, by the fair hand of his correspondent the 'Little Corner
of the World,' whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.He was
offered L3000 for these models and refused it.The iron bars, which
I before mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also
forged by himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description.He put
them together, and exhibited the power of the lever to a most surprising
degree."'*"Letters from France," etc., London, 1804, 2 vols., 8vo.Thirty-three pages of the last letter are devoted to Paine.About this time Sir Robert Smith died, and another of the ties to Paris
was snapped.His beloved Bonnevilles promised to follow him to the New
World.His old friend Rickman has come over to see him off, and observed
that "he did not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even
objected to any spirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock."These
two friends journeyed together to Havre, where, on September 1st, the
way-worn man begins his homeward voyage.Poor Rickman, the perpetually
prosecuted, strains his eyes till the sail is lost, then sits on the
beach and writes his poetical tribute to Jefferson and America for
recalling Paine, and a touching farewell to his friend:

     "Thus smooth be thy waves, and thus gentle the breeze,
     As thou bearest my Paine far away;
     O waft him to comfort and regions of ease,
     Each blessing of freedom and friendship to seize,
     And bright be his setting sun's ray."Who can imagine the joy of those eyes when they once more beheld the
distant coast of the New World!Fifteen years have passed,--years
in which all nightmares became real, and liberty's sun had turned to
blood,--since he saw the happy land fading behind him.Oh, America,
thine old friend who first claimed thy republican independence, who laid
aside his Quaker coat and fought for thy cause, believing it sacred, is
returning to thy breast!This is the man of whom Washington wrote: "His
writings certainly had a powerful effect on the public mind,--ought they
not then to meet an adequate return?It is
not money he needs now, but tenderness, sympathy; for he comes back from
an old world that has plundered, outlawed, imprisoned him for his love
of mankind.He has seen his dear friends sent to the guillotine, and
others are pining in British prisons for publishing his "Rights of
Man,"--principles pronounced by President Jefferson and Secretary
Madison to be those of the United States.Heartsore, scarred,
white-haired, there remains to this veteran of many struggles for
humanity but one hope, a kindly welcome, a peaceful haven for his
tempest-tossed life.Never for an instant has his faith in the heart
of America been shaken.Already he sees his friend Jefferson's arms
extended; he sees his old comrades welcoming him to their hearths; he
sees his own house and sward at Bordentown, and the beautiful Kirk-bride
mansion beside the Delaware,--river of sacred memories, soon to be
spanned by his graceful arch.How the ladies he left girls,--Fanny.Kitty, Sally,--will come with their husbands to greet him!How will they
admire the latest bridge-model, with Lady Smith's delicate chain-work
for which (such is his estimate of friendship) he refused three thousand
pounds, though it would have made his mean room palatial!Ah, yes, poor
heart, America will soothe your wounds, and pillow your sinking head on
her breast!America, with Jefferson in power, is herself again.They do
not hate men in America for not believing in a celestial Robespierre.Thou stricken friend of man, who hast appealed from the god of wrath
to the God of Humanity, see in the distance that Maryland coast, which
early voyagers called Avalon, and sing again your song when first
stepping on that shore twenty-seven years ago:

      "I come to sing that summer is at hand,
      The summer time of wit, you 'll understand;
      Plants, fruits, and flowers, and all the smiling race
      That can the orchard or the garden grace;
      The Rose and Lily shall address the fair,
      And whisper sweetly out, 'My dears, take care:'
      With sterling worth the Plant of Sense shall rise,
      And teach the curious to philosophize.We 'll garnish out the scenes
      With stately rows of Evergreens,
      Trees that will bear the frost, and deck their tops
      With everlasting flowers, like diamond drops."* "The Snowdrop and Critic," Pennsylvania Magazine, 1775.THE AMERICAN INQUISITION

On October 30th Paine landed at Baltimore.More than two and a half
centuries had elapsed since the Catholic Lord Baltimore appointed a
Protestant Governor of Maryland, William Stone, who proclaimed in that
province (1648) religious freedom and equality.The Puritans, crowding
thither, from regions of oppression, grew strong enough to exterminate
the religion of Lord Baltimore who had given them shelter, and
imprisoned his Protestant Governor.So, in the New World, passed the
Inquisition from Catholic to Protestant hands.In Paine's first American pamphlet, he had repeated and extolled the
principle of that earliest proclamation of religious liberty."Diversity
of religious opinions affords a larger field for Christian kindness."The Christian kindness now consists in a cessation of sectarian strife
that they may unite in stretching the author of the "Age of Reason"
on their common rack, so far as was possible under a Constitution
acknowledging no deity.Soon after landing Paine wrote to President Jefferson:

"I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days.I have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get
them from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown
I shall set off to pay my respects to you.Your much obliged
fellow-citizen,--Thomas Paine."On reaching Washington City Paine found his dear friend Monroe starting
off to resume his ministry in Paris, and by him wrote to Mr.Este,
banker in Paris (Sir Robert Smith's son-in-law), enclosing a letter to
Rickman, in London."You can have no idea," he tells Rickman, "of the
agitation which my arrival occasioned."Every paper is "filled with
applause or abuse.""My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and
is now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will
bring me L400 sterling a year.Remember me in friendship and affection
to your wife and family, and in the circle of our friends.I am but just
arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that I have just
time to write you this.If he should not sail this tide I will write to
my good friend Col.Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait on
him for me.* Paine still had faith in Bosville.He was slow in
     suspecting any man who seemed enthusiastic for liberty.In
     this connection it may be mentioned that it is painful to
     find in the "Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris," (ii.,
     p.426) a confidential letter to Robert R. Livingston,
     Minister in France, which seems to assume that Minister's
     readiness to receive slanders of Jefferson, who appointed
     him, and of Paine whose friendship he seemed to value.Speaking of the President, Morris says: "The employment of
     and confidence in adventurers from abroad will sooner or
     later rouse the pride and indignation of this country."Morris' editor adds: "This was probably an allusion to
     Thomas Paine, who had recently returned to America and was
     supposed to be an intimate friend of Mr.Jefferson, who, it
     was said, received him warmly, dined him at the White House,
     and could be seen walking arm in arm with him on the street
     any fine afternoon."The allusion to "adventurers" was no
     doubt meant for Paine, but not to his reception by
     Jefferson, for Morris' letter was written on August 27th,
     some two months before Paine's arrival.It was probably
     meant by Morris to damage Paine in Paris, where it was known
     that he was intimate with Livingston, who had been
     introduced by him to influential men, among others to Sir
     Robert Smith and Este, bankers.It is to be hoped that
     Livingston resented Morris' assumption of his treacherous
     character.Morris, who had shortly before dined at the White
     House, tells Livingston that Jefferson is "descending to a
     condition which I find no decent word to designate."Surely
     Livingston's descendants should discover his reply to that
     letter.The defeated Federalists had already prepared their batteries to assail
the President for inviting Paine to return on a national ship, under
escort of a Congressman.It required some skill for these adherents of
John Adams, a Unitarian, to set the Inquisition in motion.It had to be
done, however, as there was no chance of breaking down Jefferson but
by getting preachers to sink political differences and hound the
President's favorite author.Out of the North, stronghold of the
"British Party," came this partisan crusade under a pious flag.In
Virginia and the South the "Age of Reason" was fairly discussed, its
influence being so great that Patrick Henry, as we have seen, wrote and
burnt a reply.In Virginia, Deism, though largely prevailing, had not
prevented its adherents from supporting the Church as an institution.It had become their habit to talk of such matters only in private.Jefferson had not ventured to express his views in public, and was
troubled at finding himself mixed up with the heresies of Paine.*

     * To the Rev.Waterhouse (Unitarian) who had asked
     permission to publish a letter of his, Jefferson, with a
     keen remembrance of Paine's fate, wrote (July 19, 1822):
     "No, my dear Sir, not for the world.Into what a hornet's
     nest would it thrust my head!--The genus irritabile vatmm,
     on whom argument is lost, and reason is by themselves
     disdained in matters of religion.Don Quixote undertook to
     redress the bodily wrongs of the world, but the redressaient
     of mental vagaries would be an enterprise more than Quixotic
     I should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of
     Bedlam to sound understanding as to inculcate reason into
     that of an Athanasian.I am old, and tranquillity is now my
     summum bonum.Keep me therefore from the fire and <DW19> of
     Calvin and his victim Servetus.Happy in the prospect of a
     restoration of a primitive Christianity, I must leave to
     younger athletes to lop off the false branches which have
     been engrafted into it by the mycologists of the middle and
     modern ages."--MS.The author on reaching Lovell's Hotel, Washington, had made known
his arrival to the President, and was cordially received; but as the
newspapers came in with their abuse, Jefferson may have been somewhat
intimidated.Eager to disembarrass the
administration, Paine published a letter in the _National Intelligencer_
which had cordially welcomed him, in which he said that he should not
ask or accept any office.*

     * The National Intelligencer (Nov.3d), announcing Paine's
     arrival at Baltimore, said, among other things: "Be his
     religious sentiments what they may, it must be their [the
     American people's] wish that he may live in the undisturbed
     possession of our common blessings, and enjoy them the more
     from his active participation in their attainment."The same
     paper said, Nov.10th: "Thomas Paine has arrived in this
     city [Washington] and has received a cordial reception from
     the Whigs of Seventy-six, and the republicans of 1800, who
     have the independence to feel and avow a sentiment of
     gratitude for his eminent revolutionary services."He meant to continue writing and bring forward his mechanical projects.None the less did the "federalist" press use Paine's infidelity to
belabor the President, and the author had to write defensive letters
from the moment of his arrival.On October 29th, before Paine had
landed, the _National Intelligencer_ had printed (from a Lancaster,
Pa., journal) a vigorous letter, signed "A Republican," showing that the
denunciations of Paine were not religious, but political, as John Adams
was also unorthodox.The "federalists" must often have wished that they
had taken this warning, for Paine's pen was keener than ever, and the
opposition had no writer to meet him.His eight "Letters to the
Citizens of the United States" were scathing, eloquent, untrammelled by
partisanship, and made a profound impression on the country,--for even
the opposition press had to publish them as part of the news of the
day.*

     * They were published in the National Intelligencer of
     November 15th, 22d.29th, December 6th, January 25th, and
     February 2d, 1803.Of the others one appeared in the Aurora
     (Philadelphia), dated from Bordentown, N. J., March 12th,
     and the last in the Trenton True American % dated April
     21st.On Christmas Day Paine wrote the President a suggestion for the purchase
of Louisiana.The French, to whom Louisiana had been ceded by Spain,
closed New Orleans (November 26th) against foreign ships (including
American), and prohibited deposits there by way of the Mississippi.This
caused much excitement, and the "federalists" showed eagerness to push
the administration into a belligerent attitude toward France.Paines
"common sense" again came to the front, and he sent Jefferson the
following paper:

"OF LOUISIANA."Spain has ceded Louisiana to france, and france has excluded the
Americans from N. Orleans and the navigation of the Mississippi;
the people of the Western Territory have complained of it to their
Government, and the governt.is of consequence involved and interested
in the affair The question then is--What is the best step to be taken?"The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction
of a right.The other is by accommodation, still keeping the right in
view, but not making it a groundwork."Suppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to france to
repurchase the cession, made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it
be with the consent of the people of Louisiana or a majority thereof."By beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the
appearance of a threat,--the growing power of the western territory
can be stated as matter of information, and also the impossibility
of restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal
impossibility of france to prevent it."Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
carpet This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the
value of the Commerce, and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will
produce."The french treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed
by anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue.A monied
proposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon
france can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be
paid here to the claimants.

"------I congratulate you on the _birthday of the New Sun_, now called
christmas-day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana."Jefferson next day told Paine, what was as yet a profound secret, that
he was already contemplating the purchase of Louisiana.*

     * "The idea occurred to me," Paine afterwards wrote to the
     President, "without knowing it had occurred to any other
     person, and I mentioned it to Dr.Leib who lived in the same
     house (Lovell's); and, as he appeared pleased with it, I
     wrote the note and showed it to him before I sent it.The
     next morning you said to me that measures were already taken
     in that business.When Leib returned from Congress I told
     him of it.'Why then,' said I, 'did
     you not tell me so, because in that case I would not have
     sent the note.''That is the very reason,' said he; 'I would
     not tell you, because two opinions concurring on a case
     strengthen it.'Leib's motion
     about Banks.Congress ought to be very cautious how it gives
     encouragement to this speculating project of banking, for it
     is now carried to an extreme.It is but another kind of
     striking paper money.Neither do I like the notion
     respecting the recession of the territory [District of
     Columbia.]."Michael Leib was a representative from
     Pennsylvania.{1803}

The "New Sun" was destined to bring his sunstrokes on Paine.The
pathetic story of his wrongs in England, his martyrdom in France,
was not generally known, and, in reply to attacks, he had to tell
it himself.He had returned for repose and found himself a sort of
battlefield.One of the most humiliating circumstances was the discovery
that in this conflict of parties the merits of his religion were of
least consideration.The outcry of the country against him, so far as
it was not merely political, was the mere ignorant echo of pulpit
vituperation.His well-considered theism, fruit of so much thought,
nursed amid glooms of the dungeon, was called infidelity or atheism.Even some from whom he might have expected discriminating criticism
accepted the vulgar version and wrote him in deprecation of a work
they had not read.Samuel Adams, his old friend, caught in this
_schwarmerei_, wrote him from Boston (November 30th) that he had "heard"
that he had "turned his mind to a defence of infidelity."Paine copied
for him his creed from the "Age of Reason," and asked, "My good friend,
do you call believing in God infidelity?"This letter to Samuel Adams (January 1, 1803) has indications that Paine
had developed farther his theistic ideal."We cannot serve the Deity in the manner we serve those who cannot do
without that service.We can add nothing to
eternity.But it is in our power to render a service acceptable to him,
and that is, not by praying, but by endeavoring to make his creatures
happy.A man does not serve God by praying, for it is himself he is
trying to serve; and as to hiring or paying men to pray, as if the Deity
needed instruction, it is in my opinion an abomination.I have been
exposed to and preserved through many dangers, but instead of buffeting
the Deity with prayers, as if I distrusted him, or must dictate to him,
I reposed myself on his protection; and you, my friend, will find, even
in your last moments, more consolation in the silence of resignation
than in the murmuring wish of a prayer."Paine must have been especially hurt by a sentence in the letter of
Samuel Adams in which he said: "Our friend, the president of the United
States, has been calumniated for his liberal sentiments, by men who have
attributed that liberality to a latent design to promote the cause of
infidelity."To this he did not reply, but it probably led him to feel a
deeper disappointment at the postponement of the interviews he had hoped
to enjoy with Jefferson after thirteen years of separation.A feeling
of this kind no doubt prompted the following note (January 12th) sent to
the President:

"I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up
to set off for Philadelphia and New York.My intention in bringing them
here in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was
to have some conversation with you on those matters and others I have
not informed you of.But you have not only shown no disposition towards
it, but have, in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in
fear of federal observation, precluded it.I am not the only one, who
makes observations of this kind."Jefferson at once took care that there should be no misunderstanding
as to his regard for Paine.The author was for some days a guest in the
President's family, where he again met Maria Jefferson (Mrs.Eppes) whom
he had known in Paris.Randall says the devout ladies of the family had
been shy of Paine, as was but natural, on account of the President's
reputation for rationalism, but "Paine's discourse was weighty, his
manners sober and inoffensive; and he left Mr.Jefferson's mansion the
subject of lighter prejudices than he entered it."*

     * "Life of Jefferson," ii., 642 sec.Randall is mistaken in
     some statements.Paine, as we have seen, did not return on
     the ship placed at his service by the President; nor did
     the President's letter appear until long after his return,
     when he and Jefferson felt it necessary in order to disabuse
     the public mind of the most absurd rumors on the subject.Paine's defamers have manifested an eagerness to ascribe his
maltreatment to personal faults.For some years
after his arrival in the country no one ventured to hint anything
disparaging to his personal habits or sobriety.On January 1, 1803, he
wrote to Samuel Adams: "I have a good state of health and a happy mind;
I take care of both by nourishing the first with temperance, and the
latter with abundance."Had not this been true the "federal" press would have noised it abroad.In all portraits, French and American, his
dress is in accordance with the fashion.There was not, so far as I can
discover, a suggestion while he was at Washington, that he was not a
suitable guest for any drawing-room in the capital On February 23,
1803, probably, was written the following which I find among the Cobbett
papers:

From Mr.Jefferson, on the occasion of a toast being given
at a federal dinner at Washington, of "May they

     NEVER KNOW PLEASURE WHO LOVE PAINE.""I send you, Sir, a tale about some Feds,
     Who, in their wisdom, got to loggerheads.The case was this, they felt so flat and sunk,
     They took a glass together and got drunk.Such things, you know, are neither new nor rare,
     For some will hary themselves when in despair.It was the natal day of Washington,
     And that they thought a famous day for fun;
     For with the learned world it is agreed,
     The better day the better deed.They talked away, and as the glass went round
     They grew, in point of wisdom, more profound;
     For at the bottom of the bottle lies
     That kind of sense we overlook when wise.Come, here's a toast, cried one, with roar immense,
     May none know pleasure who love Common Sense.some others cried,
     But left it to the waiter to decide.I think, said he, the case would be more plain,
     To leave out Common Sense, and put in Paine.On this a mighty noise arose among
     This drunken, bawling, senseless throng.Some said that Common Sense was all a curse,
     That making people wiser made them worse;
     It learned them to be careful of their purse,
     And not be laid about like babes at nurse,
     Nor yet believe in stories upon trust,
     Which all mankind, to be well governed must;
     And that the toast was better at the first,
     And he that didn't think so might be cursed.So on they went, till such a fray arose
     As all who know what Feds are may suppose."On his way northward, to his old home in Bor-dentown, Paine passed many
a remembered spot, but found little or no greeting on his journey.In
Baltimore a "New Jerusalemite," as the Sweden-borgian was then called,
the Rev.Hargrove, accosted him with the information that the key to
scripture was found, after being lost 4,000 years."Then it must be very rusty," answered Paine."His principles," wrote
Rush to Cheetham, "avowed in his 'Age of Reason,' were so offensive to
me that I did not wish to renew my intercourse with him."Paine made
arrangements for the reception of his bridge models at Peale's Museum,
but if he met any old friend there no mention of it appears.Most
of those who had made up the old circle--Franklin, Rittenhouse,
Muhlenberg--were dead, some were away in Congress; but no doubt Paine
saw George Clymer.However, he did not stay long in Philadelphia, for he
was eager to reach the spot he always regarded as his home, Bordentown.And there, indeed, his hope, for a time, seemed to be fulfilled It need
hardly be said that his old friend Colonel Kirkbride gave him hearty
welcome.John Hall, Paine's bridge mechanician, "never saw him jollier,"
and he was full of mechanical "whims and schemes" they were to pursue
together.Jefferson was candidate for the presidency, and Paine entered
heartily into the canvass; which was not prudent, but he knew nothing of
prudence.The issue not only concerned an old friend, but was turning on
the question of peace with France.On March 12th he writes against the
"federalist" scheme for violently seizing New Orleans.At a meeting in
April, over which Colonel Kirkbride presides, Paine drafts a reply to an
attack on Jefferson's administration, circulated in New York.On April
21 st he writes the refutation of an attack on Jefferson, _apropos_ of
the national vessel offered for his return, which had been coupled
with a charge that Paine had proposed to the Directory an invasion of
America!In June he writes about his bridge models (then at Peale's
Museum, Philadelphia), and his hope to span the Delaware and the
Schuylkill with iron arches.Here is a letter written to Jefferson from Bordentown

(August 2d) containing suggestions concerning the beginning of
government in Louisiana, from which it would appear that Paine's faith
in the natural inspiration of _vox populi_ was still imperfect:

"I take it for granted that the present inhabitants know little or
nothing of election and representation as constituting government.They
are therefore not in an immediate condition to exercise those powers,
and besides this they are perhaps too much under the influence of their
priests to be sufficiently free."I should suppose that a Government _provisoire_ formed by Congress for
three, five, or seven years would be the best mode of beginning.In
the meantime they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
Municipal government, and after some experience they will be in train to
elect their State government.I think it would not only be good policy
but right to say, that the people shall have the right of electing their
Church Ministers, otherwise their Ministers will hold by authority from
the Pope.I do not make it a compulsive article, but to put it in their
power to use it when they please.It will serve to hold the priests in a
stile of good behavior, and also to give the people an idea of elective
rights.Anything, they say, will do to learn upon, and therefore they
may as well begin upon priests."The present prevailing language is french and Spanish, but it will be
necessary to establish schools to teach english as the laws ought to be
in the language of the Union."As soon as you have formed any plan for settling the Lands I shall be
glad to know it.My motive for this is because there are thousands and
tens of thousands in England and Ireland and also in Scotland who are
friends of mine by principle, and who would gladly change their present
country and condition.Many among them, for I have friends in all ranks
of life in those countries, are capable of becoming monied purchasers to
any amount."If you can give me any hints respecting Louisiana, the quantity in
square miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will
find an opportunity of making some use of it.When the formalities of
the cession are compleated, the next thing will be to take possession,
and I think it would be very consistent for the President of the United
States to do this in person."What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for?Is he there as an Agent for the
British as Blount was said to be?"Of the same date is a letter to Senator Breck-enridge, of Kentucky,
forwarded through Jefferson:

"My Dear Friend,--Not knowing your place of Residence in Kentucky I send
this under cover to the President desiring him to fill up the direction."I see by the public papers and the Proclamation for calling Congress,
that the cession of Louisiana has been obtained.The papers state the
purchase to be 11,250,000 dollars in the six per cents and 3,750,000
dollars to be paid to American claimants who have furnished supplies to
France and the french Colonies and are yet unpaid, making on the whole
15,000,000 dollars."I observe that the faction of the Feds who last Winter were for going
to war to obtain possession of that country and who attached so much
importance to it that no expense or risk ought be spared to obtain it,
have now altered their tone and say it is not worth having, and that
we are better without it than with it."The second section of the 2d article of the constitution says, The
'President shall have Power by and with the consent of the senate to
make Treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur.'"A question may be supposed to arise on the present case, which is,
under what character is the cession to be considered and taken up in
congress, whether as a treaty, or in some other shape?Sandra journeyed to the hallway."Though the word, Treaty, as a Word, is unlimited in its meaning
and application, it must be supposed to have a denned meaning in the
constitution.It there means Treaties of alliance or of navigation and
commerce--Things which require a more profound deliberation than
common acts do, because they entail on the parties a future reciprocal
responsibility and become afterwards a supreme law on each of the
contracting countries which neither can annull.But the cession of
Louisiana to the United States has none of these features in it It is a
sale and purchase.A sole act which when finished, the parties have no
more to do with each other than other buyers and sellers have.It has no
future reciprocal consequences (which is one of the marked characters of
a Treaty) annexed to it; and the idea of its becoming a supreme law
to the parties reciprocally (which is another of the characters of a
Treaty) is inapplicable in the present case.There remains nothing for
such a law to act upon."I love the restriction in the constitution which takes from the
Executive the power of making treaties of his own will: and also the
clause which requires the consent of two thirds of the Senators, because
we cannot be too cautious in involving and entangling ourselves with
foreign powers; but I have an equal objection against extending the
same power to the senate in cases to which it is not strictly and
constitutionally applicable, because it is giving a nullifying power
to a minority.Treaties, as already observed, are to have future
consequences and whilst they remain, remain always in execution
externally as well as internally, and therefore it is better to run the
risk of losing a good treaty for the want of two thirds of the senate
than be exposed to the danger of ratifying a bad one by a small
majority.But in the present case no operation is to follow but what
acts itself within our own Territory and under our own laws.We are the
sole power concerned after the cession is accepted and the money paid,
and therefore the cession is not a Treaty in the constitutional meaning
of the word subject to be rejected by a minority in the senate."The question whether the cession shall be accepted and the bargain
closed by a grant of money for the purpose, (which I take to be the
sole question) is a case equally open to both houses of congress, and
if there is any distinction of _formal right_, it ought according to
the constitution, as a money transaction, to begin in the house of
Representatives."I suggest these matters that the senate may not be taken unawares, for
I think it not improbable that some Fed, who intends to negative the
cession, will move to take it up as if it were a Treaty of Alliance or
of Navigation and Commerce."The object here is an increase of territory for a valuable
consideration.It is altogether a home concern--a matter of domestic
policy.The only real ratification is the payment of the money, and as
all verbal ratification without this goes for nothing, it would be a
waste of time and expense to debate on the verbal ratification distinct
from the money ratification.The shortest way, as it appears to me,
would be to appoint a committee to bring in a report on the President's
Message, and for that committee to report a bill for the payment of the
money.The french Government, as the seller of the property, will not
consider anything ratification but the payment of the money contracted
for."There is also another point, necessary to be aware of, which is, to
accept it in toto.Any alteration or modification in it, or annexed as
a condition is so far fatal, that it puts it in the power of the other
party to reject the whole and propose new Terms.There can be no such
thing as ratifying in part, or with a condition annexed to it and
the ratification to be binding.It is still a continuance of the
negociation."It ought to be presumed that the American ministers have done to the
best of their power and procured the best possible terms, and that being
immediately on the spot with the other party they were better Judges of
the whole, and of what could, or could not be done, than any person at
this distance, and unacquainted with many of the circumstances of the
case, can possibly be."If a treaty, a contract, or a cession be good upon the whole, it is ill
policy to hazard the whole, by an experiment to get some trifle in it
altered.The right way of proceeding in such case is to make sure of
the whole by ratifying it, and then instruct the minister to propose
a clause to be added to the Instrument to obtain the amendment or
alteration wished for.This was the method Congress took with respect to
the Treaty of Commerce with France in 1778.Congress ratified the whole
and proposed two new articles which were agreed to by France and added
to the Treaty."There is according to newspaper account an article which admits french
and Spanish vessels on the same terms as American vessels.But this
does not make it a commercial Treaty.It is only one of the Items in the
payment: and it has this advantage, that it joins Spain with France in
making the cession and is an encouragement to commerce and new settlers."With respect to the purchase, admitting it to be 15 millions dollars,
it is an advantageous purchase.The revenue alone purchased as an
annuity or rent roll is worth more--at present I suppose the revenue
will pay five per cent for the purchase money."I know not if these observations will be of any use to you.I am in
a retired village and out of the way of hearing the talk of the great
world.But I see that the Feds, at least some of them, are changing
their tone and now reprobating the acquisition of Louisiana; and the
only way they can take to lose the affair will be to take it up as they
would a Treaty of Commerce and annull it by a Minority; or entangle it
with some condition that will render the ratification of no effect."I believe in this state (Jersey) we shall have a majority at the next
election.I have half a
disposition to visit the Western World next spring and go on to New
Orleans.They are a new people and unacquainted with the principles of
representative government and I think I could do some good among them."As the stage-boat which was to take this letter to the Post-office does
not depart till to-morrow, I amuse myself with continuing the subject
after I had intended to close it."I know little and can learn but little of the extent and present
population of Louisiana.After the cession be com-pleated and the
territory annexed to the United States it will, I suppose, be formed
into states, one, at least, to begin with."The people, as I have said, are new to us and we to them and a great
deal will depend on a right beginning.As they have been transferred
backward and forward several times from one European Government to
another it is natural to conclude they have no fixed prejudices with
respect to foreign attachments, and this puts them in a fit disposition
for their new condition.The established religion is roman; but in
what state it is as to exterior ceremonies (such as processions and
celebrations), I know not.Had the cession to france continued with her,
religion I suppose would have been put on the same footing as it is
in that country, and there no ceremonial of religion can appear on the
streets or highways; and the same regulation is particularly necessary
now or there will soon be quarrels and tumults between the old settlers
and the new.The Yankees will not move out of the road for a little
wooden Jesus stuck on a stick and carried in procession nor kneel in
the dirt to a wooden Virgin Mary.As we do not govern the territory as
provinces but incorporated as states, religion there must be on the same
footing it is here, and Catholics have the same rights as Catholics have
with us and no others.As to political condition the Idea proper to be
held out is, that we have neither conquered them, nor bought them, but
formed a Union with them and they become in consequence of that union a
part of the national sovereignty."The present Inhabitants and their descendants will be a majority for
some time, but new emigrations from the old states and from Europe, and
intermarriages, will soon change the first face of things, and it is
necessary to have this in mind when the first measures shall be taken.Everything done as an expedient grows worse every day, for in proportion
as the mind grows up to the full standard of sight it disclaims the
expedient.America had nearly been ruined by expedients in the first
stages of the revolution, and perhaps would have been so, had not
'Common Sense' broken the charm and the Declaration of Independence sent
it into banishment."Yours in friendship

"Thomas Paine.*

"remember me in the circle of your friends."William F.
     Havermeyer, Jr.E. M. Woodward, in his account of Bordentown, mentions among the
"traditions" of the place, that Paine used to meet a large number of
gentlemen at the "Washington House," kept by Debora Applegate, where he
conversed freely "with any proper person who approached him."Paine was too much occupied in literary pursuits and writing to
spend a great deal of his time here, but he generally paid several
visits during the day.In walking he
was generally absorbed in deep thought, seldom noticed any one as he
passed, unless spoken to, and in going from his home to the tavern was
frequently observed to cross the street several times.It is stated that
several members of the church were turned from their faith by him, and
on this account, and the general feeling of the community against him
for his opinions on religious subjects, he was by the mass of the
people held in odium, which feeling to some extent was extended to Col.These "traditions" were recorded in 1876.Paine's "great power of
conversation" was remembered.But among the traditions, even of the
religious, there is none of any excess in drinking.Possibly the turning of several church-members from their faith may
not have been so much due to Paine as to the parsons, in showing their
"religion" as a gorgon turning hearts to stone against a benefactor
of mankind.One day Paine went with Colonel Kirkbride to visit Samuel
Rogers, the Colonels brother-in-law, at Bellevue, across the river.As
he entered the door Rogers turned his back, refusing his old friend's
hand, because it had written the "Age of Reason."Presently Borden-town
was placarded with pictures of the Devil flying away with Paine.The
pulpits set up a chorus of vituperation.Why should the victim spare the
altar on which he is sacrificed, and justice also?Dogma had chosen to
grapple with the old man in its own way.That it was able to break a
driven leaf Paine could admit as truly as Job; but he could as bravely
say: Withdraw thy hand from me, and I will answer thee, or thou shalt
answer me!In Paine too it will be proved that such outrages on truth
and friendship, on the rights of thought, proceed from no God, but from
the destructive forces once personified as the adversary of man.Early in March Paine visited New York, to see Monroe before his
departure for France.He drove with Kirkbride to Trenton; but so furious
was the pious mob, he was refused a seat in the Trenton stage.They
dined at Government House, but when starting for Brunswick were hooted
These were the people for whose liberties Paine had marched that same
road on foot, musket in hand.At Trenton insults were heaped on the
man who by camp-fires had written the _Crisis_, which animated the
conquerors of the Hessians at that place, in "the times that tried men's
souls."These people he helped to make free,--free to cry _Crucify!_

Paine had just written to Jefferson that the Louisianians were "perhaps
too much under the influence of their priests to be sufficiently free."Probably the same thought occurred to him about people nearer home,
when he presently heard of Colonel Kirkbride's sudden unpopularity, and
death.On October 3d Paine lost this faithful friend.*

     * It should be stated that Burlington County, in which
     Bordentown is situated, was preponderantly Federalist, and
     that Trenton was in the hands of a Federalist mob of young
     well-to-do rowdies.The editor of the _True American_, a
     Republican paper to which Paine had contributed, having
     commented on a Fourth of July orgie of those rowdies in a
     house associated with the revolution, was set upon with
     bludgeons on July 12th, and suffered serious injuries.The
     Grand Jury refused to present the Federalist ruffians,
     though the evidence was clear, and the mob had free course.The facts of the Paine mob are these: after dining at Government House,
Trenton, Kirkbride applied for a seat on the New York stage for Paine.The owner, Voorhis, cursed Paine as "a deist," and said, "I 'll be
damned if he shall go in my stage."Another stage-owner also refused,
saying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don't
want them to suffer again."When Paine and Kirkbride had entered their
carriage a mob surrounded them with a drum, playing the "rogue's march."The local reporter (_True American_) says, "Mr.Paine discovered not the
least emotion of fear or anger, but calmly observed that such conduct
had no tendency to hurt his feelings or injure his fame."The mob then
tried to frighten the horse with the drum, and succeeded, but the two
gentlemen reached a friend's house in Brunswick in safety.A letter
from Trenton had been written to the stage-master there also, to prevent
Paine from securing a seat, whether with success does not appear.NEW ROCHELLE AND THE BONNEVILLES

The Bonnevilles, with whom Paine had resided in Paris, were completely
impoverished after his departure.They resolved to follow Paine to
America, depending on his promise of aid should they do so.Foreseeing
perils in France, Nicolas, unable himself to leave at once, hurried off
his wife and children--Benjamin, Thomas, and Louis.Madame Bonneville
would appear to have arrived in August, 1803.I infer this because Paine
writes, September 23d, to Jefferson from Stonington, Connecticut; and
later letters show that he had been in New York, and afterwards placed
Thomas Paine Bonneville with the Rev.Foster (Universalist) of
Stonington for education.Madame Bonneville was placed in his house at
Bordentown, where she was to teach French.At New York, Paine found both religious and political parties sharply
divided over him.At Lovett's Hotel, where he stopped, a large dinner
was given him, March 18th, seventy being present One of the active
promoters of this dinner was James Cheetham, editor of the _American
Citizen_, who, after seriously injuring Paine by his patronage, became
his malignant enemy.In the summer of 1803 the political atmosphere was in a tempestuous
condition, owing to the widespread accusation that Aaron Burr had
intrigued with the Federalists against Jefferson to gain the presidency.There was a Society in New York called "Republican Greens," who, on
Independence Day, had for a toast "Thomas Paine, the Man of the People,"
and who seem to have had a piece of music called the "Rights of Man."Paine was also apparently the hero of that day at White Plains, where
a vast crowd assembled, "over 1,000," among the toasts being: "Thomas
Paine--the bold advocate of rational liberty--the People's friend."He
probably reached New York again in August A letter for "Thomas Payne"
is in the advertised Letter-list of August 6th, and in the _American
Citizen_ (August 9th) are printed (and misprinted) "Lines, extempore, by
Thomas Paine, July, 1803."*

     * On July 12th the _Evening Post _(edited by William
     Coleman) tries to unite republicanism and infidelity by
     stating that Part I. of the "Age of Reason" was sent in MS.Fellows of New York, and in the following year Part
     II.was gratuitously distributed "from what is now the
     office of the Aurora."On September 24th that paper
     publishes a poem about Paine, ending:


     "Quick as the lightning's vivid flash
     The poet's eye o'er Europe rolls;
     Sees battles rage, hears tempests crash,
     And dims at horror's threatening scowls."Mark ambition's ruthless king,
     With crimsoned banners scathe the globe;
     While trailing after conquest's wing,
     Man's festering wounds his demons probe."Palled with streams of reeking gore
     That stain the proud imperial day,
     He turns to view the western shore,
     Where freedom holds her boundless sway."'T is here her sage triumphant sways
     An empire in the people's love;
     'T is here the sovereign will obeys
     No king but Him who rules above."The verses, crudely expressing the contrast between President Jefferson
and King George--or Napoleon, it is not clear which,--sufficiently show
that Paine's genius was not extempore.His reputation as a patriotic
minstrel was high; his "Hail, great Republic," to the tune of "Rule
Britannia," was the established Fourth-of-July song, and it was even
sung at the dinner of the American consul in London (Erving) March 4,
1803, the anniversary of Jefferson's election.Possibly the extempore
lines were sung on some Fourth-of-July occasion.I find "Thomas Paine"
and the "Rights of Man" favorite toasts at republican celebrations in
Virginia also at this time.In New York we may discover Paine's coming
and going by rancorous paragraphs concerning him in the _Evening Post_.*

     "And having spent a lengthy life in evil,
     Return again unto thy parent Devil!"Perhaps the most malignant wrong done Paine in this paper was the
adoption of his signature, "Common Sense," by one of its contributors!Another paragraph says that Franklin hired Paine in London to come to
America and write in favor of the Revolution,--a remarkable example of
federalist heredity from "Toryism."On September 27th the paper prints a
letter purporting to have been found by a waiter in Lovett's Hotel after
Paine's departure,--a long letter to Paine, by some red-revolutionary
friend, of course gloating over the exquisite horrors filling Europe in
consequence of the "Rights of Man."12, 1803," and signed "J.The paper's correspondent pretends
to have found out Oldney, and conversed with him.No doubt many simple
people believed the whole thing genuine.The most learned physician in New York, Dr.Nicholas Romayne, invited
Paine to dinner, where he was met by John Pintard, and other eminent
citizens.Pintard said to Paine: "I have read and re-read your 'Age
of Reason,' and any doubts which I before entertained of the truth
of revelation have been removed by your logic.Yes, sir, your very
arguments against Christianity have convinced me of its truth.""Well
then," answered Paine, "I may return to my couch to-night with the
consolation that I have made at least one Christian."* This authentic
anecdote is significant John Pintard, thus outdone by Paine in
politeness, founded the Tammany Society, and organized the democratic
party.When the "Rights of Man" appeared, the book and its author were
the main toasts of the Tammany celebrations; but it was not so after
the "Age of Reason" had appeared.For John Pintard was all his life
a devotee of Dutch Reformed orthodoxy.Tammany, having begun with the
populace, had by this time got up somewhat in society.As a rule the
"gentry" were Federalists, though they kept a mob in their back yard to
fly at the democrats on occasion.But with Jefferson in the presidential
chair, and Clinton vice-president, Tammany was in power.To hold this
power Tammany had to court the clergy.So there was no toast to Paine in
the Wigwam of 1803.Francis' "Old New York," p.** The New York Daily Advertiser published the whole of Part
     I. of the "Rights of Man" in 1791 (May 6-27), the editor
     being then John Pintard.At the end of the publication a
     poetical tribute to Paine was printed.Four of the lines run:

     "Rous'd by the reason of his manly page,
     Once more shall Paine a listening world engage;
     From reason's source a bold reform he brings,
     By raising up mankind he pulls down kings."President Jefferson was very anxious about the constitutional points
involved in his purchase of Louisiana, and solicited Paine's views on
the whole subject.Paine wrote to him extended communications, among
which was the letter of September 23d, from Stonington.The interest of
the subject is now hardly sufficient to warrant publication of the whole
of this letter, which, however, possesses much interest.At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the third Centenary of
the discovery of America, by the sons of St Tammany, New York, the first
man toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to Paine "The Rights of
Man."They were also extolled in an ode composed for the occasion, and
sung."Your two favours of the 10 and 18 ult.reached me at this place on the
14th inst.I do not suppose that the framers
of the Constitution thought anything about the acquisition of new
territory, and even if they did it was prudent to say nothing about
it, as it might have suggested to foreign Nations the idea that we
contemplated foreign conquest.It appears to me to be one of those cases
with which the Constitution had nothing to do, and which can be judged
of only by the circumstances of the times when such a case shall occur.The Constitution could not foresee that Spain would cede Louisiana to
France or to England, and therefore it could not determine what our
conduct should be in consequence of such an event.The cession makes
no alteration in the Constitution; it only extends the principles of it
over a larger territory, and this certainly is within the morality of
the Constitution, and not contrary to, nor beyond, the expression or
intention of any of its articles... Were a question to arise it would
apply, not to the Cession, because it violates no article of the
Constitution, but to Ross and Morris's motion.The Constitution empowers
Congress to declare war, but to make war without declaring it is
anti-constitutional.It is like attacking an unarmed man in the dark.There is also another reason why no such question should arise.The
english Government is but in a tottering condition and if Bonaparte
succeeds, that Government will break up.In that case it is not
improbable we may obtain Canada, and I think that Bermuda ought to
belong to the United States.In its present condition it is a nest for
piratical privateers.This is not a subject to be spoken of, but it may
be proper to have it in mind."The latest news we have from Europe in this place is the insurrection
in Dublin.It is a disheartening circumstance to the english Government,
as they are now putting arms into the hands of people who but a few
weeks before they would have hung had they found a pike in their
possession.I think the probability is in favour of the descent [on
England by Bonaparte]...

"I shall be employed the ensuing Winter in cutting two or three thousand
Cords of Wood on my farm at New Rochelle for the New York market distant
twenty miles by water.The Wood is worth 3 1/2 dollars per load as it
stands.This will furnish me with ready money, and I shall then be ready
for whatever may present itself of most importance next spring.I had
intended to build myself a house to my own taste, and a workshop for
my mechanical operations, and make a collection, as authors say, of
my works, which with what I have in manuscript will make four, or five
octavo volumes, and publish them by subscription, but the prospects that
are now opening with respect to England hold me in suspence."It has been customary in a President's discourse to say something about
religion.The word, religion,
used as a word _en masse_ has no application to a country like America.In catholic countries it would mean exclusively the religion of the
romish church; with the Jews, the Jewish religion; in England,
the protestant religion or in the sense of the english church, the
established religion; with the Deists it would mean Deism; with the
Turks, Mahometism &c, &c, As well as I recollect it is _Lego, Religo,
Relegio, Religion_, that is say, tied or bound by an oath or obligation.The french use the word properly; when a woman enters a convent, she is
called a novitiate; when she takes the oath, she is a _religieuse_, that
is, she is bound by an oath.Now all that we have to do, as a Government
with the word religion, in this country, is with the civil rights of it,
and not at all with its _creeds_.Instead therefore of using the word
religion, as a word en masse, as if it meant a creed, it would be better
to speak only of its civil rights; _that all denominations of religion
are equally protected, that none are dominant, none inferior, that
the rights of conscience are equal to every denomination and to every
individual and that it is the duty of Government to preserve this
equality of conscientious rights_.A man cannot be called a hypocrite
for defending the civil rights of religion, but he may be suspected of
insincerity in defending its creeds."I suppose you will find it proper to take notice of the impressment of
American seamen by the Captains of British vessels, and procure a list
of such captains and report them to their government.This pretence
of searching for british seamen is a new pretence for visiting and
searching American vessels....

"I am passing some time at this place at the house of a friend till the
wood cutting time comes on, and I shall engage some cutters here and
then return to New Rochelle.Madison concerning the
report that the british Government had cautioned ours not to pay
the purchase money for Louisiana, as they intended to take it for
themselves.I have received his [negative] answer, and I pray you make
him my compliments."We are still afflicted with the yellow fever, and the Doctors are
disputing whether it is an imported or a domestic disease.Would it not
be a good measure to prohibit the arrival of all vessels from the West
Indies from the last of June to the middle of October.If this was
done this session of Congress, and we escaped the fever next summer, we
should always know how to escape it.I question if performing quarantine
is a sufficient guard.The disease may be in the cargo, especially that
part which is barrelled up, and not in the persons on board, and when
that cargo is opened on our wharfs, the hot steaming air in contact with
the ground imbibes the infection.I can conceive that infected air can
be barrelled up, not in a hogshead of rum, nor perhaps sucre, but in
a barrel of coffee.I am badly off in this place for pen and Ink, and
short of paper.I heard yesterday from Boston that our old friend S.
Adams was at the point of death.When Madame Bonneville left France it was understood that her husband
would soon follow, but he did not come, nor was any letter received from
him.This was probably the most important allusion in a letter of Paine,
dated New York, March 1, 1804, to "Citizen Skipwith, Agent Commercial
d'Amerique, Paris.""Dear Friend--I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who
is on the point of sailing for Bordeaux.The Republican interest is now
compleatly triumphant.The change within this last year has been great.We have now 14 States out of 17,--N. Hampshire, Mass.I much question if any person will be started against Mr.Burr is rejected for the vice-presidency; he is now putting
up for Governor of N. York.Morgan Lewis, Chief Justice of the State of N. Y. is the Republican
candidate for Governor of that State."I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since
I left it.We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe.I have not heard anything from him except that
he is _always_ coming.Not a line has been
received from aim.Madame Bonneville, unable to speak English, found Bordentown dull,
and soon turned up in New York.She ordered rooms in Wilburn's
boarding-house, where Paine was lodging, and the author found the
situation rather complicated The family was absolutely without means
of their own, and Paine, who had given them a comfortable home at
Bordentown, was annoyed by their coming on to New York.Anxiety is shown
in the following letter written at 16 Gold St., New York, March 24th, to
"Mr."Dear Sir,--I received your letter by Mr.Nixon, and also a former
letter, but I have been so unwell this winter with a fit of gout, tho'
not so bad as I had at Bordenton about twenty years ago, that I could
not write, and after I got better I got a fall on the ice in the garden
where I lodge that threw me back for above a month.I was obliged to get
a person to copy off the letter to the people of England, published
in the Aurora, March 7, as I dictated it verbally, for all the time my
complaint continued.My health and spirits were as good as ever.It
was my intention to have cut a large quantity of wood for the New York
market, and in that case you would have had the money directly, but this
accident and the gout prevented my doing anything.I shall now have to
take up some money upon it, which I shall do by the first of May to put
Mrs.Bonneville into business, and I shall then discharge her bill.In
the mean time I wish you to receive a quarter's rent due on the 1st of
April from Mrs Richardson, at $25 per ann., and to call on Mrs.Read for
40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get, and to give a receipt in my name.Kirkbride should have discharged your bill, it was what he engaged
to do.Wharton owes for the rent of the house while she lived in
it, unless Col.Kirkbride has taken it into his accounts.Samuel Hileyar
owes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money.Nixon spake to me about
hiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.Richardson intended to
stay in it or quit it I could give no positive answer, but said I would
write to you about it.Israel Butler also writes me about taking at the
same rent as Richardson pays.I will be obliged to you to let the house
as you may judge best.I shall make a visit to Bordenton in the spring,
and I shall call at your house first."There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England.P. Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte.You will see
it in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the
french legislature.She would have wrote, but she
cannot yet venture to write in English.I congratulate you on your new
appointment."*

     * I am indebted for this letter to the N. Y. Hist.Society,
     which owns the original ought to be fulfilled."The
     following passages may be quoted:

     "In casting my eye over England and America, and comparing
     them together, the difference is very striking.The two
     countries were created by the same power, and peopled from
     the same stock.Have
     those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom they
     left behind degenerated?...We see America flourishing
     in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations, and
     reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the
     revolution.On the contrary we see England almost
     perpetually in war, or warlike disputes, and her debt and
     taxes continually increasing.Could we suppose a stranger,
     who knew nothing of the origin of the two nations, he would
     from observation conclude that America was the old country,
     experienced and sage, and England the new, eccentric and
     wild.Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from
     America, after the revolutionary war, than she was on the
     point of plunging herself into a war with Holland, on
     account of the Stadtholder; then with Russia; then with
     Spain on account of the Nootka cat-skins; and actually with
     France to prevent her revolution.Scarcely had she made
     peace with France, and before she had fulfilled her own part
     of the Treaty, than she declared war again, to avoid
     fulfilling the Treaty.In her Treaty of peace with America,
     she engaged to evacuate the western posts within six months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to fulfil the
     conditions, and kept possession of the posts, and embroiled
     herself in an Indian war.* In her Treaty of peace with
     France, she engaged to evacuate Malta within three months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to evacuate Malta,
     and began a new war."* Paine's case is not quite sound at this point.The
     Americans had not, on their side, fulfilled the condition of
     paying their English debts.(1804)

Paine's letter alluded to was printed in the _Aurora_ with the following
note:

"To the Editor.--As the good sense of the people in their elections has
now put the affairs of America in a prosperous condition at home and
abroad, there is nothing immediately important for the subject of a
letter.I therefore send you a piece on another subject."The piece presently appeared as a pamphlet of sixteen pages with the
following title: "Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion
of England.Philadelphia: Printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch
Street.Once more the hope had risen in Paine's breast that
Napoleon was to turn liberator, and that England was to be set free."If
the invasion succeed I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war
has not been provoked by the people.It is altogether the act of the
government without their consent or knowledge; and though the late
peace appears to have been insidious from the first, on the part of the
government, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy."He still hopes that the English people may be able to end the trouble
peacefully, by compelling Parliament to fulfil the Treaty of Amiens.Paine points out that the failure of the French Revolution was due to
"the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was
the principal and vindictive agent," and affirms the success of
representative government in the United States after thirty years'
trial."The people of England have now two revolutions before them,--the
one as an example, the other as a warning.Their own wisdom will direct
them what to choose and what to avoid; and in everything which regards
their happiness, combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them
honor and success."During this summer, Paine wrote a brilliant paper on a memorial sent
to Congress from the French inhabitants of Louisiana.They demanded
immediate admission to equal Statehood, also the right to continue
the importation of <DW64> slaves.Paine reminds the memorialists of
the "mischief caused in France by the possession of power before they
understood principles."After explaining their position, and the
freedom they have acquired by the merits of others, he points out their
ignorance of human "rights" as shown in their guilty notion that to
enslave others is among them."Dare you put up a petition to Heaven
for such a power, without fearing to be struck from the earth by its
justice?Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?Do you want to
renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?"This article (dated September 22d) produced great effect.John Randolph
of Roanoke, in a letter to Albert Gallatin (October 14th), advises
"the printing of... thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to their
remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many thousand troops, who
can speak a language perfectly intelligible to the people of Louisiana,
whatever that of their governor may be."Nicolas Bonneville still giving no sign, and Madame being uneconomical
in her notions of money, Paine thought it necessary--morally and
financially--to let it be known that he was not responsible for her
debts.When, therefore, Wilburn applied to him for her board ($35),
Paine declined to pay, and was sued.Paine pleaded _non assumpsit_, and,
after gaining the case, paid Wilburn the money.It presently turned out that the surveillance of Nicolas Bonneville did
not permit him to leave France, and, as he was not permitted to resume
his journal or publications, he could neither join his family nor assist
them.Paine now resolved to reside on his farm.It is dated at New Rochelle, July 9th:

"Fellow Citizen,--As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the
people begin to get out of town, you may as well come up here and help
me settle my accounts with the man who lives on the place.You will be
able to do this better than I shall, and in the mean time I can go on
with my literary works, without having my mind taken off by affairs of
a different kind.I have received a packet from Governor Clinton,
enclosing what I wrote for.If you come up by the stage you will stop
at the post-office, and they will direct you the way to the farm.I send a price for the Prospect; if the plan
mentioned in it is pursued, it will open a way to enlarge and give
establishment to the deistical church; but of this and some other things
we will talk when you come up, and the sooner the better.Paine was presently enjoying himself on his farm at New Rochelle, and
Madame Bonneville began to keep house for him."It is a pleasant and healthy situation [he wrote to Jefferson somewhat
later], commanding a prospect always green and peaceable, as New
Rochelle produces a great deal of grass and hay.The farm contains three
hundred acres, about one hundred of which is meadow land, one hundred
grazing and village land, and the remainder woodland.It is an oblong
about a mile and a half in length.I have sold off sixty-one acres and
a half for four thousand and twenty dollars.With this money I shall
improve the other part, and build an addition 34 feet by 32 to the
present dwelling."He goes on into an architectural description, with drawings, of
the arched roof he intends to build, the present form of roof being
"unpleasing to the eye."He also draws an oak floor such as they make in
Paris, which he means to imitate.With a black cook, Rachel Gidney, the family seemed to be getting on
with fair comfort; but on Christmas Eve an event occurred which came
near bringing Paine's plans to an abrupt conclusion.This is related
in a letter to William Carver, New York, dated January 16th, at New
Rochelle."Esteemed Friend,--I have recd, two letters from you, one giving an
account of your taking Thomas to Mr.Foster*--the other dated Jany.12--I did not answer the first because I hoped to see you the next
Saturday or the Saturday after.* Thomas Bonneville, Paine's godson, at school in Stonington.What you heard of a gun being fired into the room is true--Robert and
Rachel were both gone out to keep Christmas Eve and about eight o'clock
at Night the gun were fired.Dean's
boys with me, but the person that had done it was gone.I directly
suspected who it was, and I halloed to him by name, that _he was
discovered_.I did this that the party who fired might know I was on the
watch.I cannot find any ball, but whatever the gun was charged with
passed through about three or four inches below the window making a hole
large enough to a finger to go through--the muzzle must have been very
near as the place is black with the powder, and the glass of the window
is shattered to pieces.Mr Shute after examining the place and getting
what information could be had, issued a warrant to take up Derrick, and
after examination committed him."He is now on bail (five hundred dollars) to take his trial at the
supreme Court in May next.Derrick owes me forty-eight dollars for which
I have his note, and he was to work it out in making stone fence which
he has not even begun and besides this I have had to pay forty-two
pounds eleven shillings for which I had passed my word for him at Mr.Derrick borrowed the Gun under pretence of giving Mrs.He was with Purdy about two hours before the
attack on the house was made and he came from thence to Dean's half
drunk and brought with him a bottle of Rum, and Purdy was with him when
he was taken up."I am exceedingly well in health and shall always be glad to see you.Hubbs tells me that your horse is getting better.Shute sent for
the horse and took him when the first snow came but he leaped the fences
and came back.If this be the case I
suppose he has broke or cracked it in leaping a fence when he was lame
on the other hind leg, and hung with his hind legs in the fence.I am
glad to hear what you tell me of Thomas.He shall not want for anything
that is necessary if he be a good boy for he has no friend but me.You
have not given me any account about the meeting house.The window of the room said to have been Paine's study is close to the
ground, and it is marvellous that he was not murdered.**

     * I am indebted for this letter to Dr.Clair J. Grece, of
     England, whose uncle, Daniel Constable, probably got it from
     Carver.** Derrick (or Dederick) appears by the records at White
     Plains to have been brought up for trial May 19, 1806, and
     to have been recognized in the sum of $500 for his
     appearance at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer and
     General Gaol Delivery, and in the meantime to keep the peace
     towards the

People, and especially towards Thomas Payne (sic).Paine, Christopher
Hubbs, and Andrew A. Dean were recognized in $50 to appear and give
evidence against Derrick.Nothing further appears in the records
(examined for me by Mr.B. D. Washburn up to 1810).It is pretty certain
that Paine did not press the charges.The most momentous change which had come over America during Paine's
absence was the pro-slavery reaction.This had set in with the first
Congress.An effort was made by the Virginia representatives to check
the slave traffic by imposing a duty of $10 on each <DW64> imported, but
was defeated by an alliance of members from more Southern States and
professedly antislavery men of the North.The Southern leader in this
first victory of slavery in Congress was Major Jackson of Georgia, who
defended the institution as scriptural and civilizing.Franklin published (Federal Gazette, March 25, 1790) a parody of
Jackson's speech, purporting to be a speech uttered in 1687 by a Divan
of Algiers in defence of piracy and slavery, against a sect of Erika,
or Purists, who had petitioned for their suppression.Franklin was now
president of the American Antislavery Society, founded in Philadelphia
in 1775 five weeks after the appearance of Paine's scheme of
emancipation (March 8, 1775).Rush was also active in the cause, and
to him Paine wrote (March 16, 1790) the letter on the subject elsewhere
quoted (L, p.This letter was published by Rush (Columbian
Magazine, vol.318) while the country was still agitated by the
debate which was going on in Congress at the time when it was written,
on a petition of the Antislavery Society, signed by Franklin,--his
last public act.Franklin died April 17, 1790, twenty-five days after the close of the
debate, in which he was bitterly denounced by the proslavery party.Washington had pronounced the petition "inopportune,"--his presidential
mansion in New York was a few steps from the slave-market,--Jefferson
(now Secretary of State) had no word to say for it, Madison had smoothed
over the matter by a compromise.Thenceforth slavery had become a
suppressed subject, and the slave trade, whenever broached in Congress,
had maintained its immunity.In 1803, even under Jefferson's
administration, the <DW64>s fleeing from oppression in Domingo were
forbidden asylum in America, because it was feared that they would
incite servile insurrections.That the United States, under presidency
of Jefferson, should stand aloof from the struggle of the <DW64>s in
Domingo for liberty, cut Paine to the heart.Unperturbed by the attempt
made on his own life a few days before, he wrote to Jefferson on New
Year's Day, 1805, (from New Rochelle,) what may be regarded as an
appeal:




{1805}

"Dear Sir,--I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as
I may as well spend a part of it there as elsewhere.But lest bad roads
or any other circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for
your consideration, and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of
Louisiana, we may happen to think alike without knowing what each other
had thought of."The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases
in which it now stands.If armed merchantmen force their way through the
blockading fleet it will embarrass us with the french Government;
and, on the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a
partiality to the french injurious to them there is danger they will
turn Pirates upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity
than the barbary powers, and England will encourage it, as she
encourages the Indians.Domingo is lost to France either as to the
Government or the possession of it, But if a way could be found out to
bring about a peace between france and Domingo through the mediation,
and under the guarantee of the United States, it would be beneficial to
all parties, and give us a great commercial and political standing,
not only with the present people of Domingo but with the West Indies
generally.And when we have gained their confidence by acts of
justice and friendship, they will listen to our advice in matters of
Civilization and Government, and prevent the danger of their becoming
pirates, which I think they will be, if driven to desperation."The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of
this kind.She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge
of the local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of
this kind superior to any European Nation.She is enabled by situation,
and grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as
her advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part
of Domingo be fulfilled.It is also a measure that accords with
the humanity of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial
interest."All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her
alone, and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for
this Domingo to give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of
years,--that is, to import from France all the utensils and manufactures
she may have occasion to use or consume (except such as she can more
conveniently procure from the manufactories of the United States), and
to pay for them in produce.France will gain more by this than she can
expect to do even by a conquest of the Island, and the advantage to
America will be that she will become the carrier of both, at least
during the present war."There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to
Domingo; and the events that have since taken place were then often
predicted.The opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that
the commerce of the Island was better than the conquest of it,--that the
conquest could not be accomplished without destroying the <DW64>s, and
in that case the Island would be of no value."I think it might be signified to the french Government, yourself is
the best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to
undertake an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless
slaughter on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in
point of commerce that the state of things will admit of.Such an offer,
whether accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a
good end."There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off
for Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington.I congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for
President and Vice-President."Yours in friendship,

"Thomas Paine."The journey to Washington was given up, and Paine had to content himself
with his pen.He took in several newspapers, and was as keenly alive
as ever to the movements of the world.His chief anxiety was lest some
concession might be made to the Louisianians about the slave trade, that
region being an emporium of the traffic which grew more enterprising and
brutal as its term was at hand.Much was said of the great need of the
newly acquired region for more laborers, and it was known that Jefferson
was by no means so severe in his opposition to slavery as he was once
supposed to be.The President repeatedly invited Paine's views, and they
were given fully and freely.The following extracts are from a letter
dated New York, January 25, 1805:

"Mr.Wingate called on me at N. York, where I
happened to be when they arrived on their Journey from Washington to
the Eastward: I find by Mr.Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will
have to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an
end to this business the better.The Cession of Louisiana is a great
acquisition; but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union
were the prayer of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lauds be
worth settling if the settlers are to be under a french jurisdiction....
When the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana become equal
to the number of french inhabitants it may then be proper and right to
erect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional state;
but to do it now would be sending the american settlers into exile....
For my own part, I wish the name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may
in a great measure be done by giving names to the new states that will
serve as descriptive of their situation or condition.France lost the
names and almost the remembrance of provinces by dividing them into
departments with appropriate names."Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it
is that of settling it.The people of the Eastern States are the
best settlers of a new country, and of people from abroad the German
Peasantry are the best.The Irish in general are generous and dissolute.The Scotch turn their attention to traffic, and the English to
manufactures.These people are more fitted to live in cities than to
be cultivators of new lands.I know not if in Virginia they are much
acquainted with the importation of German redemptioners, that is,
servants indented for a term of years.The best farmers in Pennsylvania
are those who came over in this manner or the descendants of them.The
price before the war used to be twenty pounds Pennsylvania currency for
an indented servant for four years, that is, the ship owner, got twenty
pounds per head passage money, so that upon two hundred persons he would
receive after their arrival four thousand pounds paid by the persons who
purchased the time of their indentures which was generally four
years.These would be the best people, of foreigners, to bring into
Louisiana--because they would grow to be citizens.Whereas bringing poor
<DW64>s to work the lands in a state of slavery and wretchedness, is,
besides the immorality of it, the certain way of preventing population
and consequently of preventing revenue.I question if the revenue
arising from ten <DW64>s in the consumption of imported articles is
equal to that of one white citizen.In the articles of dress and of the
table it is almost impossible to make a comparison."These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are
proper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always
fortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act
unitedly.But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a
french Jurisdiction.Congress must frame the laws under which they are
to serve out their time; after which Congress might give them a few
acres of land to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able
to buy more.I am inclined to believe that by adopting this method the
Country will be more peopled in about twenty years from the present time
than it has been in all the times of the french and Spaniards.Spain,
I believe, held it chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and
the less it was improved the better it agreed with that policy; and
as to france she never shewed any great disposition or gave any great
encouragement to colonizing.It is chiefly small countries, that are
straitened for room at home, like Holland and England, that go in quest
of foreign settlements....

"I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg.He tells
me that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America
carried them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors.He tells me
he has the Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding
persons shipping themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that
he will give me a copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send
with this letter.He says that the American Consul has been spoken to
respecting this kidnapping business under American pretences, but
that he says he has no authority to interfere.The German members of
Congress, or the Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been
in the practice of importing German redemptioners, can give you better
information respecting the business of importation than I can.But the
redemptioners thus imported must be at the charge of the Captain or
ship owner till their time is sold.Some of the quaker Merchants of
Philadelphia went a great deal into the importation of German servants
or redemptioners.It agreed with the morality of their principles that
of bettering people's condition, and to put an end to the practice of
importing slaves.I think it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose
that the population of Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls
every year.What <DW44>s the settlement of it is the want of labourers,
and until labourers can be had the sale of the lands will be slow.Were
I twenty years younger, and my name and reputation as well known in
European countries as it is now, I would contract for a quantity of land
in Louisiana and go to Europe and bring over settlers....

"It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an
excursion to Washington.The piece on Gouverneur Morris's Oration
on Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have
published; and as every thing of public affairs is now on a good ground
I shall do as I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator and attend
now to my own affairs."I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published,
beginning with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript,
and publish them by subscription.I have deferred doing this till the
presidential election should be over, but I believe there was not much
occasion for that caution.There is more hypocrisy than bigotry in
America.When I was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell
in company with some Baptists among whom were three Ministers.The
conversation turned on the election for President, and one of them who
appeared to be a leading man said 'They cry out against Mr.Jefferson
because, they say he is a Deist.Well, a Deist may be a good man, and if
he think it right, it is right to him.For my own part, said he, 'I had
rather vote for a Deist than for a blue-skin presbyterian.''You judge
right,' said I, 'for a man that is not of any of the sectaries will hold
the balance even between all; but give power to a bigot of any sectary
and he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the blue-skins
do in connection,' They all agree in this sentiment, and I have always
found it assented to in any company I have had occasion to use it."I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four
hundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid on delivery; and
as they will be delivered separately, as fast as they can be printed and
bound the subscribers may stop when they please.The three first volumes
will be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account
of the state of affairs at the time it was written, whether in America,
france, or England, which will also shew the occasion of writing it.of the Crisis published the 19th
December '76 is '_These are the times that try men's souls,_' It is
therefore necessary as explanatory to the expression in all future times
to shew what those times were.The two last volumes will be theological
and those who do not chuse to take them may let them alone.They will
have the right to do so, by the conditions of the subscription.I shall
also make a miscellaneous Volume of correspondence, Essays, and
some pieces of Poetry, which I believe will have some claim to
originality....

"I find by the Captain [from New Orleans] above mentioned that several
Liverpool ships have been at New Orleans.It is chiefly the people
of Liverpool that employ themselves in the slave trade and they bring
cargoes of those unfortunate <DW64>s to take back in return the hard
money and the produce of the country.Had I the command of the elements
I would blast Liverpool with fire and brimstone.It is the Sodom and
Gomorrah of brutality....

"I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the
<DW64>s tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negroe family
a quantity of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain
quantity of produce.I think that numbers of our free <DW64>s might be
provided for in this manner in Louisiana.The best way that occurs to me
is for Congress to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them
to hire themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would
by this means learn plantation business, after which to place them on a
tract of land as before mentioned.A great many good things may now be
done; and I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to
you."Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite
New York calls sometimes to see me.He is a very
respectable old man.I wish something had been done for him in Congress
on his petition; for I think something is due to him, nor do I see how
the Statute of limitation can consistently apply to him.The law in John
Adams's administration, which cut off all commerce and communication
with france, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put
in his claim.I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on
England, france and Spain is more than 6 or 7 years standing yet no
law of limitation, that I know of take place between nations or between
individuals of different nations.I consider a statute of limitation to
be a domestic law, and can only have a domestic operation.Miller,
one of the New York Senators in Congress, knows Landais and can give you
an account of him."Concerning my former letter, on Domingo, I intended had I come to
Washington to have talked with Pichon about it--if you had approved that
method, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way.The two
Emperors are at too great a distance in objects and in colour to have
any intercourse but by Fire and Sword, yet something I think might be
done.It is time I should close this long epistle.Paine made but a brief stay in New York (where he boarded with William
Carver).His next letter (April 22d) is from New Rochelle, written to
John Fellows, an auctioneer in New York City, one of his most faithful
friends."Citizen: I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the
boatman to call on you with it.He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I
will be obliged to you to see them safe on board.The boat will leave N.
Y. on friday."I have left my pen knife at Carver's.It is, I believe, in the writing
desk.It is a small french pen knife that slides into the handle.I wish
Carver would look behind the chest in the bed room.I miss some papers
that I suppose are fallen down there.The boys will bring up with them
one pair of the blankets Mrs.Bonneville took down and also my best
blanket which is at Carver's.--I send enclosed three dollars for a ream
of writing paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to
the boat.I wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with
them, and tell them that the better they behave the better it will be
for them.I am now their only dependance, and they ought to know it.of the Prospect, while I was at Carver's, are left there.since I came to New
Rochelle."'The Thomas mentioned in this letter was Paine's godson, and "Bebia" was
Benjamin,--the late Brigadier-General Bonneville, U. S. A. The third
son, Louis, had been sent to his father in France.The _Prospect_ was
Elihu Palmer's rationalistic paper.Early in this year a series of charges affecting Jefferson's public and
private character were published by one Hulbert, on the authority of
Thomas Turner of Virginia.Beginning with an old charge of cowardice,
while Governor (of which Jefferson had been acquitted by the Legislature
of Virginia), the accusation proceeded to instances of immorality,
persons and places being named.The following letter from New Rochelle,
July 19th, to John Fellows enclosed Paine's reply, which appeared in the
_American Citizen_, July 23d and 24th:

     * This letter is in the possession of Mr.Grenville Kane,
     Tuxedo, N. Y."Citizen--I inclose you two pieces for Cheetham's paper, which I wish
you to give to him yourself.in one daily paper,
and the other number in the next daily paper, and then both in his
country paper.There has been a great deal of anonimous (sic) abuse
thrown out in the federal papers against Mr.Jefferson, but until some
names could be got hold of it was fighting the air to take any notice
of them.We have now got hold of two names, your townsman Hulbert, the
hypocritical Infidel of Sheffield, and Thomas Turner of Virginia, his
correspondent.I have already given Hulbert a basting with my name
to it, because he made use of my name in his speech in the Mass.Turner has not given me the same cause in the letter he
wrote (and evidently) to Hulbert, and which Hulbert, (for it could be
no other person) has published in the Repertory to vindicate himself.Jefferson, and I have taken
them up one by one, which is the first time the opportunity has offered
for doing it; for before this it was promiscuous abuse.I have not
signed it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I
found myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little
smart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are
some sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my
stile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish
Mr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of
any thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett
accompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,
who is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be
obliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.You did not
tell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the
enclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for
you never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,
Paine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without
trustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended
that it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as
Congress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark
from the Altar of '76," but the writer was easily recognized.The
service thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and
Charters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New
York of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This
defeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one
legislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all
matters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants
of land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a
legislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an
article been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery
and corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late
legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
place.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they
had no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New
York.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk
English, and did not appreciate Paine's idea of plain living and high
thinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,
and, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts
the unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,
practically fatherless, some start in life.The philosophic solitude in
which he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)
to John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as
a teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for
herself.I will take care of him for his
own sake and his father's, but that is all I have to say.... I am
master of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a
straw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
snuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
Chair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come
you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,
fruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I
live with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Bonneville was
an encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do
anything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you
cannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and
you will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if
they have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]
the piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers
on Turner's letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous
paragraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of
such editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want
to come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I
wish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which
     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,
     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that
there was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one
years younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old
gentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little
companionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he
indulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,
devoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless
reverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick's attempt on Paine's life she became
nervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she
presently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several
families.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,
who had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their
affection.*

     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an
     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),
     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a
     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,
     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been
     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,
Philadelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of
Pennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."It opens with a
reference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I
now am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I
address this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance
of former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the
negative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament's badge of
disgrace under William of Normandy, a defence of personal prerogative
that ought to find no place in a republic.He advises that in the new
Constitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should
be established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he
should make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation
of the House of Lords.The Representatives should be divided by lot into
two equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not
being entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor
committed by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,
and be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two
houses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should
be removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of
impeachment at "stated periods."(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator
Mitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by
the President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,
on the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,
etc.The two essays prove that
there was no abatement in Paine's intellect, and that despite occasional
"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was
still occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in
New Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the
house, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let
and he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux
House, which is still standing,*--but Paine's pecuniary situation now
gave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be
far less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the
President, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to
allude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,
had once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He
suggests that Congress should remember his services.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about
     Dederick's attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take
it will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been
a volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from
anything I have published in America or Europe.I have relinquished all
profits that those publications might come cheap among the people for
whom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been
received.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow
Fever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with
it Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he
dates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out
that the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been
unknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not
reach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease
certainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from
New York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of
the wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the
West Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves
were built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the
shore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter
decaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of
arches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the
North River.Francis justly remarks, in his "Old New York," that Paine's writings
were usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the
essay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,
there being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and learning, traces
Freemasonry to the ancient solar mythology also identified with
Christian mythology--was not published during his life.It was published
by Madame Bonneville with the passages affecting Christianity omitted.The original manuscript was obtained, however, and published with an
extended preface, criticizing Paine's theory, the preface being in
turn criticized by Paine's editor.The preface was probably written by
Colonel Fellows, author of a large work on Freemasonry.A NEW YORK PROMETHEUS

When Paine left Bordentown, on March 1st 1803, driving past placards of
the devil flying away with him, and hooted by a pious mob at Trenton,
it was with hope of a happy reunion with old friends in more enlightened
New York.Few, formerly senator from Georgia, his friend of many
years, married Paine's correspondent, Kitty Nicholson, to whom was
written the beautiful letter from London (L, p.Few had
become a leading man in New York, and his home, and that of the
Nicholsons, were of highest social distinction.Paine's arrival at
Lovett's Hotel was well known, but not one of those former friends came
near him."They were actively as well as passively religious," says
Henry Adams, "and their relations with Paine after his return to America
in 1802 were those of compassion only, for his intemperate and offensive
habits, and intimacy was impossible.Adams will vainly search
his materials for any intimation at that time of the intemperate or
offensive habits.Gallatin continued to risk
     Paine.360

The "compassion" is due to those devotees of an idol requiring sacrifice
of friendship, loyalty, and intelligence.The
old author was as a grand organ from which a cunning hand might bring
music to be remembered through the generations.In that brain were
stored memories of the great Americans, Frenchmen, Englishmen who acted
in the revolutionary dramas, and of whom he loved to talk.What would a
diary of interviews with Paine, written by his friend Kitty Few, be now
worth?To intolerance, the least pardonable form of ignorance, must be
credited the failure of those former friends, who supposed themselves
educated, to make more of Thomas Paine than a scarred monument of an Age
of Unreason.But the ostracism of Paine by the society which, as Henry Adams states,
had once courted him "as the greatest literary genius of his day,"
was not due merely to his religious views, which were those of various
statesmen who had incurred no such odium.There was at work a lingering
dislike and distrust of the common people.From the scholastic study, where heresies once
written only in Latin were daintily wrapped up in metaphysics, from
drawing-rooms where cynical smiles went round at Methodism, and other
forms of "Christianity in earnest," Paine carried heresy to the people.And he brought it as a religion,--as fire from the fervid heaven
that orthodoxy had monopolized.The popularity of his writing, the
revivalistic earnestness of his protest against dogmas common to all
sects, were revolutionary; and while the vulgar bigots were binding him
on their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the
social leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have
felt.**

     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March
     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being
     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously
     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,
     who lived to denounce Channing as "the devil's disciple."Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher's
     church.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit
     Paine, for which he was "suspended."Thorburn afterwards
     made amends by fathering Cheetham's slanders of Paine after
     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and
maltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had
warmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems
to have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu
Palmer.'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much
interested in the "cause":

"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from
Groton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal
of sincere enthusiasm.The publication of it would do good, but there is
an impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter.You
may show the letter to Palmer and Foster.... Remember me to my much
respected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we shall succeed if we
hold on.We have already silenced the clamor of the priests.They act
now as if they would say, let us alone and we will let you alone.You do
not tell me if the Prospect goes on.As Carver will want pay he may have
it from me, and pay when it suits him; but I expect he will take a ride
up some Saturday, and then he can chuse for himself."The result of this was that Paine passed the winter in New York,
where he threw himself warmly into the theistic movement, and no doubt
occasionally spoke from Elihu Palmer's platform.The rationalists who gathered around Elihu Palmer in New York were
called the "Columbian Illuminati."The pompous epithet looks like an
effort to connect them with the Columbian Order (Tammany) which was
supposed to represent Jacobinism and French ideas generally.Their
numbers were considerable, but they did not belong to fashionable
society.Their lecturer, Elihu Palmer, was a scholarly gentleman of the
highest character.A native of Canterbury, Connecticut, (born 1754) he
had graduated at Dartmouth.Watt to
a widow, Mary Powell, in New York (1803), at the time when he was
lecturing in the Temple of Reason (Snow's Rooms, Broadway).This
suggests that he had not broken with the clergy altogether.Somewhat
later he lectured at the Union Hotel, William Street He had studied
divinity, and turned against the creeds what was taught him for their
support."I have more than once [says Dr.Francis] listened to Palmer; none could
be weary within the sound of his voice; his diction was classical; and
much of his natural theology attractive by variety of illustration.But admiration of him sank into despondency at his assumption, and his
sarcastic assaults on things most holy.His boldest phillippic was his
discourse on the title-page of the Bible, in which, with the double
shield of jacobinism and infidelity, he warned rising America against
confidence in a book authorised by the monarchy of England.Palmer
delivered his sermons in the Union Hotel in William Street."Francis does not appear to have known Paine personally, but had seen
him.Palmer's chief friends in New York were, he says, John Fellows;
Rose, an unfortunate lawyer; Taylor, a philanthropist; and Charles
Christian.John Foster, another rationalist lecturer, Dr.Francis says he had a noble presence and great eloquence.Foster's
exordium was an invocation to the goddess of Liberty.John Fellows, always the devoted friend of Paine, was an
auctioneer, but in later life was a constable in the city courts.He
has left three volumes which show considerable literary ability, and
industrious research; but these were unfortunately bestowed on such
extinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies
concerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel
Fellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was
in especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,
and Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the
State Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on
Paine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36
Cedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced
himself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman
at Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud
professions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes
had become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active
rationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver's probably shortened Paine's life.Carver, to
anticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man
and a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious
subjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804
by Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This
succeeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine's
objects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of
attention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon
by Robert Hall, on "Modern Infidelity," sent him by a gentleman in New
York.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:

"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and
how is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not
redeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that
Adam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby
subjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus
Christ to affect or alter the case?If so,
would it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden
tree, and made a new man?""Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and
Pontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of
salvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,
was never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the
sacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the
calendar of Saints."Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: "Of the word Religion";
"Cain and Abel"; "The Tower of Babel"; "Of the religion of Deism
compared with the Christian Religion"; "Of the Sabbath Day in
Connecticut"; "Of the Old and New Testaments"; "Hints towards forming a
Society for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,
so far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and
modern"; "To the members of the Society styling itself the Missionary
Society"; "On Deism, and the writings of Thomas Paine"; "Of the Books
of the New Testament" There were several communications without any
heading.Passages and sentences from these little essays have long been
a familiar currency among freethinkers."We admire the wisdom of the ancients, yet they had no bibles, nor
books, called revelation.They cultivated the reason that God gave them,
studied him in his works, and rose to eminence.""The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other than the ancient
Egyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the darkness and the light, which
answered very well as allegory without being believed as fact.""Those who most believe the Bible are those who know least about it.""Another observation upon the story of Babel is the inconsistence of it
with respect to the opinion that the bible is the word of God given for
the information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent
such a word being known by mankind as confounding their language.""God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us.""Jesus never speaks of Adam, of the Garden of Eden, nor of what is
called the fall of man.""Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
themselves carry on?"[On the presentation of a Bible to some Osage
chiefs in New York.]"The remark of the Emperor Julian is worth observing.'If, said he,
'there ever had been or could be a Tree of Knowledge, instead of God
forbidding man to eat thereof, it would be that of which he would order
him to eat the most.'""Do Christians not see that their own religion is founded on a human
sacrifice?Many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on
the altar of the Christian Religion.""For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines."The Bible has been received by Protestants on the authority of the
Church of Rome.""The same degree of hearsay evidence, and that at third and fourth hand,
would not, in a court of justice, give a man title to a cottage, and
yet the priests of this profession presumptuously promise their deluded
followers the kingdom of Heaven.""Nobody fears for the safety of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may
be washed away.Blow then, O ye priests, 'the Trumpet in Zion,' for the
Hillock is in danger."The force of Paine's negations was not broken by any weakness for
speculations of his own.He constructed no system to invite the missiles
of antagonists.It is, indeed, impossible to deny without affirming;
denial that two and two make five affirms that they make four.The basis
of Paine's denials being the divine wisdom and benevolence, there was in
his use of such expressions an implication of limitation in the divine
nature.Wisdom implies the necessity of dealing with difficulties, and
benevolence the effort to make all sentient creatures happy.Neither
quality is predicable of an omniscient and omnipotent being, for whom
there could be no difficulties or evils to overcome.confuse the world with his doubts or with his mere opinions.He stuck to
his certainties, that the scriptural deity was not the true one, nor
the dogmas called Christian reasonable.But he felt some of the moral
difficulties surrounding theism, and these were indicated in his reply
to the Bishop of Llandaff."The Book of Job belongs either to the ancient Persians, the Chaldeans,
or the Egyptians; because the structure of it is consistent with the
dogma they held, that of a good and evil spirit, called in Job God
and Satan, existing as distinct and separate beings, and it is not
consistent with any dogma of the Jews.... The God of the Jews was the
God of everything.According to Exodus
it was God, and not the Devil, that hardened Pharaoh's heart.According
to the Book of Samuel it was an evil spirit from God that troubled
Saul.And Ezekiel makes God say, in speaking of the Jews, 'I gave them
statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not
live.'...As to the precepts, principles, and maxims in the Book of Job,
they show that the people abusively called the heathen, in the books
of the Jews, had the most sublime ideas of the Creator, and the most
exalted devotional morality.It was
the Gentiles who glorified him."Several passages in Paine's works show that he did not believe in a
personal devil; just what he did believe was no doubt written in a part
of his reply to the Bishop, which, unfortunately, he did not live to
carry through the press.In the part that we have he expresses
the opinion that the Serpent of Genesis is an allegory of winter,
necessitating the "coats of skins" to keep Adam and Eve warm, and adds:
"Of these things I shall speak fully when I come in another part to
speak of the ancient religion of the Persians, and compare it with the
modern religion of the New Testament" But this part was never published.The part published was transcribed by Paine and given, not long before
his death, to the widow of Elihu Palmer, who published it in the
_Theophilanthropist_ in 1810.Paine had kept the other part, no doubt
for revision, and it passed with his effects into the hands of Madame
Bonneville, who eventually became a devotee.She either suppressed it or
sold it to some one who destroyed it.We can therefore only infer from
the above extract the author's belief on this momentous point.It seems
clear that he did not attribute any evil to the divine Being.In the
last article Paine published he rebukes the "Predestinarians" for
dwelling mainly on God's "physical attribute" of power."The Deists, in
addition to this, believe in his moral attributes, those of justice and
goodness."Among Paine's papers was found one entitled "My private thoughts of a
Future State," from which his editors have dropped important sentences."I have said in the first part of the Age of Reason that 'I hope for
happiness after this life,' This hope is comfortable to me, and I
presume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope, with respect to a
future state.I consider myself in the hands of my Creator, and that he
will dispose of me after this life, consistently with his justice and
goodness.I leave all these matters to him as my Creator and friend,
and I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article of faith as to
what the Creator will do with us hereafter.I do not believe, because
a man and a woman make a child, that it imposes on the Creator the
unavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existence
hereafter.It is in his power to do so, or not to do so, and it is not
in our power to decide which he will do."[After quoting from Matthew
25th the figure of the sheep and goats he continues:] "The world cannot
be thus divided.The moral world, like the physical world, is composed
of numerous degrees of character, running imperceptibly one into the
other, in such a manner that no fixed point can be found in either.That
point is nowhere, or is everywhere.The whole world might be divided
into two parts numerically, but not as to moral character; and therefore
the metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can be divided, whose
difference is marked by their external figure, is absurd.All sheep are
still sheep; all goats are still goats; it is their physical nature to
be so.But one part of the world are not all good alike, nor the
other part all wicked alike.There are some exceedingly good, others
exceedingly wicked.There is another description of men who cannot be
ranked with either the one or the other--they belong neither to the
sheep nor the goats.And there is still another description of them who
are so very insignificant, both in character and conduct, as not to be
worth the trouble of damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.My
own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good,
and endeavouring to make their fellow mortals happy, for this is the
only way in which we can serve God, will be happy hereafter; and that
the very wicked will meet with some punishment.But those who are
neither good nor bad, or are too insignificant for notice, will be dropt
entirely.It is consistent with my idea of God's
justice, and with the reason that God has given me, and I gratefully
know that he has given me a large share of that divine gift."The closing tribute to his own reason, written in privacy, was, perhaps
pardonably, suppressed by the modern editor, and also the reference to
the insignificant who "will be dropt entirely."This sentiment is not
indeed democratic, but it is significant.It seems plain that Paine's
conception of the universe was dualistic.Though he discards the notion
of a devil, I do not find that he ever ridicules it.No doubt he would,
were he now living, incline to a division of nature into organic and
inorganic, and find his deity, as Zoroaster did, in the living as
distinguished from, and sometimes in antagonism with, the "not-living".In this belief he would now find himself in harmony with some of the
ablest modern philosophers.*

     * John Stuart Mill, for instance.Abbott's "Kernel and Husk" (London), and the great work of
     Samuel Laing, "A Modern Zoroastrian."{1806}

The opening year 1806 found Paine in New Rochelle.By insufficient
nourishment in Carver's house his health was impaired.His means were
getting low, insomuch that to support the Bonnevilles he had to sell the
Bordentown house and property.*

     * It was bought for $300 by his friend John Oliver, whose
     daughter, still residing in the house, told me that her
     father to the end of his life "thought everything of Paine."John Oliver, in his old age, visited Colonel Ingersoll in
     order to testify against the aspersions on Paine's character
     and habits.Elihu Palmer had gone off to Philadelphia for a time; he died there of
yellow fever in 1806.The few intelligent people whom Paine knew were
much occupied, and he was almost without congenial society.His hint to
Jefferson of his impending poverty, and his reminder that Virginia had
not yet given him the honorarium he and Madison approved, had brought
no result.With all this, and the loss of early friendships, and the
theological hornet-nest he had found in New York, Paine began to feel
that his return to America was a mistake.The air-castle that had allured him to his beloved land had faded.His
little room with the Bonnevilles in Paris, with its chaos of papers, was
preferable; for there at least he could enjoy the society of educated
persons, free from bigotry.He dwelt a stranger in his Land of Promise.So he resolved to try and free himself from his depressing environment.Jefferson had offered him a ship to
return in, perhaps he would now help him to get back.30th) a letter to the President, pointing out the probabilities of a
crisis in Europe which must result in either a descent on England by
Bonaparte, or in a treaty.In the case that the people of England should
be thus liberated from tyranny, he (Paine) desired to share with his
friends there the task of framing a republic.Should there be, on the
other hand, a treaty of peace, it would be of paramount interest to
American shipping that such treaty should include that maritime compact,
or safety of the seas for neutral ships, of which Paine had written
so much, and which Jefferson himself had caused to be printed in a
pamphlet.Both of these were, therefore, Paine's subjects."I think," he
says, "you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a person to
France in the event of either a treaty or a descent, and I make you an
offer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.Monroe.... As I think
that the letters of a friend to a friend have some claim to an answer,
it will be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any
wish that you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what
is proper or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May."Paine must face the fact that his
career is ended.It is probable that Elihu Palmer's visit to Philadelphia was connected
with some theistic movement in that city.How it was met, and what
annoyances Paine had to suffer, are partly intimated in the following
letter, printed in the Philadelphia _Commercial Advertiser_, February
10, 1806."To John Inskeep, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia."I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and
signed Isaac Hall.It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in
refusing to let him have Vine-st.Wharf after he had bid fifty
dollars more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been
unanimously approved of by the Commissioners appointed by law for that
purpose.Among the reasons given by you for this refusal, one was, that
'_Mr Hall was one of Paine's disciples_.'If those whom you may chuse to
call my disciples follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will
pass the confines of this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish and delusion sink into despair.Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of
Inskeep at Philadelphia in '_the time that tried men's souls._* He must
be some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which
the generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;
neither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care,
for if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class
or sectary he may hypocritically belong."As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little
consequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a
declaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance.Here it is:
My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
him to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne
my share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made
for this purpose.And my motive and object in all my publications on
religious subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason,
have been to bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy,
and a benevolent disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to
excite in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation in his
creator, unshackled by the fable and fiction of books, by whatever
invented name they may be called.I am happy in the continual
contemplation of what I have done, and I thank God that he gave
me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it It will make the
continual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they finally
arrive."'_These are the times that try men's souls_.'1, written
while on the retreat with the army from fort Lee to the Delaware and
published in Philadelphia in the dark days of 1776 December the 19th,
six days before the taking of the Hessians at Trenton."But the year 1806 had a heavier blow yet to inflict on Paine, and
it naturally came, though in a roundabout way, from his old enemy
Gouverneur Morris.While at New Rochelle, Paine offered his vote at the
election, and it was refused, on the ground that he was not an American
citizen!The supervisor declared that the former American Minister,
Gouverneur Morris, had refused to reclaim him from a French prison
because he was not an American, and that Washington had also refused to
reclaim him.Gouverneur Morris had just lost his seat in Congress,
and was politically defunct, but his ghost thus rose on poor Paine's
pathway.The supervisor who disfranchised the author of "Common Sense"
had been a "Tory" in the Revolution; the man he disfranchised was one to
whom the President of the United States had written, five years before:
"I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments
worthy of former times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily
labored, and with as much effect as any man living."There was not any
question of Paine's qualification as a voter on other grounds than the
supervisor (Elisha Ward) raised.More must presently be said concerning
this incident.Paine announced his intention of suing the inspectors,
but meanwhile he had to leave the polls in humiliation.It was the fate
of this founder of republics to be a monument of their ingratitude.And
now Paine's health began to fail.An intimation of this appears in a
letter to Andrew A. Dean, to whom his farm at New Rochelle was let,
dated from New York, August, 1806.It is in reply to a letter from Dean
on a manuscript which Paine had lent him.*

     * "I have read," says Dean,  "with good attention your
     manuscript on dreams, and Examination of the Prophecies in
     the Bible.I am now searching the old prophecies, and
     comparing the same to those said to be quoted in the New
     Testament.I confess the comparison is a matter worthy of
     our serious attention; I know not the result till I finish;
     then, if you be living, I shall communicate the same to
     you.Paine was now living with
     Jarvis, the artist.One evening he fell as if by apoplexy,
     and, as he lay, his first word was (to Jarvis): "My
     corporeal functions have ceased; my intellect is clear;
     this is a proof of immortality.""Respected Friend: I received your friendly letter, for which I am
obliged to you.It is three weeks ago to day (Sunday, Aug.15,) that I
was struck with a fit of an apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense
and motion.I had neither pulse nor breathing, and the people about me
supposed me dead.I had felt exceedingly well that day, and had just
taken a slice of bread and butter for supper, and was going to bed.The
fit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through the
head; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been able
to get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted
out in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties
have remained as perfect as I ever enjoyed them.I consider the scene I
have passed through as an experiment on dying, and I find death has
no terrors for me.As to the people called Christians, they have no
evidence that their religion is true.There is no more proof that the
Bible is the word of God, than that the Koran of Mahomet is the word of
God.Man, before he begins to
think for himself, is as much the child of habit in Creeds as he is in
ploughing and sowing.Yet creeds, like opinions, prove nothing.Where is
the evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of
God?The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our mental
faculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a thing
is comprehensible.It cannot therefore be an object for faith to
act upon, for faith is nothing more than an assent the mind gives to
something it sees cause to believe is fact.But priests, preachers, and
fanatics, put imagination in the place of faith, and it is the nature
of the imagination to believe without evidence.If Joseph the carpenter
dreamed (as the book of Matthew, chapter 1st, says he did,) that his
betrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that an
angel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dream; nor do I
put any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and
foolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.--The Christian
religion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.It puts the
Creator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian Devil
above him.It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that
outwits the Creator, in the garden of Eden, and steals from him his
favorite creature, man; and, at last, obliges him to beget a son, and
put that son to death, to get man back again.And this the priests of
the Christian religion, call redemption."Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering human
sacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those
authors make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own
doctrine of salvation is founded on a human sacrifice.They are saved,
they say, by the blood of Christ.The Christian religion begins with a
dream and ends with a murder."As I am well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well
enough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done,
in endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has
given him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to
fanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated
or ferocious."As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the word of
God.It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times
and bad men.There are but a few good characters in the whole book.The
fable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun
and the twelve signs of the Zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of
the eastern world, is the least hurtful part.Every thing told of Christ
has reference to the sun.His reported resurrection is at sunrise,
and that on the first day of the week; that is, on the day anciently
dedicated to the sun, and from thence called Sunday; in latin Dies
Solis, the day of the sun; as the next day, Monday, is Moon day.But
there is no room in a letter to explain these things.While man keeps
to the belief of one God, his reason unites with his creed.He is not
shocked with contradictions and horrid stories.His bible is the heavens
and the earth.He beholds his Creator in all his works, and every thing
he beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude.From the goodness
of God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands
self-reproved when he transgresses it.But
when he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can have
neither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the garden of
Eden, the talking serpent, the fall of man, the dreams of Joseph the
carpenter, the pretended resurrection and ascension, of which there is
even no historical relation, for no historian of those times mentions
such a thing, he gets into the pathless region of confusion, and turns
either frantic or hypocrite.He forces his mind, and pretends to
believe what he does not believe.This is in general the case with the
Methodists."I have now my friend given you a fac-simile of my mind on the subject
of religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you may make this letter as
publicly known as you find opportunities of doing.{1807}

The "Essay on Dream" was written early in 1806 and printed in May,
1807.It was the last work of importance written by Paine.In the same
pamphlet was included a part of his reply to the Bishop of Llandaff,
which was written in France: "An Examination of the Passages in the New
Testament, quoted from the Old, and called Prophecies of the Coming
of Jesus Christ" The Examination is widely known and is among Paine's
characteristic works,--a continuation of the "Age of Reason."The "Essay
on Dream" is a fine specimen of the author's literary art.Dream is the
imagination awake while the judgment is asleep."Every person is mad
once in twenty-four hours; for were he to act in the day as he dreams
in the night, he would be confined for a lunatic."Nathaniel Hawthorne
thought spiritualism "a sort of dreaming awake."Paine explained in the
same way some of the stories on which popular religion is founded.The
incarnation itself rests on what an angel told Joseph in a dream, and
others are referred to."This story of dreams has thrown Europe into
a dream for more than a thousand years.All the efforts that nature,
reason, and conscience have made to awaken man from it have been
ascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the workings of the devil,
and had it not been for the American revolution, which by establishing
the universal right of conscience, first opened the way to free
discussion, and for the French revolution which followed, this religion
of dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had ceased to
be believed."But Paine was to be reminded that the revolution had not made conscience
free enough in America to challenge waking dreams without penalties.The
following account of his disfranchisement at New Rochelle, was written
from Broome St., New York, May 4, 1807, to Vice-President Clinton."Respected Friend,--Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who
lived within the british lines in the revolutionary war, got in to
be inspectors of the election last year at New Rochelle.These men refused my vote at the election, saying to me:
'You are not an American; our minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris,
would not reclaim you when you were emprisoned in the Luxembourg prison
at Paris, and General Washington refused to do it.'Upon my telling
him that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and that if he did me
injustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling for a constable,
said to me, 'I will commit you to prison.'He chose, however, to sit
down and go no farther with it.Monro's
letter to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr.Monro gives
the government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in
consequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr.Randolph's
answer, in which he says: 'The President approves what you have done in
the case of Mr.The matter I believe is, that, as I had not
been guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did.As
to Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his
reclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he did not intend it
should.Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a body to
reclaim me, but their application, being unofficial, was not regarded.I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested
copies from the Secretary of State's office it will prove the lie on the
inspectors."As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration
of independence, they know nothing of what the political state of
the country was at the time the pamphlet 'Common Sense' appeared; and
besides this there are but few of the old standers left, and none that I
know of in this city."It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the
jury back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in
your way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from
your own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the
effect which the work 'Common Sense,' and the several members (numbers)
of the 'Crisis' had upon the country.It would, I think, be best that
the letter should begin directly on the subject in this manner: Being
informed that Thomas Paine has been denied his rights of citizenship by
certain persons acting as inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, &c."I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr.Riker, district
attorney, who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and
Jury.Your handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary.Had you been on the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had
been too inconvenient to you to have attended.To this Clinton replied from Washington, 12th May, 1807:

"Dear Sir,--I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 4th
instant, yesterday; agreeably to your request I have this day written a
letter to Richard Riker, Esquire, which he will show you.I doubt much,
however, whether the Court will admit it to be read as evidence."I am indebted to you for a former letter.I can make no other apology
for not acknowledging it before than inability to give you such an
answer as I could wish.I constantly keep the subject in mind, and
should any favorable change take place in the sentiments of the
Legislature, I will apprize you of it."I am, with great esteem, your sincere friend."In the letter to Madison, Paine tells the same story.At the end he says
that Morris' reclamation was not out of any good will to him."I know
not what he wrote to the french minister; whatever it was he concealed
it from me."He also says Morris could hardly keep himself out of
prison.*

     * The letter is in Mr.Frederick McGuire's collection of
     Madison papers.A letter was also written to Joel Barlow, at Washington, dated Broome
Street, New York, May 4th.He says in this:

"I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.You

I had got to be master of the feds and the priests.The former do not
attack my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of

Intelligencer.I
am somewhat at a loss for want of authentic intelligence.It will be seen that Paine was still in ignorance of the conspiracy
which had thrown him in prison, nor did he suspect that Washington
had been deceived by Gouverneur Morris, and that his private letter to
Washington might have been given over to Pickering.*

     * In Chapter X. of this volume, as originally printed, there
     were certain passages erroneously suggesting that Pickering
     might have even intercepted this important letter of
     September 20, 1795.I had not then observed a reference to
     that letter by Madison, in writing to Monroe (April 7,
     1796), which proves that Paine's communication to Washington
     had been read by Pickering.Monroe was anxious lest some
     attack on the President should be written by Paine while
     under his roof,--an impropriety avoided by Paine as we have
     seen,--and had written to Madison on the subject.Madison
     answers: "I have given the explanation you desired to F. A.
     M[uhlenberg], who has not received any letter as yet, and
     has promised to pay due regard to your request.It is proper
     you should know that Thomas Paine wrote some time ago a
     severe letter to the President which Pickering mentioned to
     me in harsh terms when I delivered a note from Thomas Paine
     to the Secretary of State, inclosed by T. P. in a letter to
     me.Nothing passed, however, that betrayed the least
     association of your patronage or attention to Thomas Paine
     with the circumstance; nor am I apprehensive that any real
     suspicion can exist of your countenancing or even knowing
     the steps taken by T. P. under the influence of his personal
     feelings or political principles.At the same time the
     caution you observe is by no means to be disapproved.Be so
     good as to let T. P. know that I have received his letter
     and handed his note to the Secretary of State, which
     requested copies of such letters as might have been written
     hence in his behalf.The note did not require any answer
     either to me or through me, and I have heard nothing of it
     since I handed it to Pickering."At this time the Secretary
     of State's office contained the President's official
     recognition of Paine's citizenship; but this application
     for the papers relating to his imprisonment by a foreign
     power received no reply, though it was evidently couched in
     respectful terms; as the letter was open for the eye of
     Madison, who would not have conveyed it otherwise.It is
     incredible that Washington could have sanctioned such an
     outrage on one he had recognized as an American citizen,
     unless under pressure of misrepresentations.Possibly
     Paine's Quaker and republican direction of his letter to
     "George Washington, President of the United States," was
     interpreted by his federalist ministers as an insult.It will be seen, by Madame Bonneville's and Jarvis' statements
elsewhere, that Paine lost his case against Elisha Ward, on what ground
it is difficult to imagine.The records of the Supreme Court, at Albany,
and the Clerk's office at White Plains, have been vainly searched for
any trace of this trial.John H. Riker, son of Paine's counsel, has
examined the remaining papers of Richard Riker (many were accidentally
destroyed) without finding anything related to the matter.It is so
terrible to think that with Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison at the head
of the government, and the facts so clear, the federalist Elisha Ward
could vindicate his insult to Thomas Paine, that it may be hoped the
publication of these facts will bring others to light that may put a
better face on the matter.*

     * Gilbert Vale relates an anecdote which suggests that a
     reaction may have occurred in Elisha Ward's family: "At the
     time of Mr.Paine's residence at his farm, Mr.Ward, now a
     coffee-roaster in Gold Street, New York, and an assistant
     alderman, was then a little boy and residing at New
     Rochelle.He remembers the impressions his mother and some
     religious people made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so
     that he concluded that Tom Paine must be a very bad and
     brutal man.Some of his elder companions proposed going into
     Mr.Paine's orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of
     fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, with
     surprise, Mr.Paine come out and assist the boys in getting
     apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and
     directing them where to get the best.He then advanced and
     received his share of encouragement, and the impression this
     kindness made on him determined him at a very early period
     to examine his writings.His mother at first took the books
     from him, but at a later period restored them to him,
     observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself;
     perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as
     to his character and writings."Madame Bonneville may have misunderstood the procedure for which she
had to pay costs, as Paine's legatee.Whether an ultimate decision was
reached or not, the sufficiently shameful fact remains that Thomas Paine
was practically disfranchised in the country to which he had rendered
services pronounced pre-eminent by Congress, by Washington, and by every
soldier and statesman of the Revolution.Paine had in New York the most formidable of enemies,--an enemy with a
newspaper.This was James Cheetham, of whom something has been said in
the preface to this work (p.In addition to what is there stated,
it may be mentioned that Paine had observed, soon after he came to New
York, the shifty course of this man's paper, _The American Citizen_.But it was the only republican paper in New York, supported Governor
Clinton, for which it had reason, since it had the State printing,--and
Colonel Fellows advised that Cheetham should not be attacked.Cheetham
had been an attendant on Elihu Palmer's lectures, and after his
participation in the dinner to Paine, his federalist opponent, the
_Evening Post_, alluded to his being at Palmer's.Thereupon Cheetham
declared that he had not heard Palmer for two years.In the winter
of 1804 he casually spoke of Paine's "mischievous doctrines."In the
following year, when Paine wrote the defence of Jefferson's personal
character already alluded to, Cheetham omitted a reference in it
to Alexander Hamilton's pamphlet, by which he escaped accusation of
official defalcation by confessing an amorous intrigue.*

     *  "I see that Cheetham has left out the part respecting
     Hamilton and Mrs.Reynolds, but for my own part I wish it
     had been in.Had the story never been publicly told I
     would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton had
     told it himself, and therefore it was no secret; but my
     motive in introducing it was because it was applicable to
     the subject I was upon, and to show the revilers of Mr.Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of horror
     at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr.Jefferson, they
     had better look at home and give vent to their horror, if
     they had any, at a real case of their own Dagon (sic) and
     his Delilah."--Paine to Colonel Fellows, July 31, 1805.Cheetham having been wont to write of Hamilton as "the gallant of Mrs.Reynolds," Paine did not give much credit to the pretext of respect for
the dead, on which the suppression was justified.He was prepared to
admit that his allusion might be fairly suppressed, but perceived that
the omission was made merely to give Cheetham a chance for vaunting his
superior delicacy, and casting a suspicion on Paine."Cheetham," wrote
Paine, "might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for
which he left it out.Those reasons leave people to suspect that the
part suppressed related to some new discovered immorality in Hamilton
worse than the old story."About the same time with Paine, an Irishman came to America, and, after
travelling about the country a good deal, established a paper in New
York called _The People's Friend_.This paper began a furious onslaught
on the French, professed to have advices that Napoleon meant to retake
New Orleans, and urged an offensive alliance of the United States with
England against France and Spain.These articles appeared in the early
autumn of 1806, when, as we have seen, Paine was especially beset by
personal worries.His denunciations, merited as
they were, of this assailant of France reveal the unstrung condition of
the old author's nerves.Duane, of the Philadelphia _Aurora_, recognized
in Carpenter a man he had seen in Calcutta, where he bore the name of
Cullen.It was then found that he had on his arrival in America borne
the _alias_ of Mac-cullen.Paine declared that he was an "emissary"
sent to this country by Windham, and indeed most persons were at length
satisfied that such was the case.Paine insisted that loyalty to our
French alliance demanded Cullen's expulsion.His exposures of "the
emissary Cullen" (who disappeared) were printed in a new republican
paper in New York, _The Public Advertiser_, edited by Mr.The
combat drew public attention to the new paper, and Cheetham was probably
enraged by Paines transfer of his pen to Frank.In 1807, Paine had a
large following in New York, his friends being none the less influential
among the masses because not in the fashionable world Moreover, the
very popular Mayor of New York, De Witt Clinton, was a hearty admirer
of Paine.So Cheetham's paper suffered sadly, and he opened his guns
on Paine, declaring that in the Revolution he (Paine) "had stuck very
correctly to his pen in a safe retreat," that his "Rights of Man" merely
repeated Locke, and so forth.He also began to denounce France and
applaud England, which led to the belief that, having lost republican
patronage, Cheetham was aiming to get that of England.In a "Reply to Cheetham" (August 21st), Paine met personalities in kind.Cheetham, in his rage for attacking everybody and everything that
is not his own (for he is an ugly-tempered man, and he carries
the evidence of it in the vulgarity and forbiddingness of his
countenance--God has set a mark upon Cain), has attacked me, etc."In
reply to further attacks, Paine printed a piece headed "Cheetham and his
Tory Paper."He said that Cheetham was discovering symptoms of being
the successor of Cullen, _alias_ Carpenter."Like him he is seeking to
involve the United States in a quarrel with France for the benefit of
England."This article caused a duel between the rival editors, Cheetham
and Frank, which seems to have been harmless.Paine wrote a letter
to the _Evening Post_, saying that he had entreated Frank to answer
Cheetham's challenge by declaring that he (Paine) had written the
article and was the man to be called to account.In company Paine
mentioned an opinion expressed by the President in a letter just
received.This got into the papers, and Cheetham declared that the
President could not have so written, and that Paine was intoxicated
when he said so.For this Paine instituted a suit against Cheetham for
slander, but died before any trial.Paine had prevailed with his pen, but a terrible revenge was plotted
against his good name.The farrier William Carver, in whose house he
had lived, turned Judas, and concocted with Cheetham the libels against
Paine that have passed as history.PERSONAL TRAITS

On July 1, 1806, two young English gentlemen, Daniel and William
Constable, arrived in New York, and for some years travelled about the
country.The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his
nephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to
Paine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe
offered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed
a true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was
taking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine's about 5 o'clock, sat about an
hour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me
to-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but
when I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We
were up by five o'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in
commemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against
the sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:
stores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the
honour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished
peaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked
with him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was
walking about Carver's shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old
philosopher, in bed at 4 o'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well
as when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine's papier-mache snuff-box, which
     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,
     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is
     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July
5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print
I left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family
who came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or
noticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old
friend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There
is no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of
culture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of
Paine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they
travelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine
months later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine
from Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent
disagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,
lying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his
actions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But
next day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable
writes:

"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national
defence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and
ships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures
called prophecies, etc.He says
that this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will
not touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine's just then
experimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a
scandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that
thirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had
"the Bible bound up with the 'Age of Reason,' and that they spoke in
very disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his
farm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of
his slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of
intemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to
time for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister
to Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw
persons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there
without fault.Staple, brother of the
influential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine's religious views
by some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at
New Rochelle.Burger, Pelton's clerk, used to drive Paine about
     daily.Vale says:

     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and
     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his
     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and
     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine
     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless
     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean
     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with
     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring
     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing
     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine's dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between
Paine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates
the latter's bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly
and dishonestly treated in Carver's house, and had taken him out of his
Will.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly
never wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him
hardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*

     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of
     Cheetham's book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was
     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned
     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars
     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--
     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any
     person reading Cheetham's life of Paine that [sic] his pen
     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham's
     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a
     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice
     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the
     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then
     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing
     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a
     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the
     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was
     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this
     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.
     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written
for Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver's
letter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the
correspondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years
hanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,
he could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham
had compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham
had obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters
written in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means
to publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical
errours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a
candid and impartial public will not view them 'with a critick's eye.'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine's faulty grammar, which
Carver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own
letter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he
written it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan's.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver
     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for
wich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to
Paine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver's antipathy
to whom arose from his hopes of Paine's property.In reply to Paine's
information, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I
likewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your
mind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to
appear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing
afterwards."Carver's letter
is dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine's life,
for the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame
Bonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine's death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning
Paine's domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts
personally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"
says Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he
wrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this
plain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to
blackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never
made any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made
an effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you
or myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each
other--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place
between us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have
caused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not
more effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,
and Carver, who had flattered Paine's "great mind," in the letter
just quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for
Cheetham's projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to
publish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which
he meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter
had he not written it.All of Cheetham's libels on Paine's life in New
York are amplifications of Carver's insinuations.In describing Cheetham
as "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this
blackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally
the charges relating to Paine's last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux
mansion.In 1891 I
visited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,
finding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated
in the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used
to sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of
his."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a
perfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,
never intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my
grandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she
heard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those
who uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members
of the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau's religious opinions
are I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman
could for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It
certainly was not until some years after his return to America that any
slovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often
remarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was
neglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once
associated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who
need it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always
     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and
     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,
     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I
     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very
     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side
     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French
     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge
     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had
aversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I
have sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the
following conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the
custom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,
which causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the
oft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was
prominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just
after he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and
at public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no
instance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise
Office to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or
intemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America
(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall's
daily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning
everything, but in no case is a word said of Paine's drinking.Paine's enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every
charge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine
told Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private
affliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified
on a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest
friends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected
to follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and
drank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,
where Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to
Caleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less
than any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,
questioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton's store at New Rochelle, and
found that Paine's liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per
week.He also questioned Jarvis, the
artist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five
months, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and
himself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink
much."In July, 1809, just after Paine's death, Cheetham wrote
Barlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his
character," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a
merchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order
of Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of
Washington; he could know nothing of Cheetham's treachery, and fell into
his trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for
granted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about
Paine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,
though strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the
heaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his
former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had
received his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking
down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
their society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he
was, well knew Paine's nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not
from appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a
stock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine
found no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps
discover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness
that threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the
terrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left
Carver's to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the
house of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained
ten months.Hitt reports that Paine's weekly supply then--his
seventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd's "Joel Barlow," p.was one
     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never
     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver's he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor's recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John
Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and
fire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,
and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,
and was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows
was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was
intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to
this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of
wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both
in the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and
irreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant
personal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine's life, that
he never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that
all accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under
all circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,
they said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age
and Paine, like Jefferson, could 'bear but little spirit,' so that he
was constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I
visited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed
with the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was
a drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter
to Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when
he wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;
that Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it
without authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole
course of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him
on religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,
philosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from
their own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their
integrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be
impossible to give."During Paine's life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality
connected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the
following: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in
whose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three
sons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"
Madame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had
betrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to
blackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed
he had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not
actionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville
in court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation
between the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was
preposterous.Cheetham's lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things
that his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine
smile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the
slander.She never saw but
decency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when
Paine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver's
lies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole
story (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine's estate for tuition
of the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,
"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not
have come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for
her children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that
"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,
and Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine's child."But, apart from the
intrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),
Underbill's character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,
Judge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence
but Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead
lips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham's case by saying that
Paine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;
the charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted
from Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to
Paine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to
visit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham's
case was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that
"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or
illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were
alone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects
of Paine's care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that
Paine's Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this
mysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and
disappointed speculators."Sampson's invective was terrific; Cheetham
rose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson
took a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:

"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross
abuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself
a monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a
party, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit
still to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court
against a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does
she deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of
coming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has
lavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten
     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson's speech says that the jury "although
composed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few
minutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:

"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive
his sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
imposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,
with a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,
lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should
receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong
to the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office
by men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the
councils of state."*

     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret
     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,
     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and
     for other information, to the industrious collector of
     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.

Madame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her
character,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose
children she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an
illustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham's defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a
French woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they
could little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years
had thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals
as the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into
variants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that
Paine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu
Palmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,
etc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose
name Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a
romantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the
execution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young
children in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,
supported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his
property to them when he died.The widow and children lived in
apartments up town by themselves.I believe
his conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared
to be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*

     * "Forty Years' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was
the widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first
brought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth
of the time (1834), and an indication that Paine's generosity to
the Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth
quoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years
afterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it
was whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though
he was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it
has gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of
McClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]
followed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas
Bonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where
he and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by
Paine's self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents
concerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have
been brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except
out of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory
of sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for
the same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of
a home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our
revolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law
of his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,
he could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be
persecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION

The blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle
was heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously
gained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first
advocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were
low, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were
insulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or
two letters to Congress, of which Paine's enemies did not fail to make
the most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for
     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864.Reports of neglect of Paine by Madame Bonneville have been credited by
some, but are unfounded She gave all the time she could to the sufferer,
and did her best for him.Willett Hicks sometimes called, and his
daughter (afterwards Mrs.Cheese-man) used to take Paine delicacies.The
only procurable nurse was a woman named Hedden, who combined piety and
artfulness.Paine's physician was the most distinguished in New York,
Dr.Romaine, but nurse Hedden managed to get into the house one
Dr.Manly, who turned out to be Cheetham's spy.Manly afterwards
contributed to Cheetham's book a lying letter, in which he claimed
to have been Paine's physician.It will be seen, however, by Madame
Bonneville's narrative to Cobbett, that Paine was under the care of
his friend.As Manly, assuming that he called as many did,
never saw Paine alone, he was unable to assert that Paine recanted, but
he converted the exclamations of the sufferer into prayers to Christ.*

     * Another claimant to have been Paine's physician has been
     cited.In 1876 (N. Y, Observer) Feb.Wickham
     reported from a late Dr.Matson Smith, of New Rochelle, that
     he had been Paine's physician, and witnessed his
     drunkenness.Unfortunately for Wickham he makes Smith say it
     was on his farm where Paine "spent his latter days."Paine
     was not on his farm for two years before his death.Smith
     could never have attended Paine unless in 1803, when he had
     a slight trouble with his hands,--the only illness he ever
     had at New Rochelle,--while the guest of a neighbor, who
     attests his sobriety.Smith is
     living, Mr.Albert Willcox, who writes me his recollection
     of what Smith told him of Paine.Neither drunkenness, nor
     any item of Wickham's report is mentioned.He said Paine
     was afraid of death, but could only have heard it.The god of wrath who ruled in New York a hundred years, through the
ministerial prerogatives, was guarded by a Cerberean legend.The
three alternatives of the heretic were, recantation, special judgment,
terrible death.Before Paine's arrival in America, the excitement on
his approach had tempted a canny Scot, Donald Fraser, to write an
anticipated "Recantation" for him, the title-page being cunningly
devised so as to imply that there had been an actual recantation.On his
arrival in New York, Paine found it necessary to call Fraser to account,
The Scotchman pleaded that he had vainly tried to earn a living as
fencing-master, preacher, and school-teacher, but had got eighty dollars
for writing the "Recantation."Paine said: "I am glad you found the
expedient a successful shift for your needy family; but write no more
concerning Thomas Paine.I am satisfied with your acknowledgment--try
something more worthy of a man."*

     * Dr.Francis' "Old New York," p.The second mouth of Cerberus was noisy throughout the land; revivalists
were describing in New Jersey how some "infidel" had been struck blind
in Virginia, and in Virginia how one was struck dumb in New Jersey.But here was the very head and front of what they called "infidelity,"
Thomas Paine, who ought to have gathered in his side a sheaf of
thunderbolts, preserved by more marvellous "providences" than any
sectarian saint.Out of one hundred and sixty carried to the guillotine
from his prison, he alone was saved, by the accident of a chalk mark
affixed to the wrong side of his cell door.On two ships he prepared
to return to America, but was prevented; one sank at sea, the other was
searched by the British for him particularly.And at the very moment
when New Rochelle disciples were calling down fire on his head,
Christopher Dederick tried vainly to answer the imprecation; within a
few feet of Paine, his gun only shattered the window at which the author
sat."Providence must be as bad as Thomas Paine," wrote the old deist.This amounted to a sort of contest like that of old between the
prophets of Baal and those of Jehovah.The deists were crying to their
antagonists: "Perchance he sleepeth."If Paine
was spared, what heretic need tremble?But he reached his threescore
years and ten in comfort; and the placard of Satan flying off with him
represented a last hope.Skepticism and rationalism were not understood by pious people a hundred
years ago.Renan thinks
he will have his legend in France modelled after Judas.But no educated
Christian conceives of a recantation or extraordinary death-bed for a
Darwin, a Parker, an Emerson.Brad-laugh had some fear that
he might be a posthumous victim of the "infidel's legend."In 1875, when
he was ill in St Luke's Hospital, New York, he desired me to question
the physicians and nurses, that I might, if necessary, testify to his
fearlessness and fidelity to his views in the presence of death.But he
has died without the "legend," whose decline dates from Paine's case;
that was its crucial challenge.The whole nation had recently been thrown into a wild excitement by
the fall of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Hamilton's
world-liness had been notorious, but the clergymen (Bishop Moore and the
Presbyterian John Mason) reported his dying words of unctuous piety and
orthodoxy.John Mason, Paine said:

"Between you and your rival in communion ceremonies, Dr.Moore of the
Episcopal church, you have, in order to make yourselves appear of
some importance, reduced General Hamilton's character to that of a
feeble-minded man, who in going out of the world wanted a passport from
a priest.Which of you was first applied to for this purpose is a matter
of no consequence.The man, sir, who puts his trust and confidence in
God, that leads a just and moral life, and endeavors to do good, does
not trouble himself about priests when his hour of departure comes, nor
permit priests to trouble themselves about him."The words were widely commented on, and both sides looked forward,
almost as if to a prize-fight, to the hour when the man who had unmade
thrones, whether in earth or heaven, must face the King of Terrors.Since Michael and Satan had their legendary combat for the body of
Moses, there was nothing like it.In view of the pious raids on Paine's
death-bed, freethinkers have not been quite fair.To my own mind, some
respect is due to those humble fanatics, who really believed that Paine
was approaching eternal fires, and had a frantic desire to save him.*

     * Nor should it be forgotten that several liberal
     Christians, like Hicks, were friendly towards Paine at the
     close of his life, whereas his most malignant enemies were
     of his own "Painite" household, Carver and Cheetham.William Erving tells me that he remembers an English
     clergyman in New York, named Cunningham, who used to visit
     his (Erving's) father.He heard him say that Paine and he
     were friends; and that "the whole fault was that people
     hectored Paine, and made him say things he would never say
     to those who treated him as a gentleman."Paine had no fear of death; Madame Bonneville's narrative shows that his
fear was rather of living too long.But he had some such fear as that of
Voltaire when entering his house at Fernay after it began to lighten.He was not afraid of the lightning, he said, but of what the neighboring
priest would make of it should he be struck.Paine had some reason to
fear that the zealots who had placarded the devil flying away with him
might fulfil their prediction by body-snatching.His unwillingness to be
left alone, ascribed to superstitious terror, was due to efforts to
get a recantation from him, so determined that he dare not be without
witnesses.While living with Jarvis, two years
before, he desired him to bear witness that he maintained his theistic
convictions to the last.Jarvis merrily proposed that he should make a
sensation by a mock recantation, but the author said, "Tom Paine never
told a lie."When he knew that his illness was mortal he solemnly
reaffirmed these opinions in the presence of Madame Bonneville, Dr.Haskin, Captain Pelton, and Thomas Nixon.* The nurse
Hedden, if the Catholic Bishop of Boston (Fenwick) remembered accurately
thirty-seven years later, must have conspired to get him into the
patient's room, from which, of course, he was stormily expelled.But the
Bishop's story is so like a pious novelette that, in the absence of
any mention of his visit by Madame Bonneville, herself a Catholic, one
cannot be sure that the interview he waited so long to report did not
take place in some slumberous episcopal chamber in Boston.**

     * Sec the certificate of Nixon and Pelton to Cobbett (Vale,
     p.** Bishop Fenwick's narrative (U. S. Catholic Magazine,
     1846) is quoted in the N. Y. Observer\ September 27, 1877.(Extremes become friends when a freethinker is to be
     crucified.)It was rumored that Paine's adherents were keeping him under the
influence of liquor in order that he might not recant,--so convinced,
at heart, or enamoured of Calvinism was this martyr of Theism, who
had published his "Age of Reason" from the prison where he awaited the
guillotine.*

     * Engineer Randel (orthodox), in his topographical report to
     the Clerk of the City Council (1864), mentions that the
     "very worthy mechanic," Amasa Wordsworth, who saw Paine
     daily, told him "there was no truth in such report, and that
     Thomas Paine had declined saying anything on that subject
     [religion]."Francis, "clung to his
     infidelity to the last moment of his natural life."Francis (orthodox) heard that Paine yielded to King Alcohol,
     but says Cheetham wrote with "settled malignity," and
     suspects "sinister motives" in his "strictures on the fruits
     of unbelief in the degradation of the wretched Paine."Of what his principles had cost him Paine had near his end a reminder
that cut him to the heart.Albert Gallatin had remained his friend, but
his connections, the Fews and Nicholsons, had ignored the author they
once idolized.The woman for whom he had the deepest affection, in
America, had been Kitty Nicholson, now Mrs.Henry Adams, in his
biography of Gallatin, says: "When confined to his bed with his last
illness he [Paine] sent for Mrs.Few, who came to see him, and when they
parted she spoke some words of comfort and religious hope.Poor Paine
only turned his face to the wall, and kept silence."According to Rick-man, Sherwin, and Vale, Mr.Few came of their own accord, and "Mrs.Few expressed a wish to
renew their former friendship."Paine said to her, "very impressively,
'You have neglected me, and I beg that you will leave the room.'Few went into the garden and wept bitterly."I doubt this tradition
also, but it was cruelly tantalizing for his early friend, after
ignoring him six years, to return with Death.If, amid tortures of this kind, the annoyance of fanatics and the
"Painites" who came to watch them, and the paroxysms of pain, the
sufferer found relief in stimulants, the present writer can only reflect
with satisfaction that such resource existed.For some time no food
would stay on his stomach.In such weakness and helplessness he was for
a week or so almost as miserable as the Christian spies could desire,
and his truest friends were not sorrowful when the peace of death
approached.After the years in which the stories of Paine's wretched
end have been accumulating, now appears the testimony of the Catholic
lady,--persons who remember Madame Bonneville assure me that she was a
perfect lady,--that Paine's mind was active to the last, that shortly
before death he made a humorous retort to Dr.Romaine, that he died
after a tranquil night.Paine died at eight o'clock on the morning of June 8, 1809.Shortly
before, two clergymen had invaded his room, and so soon as they spoke
about his opinions Paine said: "Let me alone; good morning!"Madame
Bonneville asked if he was satisfied with the treatment he had received
in her house, and he said "Oh yes."These were the last words of Thomas
Paine.On June 10th Paine's friends assembled to look on his face for the last
time.Madame Bonneville took a rose from her breast and laid it on that
of her dead benefactor.His adherents were busy men, and mostly poor;
they could not undertake the then difficult journey (nearly twenty-five
miles) to the grave beyond New Rochelle.Of the _cortege_ that followed
Paine a contemptuous account was printed (Aug.7th) in the London
Packet:

"Extract of a letter dated June 20th, Philadelphia, written by a
gentleman lately returned from a tour: 'On my return from my journey,
when I arrived near Harlem, on York island, I met the funeral of Tom
Paine on the road.The followers were
two <DW64>s, the next a carriage with six drunken Irishmen, then a
riding chair with two men in it, one of whom was asleep, and then an
Irish Quaker on horseback.I stopped my sulkey to ask the Quaker what
funeral it was; he said it was Paine, and that his friends as well as
his enemies were all glad that he was gone, for he had tired his friends
out by his intemperance and frailties.I told him that Paine had done
a great deal of mischief in the world, and that, if there was any
purgatory, he certainly would have a good share of it before the devil
would let him go.The Quaker replied, he would sooner take his chance
with Paine than any man in New York, on that score.He then put his
horse on a trot, and left me.'"The funeral was going to West Chester; one of the vehicles contained
Madame Bonneville and her children; and the Quaker was not an Irishman.I have ascertained that a Quaker did follow Paine, and that it was
Willett Hicks.Hicks, who has left us his testimony that Paine was "a
good man, and an honest man," may have said that Paine's friends were
glad that he was gone, for it was only humane to so feel, but all
said about "intemperance and frailties" is doubtless a gloss of the
correspondent, like the "drunken Irishmen" substituted for Madame
Bonneville and her family.Could the gentleman of the sulky have appreciated the historic dignity
of that little _cortege_ he would have turned his horse's head and
followed it.Those two <DW64>s, travelling twenty-five miles on foot,
represented the homage of a race for whose deliverance Paine had pleaded
from his first essay written in America to his recent entreaty for
the President's intervention in behalf of the slaughtered <DW64>s of
Domingo.* One of those vehicles bore the wife of an oppressed French
author, and her sons, one of whom was to do gallant service to this
country in the War of 1812, the other to explore the unknown West.Behind the Quaker preacher, who would rather take his chance in the next
world with Paine than with any man in New York, was following invisibly
another of his family and name, who presently built up Hicksite
Quakerism, the real monument of Paine, to whom unfriendly Friends
refused a grave.* "On the last day men shall wear On their heads the dust,
     As ensign and as ornament Of their lowly trust."--Hafis.The grand people of America were not there, the clergy were not there;
but beside the <DW64>s stood the Quaker preacher and the French Catholic
woman.Madame Bonneville placed her son Benjamin--afterwards General in
the United States army--at one end of the grave, and standing herself at
the other end, cried, as the earth fell on the coffin: "Oh, Mr.Paine,
my son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I for
France!"No sooner was Paine dead than the ghoul sat gloating upon him.I found
in the Rush papers a letter from Cheetham (July 31st) to Benjamin Rush:
"Since Mr.Paine's arrival in this city from Washington, when on his way
you very properly avoided him, his life, keeping the lowest company,
has been an uninterrupted scene of filth, vulgarity, and drunkenness.As
to the reports, that on his deathbed he had something like compunctious
visitings of conscience with regard to his deistical writings and
opinions, they are altogether groundless.He resisted very angrily, and
with a sort of triumphant and obstinate pride, all attempts to draw him
from those doctrines.Much as you must have seen in the course of your
professional practice of everything that is offensive in the poorest
and most depraved of the species, perhaps you have met with nothing
excelling the miserable condition of Mr.It may indeed be said that he was totally neglected and
forgotten.Bournville (sic) a woman, I cannot say a Lady, whom
he brought with him from Paris, the wife of a Parisian of that name,
seemed desirous of hastening his death.He died at Greenwich, in a small
room he had hired in a very obscure house.He was hurried to his grave
with hardly an attending person.An ill-natured epitaph, written on him
in 1796, when it was supposed he was dead, incorrectly describes the
latter end of his life.He

     "Blasphemes the Almighty, lives in filth like a hog,
     Is abandoned in death and interr'd like a dog."The object of this letter was to obtain from Rush, for publication, some
abuse of Paine; but the answer honored Paine, save for his heresy, and
is quoted by freethinkers as a tribute.Within a year the grave opened for Cheetham also, and he sank into it
branded by the law as the slanderer of a woman's honor, and scourged by
the community as a traitor in public life.The day of Paine's death was a day of judgment.He had not been struck
blind or dumb; Satan had not carried him off; he had lived beyond
his threescore years and ten and died peacefully in his bed.The
self-appointed messengers of Zeus had managed to vex this Prometheus who
brought fire to men, but could not persuade him to whine for mercy,
nor did the predicted thunderbolts come.This immunity of Thomas Paine
brought the deity of dogma into a dilemma.It could be explained only
on the the theory of an apology made and accepted by the said deity.Plainly there had to be a recantation somewhere.Either Paine had to
recant or Dogma had to recant.The excitement was particularly strong among the Quakers, who regarded
Paine as an apostate Quaker, and perhaps felt compromised by his desire
to be buried among them.Willett Hicks told Gilbert Vale that he had
been beset by pleading questions."Did thee never hear him call on
Christ?""As for money," said Hicks, "I could have had any sum."There
was found, later on, a Quakeress, formerly a servant in the family of
Willett Hicks, not proof against such temptations.She pretended that
she was sent to carry some delicacy to Paine, and heard him cry "Lord
Jesus have mercy upon me"; she also heard him declare "if the Devil has
ever had any agency in any work he has had it in my writing that book
[the 'Age of Reason']."* Few souls are now so belated as to credit such
stories; but my readers may form some conception of the mental condition
of the community in which Paine died from the fact that such absurdities
were printed, believed, spread through the world.The Quaker servant
became a heroine, as the one divinely appointed witness of Tom Paine's
recantation.* "Life and Gospel Labors of Stephen Grellet."This
     "valuable young Friend," as Stephen Grellet calls her, had
     married a Quaker named Hinsdale.Grellet, a native of
     France, convert from Voltaire, led the anti-Hicksites, and
     was led by his partisanship to declare that Elias promised
     him to suppress his opinions!The cant of the time was that
     "deism might do to live by but not to die by."But it had
     been announced in Paine's obituaries that "some days
     previous to his demise he had an interview with some Quaker
     gentlemen on the subject [of burial in their graveyard] but
     as he declined a renunciation of his deistical opinions his
     anxious wishes were not complied with."But ten years later,
     when Hicks's deism was spreading, death-bed terrors seemed
     desirable, and Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale, formerly Grellet's
     servant also, came forward to testify that the recantation
     refused by Paine to the "Quaker gentlemen," even for a much
     desired end, had been previously confided to her for no
     object at all!The story was published by one Charles
     Collins, a Quaker, who afterwards admitted to Gilbert Vale
     his doubts of its truth, adding "some of our friends believe
     she indulges in opiates."But in the end it was that same Mary that hastened the resurrection
of Thomas Paine.The controversy as to whether Mary was or was not a
calumniator; whether orthodoxy was so irresistible that Paine must needs
surrender at last to a servant-girl who told him she had thrown his book
into the fire; whether she was to be believed against her employer, who
declared she never saw Paine at all; all this kept Paine alive.Such boiling up from the abysses, of vulgar credulity, grotesque
superstition, such commanding illustrations of the Age of Unreason,
disgusted thoughtful Christians.*

     * The excitement of the time was well illustrated in a
     notable caricature by the brilliant artist John Wesley
     Jarvis.Paine is seen dead, his pillow "Common Sense," his
     hand holding a manuscript, "A rap on the knuckles for John
     Mason."On his arm is the label, "Answer to Bishop Watson."Under him is written: "A man who devoted his whole life to
     the attainment of two objects--rights of man and freedom of
     conscience--had his vote denied when living, and was denied
     a grave when dead!"The Catholic Father O'Brian (a
     notorious drunkard), with very red nose, kneels over Paine,
     exclaiming, "Oh you ugly drunken beast!"John
     Mason (Presbyterian) stamps on Paine, exclaiming, "Ah, Tom!thou 't get thy frying in hell; they 'll roast thee
     like a herring."They 'll put thee in the furnace hot,
     And on thee bar the door:
     How the devils all will laugh
     To hear thee burst and roar!"Livingston kicks at Paine's head, exclaiming,

     "How are the mighty fallen,
     Right fol-de-riddle-lol!"Bishop Hobart kicks the feet, tinging:
     "Right fol-de-rol, let's dance and sing,
     Tom is dead, God save the king--
     The infidel now low doth lie--
     Sing Hallelujah--hallelujah!"A Quaker turns away with a shovel, saying,
     "I 'll not bury thee."Such was the religion which was supposed by some to have won Paine's
heart at last, but which, when mirrored in the controversy over his
death, led to a tremendous reaction.The division in the Quaker Society
swiftly developed.In December, 1826, there was an afternoon meeting of
Quakers of a critical kind, some results of which led directly to the
separation.The chief speaker was Elias Hicks, but it is also recorded
that "Willet Hicks was there, and had a short testimony, which seemed to
be impressive on the meeting."He had stood in silence beside the grave
of the man whose chances in the next world he had rather take than those
of any man in New York; but now the silence is broken.*

     * Curiously enough, Mary (Roscoe) Hinsdale turned up again.She had broken down under the cross-examination of William
     Cobbett, but he had long been out of the country when the
     Quaker separation took place.Mary now reported that a
     distinguished member of the Hicksite Society, Mary Lock
     wood, had recanted in the same way as Paine.This being
     proved false, the hysterical Mary sank and remained in
     oblivion, from which she is recalled only by the Rev.Rip
     Van Winkle.It was the unique sentence on Paine to recant
     and yet be damned.This honor belies the indifference
     expressed in the rune taught children sixty years ago:

     "Poor Tom Paine!there he lies:
     Nobody laughs and nobody cries:
     Where he has gone or how he fares,
     Nobody knows and nobody cares!"I told Walt Whitman, himself partly a product of Hicksite Quakerism,
of the conclusion to which I had been steadily drawn, that Thomas Paine
rose again in Elias Hicks, and was in some sort the origin of our one
American religion.I said my visit was mainly to get his "testimony" on
the subject for my book, as he was born in Hicks' region, and mentions
in "Specimen Days" his acquaintance with Paine's friend, Colonel
Fellows.Walt said, for I took down his words at the time:

"In my childhood a great deal was said of Paine in our neighborhood, in
Long Island.My father, Walter Whitman, was rather favorable to Paine.I remember hearing Elias Hicks preach; and his look, slender figure,
earnestness, made an impression on me, though I was only about eleven.He is well represented in the bust there, one of my
treasures.I was a young man when I enjoyed the friendship of Col.Fellows,--then a constable of the courts; tall, with ruddy face,
blue eyes, snowy hair, and a fine voice; neat in dress, an old-school
gentleman, with a military air, who used to awe the crowd by his looks;
they used to call him 'Aristides.'I used to chat with him in Tammany
Hall.It was a time when, in religion, there was as yet no philosophical
middle-ground; people were very strong on one side or the other; there
was a good deal of lying, and the liars were often well paid for
their work.Paine and his principles made the great issue.Paine was
double-damnably lied about.Fellows was a man of perfect truth
and exactness; he assured me that the stories disparaging to Paine
personally were quite false.Paine was neither drunken nor filthy; he
drank as other people did, and was a high-minded gentleman.I incline to
think you right in supposing a connection between the Paine excitement
and the Hicksite movement.Paine left a deep, clear-cut impression on
the public mind.Fellows told me that while Paine was in New York
he had a much larger following than was generally supposed.After his
death a reaction in his favor appeared among many who had opposed him,
and this reaction became exceedingly strong between 1820 and 1830, when
the division among the Quakers developed.Probably William Cobbett's
conversion to Paine had something to do with it.Cobbett lived in the
neighborhood of Elias Hicks, in Long Island, and probably knew him.Hicks was a fair-minded man, and no doubt read Paine's books carefully
and honestly.I am very glad you are writing the Life of Paine.Paine was among the best and truest of men."Paine's risen soul went marching on in England also.The pretended
recantation proclaimed there was exploded by William Cobbett, and the
whole controversy over Paine's works renewed.One after another deist
was sent to prison for publishing Paine's works, the last being Richard
Carlile and his wife.In 1819, the year in which William Cobbett
carried Paine's bones to England, Richard Carlile and his wife, solely
for this offence, were sent to prison,--he for three years, with fine of
L1,500, she for two years, with fine of L500,* This was a suicidal
victory for bigotry.When these two came out of prison they found that
wealthy gentlemen had provided for them an establishment in Fleet
Street, where these books were thenceforth sold unmolested.Carlile's petition to the House of Commons awakened that body and the
whole country.When Richard Carlile entered prison it was as a captive
deist; when he came out the freethinkers of England were generally
atheists.* I have before me an old fly-leaf picture, issued by
     Carlile in the same year.It shows Paine in his chariot
     advancing against Superstition.Superstition is a snaky-
     haired demoness, with poison-cup in one hand and dagger in
     the other, surrounded by instruments of torture, and
     treading on a youth.Behind her are priests, with mask,
     crucifix, and dagger.Burning <DW19>s surround them with a
     cloud, behind which are worshippers around an idol, with a
     priest near by, upholding a crucifix before a man burning at
     the stake.Attended by fair genii, who uphold a banner
     inscribed, "Moral Rectitude."Paine advances, uplifting in
     one hand the mirror of Truth, in the other his "Age of
     Reason."There are ten stanzas describing the conflict,
     Superstition being described as holding

     "in vassalage a doating World,
     Till Paine and Reason burst upon the mind,
     And Truth and Deism their flag unfurled."Common sense and common justice were entering into religion as they were
entering into government.Such epithets as "atheism," "infidelity,"
were but labels of outlawry which the priesthood of all denominations
pronounced upon men who threatened their throne, precisely as "sedition"
was the label of outlawry fixed by Pitt on all hostility to George III.In England, atheism was an insurrection of justice against any deity
diabolical enough to establish the reign of terror in that country
or any deity worshipped by a church which imprisoned men for their
opinions.Paine was a theist, but he arose legitimately in his admirer
Shelley, who was punished for atheism.Knightly service was done by
Shelley in the struggle for the Englishman's right to read Paine.If
any enlightened religious man of to-day had to choose between the
godlessness of Shelley and the godliness that imprisoned good men for
their opinions, he would hardly select the latter.The genius of Paine
was in every word of Shelley's letter to Lord Ellenborough on the
punishment of Eaton for publishing the "Age of Reason."*

     * "Whence is any right derived, but that which power
     confers, for persecution?Eaton
     to your religion by embittering his existence?You might
     force him by torture to profess your tenets, but he could
     not believe them except you should make them credible, which
     perhaps exceeds your power.Do you think to please the God
     you worship by this exhibition of your zeal?If so the
     demon to whom some nations offer human hecatombs is less
     barbarous than the Deity of civilized society.... Does
     the Christian God, whom his followers eulogize as the deity
     of humility and peace--he, the regenerator of the world, the
     meek reformer--authorise one man to rise against another,
     and, because lictors are at his beck, to chain and torture
     him as an infidel?When the Apostles went abroad to convert
     the nations, were they enjoined to stab and poison all who
     disbelieved the divinity of Christ's mission?...The
     time is rapidly approaching--I hope that you, my Lord, may
     live to behold its arrival--when the Mahometan, the Jew, the
     Christian, the Deist, and the Atheist will live together in
     one community, equally sharing the benefits which arrive
     from its association, and united in the bonds of charity and
     brotherly love."In America "atheism" was never anything but the besom which again and
again has cleared the human mind of phantasms represented in outrages on
honest thinkers.In Paine's time the phantasm which was called Jehovah
represented a grossly ignorant interpretation of the Bible; the
revelation of its monstrous character, represented in the hatred,
slander, falsehood, meanness, and superstition, which Jarvis represented
as crows and vultures hovering near the preachers kicking Paine's dead
body, necessarily destroyed the phantasm, whose pretended power was
proved nothing more than that of certain men to injure a man who
out-reasoned them.Paine's fidelity to his unanswered argument was
fatal to the consecrated phantasm.It was confessed to be ruling without
reason, right, or humanity, like the King from whom "Common Sense,"
mainly, had freed America, and not by any "Grace of God" at all, but
through certain reverend Lord Norths and Lord Howes.Paine's peaceful
death, the benevolent distribution of his property by a will affirming
his Theism, represented a posthumous and potent conclusion to the "Age
of Reason."Paine had aimed to form in New York a Society for Religious Inquiry,
also a Society of Theophilan-thropy.The latter was formed, and his
posthumous works first began to appear, shortly after his death, in an
organ called _The Theophilanthropist_.But his movement was too cosmopolitan to be contained in any local
organization."Thomas Paine," said President Andrew Jackson to Judge
Hertell, "Thomas Paine needs no monument made by hands; he has erected
a monument in the hearts of all lovers of liberty."The like may be
said of his religion: Theophilanthropy, under a hundred translations and
forms, is now the fruitful branch of every religion and every sect.The
real cultivators of skepticism,--those who ascribe to deity biblical
barbarism, and the savagery of nature,--have had their day.The removal and mystery of Paine's bones appear like some page of Mosaic
mythology.* An English caricature pictured Cobbett seated on Paine's
coffin, in a boat named Rights of Man, rowed by <DW64> Slaves.* The bones of Thomas Paine were landed in Liverpool
     November 21, 1819.The monument contemplated by Cobbett was
     never raised.There was much parliamentary and municipal
     excitement.A Bolton town-crier was imprisoned nine weeks
     for proclaiming the arrival.In 1836 the bones passed with
     Cobbett's effects into the hands of a Receiver (West).The
     Lord Chancellor refusing to regard them as an asset, they
     were kept by an old day-laborer until 1844, when they passed
     to B. Tilley, 13 Bedford Square, London, a furniture dealer.In 1849 the empty coffin was in possession of J. Chennell,
     Guildford.The silver plate bore the inscription "Thomas
     Paine, died June 8, 1809, aged 72."R. Ainslie
     (Unitarian) told E. Truelove that he owned "the skull and
     the right hand of Thomas Paine," but evaded subsequent
     inquiries.Of
     Paine's gravestone the last fragment was preserved by his
     friends of the Bayeaux family, and framed on their wall.In
     November, 1839, the present marble monument at New Rochelle
     was erected.Francis] led me to pay a visit to
Cobbett at his country seat, within a couple of miles of the city, on
the island, on the very day that he had exhumed the bones of Paine, and
shipped them for England.I will here repeat the words which Cobbett
gave utterance to at the friendly interview our party had with him.'I
have just performed a duty, gentlemen, which has been too long delayed:
you have neglected too long the remains of Thomas Paine.I have done
myself the honor to disinter his bones.I have removed them from New
Rochelle.I have dug them up; they are now on their way to England.When
I myself return, I shall cause them to speak the common sense of
the great man; I shall gather together the people of Liverpool and
Manchester in one assembly with those of London, and those bones will
effect the reformation of England in Church and State.'"Badeau, of New Rochelle, remembers standing near Cobbett's workmen
while they were digging up the bones, about dawn.There is a legend that
Paine's little finger was left in America, a fable, perhaps, of his once
small movement, now stronger than the loins of the bigotry that refused
him a vote or a grave in the land he so greatly served.As to his bones,
no man knows the place of their rest to this day.His thoughts, untraceable like his dust, are blown about the world
which he held in his heart.For a hundred years no human being has been
born in the civilized world without some spiritual tincture from that
heart whose every pulse was for humanity, whose last beat broke a fetter
of fear, and fell on the throne of thrones.APPENDIX A. THE COBBETT PAPERS.In the autumn of 1792 William Cobbett arrived in America.Among the
papers preserved by the family of Thomas Jefferson is a letter from
Cobbett, enclosing an introduction from Mr.Short, U. S. Secretary
of Legation at Paris.In this letter, dated at Wilmington, Delaware,
November 2, 1792, the young Englishman writes: "Ambitious to become
the citizen of a free state I have left my native country, England, for
America.I bring with me youth, a small family, a few useful literary
talents, and that is all."Cobbett had been married in the same year, on February 5th, and visited
Paris, perhaps with an intention of remaining, but becoming disgusted
with the revolution he left for America.He had conceived a dislike of
the French revolutionary leaders, among whom he included Paine.He
thus became an easy victim of the libellous Life of Paine, by George
Chalmers, which had not been reprinted in America, and reproduced the
statements of that work in a brief biographical sketch published in
Philadelphia, 1796.In later life Cobbett became convinced that he had
been deceived into giving fresh currency to a tissue of slanders.In the very year of this publication, afterwards much lamented, Paine
published in Europe a work that filled Cobbett with admiration.This was
"The Decline and Fall of the English System of Finance," which predicted
the suspension of gold payments by the Bank of England that followed the
next year.The pamphlet became Cobbett's text-book, and his _Register_
was eloquent in Paine's praise, the more earnestly, he confessed,
because he had "been one of his most violent assailants.""Old age
having laid his hand upon this truly great man, this truly philosophical
politician, at his expiring flambeau I lighted my taper."A sketch of Thomas Paine and some related papers of Cobbett are
generously confided to me by his daughter, Eleanor Cobbett, through her
nephew, William Cobbett, Jr., of Woodlands, near Manchester, England.The public announcement (1818) by Cobbett, then in America, of his
intention to write a Life-of Paine, led to his negotiation with
Madame Bonneville, who, with her husband, resided in New York.Madame
Bonneville had been disposing of some of Paine's manuscripts, such as
that on "Freemasonry," and the reply to Bishop Watson, printed in
_The Theophilanthropist_ (1810).She had also been preparing, with her
husband's assistance, notes for a biography of Paine, because of the
"unjust efforts to tarnish the memory of Mr.Paine"; adding, "_Et
l'indignation ma fait prendre la plume_."Cobbett agreed to give her
a thousand dollars for the manuscript, which was to contain important
letters from and to eminent men.She stated (September 30, 1819)
her conditions, that it should be published in England, without any
addition, and separate from any other writings.I suppose it was one or
all of these conditions that caused the non-completion of the bargain.Cobbett re-wrote the whole thing, and it is now all in his writing
except a few passages by Madame Bonneville, which I indicate by
brackets, and two or three by his son, J. P. Cobbett.Although Madame
Bonneville gave some revision to Cobbett's manuscript, most of the
letters to be supplied are merely indicated.No trace of them exists
among the Cobbett papers.Soon afterward the Bonnevilles went to Paris,
where they kept a small book shop.His biography
in Michaud's Dictionary is annotated by the widow, and states that
in 1829 she had begun to edit for publication the Life and posthumous
papers of Thomas Paine.From this it would appear that she had retained
the manuscript, and the original letters.In 1833 Madame Bonneville
emigrated to St.Louis, where her son, the late General Bonneville,
lived.Her Catholicism became, I believe, devout with advancing years,
and to that cause, probably also to a fear of reviving the old scandal
Cheetham had raised, may be due the suppression of the papers, with
the result mentioned in the introduction to this work.Louis, October 30, 1846, at the age of 79.Probably William Cobbett
did not feel entitled to publish the manuscript obtained under such
conditions, or he might have waited for the important documents that
were never sent.The recollections are those of both M.
and Madame Bonneville.The reader will find no difficulty in making out
the parts that represent Madame's personal knowledge and reminiscences,
as Cobbett has preserved her speech in the first person, and, with
characteristic literary acumen, her expressions in such important
points.His manuscript is perfect, and I have little editing to do
beyond occasional correction of a date, supplying one or two letters
indicated, which I have found, and omitting a few letters, extracts,
etc., already printed in the body of this work, where unaccompanied by
any comment or addition from either Cobbett or the Bonnevilles.At the time when this Cobbett-Bonneville sketch was written New York was
still a provincial place.Nicolas Bonneville, as Irving describes him,
seated under trees at the Battery, absorbed in his classics, might have
been regarded with suspicion had it been known that his long separation
from his family was due to detention by the police.Madame Bonneville is
reserved on that point.The following incident, besides illustrating the
characters of Paine and Bonneville, may suggest a cause for the rigor
of Bonneville's surveillance.In 1797, while Paine and Bonneville were
editing the _Bien Informe_, a "suspect" sought asylum with them.This
was Count Barruel-Beauvert, an author whose writings alone had caused
his denunciation as a royalist.He had escaped from the Terror, and now
wandered back in disguise, a pauper Count, who knew well the magnanimity
of the two men whose protection he asked.He remained, as proof-reader,
in the Bonneville house for some time, safely; but when the conspiracy
of 18 Fructidor (September 4, 1797) exasperated the Republic against
royalists, the Count feared that he might be the means of compromising
his benefactors, and disappeared.When the royalist conspiracy against
Bonaparte was discovered, Barruel-Beauvert was again hunted, and
arrested (1802).His trial probably brought to the knowledge of the
police his former sojourn with Paine and Bonneville.Bonaparte sent by
Fouche a warning to Paine that the eye of the police was upon him,
and that "on the first complaint he would be sent to his own country,
America."Whether this, and the closer surveillance on Bonneville, were
connected with the Count, who also suffered for a time, or whether due
to their anti-slavery writings on Domingo, remains conjectural.Towards
the close of life Bonneville received a pension, which was continued to
his widow.So much even a monarchy with an established church could do
for a republican author, and a freethinker; for Bonneville had published
heresies like those of Paine.THOMAS PAINE, A SKETCH OF HIS LIFE AND CHARACTER.[More exactly than any other author Thomas Paine delineates every
Circumstantial Events, private or Public in his Writings; nevertheless,
since many pretended Histories of the Life of T. P. have been published,
tracing him back to the day of his]* birth, we shall shortly observe,
that, as was never denied by himself, he was born at Thetford, in the
County of Norfolk, England on the 29.January, in the year 1737; that
his father Joseph Paine was a stay-maker, and by religion a Quaker; that
his mother was the daughter of a country attorney, and that she belonged
to the Church of England; but, it appears, that she also afterwards
became a Quaker; for these parents both belonged to the Meeting in 1787,
as appears from a letter of the father to the son.* The bracketed words, Madame Bonneville's, are on a
     separate slip.An opening paragraph by Cobbett is crossed
     out by her pen: "The early years of the life of a Great Man
     are of little consequence to the world.Whether Paine made
     stays or gauged barrels before he became a public character,
     is of no more importance to us than whether he was swaddled
     with woollen or with linen.It is the man, in conjunction
     with those labours which have produced so much effect in the
     world, whom we are to follow and contemplate.Nevertheless,
     since many pretended histories of the life of Paine have
     been published, etc."The above-mentioned histories relate (and the correctness of the
statement has not been denied by him), that Paine was educated at the
free-school of Thetford; that he left it in 1752, when he was fifteen
years of age, and then worked for some time with his father: that in a
year afterwards, he went to London: that from London he went to Dover:
that about this time he was on the eve of becoming a sailor: that he
afterwards did embark on board a privateer: that, between the years 1759
and 1774 he was a stay maker, an excise officer, a grocer, and an usher
to a school; and that, during the period he was twice married, and
separated by mutual consent, from his second wife.*

     * The dates given by Cobbett from contemporary histories
     require revision by the light of the careful researches made
     by myself and others, as given at the beginning of this
     biography.In this year 1774 and in the month of September, Paine sailed from
England for Philadelphia, where he arrived safe; and now we begin his
history; for here we have him in connection with his literary labours.It being an essential part of our plan to let Thomas Paine speak in his
own words, and explain himself the reason for his actions, whenever
we find written papers in his own hand, though in incomplete notes or
fragments, we shall insert such, in order to enable the reader to judge
for himself, and to estimate the slightest circumstances._Sauvent d'un
grand dessin un mot nous fait juger_."A word often enables us to judge
of a great design.""I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities.I found the disposition of the people such that they might
have been led by a thread and governed by a reed.Their suspicion was
quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain was obstinate,
and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it.They
disliked the Ministry, but they esteemed the Nation.Their idea of
grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was
reconciliation.Bad as I believed the Ministry to be, I never conceived
them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of
hostilities; much less did I imagine the Nation would encourage it.I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I supposed the
parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.I had no
thoughts of independence or of arms.The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author.If I had
any talents for either they were buried in me, and might ever have
continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them
into action.I had formed my plan of life, and conceiving myself happy
wished everybody else so.But when the country, into which I had just
set my foot, was set on fire about my ears, it was time to stir.It was
time for every man to stir."*

     * From Crisis vii., dated Philadelphia, November 21, 1778.His first intention at Philadelphia was to establish an Academy for
young ladies, who were to be taught many branches of learning then
little known in the education of young American ladies.But, in 1775, he
undertook the management of the Pennsylvania Magazine.About this time he published, in Bradford's journal, an essay on the
slavery, of the <DW64>s, which was universally well received; and also
stanzas on the death of General Wolfe.In 1776, January 10, he published Common Sense.In the same year he
joined the army as aid-de-camp to General Greene.Gordon, in his history
of the Independence of the United States (vol.78), says:
[Wanting]--Ramsay (Lond.Franklin preserved by Thomas Paine: [Wanting, but no doubt one
else-where given, in the Hall manuscripts]

When Washington had made his retreat from New York Thomas Paine
published the first number of the Crisis, which was read to every
corporal's guard in the camp.It revived the army, reunited the members
of the [New York] Convention, when despair had reduced them to nine in
number, while the militia were abandoning their standards and flying in
all directions.The success of the army at Trenton was, in some degree,
owing to this first number of the Crisis.In 1778 he discovered the
robberies of Silas Deane, an agent of the United States in France.He gave in his resignation as Secretary, which was accepted by the
Congress.In 1779 he was appointed-Clerk to the General Assembly of
Pennsylvania, which office he retained until 1780.In 1780 he departed
for France with Col.John Laurens, commissioned especially by the
Congress to the Court at Versailles to obtain the aid that was wanted.After his return from France he
received the following letter from Col.Laurens:

"Carolina, April 18, 1782.--I received the letter wherein you mention
my horse and trunk, (the latter of which was left at Providence).The misery which the former has suffered at different times, by
mismanagement, has greatly distressed me.He was wounded in service, and
I am much attached to him.If he can be of any service to you, I entreat
your acceptance of him, more especially if you will make use of him in
bringing you to a country (Carolina) where you will be received with
open arms, and all that affection and respect which our citizens are
anxious to testify to the author of Common Sense, and the Crisis.I wish you to regard this part of America (Carolina) as your
particular home--and everything that I can command in it to be in common
between us."On the 10th of April, 1783, the definitive treaty of peace was received
and published.Nathaniel Greene:

"Ashley-Rives (Carolina), Nov.18, 1782.--Many people wish to get you
into this country."I see you are determined to follow your genius and not your fortune.I have always been in hopes that Congress would have made some handsome
acknowledgement to you for past services.I must confess that I think
you have been shamefully neglected; and that America is indebted to few
characters more than to you.But as your passion leads to fame, and
not to wealth, your mortification will be the less.Your fame for
your writings, will be immortal.At present my expenses are great;
nevertheless, if you are not conveniently situated, I shall take a pride
and pleasure in contributing all in my power to render your situation
happy."'Then letter from his father.--"Dear Son, &c."The following letter from William Livingston (Trenton, 4 November, 1784)
will show that Thomas Paine was not only honored with the esteem of the
most famous persons, but that they were all convinced that he had been
useful to the country.**

At this time Thomas Paine was living with Colonel Kirk-bride,
Bordentown, where he remained till his departure for France.He had
bought a house [in], and five acres of marshy land over against,
Bordentown, near the Delaware, which overflowed it frequently.Congress gave an order for three thousand dollars, which Thomas Paine
received in the same month.He carried with him the model of
a bridge of his own invention and construction, which he submitted, in
a drawing, to the French Academy, by whom it was approved.From Paris he
went to London on the 3 September 1787; and in the same month he went
to Thetford, where he found his father was dead, from the small-pox; and
where he settled an allowance on his mother of 9 shillings a week.* This and the preceding letter supplied by the author.A part of 1788 he passed in Rotherham, in Yorkshire, where his bridge
was cast and erected, chiefly at the expense of the ingenious Mr.The experiment, however, cost Thomas Paine a considerable sum.When Burke published his _Reflexions on the French Revolution_, Thomas
Paine answered him in his First Part of the Rights of Man.In January,
1792, appeared the Second Part of the Rights of Man.The sale of the
Rights of Man was prodigious, amounting in the course of one year to
about a hundred thousand copies.In 1792 he was prosecuted for his Rights of Man by the Attorney General,
McDonald, and was defended by Mr.Erskine, and found guilty of libel.But he was now in France, and could not be brought up for judgment.Each district of France sent electors to the principal seat of the
Department, where the Deputies to the National Assembly were chosen.Two
Departments appointed Thomas Paine their Deputy, those of Oise and
of Pas de Calais, of which he accepted the latter.He received the
following letter from the President of the National Assembly, Herault de
Sechelles:

"To Thomas Paine:

"France calls you, Sir, to its bosom, to perform one of the most useful
and most honorable functions, that of contributing, by wise legislation,
to the happiness of a people, whose destinies interest all who think and
are united with the welfare of all who suffer in the world."It becomes the nation that has proclaimed the Rights of Many to desire
among her legislators him who first dared to estimate the consequences
of those Rights, and who has developed their principles with that
Common Senset which is the only genius inwardly felt by all men, and the
conception of which springs forth from nature and truth."The National Assembly gave you the title of Citizen, and had seen
with pleasure that its decree was sanctioned by the only legitimate
authority, that of the people, who had already claimed you, even before
you were nominated."Come, Sir, and enjoy in France the most interesting of scenes for an
observer and a philosopher,--that of a confiding and generous people
who, infamously betrayed for three years, and wishing at last to end the
struggle between slavery and liberty, between sincerity and perfidy, at
length arises in its resolute and gigantic force, gives up to the sword
of the law those guilty crowned things who betrayed them, resists the
barbarians whom they raised up to destroy the nation.Her citizens
turned soldiers, her territory into camp and fortress, she yet calls and
collects in congress the lights scattered through the universe.Men of
genius, the most capable for their wisdom and virtue, she now calls to
give to her people a government the most proper to insure their liberty
and happiness."The Electoral Assembly of the Department of Oise, anxious to be the
first to elect you, has been so fortunate as to insure to itself that
honour; and when many of my fellow citizens desired me to inform you of
your election, I remembered, with infinite pleasure, having seen you at
Mr.Jefferson's, and I congratulated myself on having had the pleasure
of knowing you."Herault,

"President of the National Assembly."before the National Convention Thomas Paine
at the Tribune, with the deputy Bancal for translator and interpreter,
gave his opinion, written, on the capital sentence on Louis:--That,
though a Deputy of the National Convention of France, he could not
forget, that, previous to his being that, he was a citizen of the United
States of America, which owed their liberty to Louis, and that gratitude
would not allow him to vote for the death of the benefactor of America.On the 21st of January, 1793, Louis XVI was beheaded in the Square of
Louis XV.Thomas Paine was named by the Assembly as one of the Committee of
Legislation, and, as he could not discuss article by article without the
aid of an interpreter, he drew out a plan of a constitution.**

     * Both missing.Possibly the second should be to Danton.The reign of terror began on the night of the 10th of March!793, when
the greatest number and the best part of the real friends to freedom had
retired [from the Convention].But, as the intention of the conspiracy
against the Assembly had been suspected, as the greatest part of the
Deputies they wished to sacrifice had been informed of the threatening
danger, as, moreover, a mutual fear [existed] of the cunning tyranny of
some usurper, the conspirators, alarmed, could not this night consummate
their horrible machinations.They therefore, for this time, confined
themselves to single degrees of accusation and arrestation against the
most valuable part of the National Convention.Robespiere had placed
himself at the head of a conspiring Common-Hall, which dared to dictate
_laws of blood_ and proscription to the Convention.All those whom he
could not make bend under a Dictatorship, which a certain number of
anti-revolutionists feigned to grant him, as a tool which they could
destroy at pleasure, were guilty of being suspected, and secretly
destined to disappear from among the living.Thomas Paine, as his marked
enemy and rival, by favour of the decree on the suspected was classed
among the suspected, and, as a foreigner, was imprisoned in the
Luxembourg in December 1793.|

From this document it will be seen, that, while in the prison, he was,
for a month, afflicted with an illness that deprived him of his memory.It was during this illness of Thomas Paine that the fall of Robespierre
took place.Monroe, who arrived at Paris some days afterwards, wrote
to Mr.Paine, assuring him of his friendship, as appears from the letter
to Washington.Fifteen days afterwards Thomas Paine received a letter
from Peter Whiteside.** In consequence of this letter Thomas Paine wrote
a memorial to Mr.Monroe now claimed Thomas Paine, and he
_came out of the prison on the 6th of November, 1794, after ten months
of imprisonment_.Monroe, who had cordially
offered him his house.In a short time after, the Convention called
him to take his seat in that Assembly; which he did, for the reasons he
alleges in his letter to Washington.The following two pieces Thomas Paine wrote while in Prison: "Essay on
Aristocracy.""Essay on the character of Robespierre."* This is the bitter letter of which when it appeared
     Cobbett had written such a scathing review.** The letter telling him of the allegations made by some
     against his American citizenship.Thomas Paine received the following letter from Madame Lafayette, whose
husband was then a prisoner of war in Austria:

"19 Brumaire, Paris.--I was this morning so much agitated by the kind
visit from Mr.Monroe, that I could hardly find words to speak; but,
however, I was, my dear Sir, desirous to tell you, that the news of your
being set at liberty, which I this morning learnt from General Kilmaine,
who arrived here at the same time with me, has given me a moment's
consolation in the midst of this abyss of misery, where I shall all my
life remain plunged.Kilmaine has told me that you recollected
me, and have taken great interest in my situation; for which I am
exceedingly grateful.Monroe, my congratulations upon your being
restored to each other, and the assurances of these sentiments from
her who is proud to proclaim them, and who well deserved the title of
citizen of that second country, though I have assuredly never failed,
nor shall ever fail, to the former."With all sincerity of my heart,

"N.On the 27 January, 1794, Thomas Paine published in Paris, the First Part
of the "Age of Reason."Seeing the state of things in America, Thomas Paine wrote a letter to
Gen.Monroe entreated him not to
send it, and, accordingly it was not sent to Washington; but it was
afterwards published.A few months after his going out of prison, he had a violent fever.Monroe showed him all possible kindness and attention.She provided him
with an excellent nurse, who had for him all the anxiety and assiduity
of a sister.She neglected nothing to afford him ease and comfort, when
he was totally unable to help himself.He was in the state of a helpless
child who has its face and hands washed by its mother.The surgeon was
the famous Dessault, who cured him of an abscess which he had in his
side.After the horrible 13 Brumaire, a friend of Thomas Paine being
very sick, he, who was in the house, went to bring his own excellent
nurse to take care of his sick friend: a fact of little account
in itself, but a sure evidence of ardent and active friendship and
kindness.The Convention being occupied with a discussion of the question of what
Constitution ought to be adopted, that of 1791 or that of 1793, Thomas
Paine made a speech (July 7, 1795) as a member of the [original]
Committee [on the Constitution] and Lanthenas translated it and read
it in the Tribune.This speech has been translated into English, and
published in London; but, the language of the author has been changed
by the two translations.It is now given as written by the author.In April, 1796, he wrote his _Decline and Fail of the British System of
Finance _; and, on the 30th of July of that year he sent his letter to
Washington off for America by Mr.-------- who sent it to Mr.Bache, a
newspaper printer of Philadelphia, to be published, and it was published
the same year.The name of the gentleman who conveyed the letter, and
who wrote the following to Thomas Paine, is not essential and therefore
we suppress it.We here insert a letter from Talleyrand, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, to show that Thomas Paine was always active and attentive in
doing every thing which would be useful to America.Thomas Paine after he came out of prison and had reentered the
Convention wrote the following letter.The following is essentially connected with the foregoing: "Paris,
October 4, 1796."In October, 1796, Thomas Paine published the Second Fart of the Age of
Reason.Monroe departed from France, and soon after Thomas Paine
went to Havre de Grace, to embark for the United States.But, he did
not, upon inquiry, think it prudent to go, on account of the great
number of English vessels then cruizing in the Channel.He therefore
came back to Paris; but, while at Havre, wrote the following letter, 13
April 1797, to a friend at Paris.The following letter will not, we hope, seem indifferent to the reader:
"Dear Sir, I wrote to you etc."At this time it was that Thomas Paine took up his abode at Mr.Bonneville's, who had known him at the Minister Roland's, and as Mr.B.
spoke English, Thomas Paine addressed himself to him in a more familiar
and friendly manner than to any other persons of the society.It was a
reception of Hospitality which was here given to Thomas Paine for a
week or a fortnight; but, the visit lasted till 1802, when he and Mr.Bonneville parted,--alas never to meet again!All the first floor was
occupied as a printing office.The whole house was pretty well filled;
and Mr.Bonneville gave up his study, which was not a large one, and a
bed-chamber to Thomas Paine.He was always in his apartments excepting
at meal times.He then used to read the newspapers, from
which, though he understood but little of the French language when
spoken, he did not fail to collect all the material information relating
to politics, in which subject he took most delight.When he had his
morning's reading, he used to carry back the journals to Mr.Bonneville,
and they had a chat upon the topicks of the day.If he had a short jaunt to take, as for instance, to Puteaux just by
the bridge of Neuilly, where Mr.Skipwith lived, he always went on
foot, after suitable preparations for the journey in that way.I do not
believe he ever hired a coach to go out on pleasure during the whole of
his stay in Paris.He laughed at those who, depriving themselves of a
wholesome exercise, could make no other excuse for the want of it than
that they were able to take it whenever they pleased.If not writing he was busily employed on some mechanical
invention, or else entertaining his visitors.Not a day escaped without
his receiving many visits.Smith [Sir
Robert] came very often to see him.Many travellers also called on him;
and, often, having no other affair, talked to him only of his great
reputation and their admiration of his works.He treated such visitors
with civility, but with little ceremony, and, when their conversation
was mere chit-chat, and he found they had nothing particular to say to
him, he used to retire to his own pursuits, leaving them to entertain
themselves with their own ideas.Smith's [Sir Robert], and sometimes at an Irish Coffee-house
in Conde Street, where Irish, English, and American people met.He here
learnt the state of politics in England and America.He never went out
after dinner without first taking a nap, which was always of two or
three hours length.And, when he went out to a dinner of _parade_, he
often came home for the purpose of taking his accustomed sleep.It was
seldom he went into the society of French people; except when, by
seeing some one in office or power, he could obtain some favour for his
countrymen who might be in need of his good offices.These he always
performed with pleasure, and he never failed to adopt the most likely
means to secure success.He wrote as
follows to Lord Cornwallis; but, he did not save Napper Tandy.C. Jourdan made a report to the Convention on the re-establishment
of Bells, which had been suppressed, and, in great part melted.Paine
published, on this occasion, a letter to C.*

     * The words "which will find a place in the Appendix" are
     here crossed out by Madame Bonneville.258
     concerning Jourdan.He had brought with him from America, as we have seen, a model of a
bridge of his own construction and invention, which model had been
adopted in England for building bridges under his own direction.He
employed part of his time, while at our house, in bringing this model to
high perfection, and this accomplished to his wishes.He afterwards,
and according the model, made a bridge of lead, which he accomplished b/
moulding different blocks of lead, which, when joined together, made the
form that he required.Though
he fully relied on the strength of his new bridge, and would produce
arguments enough in proof of its infallible strength, he often
demonstrated the proof by blows of the sledge-hammer, not leaving anyone
in doubt on the subject.One night he took off the scaffold of his
bridge and seeing that it stood firm under the repeated strokes of
hammer, he was so ravished that an enjoyment so great was not to be
sufficiently felt if confined to his own bosom.He was not satisfied
without admirers of his success.One night we had just gone to bed, and
were surprised at hearing repeated strokes of the hammer.Bonneville's room and besought him to go and see his bridge:
come and look, said he, it bears all my blows and stands like a rock.Bonneville arose, as well to please himself by seeing a happy man as
to please him by looking at his bridge.Nothing would do, unless I saw
the sight as well as Mr.After much exultation: "nothing, in
the world," said he, "is so fine as my bridge"; and, seeing me standing
by without uttering a word, he added, "except a woman!"which happy
compliment to the sex he seemed to think, a full compensation for the
trouble caused by this nocturnal visit to the bridge.A machine for planing boards was his next invention, which machine he
had executed partly by one blacksmith and partly by another.The machine
being put together by him, he placed it on the floor, and with it planed
boards to any number that he required, to make some models of wheels.Bonneville has two of these wheels now.There is a specification
of the wheels, given by Mr.This specification, together
with a drawing of the model, made by Mr.Fulton, were deposited at
Washington, in February 1811; and the other documents necessary to
obtain a patent as an invention of Thomas Paine, for the benefit of
Madam Bonneville.To be presented to the Directory of France, a memorial
on the progress and construction of iron bridges.On this subject the
two pieces here subjoined will throw sufficient light.(Memoir upon
Bridges.--Upon Iron Bridges.--To the Directory.--Memoir on the Progress
and Construction &c.)Preparations were made, real or simulated, for a Descent upon England.8. who was then in the house of
Talma, and he wrote the following notes and instructions.Letter at
Brussells.--The Ca-ira of America.--To the Consul Lepeaux.*

     * This paragraph is in the writing of Madame Bonneville.means Bonaparte, and seems to be some cipher.All of the
     pieces by Paine mentioned are missing; also that addressed
     "To the Directory," for the answer to which see p.296 of
     this volume.Chancellor Livingston, after his arrival in France, came a few times to
see Paine.One morning we had him at breakfast, Dupuis, the author of
the Origin of Worship, being of the party; and Mr.Livingston, when he
got up to go away, said to Mr.Paine smiling, "Make your Will; leave
the mechanics, the iron bridge, the wheels, etc.to America, and your
religion to France."Thomas Paine, while at our house, published in Mr.Bonneville's journal
(the _Bien Informe_) several articles on passing events.*

     * The following words are here crossed out: "Also several
     pieces of poetry, which will be published hereafter, with
     his miscellaneous prose."A few days before his departure for America, he said, at Mr.Smith's
[Sir Robert] that he had nothing to detain him in France; for that he
was neither in love, debt, nor difficulty.Some lady observed, that it
was not, in the company of ladies, gallant to say he was not in love.Upon this occasion he wrote the New Covenant, from the Castle in the Air
to the Little Corner of the World, in three stanzas, and sent it with
the following words: "As the ladies are better judges of gallantry
than the men are, I will thank you to tell me, whether the enclosed be
gallantry.If it be, it is truly original; and the merit of it belongs
to the person who inspired it.""If the usual style of gallantry was as clever as your new
covenant, many a fair ladies heart would be in danger, but the Little
Corner of the World receives it from the Castle in the Air; it is
agreeable to her as being the elegant fancy of a friend.--C.At this time, 1802, public spirit was at end in France.The real
republicans were harrassed by eternal prosecutions.Paine was a truly
grateful man: his friendship was active and warm, and steady.During the
six years that he lived in our house, he frequently pressed us to go to
America, offering us all that he should be able to do for us, and saying
that he would bequeath his property to our children.Some affairs of
great consequence made it impracticable for Mr.Bonneville to quit
France; but, foreseeing a new revolution, that would strike, personally,
many of the Republicans, it was resolved, soon after the departure
of Mr.Paine for America, that I should go thither with my children,
relying fully on the good offices of Mr.Paine, whose conduct in America
justified that reliance.In 1802 Paine left France, regretted by all who knew him.He embarked
at Havre de Grace on board a stout ship, belonging to Mr.Patterson, of
Baltimore, he being the only passenger.After a very stormy passage, he
landed at Baltimore on the 30th of October, 1812.He remained there but
a few days, and then went to Washington, where he published his Letters
to the Americans.A few months afterwards, he went to Bordentown, to his friend Col.Kirkbride, who had invited him, on his return, by the following letter
of 12 November, 1802.He staid at Bordentown about two months, and then went to New York,
where a great number of patriots gave him a splendid dinner at the City
Hotel.In June, 1803, he went to Stonington, New England, to see some
friends; and in the autumn he went to his farm at New Rochelle.(The
letter of Thomas Paine to Mr.Bonneville, 20 Nov., 1803.)An inhabitant of this village offered him an apartment, of which he
accepted, and while here he was taken ill.His complaint was a sort of
paralytic affection, which took away the use of his hands.He had had
the same while at Mr.Monroe's in Paris, after he was released from
prison.Being better, he went to his farm, where he remained a part of
the winter, and he came to New York to spend the rest of it; but in the
spring (1804) he went back to his farm.The farmer who had had his farm
for 17 or 18 years, instead of paying his rent, brought Mr.Paine a bill
for fencing, which made Paine his debtor!They had a law-suit by which
Paine got nothing but the right of paying the law-expenses!This and
other necessary expenses compelled him to sell sixty acres of his land.He then gave the honest farmer notice to quit the next April (1805).Upon taking possession of the farm himself, he hired Christopher Derrick
to cultivate it for him.He soon found that Derrick was not fit for his
place, and he, therefore, discharged him.This was in the summer; and,
on Christmas Eve ensuing, about six o'clock, Mr.Paine being in his
room, on the ground floor, reading, a gun was fired a few yards from the
window.The contents of the gun struck the bottom part of the window,
and all the charge, which was of small shot, lodged, as was next day
discovered, in the window sill and wall.The shooter, in firing the gun,
fell; and the barrel of the gun had entered the ground where he fell,
and left an impression, which Thomas Paine observed the next morning.Thomas Paine went immediately to the house of a neighboring farmer, and
there (seeing a gun, he took hold of it, and perceived that the
muzzle of the gun was filled with fresh earth.)And then he heard that
Christopher Derick had borrowed the gun about five o'clock the evening
before, and had returned it again before six o'clock the same evening.Derick was arrested, and Purdy, his brother farmer, became immediately
and voluntarily his bail.The cause was brought forward at New Rochelle;
and Derick was acquitted.*

     * See p.Several paragraphs here are in
     the writing of J. P. Cobbett, then with his father in New
     York.In 1806 Thomas Paine offered to vote at New Rochelle for the election.But his vote was not admitted; on the pretence only of his not being
a citizen of America; whereon he wrote the following letters.[_The
letters are here missing, but no doubt the same as those on pp.379-80
of this volume_..]

This case was pleaded before the Supreme Court of New York by Mr.Riker, then Attorney General, and, though Paine lost his cause, I as
his legatee, did not lose the having to pay for it.It is however, an
undoubted fact, that Mr.He remained at New Rochelle till June 1807; till disgust of every kind,
occasioned by the gross and brutal conduct of some of the people there,
made him resolve to go and live at New York.On the 4th of April, 1807, he wrote the following letter to Mr.Bonneville [in Paris]:

"My dear Bonneville: Why don't you come to America Your wife and two
boys, Benjamin and Thomas, are here, and in good health.They all speak
English very well; but Thomas has forgot his French.I intend to provide
for the boys, but, I wish to see you here.We heard of you by letters by
Madget and Captain Hailey.Thomas, an English
woman, keep an academy for young ladies."I send this by a friend, Mrs.Champlin, who will call on Mercier at the
Institute, to know where you are.And some time after the following letter:

"My dear Bonneville: I received your letter by Mrs.Champlin, and also
the letter for Mrs.Bonneville, and one from her sister.I have written
to the American Minister in Paris, Mr.Armstrong, desiring him to
interest himself to have your surveillance taken off on condition of
your coming to join your family in the United States.Bonneville's, come to you under cover to the
American Minister from Mr.As soon as you
receive it I advise you to call on General Armstrong and inform him of
the proper method to have your surveillance taken off.Champagny,
who succeeds Talleyrand, is, I suppose, the same who was Minister of the
Interior, from whom I received a handsome friendly letter, respecting
the iron bridge.I think you once went with me to see him."Call on Mr Skipwith with my compliments.He will inform you what
vessels will sail for New York and where from.Bordeaux will be the best
place to sail from.Lee is American Consul at Bordeaux.When you arrive there, call on him, with my compliments.You may
contrive to arrive at New York in April or May.The passages, in the
Spring, are generally short; seldom more than five weeks, and often
less."Present my respects to Mercier, Bernardin St.Pierre, Dupuis,
Gregoire.--When you come, I intend publishing all my works, and those I
have yet in manuscript, by subscription."*

     * This letter is entirely in the writing of Madame
     Bonneville.Beneath it is written: "The above is a true
     copy of the original; I have compared the two together.The allusion to Champagny is either a
     slip of Madame's pen or Paine's memory.The minister who
     wrote him about his bridge was Chaptal.The
     names in the last paragraph show what an attractive literary
     circle Paine had left in France, for a country unable to
     appreciate him.While Paine was one day taking his usual after-dinner nap, an old woman
called, and, asking for Mr.Paine, said she had something of great
importance to communicate to him.She was shown into his bed-chamber;
and Paine, raising himself on his elbow, and turning towards the woman,
said: "What do you want with me?""I came," said she, "from God, to
tell you, that if you don't repent, and believe in Christ, you 'll be
dammed.""Poh, poh, it's not true," said Paine; "you are not sent with
such an impertinent message.God would not send
such a foolish ugly old woman as you.Get away;
be off: shut the door."After his arrival Paine published several articles in the newspapers of
New York and Philadelphia.Subsequent to a short illness which he had
in 1807, he could not walk without pain, and the difficulty of walking
increased every day.On the 21st of January, 1808, he addressed a
memorial to the Congress of the United States, asking remuneration for
his services; and, on the 14th of February, the same year, another on
the same subject.These documents and his letter to the Speaker are as
follows.*

     * "Are as follows" in Madame B.'s writing, after striking
     oat Cobbett's words, "will be found in the Appendix."The
     documents and letters are not given, but they are well
     known.The Committee of Claims, to which the memorial had been submitted,
passed the following resolution: "Resolved, that Thomas Paine has leave
to withdraw his memorial and the papers accompanying the same."He
was deeply grieved at this refusal; some have blamed him for exposing
himself to it.But, it should be recollected, that his expenses were
greatly augmented by his illness, and he saw his means daily diminish,
while he feared a total palsy; and while he expected to live to a
very great age, as his ancestors had before him.His money yielded no
interest, always having been unwilling to place money out in that way.He had made his will in 1807, during the short illness already noticed.But three months later, he assembled his friends, and read to them
another will; saying that he had believed such and such one to be his
friend, and that now having altered his belief in them, he had also
altered his will.From motives of the same kind, he, three months before
his death, made another will, which he sealed up and directed to me, and
gave it me to keep, observing to me, that I was more interested in it
than any body else.He wished to be buried in the Quaker burying ground, and sent for a
member of the committee [Willett Hicks] who lived in the neighborhood.The interview took place on the 19th of March, 1809.Paine said, when we
were looking out for another lodging, we had to put in order the affairs
of our present abode.This was precisely the case with him; all his
affairs were settled, and he had only to provide his burying-ground;
his father had been a Quaker, and he hoped they would not refuse him a
grave; "I will," added he, "pay for the digging of it."The committee of the Quakers refused to receive his body, at which
he seemed deeply moved, and observed to me, who was present at the
interview, that their refusal was foolish."You will," said I, "be
buried on your farm" "I have no objection to that," said he "but the
farm will be sold, and they will dig my bones up before they be half
rotten."Paine," I replied, "have confidence in your friends.I
assure you, that the place where you will be buried, shall never be
sold."He seemed satisfied; and never spoke upon this subject again.I
have been as good as my word.Last December (1818) the land of the farm having been divided between
my children, I gave fifty dollars to keep apart and to myself, the place
whereon the grave was.Paine, doubtless, considered me and my children as strangers in America.His affection for us was, at any rate, great and sincere.He anxiously
recommended us to the protection of Mr.Emmet, saying to him, "when I
am dead, Madam Bonneville will have no friend here."And a little time
after, obliged to draw money from the Bank, he said, with an air of
sorrow, "you will have nothing left."*

     * Paine's Will appoints Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton
     (with $200 each), and Madame Bonneville executors; gives a
     small bequest to the widow of Elihu Palmer, and a
     considerable one to Rickman of London, who was to divide
     with Nicholas Bonneville proceeds of the sale of the North
     part of his farm.To Madame Bonneville went his manuscripts,
     movable effects, stock in the N. Y. Phoenix Insurance
     Company estimated at $1500, and money in hand.The South
     part of the New Rochelle farm, over 100 acres, were given
     Madame Bonneville in trust for her children, Benjamin and
     Thomas, "their education and maintenance, until they come to
     the age of twenty-one years, in order that she may bring them
     well up, give them good and useful learning, and instruct
     them in their duty to God, and the practice of morality."At
     majority they were to share and share alike in fee simple.He desires to be buried in the Quaker ground,--"my father
     belonged to that profession, and I was partly brought up in
     it,"--but if this is not permitted, to be buried on his
     farm."The place where I am to be buried to be a square of
     twelve feet, to be enclosed with rows of trees, and a stone
     or post and railed fence, with a head-stone with my name and
     age engraved upon it, author of "Common Sense."He confides
     Mrs.Bonneville and her children to the care of Emmet and
     Morton."Thus placing confidence in their friendship, I
     herewith take my final leave of them and of the world.I
     have lived an honest and useful life to mankind; my time
     has been spent in doing good; and I die in perfect
     composure and resignation to the will of my Creator God."The Will, dated January 18, opens with the words,
     "The last Will and Testament of me, the subscriber, Thomas
     Paine, reposing confidence in my Creator God, and in no
     other being, for I know of no other, and I believe in no
     other."Paine had died July 27th, 1808.William Fayel, to whom I am indebted for much
     information concerning the Bonnevilles in St.Louis, writes
     me that so little is known of Paine's benefactions, that
     "an ex-senator of the United States recently asserted that
     Gen.Bonneville was brought over by Jefferson and a French
     lady; and a French lady, who was intimate with the
     Bonnevilles, assured me that General Bonneville was sent to
     West Point by Lafayette."His strength and appetite daily
departed from him; and in the day-time only he was able, when not in
bed, to sit up in his arm-chair to read the newspapers, and sometimes
write.When he could no longer quit his bed, he made some one read the
newspapers to him.He wrote nothing for the
press after writing his last will, but he would converse, and took
great interest in politics.The vigour of his mind, which had always
so strongly characterized him, did not leave him to the last moment.He
never complained of his bodily sufferings, though they became excessive.The want of exercise alone was the cause of
his sufferings.Notwithstanding the great inconveniences he was obliged
to sustain during his illness, in a carman's house [Ryder's] in a small
village [Greenwich], without any bosom friend in whom he could repose
confidence, without any society he liked, he still did not complain of
his sufferings.I indeed, went regularly to see him twice a week;
but, he said to me one day: "I am here alone, for all these people are
nothing to me, day after day, week after week, month after month, and
you don't come to see me."[Albert] Gallatin, about this
time, I recollect his using these words: "_I am very sorry that I ever
returned to this country_."As he was thus situated and paying a high
price for his lodgings he expressed a wish to come to my house.This
must be a great inconvenience to me from the frequent visits to Mr.Thomas Paine; but, I, at last, consented; and hired a house in the
neighborhood, in May 1809, to which he was carried in an arm-chair,
after which he seemed calm and satisfied, and gave himself no trouble
about anything.He had no disease that required a Doctor, though
Dr.Romaine came to visit him twice a week.The swelling, which had
commenced at his feet, had now reached his body, and some one had been
so officious as to tell him that he ought to be tapped.I told him, that I did not know; but, that, unless
he was likely to derive great good from it, it should not be done.The
next [day] Doctor Romaine came and brought a physician with him, and
they resolved that the tapping need not take place.A very few days before his
death, Dr.Romame said to me, "I don't think he can live till night."Paine, hearing some one speak, opens his eyes, and said: "'T is
you Doctor: what news?"such an one is gone to France on such
business.""He will do nothing there," said Paine."Your belly
diminishes," said the Doctor."And yours augments," said Paine.* The sentence thus far is struck out by Madame Bonno he had
     not seen for a long while.He was overjoyed at seeing him;
     but, this person began to speak upon religion, and Paine
     turned his head on the other side, and remained silent, even
     to the adieu of the person.When he was near his end, two American clergymen came to see him, and
to talk with him on religious matters."Let me alone," said he; "good
morning."One of his friends
came to New York; a person for whom he had a great esteem, and whom
seeing his end fast approaching, I asked him, in presence of a friend,
if he felt satisfied with the treatment he had received at our house,
upon which he could only exclaim, O!He added other words, but
they were incoherent It was impossible for me not to exert myself to
the utmost in taking care of a person to whom I and my children owed
so much.He now appeared to have lost all kind of feeling.He spent
the night in tranquillity, and expired in the morning at eight o'clock,
after a short oppression, at my house in Greenwich, about two miles from
the city of New York.Jarvis, a Painter, who had formerly made a
portrait of him, moulded his head in plaster, from which a bust was
executed.He was, according to the American custom, deposited in a mahogany
coffin, with his name and age engraved on a silver-plate, put on the
coffin.His corpse was dressed in a shirt, a muslin gown tied at neck
and wrists with black ribbon, stockings, drawers; and a cap was put
under his head as a pillow.(He never slept in a night-cap.)Before the
coffin was placed on the carriage, I went to see him; and having a rose
in my bosom, I took it out, and placed on his breast.Death had not
disfigured him.Though very thin, his bones were not protuberant.He was
not wrinkled, and had lost very little hair.His voice was very strong even to his last moments.He often exclaimed,
oh, lord help me!He
groaned deeply, and when a question was put to him, calling him by his
name, he opened his eyes, as if waking from a dream.He never answered
the question, but asked one himself; as, what is it o'clock, &c.

On the ninth of June my son and I, and a few of Thomas Paine's friends,
set off with the corpse to New Rochelle, a place 22 miles from New York.It was my intention to have him buried in the Orchard of his own farm;
but the farmer who lived there at that time said, that Thomas Paine,
walking with him one day, said, pointing to another part of the land, he
was desirous of being buried there."Then," said I, "that shall be
the place of his burial."And, my instructions were accordingly put in
execution.The head-stone was put up about a week afterwards with the
following inscription: "Thomas Paine, Author of "Common Sense," died
the eighth of June, 1809, aged 72 years."According to his will, a wall
twelve feet square was erected round his tomb.Four trees have been
planted outside the wall, two weeping willows and two cypresses.Many
persons have taken away pieces of the tombstone and of the trees, in
memory of the deceased; foreigners especially have been eager to obtain
these memorials, some of which have been sent to England.* They have
been put in frames and preserved.Verses in honor of Paine have been
written on the head stone.The grave is situated at the angle of the
farm, by the entrance to it.This interment was a scene to affect and to wound any sensible heart.Contemplating who it was, what man it was, that we were committing to an
obscure grave on an open and disregarded bit of land, I could not help
feeling most acutely.Before the earth was thrown down upon the coffin,
I, placing myself at the east end of the grave, said to my son Benjamin,
"stand you there, at the other end, as a witness for grateful America."Looking round me, and beholding the small group of spectators, I
exclaimed, as the earth was tumbled into the grave, "Oh!My
son stands here as testimony of the gratitude of America, and I, for
France!"This was the funeral ceremony of this great politician and
philosopher!**

     * The breaking of the original gravestone has been
     traditionally ascribed to pious hatred.A fragment of it,
     now in New York, is sometimes shown at celebrations of
     Paine's birthday as a witness of the ferocity vented on
     Paine's grave.It is satisfactory to find another
     interpretation.** Paine's friends, as we have said, were too poor to leave
     their work in the city, which had refused Paine a grave.Robert Bolton, in his History of Westchester County,
     introduces Cheetham's slanders of Paine with the words: "as
     his own biographer remarks."But even Cheetham
     does not lie enough for Bolton, who says: "His [Paine's]
     body was brought up from New York in a hearse used for
     carrying the dead, to Potter's Field; a white man drove the
     vehicle, accompanied by a <DW64> to dig the grave."The whole
     Judas legend is in that allusion to Potter's Field.Such
     is history, where Paine is concerned!The eighty-eight acres of the north part were sold at 25 dollars an
acre.The half of the south (the share of Thomas de Bonneville) has been
sold for the total sum of 1425 dollars.The other part of the south,
which was left to Benjamin de Bonneville, has just (1819) been sold in
lots, reserving the spot in which Thomas Paine was buried, being a piece
of land 45 feet square._Thomas Paine's posthumous works_.He left the manuscript of his answer
to Bishop Watson; the Third Part of his Age of Reason; several pieces
on Religious subjects, prose and verse.The great part of his posthumous
political works will be found in the Appendix.Some correspondences
cannot be, as yet, published.*

In _Mechanics_ he has left two models of wheels for carriages, and of
a machine to plane boards.Of the two models of bridges, left at the
Philadelphia Museum, only one has been preserved, and that in great
disorder, one side being taken entirely off.But, I must say here, that
it was then out of the hands of Mr.Though it is difficult, at present, to make some people believe that,
instead of being looked on as a deist and a drunkard, Paine ought to be
viewed as a philosopher and a truly benevolent man, future generations
will make amends for the errors of their forefathers, by regarding
him as a most worthy man, and by estimating his talents and character
according to their real worth.Thomas Paine was about five feet nine inches high, English measure, and
about five feet six French measure.His bust was well proportioned;
and his face oblong.Reflexion was the great expression of his face;
in which was always seen the calm proceeding from a conscience void of
reproach.His eye, which was black, was lively and piercing, and told
us that he saw into the very heart of hearts [of any one who wished to
deceive him].***

     * All except the first two MSS., of which fragments exist,
     and some poems, were no doubt consumed at St.Louis, as
     stated in the Introduction to this work.** I have vainly searched in Philadelphia for some relic of
     Paine's bridges.In this paragraph and some
     that follow the hand of Nicolas Bonneville is, I think,
     discernible.A most benignant smile expressed what he felt upon receiving an
affectionate salutation, or praise delicately conveyed.His leg and
foot were elegant, and he stood and walked upright, without stiffness or
affectation.[He never wore a sword nor cane], but often walked with
his hat in one hand and with his other hand behind his back.His
countenance, when walking, was generally thoughtful.In receiving
salutations he bowed very gracefully, and, if from an acquaintance, he
did not begin with "how d' ye do?"If they had
none, he gave them his.His beard, his lips, his head, the motion of his
eye-brow, all aided in developing his mind.Was he where he got at the English or American newspapers, he hastened
to over-run them all, like those who read to make extracts for their
paper.His first glance was for the funds, which, in spite of
jobbing and the tricks of government, he always looked on as the
sure thermometer of public affairs.Parliamentary Debates, the Bills,
concealing a true or sham opposition of such or such orators, the secret
pay and violent theatrical declamation, or the revelations of public or
private meetings at the taverns; these interested him so much that he
longed for an ear and a heart to pour forth all his soul.When he
added that he knew the Republican or the hypocrite, he would affirm,
beforehand, that such or such a bill, such or such a measure, would
take place; and very seldom, in such a case, the cunning politic or the
clear-sighted observer was mistaken in his assertions; for they were not
for him mere conjectures.He spoke of a future event as of a thing past
and consummated.In a country where the slightest steps are expanded to
open day, where the feeblest connexions are known from their beginning,
and with all the views of ambition, of interest or rivalship, it is
almost impossible to escape the eye of such an observer as Thomas Paine,
whom no private interest could blind or bewitch, as was said by the
clear-sighted Michael Montaigne.His writings are generally perspicuous and full of light, and often they
discover the sardonic and sharp smile of Voltaire.One may see that he
wishes to wound to the quick; and that he hugs himself in his success.But Voltaire all at once overruns an immense space and resumes his
vehement and dramatic step: Paine stops you, and points to the place
where you ought to smile with him at the ingenious traits; a gift to
envy and stupidity.Thomas Paine did not like to be questioned.He used to say, that he
thought nothing more impertinent, than to say to any body: "What do
you think of that?"On his arrival at New York, he went to see General
Gates.After the usual words of salutation, the General said: "I have
always had it in mind, if I ever saw you again, to ask you whether you
were married, as people have said."Paine not answering, the General
went on: "Tell me how it is.""I never," said Paine, "answer impertinent
questions."Seemingly insensible and hard to himself, he was not so to the just
wailings of the unhappy.Without any vehement expression of his sorrow,
you might see him calling up all his powers, walking silently, thinking
of the best means of consoling the unfortunate applicant; and never did
they go from him without some rays of hope.And as his will was firm and
settled, his efforts were always successful.The man hardened in vice
and in courts [of law], yields more easily than one imagines to the
manly entreaties of a disinterested benefactor.* At this point are the words: "Barlow's letter [i. e. to
     Cheetham] we agreed to suppress."Thomas Paine loved his friends with sincere and tender affection.His simplicity of heart and that happy kind of openness, or rather,
carelessness, which charms our hearts in reading the fables of the good
Lafontaine, made him extremely amiable.If little children were near him
he patted them, searched his pockets for the store of cakes, biscuits,
sugarplums, pieces of sugar, of which he used to take possession as of
a treasure belonging to them, and the distribution of which belonged to
him.* His conversation was unaffectedly simple and frank; his language
natural; always abounding in curious anecdotes.He justly and fully
seized the characters of all those of whom he related any singular
traits.For his conversation was satyrick, instructive, full of
witticisms.If he related an anecdote a second time, it was always in
the same words and the same tone, like a comic actor who knows the place
where he is to be applauded.He neither cut the tale short nor told it
too circumstantially.It was real conversation, enlivened by digressions
well brought in.The vivacity of his mind, and the numerous scenes
of which he had been a spectator, or in which he had been an actor,
rendered his narrations the more animated, his conversation more
endearing.Politics were his favorite subject
He never spoke on religious subjects, unless pressed to it, and never
disputed about such matters.He could not speak French: he could
understand it tolerably well when spoken to him, and he understood it
when on paper perfectly well.He never went to the theatre: never spoke
on dramatic subjects.He did
not like it: he said it was not a serious thing, but a sport of the
mind, which often had not common sense.His common reading was the
affairs of the day; not a single newspaper escaped him; not a political
discussion: he knew how to strike while the iron was hot; and, as he
was always on the watch, he was always ready to write.Hence all his
pamphlets have been popular and powerful.He wrote with composure and
steadiness, as if under the guidance of a tutelary genius.If, for an
instant, he stopped, it was always in the attitude of a man who
listens.The Saint Jerome of Raphael would give a perfect idea of his
contemplative recollection, to listen to the voice from on high which
makes itself heard in the heart.[It will be proper, I believe, to say here, that shortly after the Death
of Thomas Paine a book appeared, under the Title of: The Life of Thomas
Paine, by Cheethatn.In this libel my character was calumniated.I cited
the Author before the Criminal Court of New York, He was tried and in
spite of all his manoeuvres, he was found guilty.--M.This last paragraph, in brackets, is in the writing of Madame
Bonneville.Robert Waters, of Jersey City, a biographer
of Cobbett, for the suggestion, made through a friend, and so amply
justified, that information concerning Paine might be derived from the
Cobbett papers.APPENDIX B. THE HALL MANUSCRIPTS

In 1785, John Hall, an able mechanician and admirable man, emigrated
from Leicester, England, to Philadelphia, He carried letters to Paine,
who found him a man after his own heart I am indebted to his relatives,
Dr.Dutton Steele of Philadelphia and the Misses Steele, for Hall's
journals, which extend over many years.It will be seen that the papers
are of historical importance apart from their records concerning Paine.Hall's entries of his daily intercourse with Paine, which he never
dreamed would see the light, represent a portraiture such as has rarely
been secured of any character in history.The extent already reached by
this work compels me to omit much that would impress the reader with the
excellent work of John Hall himself, who largely advanced ironwork in
New Jersey, and whose grave at Flemmington, surrounded by those of the
relatives that followed him, and near the library and workshop he left,
merits a noble monument."I went a day or two past with the Captain and his lady to see the
exhibition of patriotic paintings.Paine the author of Common Sense is
amongst them.He went from England (had been usher to a school) on board
the same vessel that our Captain [Coltman] went in last time; their
acquaintance then commenced and has continued ever since.He resides
now in Bordentown in the Jerseys, and it is probable that I may see him
before it be long as when he comes to town the Captain says he is
sure to call on him.It is supposed the various States have made his
circumstances easy--General Washington, said if they did not provide for
him he would himself.I think his services were as useful as the sword."Pain by his Boy, informing us
of his coming this day.Kerbright

visitors Franklin, Gouverneur Morris, Dr.Rush, Tench Francis, Robert
Morris, Rittenhouse, Redman.A rubber of whist in which Paine won is
mentioned.]Franklin today;

suppose him to be at and no tidings of him.We became very unhappy
fearing his political enemies should have shown him foul play.Went to
bed at 10 o.c, and about 2 o.c.Before 7 o'c a brother saint-maker came with a model of
machine to drive boats against stream.* He had communicated his scheme
to H. who had made alterations and a company had taken it and refused
saint-maker partnership.He would fain have given it to Mr.Paine or me,
but I a stranger refused and Mr.Paine had enough hobbys of his own.Paine pointed out a mode to simplify his apparatus greatly.This saint-maker is John
     Fitch, the "H."This entry is of
     much interest.The first steamer seems
     to have gone begging!Paine asked me to go and see Indian Chiefs of Sennaka
Nation, I gladly assented.Paine wished
to see him and made himself known to him by past remembrance as Common

and shook hands cordially Mr.Colonel Kirkbride is the gentleman in whose
family I am.My patron [Paine] is likewise a boarder and makes his home

elsewhere, for what I see.In this town is a Quaker meeting and one of
another class--I suppose of the Baptist cast--And a person in town a

places, as most necessary, or I suppose advantageous, to himself; for by
one trade or the other he has built himself a very elegant frame house
in this town.This man's way to Heaven is somewhat different to the
other.I am informed he makes publick dippings &c. My Employer has
_Common Sense enough_ to disbelieve most of the Common Systematic
Theories of Divinity but does not seem to establish any for himself.The
Colonel [Kirkbride] is as Free as John Coltman.[Under date of New York, July 31st, Hall writes an account of a journey
with Paine to Morrisania, to visit Gen.Morris, and afterwards to the
farm at New Rochelle, of which he gives particulars already known to my
reader.]Letter of Paine to John Hall, at Capt.Coltman's, in Letitia Court,
Market St, between Front and Second St.Philadelphia:

"Bordentown, Sep.22, 1786.--Old Friend: In the first place I have
settled with Mr.Gordon for the time he has been in the house--in the
second I have put Mrs.Read who, you know has part of our house Col.Kirkbride's but is at this time at Lancaster, in possession by putting
part of her goods into it.* By this means we shall have room at our
house (Col.Kirkbride) for carrying on our operations.As Philadelphia
is so injurious to your health and as apartments at Wm.Foulke's would
not be convenient to you, we can now conveniently make room for you
here.Kirkbride mentioned this to me herself and it is by the
choice of both her and Col.I wish you could
come up to-morrow (Sunday) and bring the iron with you.I shall be
backward and forward between here and Philadelphia pretty often until
the elections are over, but we can make a beginning here and what more
iron we may want we can get at the Delaware Works, and if you should
want to go to Mount hope you can more conveniently go from here than
from Philadelphia--thus you see I have done your business since I
have been up.Henry who is member for

with Col.K. who will very freely give any information in his power.servt"

Undated letter of Paine to John Hall, in Philadelphia:

"Fryday Noon.--Old Friend: Inclosed (as the man said by the horse) I
send you the battau, as I wish to present it as neat and clean as can be
done; I commit it to your care.The sooner it is got on Board the vessel
the better.I shall set off from here on Monday and expect to be in New
York on Tuesday.I shall take all the tools that are here with me and
wish you would take some with you, that if we should get on a working
fit we may have some to work with.Let me hear from you by the Sunday's
boat and send me the name of the vessel and Captain you go with and what
owners they belong to at New York, or what merchants they go to.I wrote
to you by the last boat, and Peter tells me he gave the letter to Capt.Haines, but Joe says that he enquired for letters and was told there was
none--wishing you an agreeable voyage and meeting at New York, I am your
friend, and humble servant.Kirkbride's and Polly's compt."3 (1786) "Dashwood Park, of Captain Roberts: On
Thursday morning early Sept.28th I took the stage wagon for Trenton.Jo
had gone up by water the day before to a sale of land and a very capital
iron works and nailing with a large corn mill.It was a fair sale there
was a forge and rolling and slitting mill upon an extensive scale the
man has failed--The works with about 60 or 70 acres of land were sold
for L9000 currency.Then was put up about 400 acres of land and sold for
L2700 currency and I believe a good bargain; and bought by a friend of
mine called Common Sense--Who I believe had no idea of purchasing it
when he came there.He took Jo to Bordentown with him that night and
they came to look at it the next day; then Jo went into the Jerseys
to find a countryman named Burges but was disappointed Came back to
Bordentown and on Saturday looked all over Mr.Paine's purchase along
with him and believes it bought well worth money.Paine told us an anecdote of a French noble's applying to
Dr.Franklin, as the Americans had put away their King, and that nation
having formerly chosen a King from Normandy, he offered his service and
wished him to lay his letter before Congress.Paine observed that
Britain is the most expensive government in the world.She gives a King
a million a year and falls down and worships him.Last night he brought me in my room a pair of warm cloth
overshoes as feel very comfortable this morning Had a wooden pot stove
stand betwixt my feet by Mr.Paine's desire and found it kept my feet
warm.As soon as breakfast was over mounted Button [Paine's
horse] and set off for Philadelphia.Paine $120 in gold
and silver.Day was devoted to rivetting the bars, and
punching the upper bar for the bannisters [of the bridge].Kirkbride
and Polly went to hear a David Jones preach a rhodomontade sermon about
the Devil, Mary Magdalen, and against deists, etc.This day employed in raising and putting on the abutments
again and fitting them.The smith made the nuts of screws to go easier.Then set the ribs at proper distance, and after dinner I and Jackaway [?
]put on some temporary pieces on the frame of wood to hold it straight,
and when Mr.Pain came they then tied it on its wooden frame with strong
cords.I then saw that it had bulged full on one side and hollow on the
other.I told him of it, and he said it was done by me--I denied that
and words rose high.I at length swore by God that it was straight when
I left it, he replied as positively the contrary, and I think myself ill
used in this affair.We arrived
in town about 5 o.clock took our bags to Capt Coltmans, and then went
down to Dr.Franklin's, and helped unload the bridge.Paine called
on me; gave us an anecdote of Dr.Paine asking him of
the value of any new European publication; he had not been informed of
any of importance.There were some religious posthumous anecdotes of
Doctor Johnson, of resolves he had made and broken though he had prayed
for power and strength to keep them; which showed the Doctor said that
he had not much interest there.And such things had better be suppressed
as nobody had anything to do betwixt God and man.Went with Glentworth to see the Bridge at Dr.Rittenhouse; returned with them
and helped move it for all three to stand upon, and then turned it to
examine.Rittenhouse has no doubt of its strength and sufficiency
for the Schuylkill, but wished to know what quantity of iron [it would
require,] as he seemed to think it too expensive.The Bank bill called but postponed
until tomorrow.Pain's letter read, and leave given to exhibit the
Bridge at the State House to be viewed by the members.Pain, who told me Donnalson had been to see and [stand]
upon his Bridge, and admitted its strength and powers.Then took a walk
beyond Vine street, and passed by the shop where the steamboat apparatus
is.Pain at our house, and talking on the Bank affair brought on a
dispute between Mr.Pain and the Captain [Coltman] in which words were
very high.A reflection from Captain C. on publications in favour of the
Bank having lost them considerable, he [Paine] instantly took that as a
reflection on himself, and swore by G--d, let who would, it was a lie.I then left the room and went up stairs.They quarrelled a considerable
time, but at length parted tolerably coolly.Dinner being ready I went
down; but the Captain continued talking about politics and the Bank, and
what he thought the misconduct of Mr.Pain in his being out and in with
the several parties.Pain in some things
relating thereto, by saying it was good sense in changing his ground
when any party was going wrong,--and that he seemed to delight in
difficulties, in Mechanics particularly, and was pleased in them.The
Captain grew warm, and said he knew now he could not eat his dinner.[Here followed a sharp personal quarrel between Hall and Coltman.]Paine came in and wished me to be assisting in carrying
the model to the State House.Franklin's and fetched the
Bridge to the Committee Room.Our Saint I have assisted in moving to the State House and
there placed in their Committee room, as by a letter addressed to this
Speaker they admitted.And by the desire of my patron (who is not an
early riser) I attended to give any information to inquiries until
he came.And then I was present when the Assembly with their Speaker
inspected it and many other persons as philosophers, Mechanics Statesmen
and even Tailors.I observed their sentiments and opinions of it were as
different as their features.The philosopher said it would add new
light to the great utility.And the tailor (for it is an absolute truth)
remarked it cut a pretty figure.It is yet to be laid (or by the by
stand) before the Council of State.Then the Philosophical Society and
all the other Learned Bodies in this city.And then to be canonised by
an Act of State which is solicited to incorporate a body of men to adopt
and realise or Brobdinag this our Lilliputian handywork, that is now 13
feet long on a Scale of one to 24.And then will be added another to the
world's present Wonders.Pain called in and left me the intended Act of Assembly
for a Bridge Company, who are to subscribe $33,330 50/99 then are to
be put in possession of the present Bridge and premises to answer the
interest of their money until they erect a new one; and after they have
erected a new one, and the money arising from it amounts to more
than pays interest, it is to become a fund to pay off the principal
stockholders, and then the Bridge to become free.Pain called in;
I gave him my Bill--told him I had charged one day's work and a pair of
gloves.Paine's boy called on time to [inquire] of the money
spent.Paine called this evening; told me of his being with Dr.Franklin and about the chess player, or Automaton, and that the Dr.Paine has had several
visitors, as Mr.Logan, &c.

Sunday April 16th Prepared to attend Mr.Paine's horse and chair came, mounted and drove through a barren sandy
country arrived at Bordentown at half past one-o'clock for dinner.This
is the pleasantest situation I have seen in this country.Sitting in the house saw a chair pass down the street
with a red coat on, and going out after it believed it to be Mr.Paine,
so followed him up to Collins's, where he was enquiring where I boarded.I just then called to him, and went with him to Whight's Tavern, and
there he paid me the money I had laid down for him.He is now going
for England by way of France in the French packet which sails the 25th
instant.He asked me to take a ride, and as the stage was not come in
and he going the road I gladly took the opportunity, as I could return
on meeting the stage.On the journey he told me of the Committee's
proceedings on Bridges and Sewers; anecdotes of Dr.Franklin, who had
sent a letter by him to the president, or some person, to communicate to
the Society of Civil Architects, who superintend solely over bridges in
France.The model is packed up to go with him.The Doctor, though full
of employ from the Vice President being ill, and the numerous visitors
on State business, and others that his fame justly procures him,
could hardly be supposed to pay great attention to trifles; but as he
considers Mr.Paine his adopted political Son he would endeavor to
write by him to his friends, though Mr.Paine did not press, for reasons
above.In 2 or 3 days he sent him up to Bordentown no less than a dozen
letters to his acquaintance in France.--He told me many anecdotes of the
Doctor, relating to national and political concerns, and observations of
many aged and sensible men of his acquaintance in that country.And the
treaty that he the Doctor made with the late King of Prussia by adding
an article that, should war ever break out, (though never a probability
of it) Commerce should be left free.The Doctor said he showed it to the
French minister, Vergennes, who said it met his idea, and was such as he
would make even with England, though he knew they would not,--they were
so fond of robbing and plundering.And the Doctor had gathered a hint
from a Du Quesney that no nation could properly expect to gain by
endeavoring to suppress his neighbor, for riches were to be gained from
amongst the rich and not from poor neighbors; and a National reciprocity
was as much necessary as a domestic one, or [inter] national trade as
necessary to be free as amongst the people of a country.Such and many
more hints passed in riding 2 or 3 miles, until we met the stage.I then
shook hands and wished him a good voyage and parted.Letter from Flemmington, N. J., May 16, 1788, to John Coltman,
Leicester, England:

"Friend John: Tell that disbelieving sceptical Infidel thy Father that
he has wounded my honor, What!Bought the Coat at a rag shop--does he
think I would palm such a falsity both upon Gray and Green heads!did
not I send you word it was General Washington's.And does he think I
shall slanderously brook such a slanderous indignity--No!I tell him
the first Ink that meanders from my pen, which shall be instantly on my
setting foot on Brittains Isle, shall be to call him to account.I 'll
haul out his Callous Leaden soul with its brother!"In the late revolution the provincial army lying near Princeton New
Jersey one Sunday General Washington and Common Sense each in their
chairs rode down there to Meeting Common Sense put up his at a friend's
one Mrs.Morgan's and pulling off his great coat put it in the care of
a servant man, and as I remember he was of the pure Irish Extraction;
he walked then to meeting and then slipped off with said great coat and
some plate of Mr.On their return they found what had been done
in their absence and relating it to the General his answer was it was
necessary to watch as well as pray--but told him he had two and would
lend or give him one--and that is the Coat I sent and the fact as
related to me and others in public by said [Common Sense.]Nor do I
believe that Rome or the whole Romish Church has a better attested
miracle in her whole Catalogue than the above--though I dont wish to
deem it a miracle, nor do I believe there is any miracle upon record for
these 18 hundred years so true as that being General Washington's great
coat.--I, labouring hard for said Common Sense at Bordentown, the said
coat was hung up to keep snow out of the room.I often told him I should
expect that for my pains, but he never would say I should; but having
a chest there I took care and locked it up when I had finished my work,
and sent it to you.So far are these historical facts--Maybe sometime
hence I may collect dates and periods to them--But why should they be
disputed?has not the world adopted as true a-many affairs without date
and of less moment than this, and even pay what is called a holy regard
to them?"If you communicate this to your Father and he feels a compunction for
the above crime and will signify the same by letter, he will find I
strictly adhere to the precepts of Christianity and shall forgive.--If
not------

"My best wishes to you all,

"John Hall."John
Coltman's, Shambles Lane, Leicester, England.""My old Friend: I am very happy to see a letter from you, and to hear
that our Friends on the other side the water are well.The Bridge has
been put up, but being on wood butments they yielded, and it is now
taken down.The first rib as an experiment was erected between two steel
furnaces which supported it firmly; it contained not quite three tons of
iron, was ninety feet span, height of the arch five feet; it was loaded
with six tons of iron, which remained upon it a twelve month.At present
I am engaged on my political Bridge.I shall bring out a new work
(Second part of the Rights of Man) soon after New Year.It will produce
something one way or other.I see the tide is yet the wrong way, but
there is a change of sentiment beginning.I have so far got the ear of
John Bull that he will read what I write--which is more than ever was
done before to the same extent.Rights of Man has had the greatest
run of anything ever published in this country, at least of late
years--almost sixteen thousand has gone off--and in Ireland above forty
thousand--besides the above numbers one thousand printed cheap are now
gone to Scotland by desire from some of the [friends] there.I have been
applied to from Birmingham for leave to print ten thousand copies, but
I intend, after the next work has had its run among those who will have
handsome printed books and fine paper, to print an hundred thousand
copies of each work and distribute them at sixpence a-piece; but this I
do not at present talk of, because it will alarm the wise mad folks at
St.Jefferson who mentioned
the great run it has had there.It has been attacked by John Adams, who
has brought an host about his ears from all parts of the Continent.Jefferson has sent me twenty five different answers to Adams who wrote
under the signature of Publicola.A letter is somewhere in the city for
me from Mr.I hope to receive it in a few days.I shall be glad at all times to see, or hear from you.Write to me
(under cover) to Gordon, Booksellers N: 166 Fleet Street, before
you leave Leicester.How far is it from thence to Rotherham?"P. S. I have done you the compliment of answering your favor the inst.it which is more than I have done by any other--were I to ans.all the letters I receive--I should require half a dozen clerks."Extracts from John Hall's letters from London, England: London, January
1792 Burke's publication has produced one way or other near 50 different
answers and publications.Nothing of late ever has been so read as
Paine's answer.Sometime shortly he will publish a second part of the
Rights of Man.His first part was scrutinized by the Privy Council
held on purpose and through fear of making him more popular deemed too
contemptible for Government notice.The sale of it for a day or two was
rather retarded or not publickly disposed of until it was known by the
printers that it would not be noticed by Government.John Hall to a friend in England:

"London, Nov.I dined yesterday with the Revolution Society at
the London Tavern.A very large company assembled and after dinner
many truly noble and patriotic toasts were drank.The most prominent
were--The Rights of Man--with 3 times &c.--The Revolution of France--The
Revolution of the World--May all the armies of tyrants learn the
Brunswick March--May the tree of Liberty be planted in every tyrant
city, and may it be an evergreen.The utmost unanimity prevailed through
the company, and several very excellent songs in favor of Liberty
were sung.Every bosom felt the divine glow of patriotism and love
of universal freedom.For my part I was
transported at the scene.It happened that a company of Aristocratic
french and Spanish merchants were met in the very room under, and
Horne Tooke got up and sarcastically requested the company not to wound
the tender feelings of the gentlemen by too much festivity.This sarcasm
was followed by such a burst of applause as I never before heard."From J. Redman, London, Tuesday Dec.18, 5 p. m. to John Hall,
Leicester, England: "Mr.Erskine
shone like the morning-Star.The instant Erskine
closed his speech the venal jury interrupted the Attorney General, who
was about to make a reply, and without waiting for any answer, or any
summing up by the Judge, pronounced him guilty.Such an instance of
infernal corruption is scarcely upon record.I have not time to express
my indignant feelings on this occasion.At this moment, while I write,
the mob is drawing Erskine's carriage home, he riding in triumph--his
horses led by another party.Riots at Cambridge, Manchester, Bridport
Dorset &c.&c. O England, how art thou fallen!I am just now told that
press warrants are issued today.[John Hall's London Journal (1792) records frequent meetings there with
Paine.Paine going to dress on an invitation to dine
with the Athenians.He leaves town for a few days to see his aunt."Paine goes out of town tomorrow to compose what I call
Burke's Funeral Sermon."Paine looking well and in high
spirits."Does not seem to
talk much, rather on a reserve, of the prospect of political affairs.He had a letter from G. Washington and Jefferson by the ambassador
[Pinckney]."The majority of entries merely mention meeting Paine, whose
name, by the way, after the prosecution was instituted, Hall prudently
writes "P------n."He also tells the story of Burke's pension.]Had a ride to Bordentown to see Mr.He was well and appeared jollyer than I had ever known him.He is full of whims and schemes and mechanical inventions, and is to
build a place or shop to carry them into execution, and wants my help."APPENDIX C. PORTRAITS OF PAINE

At the age of thirty Paine was somewhat stout, and very athletic; but
after his arrival in America (1774) he was rather slender.His height
was five feet, nine inches.He had a prominent nose, somewhat like that
of Ralph Waldo Emerson.It may have impressed Bonaparte, who insisted,
it is said, that a marshal must have a large nose.Paine's mouth was
delicate, his chin also; he wore no whiskers or beard until too feeble
with age to shave.His forehead was lofty and unfurrowed; his head
long, the occiput feeble.His complexion was ruddy,--thoroughly English.Charles Lee, during the American revolution, described him as "the man
who has genius in his eyes;" Carlyle quotes from Foster an observation
on the brilliancy of Paine's eyes, as he sat in the French Convention.His figure, as given in an early French portrait, is shapely; its
elegance was often remarked.A year or so after his return to America he
is shown in a contemporary picture as somewhat stout again, if one may
judge by the face.This was probably a result of insufficient exercise,
on which he much depended.He was an expert horseman, and, in health, an
unwearied walker.He loved music, and could join well in a chorus.There are eleven original portraits of Thomas Paine, besides a
death-mask, a bust, and the profile copied in this work from a seal used
on the release at Lewes, elsewhere cited (i., p.That gives some
idea of the head and face at the age of thirty-five.I have a picture
said to be that of Paine in his youth, but the dress is an anachronism.The earliest portrait of Paine was painted by Charles Willson Peale, in
Philadelphia, probably in some early year of the American Revolution,
for Thomas Brand Hollis, of London,--the benefactor of Harvard
University, one of whose halls bears his name.The same artist painted
another portrait of Paine, now badly placed in Independence Hall.There
must have been an early engraving from one of Peale's pictures, for John
Hall writes October 31, 1786: "A print of Common Sense, if any of my
friends want one, may be had by sending to the printshops in London,
but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."* The Hollis
portrait was engraved in London, 1791, underlined "by Peel [sic] of
Philadelphia," and published, July 25th, by J. Ridgway, York Street, St.Paine holds an open book bearing the words, "Rights of
Man," where Peale probably had "Common Sense."On a table with inkstand
and pens rests Paine's right elbow, the hand supporting his chin.The
full face appears--young, handsome, gay; the wig is frizzed, a bit of
the queue visible.In all of the original portraits of Paine his dress
is neat and in accordance with fashion, but in this Hollis picture it
is rather fine: the loose sleeves are ornamentally corded, and large
wristbands of white lace fall on the cuffs.The only engraving I have found with
     "Toia" was published in London in 1800.Can there be a
     portrait lost under some other name?While Paine and Jefferson were together in Paris (1787) Paine wrote him
a note, August 18th, in which he says: "The second part of your letter,
concerning taking my picture, I must feel as an honor done to me, not
as a favor asked of me--but in this, as in other matters, I am at the
disposal of your friendship."As Jefferson does not appear to have
possessed such a portrait, the request was probably made through him.I
incline to identify this portrait with an extremely interesting one, now
in this country, by an unknown artist.It is one of twelve symmetrical
portraits of revolutionary leaders,--the others being Marat,
Robespierre, Lafayette, Mirabeau, Danton, Brissot, Petion, Camille
Desmoulins, Billaud de Varennes, Gensonne, Clermont Tonnere.These
pictures were reproduced in cheap woodcuts and distributed about France
during the Revolution.Lowry, of
South Carolina, and brought to Charleston during the Revolution.At
the beginning of the civil war they were buried in leaden cases at
Williamstown, South Carolina.At the end of the war they were conveyed
to Charleston, where they remained, in the possession of a Mrs.Cole,
until purchased by their present owner, Mr.Alfred Ames Howlett, of
Syracuse, New York.As Mirabeau is included, the series must have been
begun at an early phase of the revolutionary agitation.The face of
Paine here strongly resembles that in Independence Hall.The picture
is about two feet high; the whole figure is given, and is dressed in an
elegant statesmanlike fashion, with fine cravat and silk stockings from
the knee.The table and room indicate official position, but it is the
same room as in nine of the other portraits.It is to be hoped that
further light may be obtained concerning these portraits.Well-dressed also, but notably unlike the preceding, is the "Bonneville
Paine," one of a celebrated series of two hundred engraved portraits,
the publication of which in quarto volumes was begun in Paris in
1796.et sculpsit" is its whole history.Paine is
described in it as "Ex Depute a la Convention Nationale," which would
mean strictly some time between his expulsion from that assembly
in December, 1793, and his recall to it a year later.It could not,
however, have been then taken, on account of Paine's imprisonment and
illness.It was probably made by F. Bonneville when Paine had gone to
reside with Nicolas Bonneville in the spring of 1797.It is an admirable
picture in every way, but especially in bringing out the large and
expressive eyes.The hair is here free and flowing; the dress identical
with that of the portrait by Jarvis in this work.The best-known picture of Paine is that painted by his friend George
Romney, in 1792.I have inquired through London _Notes and Queries_
after the original, which long ago disappeared, and a claimant turned up
in Birmingham, England; but in this the hand holds a book, and Sharp's
engraving shows no hand.The large engraving by W. Sharp was published April 20, 1793, and the
smaller in 1794.A reproduction by Illman were a fit frontispiece for
Cheetham (what satirical things names are sometimes), but ought not
to have got into Gilbert Vale's popular biography of Paine.That and
a reproduction by Wright in the Mendum edition of Paine's works, have
spread through this country something little better than a caricature;
and one Sweden has subjected Truelove's edition, in England, to a
like misfortune.Paine's friends, Rickman, Constable, and others, were
satisfied by the Romney picture, and I have seen in G. J. Holyoake's
library a proof of the large engraving, with an inscription on the back
by Paine, who presented it to Rickman.It is the English Paine, in all
his vigor, and in the thick of his conflict with Burke, but, noble as
it is, has not the gentler and more poetic expression which Bonneville
found in the liberated prisoner surrounded by affectionate friends.Romney and Sharp were both well acquainted with Paine.A picturesque Paine is one engraved for Baxter's "History of England,"
and published by Symonds, July 2, 1796.Dressed with great elegance,
Paine stands pointing to a scroll in his left hand, inscribed "Rights
of Man."Above his head, on a frame design, a pen lies on a roll marked
"Equality."The face is handsome and the likeness good

A miniature by H. Richards is known to me only as engraved by K.
Mackenzie, and published March 31, 1800, by G. Gawthorne, British
Library, Strand, London.It is the only portrait that has beneath it
"Tom Paine."It represents Paine as rather stout, and the face broad.It is powerful, but the least pleasing of the portraits.The picture in
Vale resembles this more than the Romney it professes to copy.I have in my possession a wood engraving of Paine, which gives no trace
of its source or period.It is a vigorous profile, which might have
been made in London during the excitement over the "Rights of Man," for
popular distribution.It has no wig, and shows the head extraordinarily
long, and without much occiput It is pre-eminently the English radical
leader.Before speaking of Jarvis' great portrait of Paine, I mention a later
one by him which Mr.William Erving, of New York, has added to my
collection.It would appear to have been circulated at the time of his
death.The lettering beneath, following a facsimile autograph, is: "J.
W. Jarvis, pinx.J- R. Ames, del.--L'Homme des Deux Mondes.Born
at Thetford, England, Jan.Died at Greenwich, New
York, June 8, 1809."Above the cheap wood-cut is: "A tribute to Paine."On the right, at the top, is a globe, showing the outlines of the
Americas, France, England, and Africa.It is supported by the wing of a
dove with large olive-branch.On the left upper corner is an open book
inscribed: "Rights of Man.Crisis": supported by a scroll
with "Doing justice, loving mercy.From this book rays
break out and illumine the globe opposite.A lower corner shows the
balances, and the liberty-cap on a pole, the left being occupied by the
United States flag and that of France.Beneath are the broken chain,
crown, sword, and other emblems of oppression.A frame rises showing a
plumb line, at the top of which the key of the Bastille is crossed by
a pen, on Paine's breast.The portrait is surrounded by a "Freedom's
Wreath" in which are traceable the floral emblems of all nations.The
wreath is bound with a fascia, on which appear, by twos, the following
names: "Washington, Monroe; Jefferson, Franklin; J. Stewart, E. Palmer;
Barlow, Rush; M. Wollstone-craft, M. B. Bonneville; Clio Rickman, J.
Home Tooke; Lafayette, Brissot."The portrait of Paine represents him with an unusually full face,
as compared with earlier pictures, and a most noble and benevolent
expression.The white cravat and dress are elegant.What has become of
the original of this second picture by the elder Jarvis?It might easily
have fallen to some person who might not recognize it as meant for
Paine, though to one who has studied his countenance it conveys the
impression of what he probably would have been at sixty-eight.About two
years later a drawing was made of Paine by William Constable, which I
saw at the house of his nephew, Dr.Clair J. Grece, Redhill, England.It
reveals the ravages of age, but conveys a vivid impression of the man's
power.After Paine's death Jarvis took a cast of his face.Laurence
Hutton has had for many years this death-mask which was formerly in the
establishment of Fowler and Wells, the phrenologists, and probably used
by George Combe in his lectures.This mask has not the large nose of the
bust; but that is known to have been added afterwards.The bust is in
the New York Historical Society's rooms.In an article on Paine in the
_Atlantic Monthly_ (1856) it was stated that this bust had to be hidden
by the Historical Society to prevent its injury by haters of Paine.Robertson, of London, in his "Thomas Paine, an
Investigation."Kelby, of that Society, that the
statement is unfounded.The Society has not room to exhibit its entire
collection, and the bust of Paine was for some time out of sight, but
from no such reason as that stated, still less from any prejudice.The
face is that of Paine in extreme dilapidation, and would be a dismal
misrepresentation if shown in a public place.Before me are examples of all the portraits I have mentioned (except
that in Birmingham), and I have observed contemporary representations of
Paine in caricatures or in apotheosis of fly-leaves.Comparative studies
convince me that the truest portrait of Paine is that painted by John
Wesley Jarvis in 1803, and now in possession of Mr.J. H. Johnston, of
New York.The picture from which our frontispiece is taken appeared to
be a replica, of somewhat later date, the colors being fresher, but an
inscription on the back says "Charles W. Jarvis, pinxit, July, 1857."From this perfect duplicate Clark Mills made his portrait-bust of Paine
now in the National Museum at Washington, but it has not hitherto been
engraved.Alas, that no art can send out to the world what colors only
can convey,--the sensibility, the candor, the spirituality, transfusing
the strong features of Thomas Paine.As I have sat at my long task, now
drawn to a close, the face there on the wall has seemed to be alive, now
flushed with hope, now shadowed with care, the eyes greeting me daily,
the firm mouth assigning some password--Truth, Justice.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Life Of Thomas Paine, Vol.Lady Wallinger had once wished to have seen the Castle, and
Coningsby was only too happy in the prospect of escorting her and Edith
over the place; but Oswald had then at once put his veto on the project,
as a thing forbidden; and which, if put in practice, his father would
never pardon.So it passed off, and now Oswald himself was at the gates
of that very domain with his friend who was about to enter them, his
friend whom he might never see again; that Coningsby who, from their
boyish days, had been the idol of his life; whom he had lived to see
appeal to his affections and his sympathy, and whom Oswald was now going
to desert in the midst of his lonely and unsolaced woe.'I ought not to enter here,' said Oswald, holding the hand of Coningsby
as he hesitated to advance; 'and yet there are duties more sacred even
than obedience to a father.I cannot leave you thus, friend of my best
heart!'The morning passed away in unceasing yet fruitless speculation on the
future.One moment something was to happen, the next nothing could
occur.Sometimes a beam of hope flashed over the fancy of Coningsby,
and jumping up from the turf, on which they were reclining, he seemed
to exult in his renovated energies; and then this sanguine paroxysm was
succeeded by a fit of depression so dark and dejected that nothing but
the presence of Oswald seemed to prevent Coningsby from flinging himself
into the waters of the Darl.The day was fast declining, and the inevitable moment of separation was
at hand.Oswald wished to appear at the dinner-table of Hellingsley,
that no suspicion might arise in the mind of his father of his having
accompanied Coningsby home.But just as he was beginning to mention the
necessity of his departure, a flash of lightning seemed to transfix the
heavens.The sky was very dark; though studded here and there with dingy
spots.The young men sprang up at the same time.'We had better get out of these trees,' said Oswald.'We had better get to the Castle,' said Coningsby.A clap of thunder that seemed to make the park quake broke over their
heads, followed by some thick drops.The Castle was close at hand;
Oswald had avoided entering it; but the impending storm was so menacing
that, hurried on by Coningsby, he could make no resistance; and, in a
few minutes, the companions were watching the tempest from the windows
of a room in Coningsby Castle.The fork-lightning flashed and scintillated from every quarter of the
horizon: the thunder broke over the Castle, as if the keep were rocking
with artillery: amid the momentary pauses of the explosion, the rain was
heard descending like dissolving water-spouts.Nor was this one of those transient tempests that often agitate
the summer.Time advanced, and its fierceness was little mitigated.Sometimes there was a lull, though the violence of the rain never
appeared to diminish; but then, as in some pitched fight between
contending hosts, when the fervour of the field seems for a moment to
allay, fresh squadrons arrive and renew the hottest strife, so a low
moaning wind that was now at intervals faintly heard bore up a great
reserve of electric vapour, that formed, as it were, into field in
the space between the Castle and Hellingsley, and then discharged its
violence on that fated district.'You must not think of going home
at present, my dear fellow,' said the first.'I am sure your father
would not be displeased.There is not a being here who even knows you,
and if they did, what then?'The servant entered the room, and inquired whether the gentlemen were
ready for dinner.'By all means; come, my dear Millbank, I feel reckless as the tempest;
let us drown our cares in wine!'Coningsby, in fact, was exhausted by all the agitation of the day, and
all the harassing spectres of the future.He found wine a momentary
solace.He ordered the servants away, and for a moment felt a degree of
wild satisfaction in the company of the brother of Edith.Thus they sat for a long time, talking only of one subject, and
repeating almost the same things, yet both felt happier in being
together.Oswald had risen, and opening the window, examined the
approaching night.The storm had lulled, though the rain still fell; in
the west was a streak of light.In a quarter of an hour, he calculated
on departing.As he was watching the wind he thought he heard the sound
of wheels, which reminded him of Coningsby's promise to lend him a light
carriage for his return.They sat down once more; they had filled their glasses for the last
time; to pledge to their faithful friendship, and the happiness of
Coningsby and Edith; when the door of the room opened, and there
appeared, MR.CHAPTER I.


It was the heart of the London season, nearly four years ago, twelve
months having almost elapsed since the occurrence of those painful
passages at Hellingsley which closed the last book of this history, and
long lines of carriages an hour before midnight, up the classic mount of
St.James and along Piccadilly, intimated that the world were received
at some grand entertainment in Arlington Street.It was the town mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at
Beaumanoir we have more than once introduced the reader, to gain whose
courtyard was at this moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to
enter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their
lords and ladies.Among the fortunate who had already succeeded in bowing to their hostess
were two gentlemen, who, ensconced in a good position, surveyed the
scene, and made their observations on the passing guests.They
were gentlemen who, to judge from their general air and the great
consideration with which they were treated by those who were
occasionally in their vicinity, were personages whose criticism bore
authority.'I say, Jemmy,' said the eldest, a dandy who had dined with the Regent,
but who was still a dandy, and who enjoyed life almost as much as in the
days when Carlton House occupied the terrace which still bears its name.'I say, Jemmy, what a load of young fellows there are!Begin to think fellows are younger than they used to be.At this moment an individual who came under the fortunate designation
of a young fellow, but whose assured carriage hardly intimated that
this was his first season in London, came up to the junior of the two
critics, and said, 'A pretty turn you played us yesterday at White's,
Melton.'My dear fellow, I am infinitely sorry; but I was obliged to go down to
Windsor, and I missed the return train.'A capital party, only you were wanted.We had Beaumanoir and Vere, and
Jack Tufton and Spraggs.'He told us a story about the
little Biron who was over here last year; I knew her at Paris; and an
Indian screen.Melton's companion, as the young man
moved away.A young fellow now of two or three and twenty
knows the world as men used to do after as many years of scrapes.I
wonder where there is such a thing as a greenhorn.Effie Crabbs says
the reason he gives up his house is, that he has cleaned out the old
generation, and that the new generation would clean him.''Buckhurst is not in that sort of way: he swears by Henry Sydney, a
younger son of the Duke, whom you don't know; and young Coningsby; a
sort of new set; new ideas and all that sort of thing.Beau tells me
a good deal about it; and when I was staying with the Everinghams,
at Easter, they were full of it.Coningsby had just returned from his
travels, and they were quite on the _qui vive_.Lady Everingham is one
of their set.I don't know what it is exactly; but I think we shall hear
more of it.''A sort of animal magnetism, or unknown tongues, I take it from your
description,' said his companion.'Well, I don't know what it is,' said Mr.Melton; 'but it has got hold
of all the young fellows who have just come out.Beau is a little bit
himself.I had some idea of giving my mind to it, they made such a fuss
about it at Everingham; but it requires a devilish deal of history, I
believe, and all that sort of thing.''It is difficult to turn to
with a new thing when you are not in the habit of it.'They told me you had the gout,
Cassilis?''So I had; but I have found out a fellow who cures the gout instanter.Pumicestone pills; sort
of a charm, I believe, and all that kind of thing: they say it rubs the
gout out of you.I sent him to Luxborough, who was very bad; cured him
directly.'Luxborough believes in the Millennium,' said Mr.'But here's a new thing that Melton has been telling me of, that all the
world is going to believe in,' said Mr.Cassilis,'something patronised
by Lady Everingham.''A very good patroness,' said Mr.'Young
Coningsby brought it from abroad; didn't you you say so, Jemmy?''No, no, my dear fellow; it is not at all that sort of thing.''But they say it requires a deuced deal of history,' continued Mr.'One must brush up one's Goldsmith.Canterton used to be the
fellow for history at White's.He was always boring one with William the
Conqueror, Julius Caesar, and all that sort of thing.'Ormsby, looking both sly and solemn, 'I
should not be surprised if, some day or another, we have a history about
Lady Everingham and young Coningsby.'Melton; 'he is engaged to be married to her sister, Lady
Theresa.'Ormsby; 'well, you are a friend of the family, and
I suppose you know.''He is a devilish good-looking fellow, that young Coningsby,' said Mr.'All the women are in love with him, they say.Lady Eleanor
Ducie quite raves about him.''By-the-bye, his grandfather has been very unwell,' said Mr.'I saw Lady Monmouth here just now,' said Mr.'Got an odd story at White's that Lord Monmouth was going to separate
from her,' said Mr.'They are not going to separate, I believe,' said Mr.Melton; 'but I
rather think there was a foundation for the rumour.'Melton, 'all I know is, that it was looked upon
last winter at Paris as a settled thing.''There was some story about some Hungarian,' said Mr.'No, that blew over,' said Mr.Melton; 'it was Trautsmansdorff the row
was about.'Ormsby, as the friend of Lord and Lady Monmouth,
remained shaking his head; but as a member of society, and therefore
delighting in small scandal, appropriating the gossip with the greatest
avidity.'I should think old Monmouth was not the sort of fellow to blow up a
woman,' said Mr.'Provided she would leave him quietly,' said Mr.'Yes, Lord Monmouth never could live with a woman more than two years,'
said Mr.'And that I thought at the time rather an
objection to his marriage.'We must now briefly revert to what befell our hero after those unhappy
occurrences in the midst of whose first woe we left him.Rigby at the Castle, Coningsby quitted
it for London, and before a week had elapsed had embarked for Cadiz.He
felt a romantic interest in visiting the land to which Edith owed some
blood, and in acquiring the language which he had often admired as she
spoke it.A favourable opportunity permitted him in the autumn to visit
Athens and the AEgean, which he much desired.In the pensive beauties
of that delicate land, where perpetual autumn seems to reign, Coningsby
found solace.There is something in the character of Grecian scenery
which blends with the humour of the melancholy and the feelings of
the sorrowful.The wish of his
grandfather had rendered it necessary for him to return to England
somewhat abruptly.Lord Monmouth had not visited his native country
since his marriage; but the period that had elapsed since that event had
considerably improved the prospects of his party.The majority of the
Whig Cabinet in the House of Commons by 1840 had become little more than
nominal; and though it was circulated among their friends, as if from
the highest authority, that 'one was enough,' there seemed daily a
better chance of their being deprived even of that magical unit.For the
first time in the history of this country since the introduction of the
system of parliamentary sovereignty, the Government of England depended
on the fate of single elections; and indeed, by a single vote, it is
remarkable to observe, the fate of the Whig Government was ultimately
decided.This critical state of affairs, duly reported to Lord Monmouth, revived
his political passions, and offered him that excitement which he was
ever seeking, and yet for which he had often sighed.The Marquess, too,
was weary of Paris.Every day he found it more difficult to be amused.He, from whom nothing could be concealed,
perceived that often, while she elaborately attempted to divert him, her
mind was wandering elsewhere.Lord Monmouth was quite superior to all
petty jealousy and the vulgar feelings of inferior mortals, but his
sublime selfishness required devotion.He had calculated that a wife
or a mistress who might be in love with another man, however powerfully
their interests might prompt them, could not be so agreeable or amusing
to their friends and husbands as if they had no such distracting hold
upon their hearts or their fancy.Latterly at Paris, while Lucretia
became each day more involved in the vortex of society, where all
admired and some adored her, Lord Monmouth fell into the easy habit of
dining in his private rooms, sometimes tete-a-tete with Villebecque,
whose inexhaustible tales and adventures about a kind of society which
Lord Monmouth had always preferred infinitely to the polished and
somewhat insipid circles in which he was born, had rendered him the
prime favourite of his great patron.Sometimes Villebecque, too, brought
a friend, male or otherwise, whom he thought invested with the rare
faculty of distraction: Lord Monmouth cared not who or what they were,
provided they were diverting.Villebecque had written to Coningsby at Rome, by his grandfather's
desire, to beg him to return to England and meet Lord Monmouth there.The letter was couched with all the respect and good feeling which
Villebecque really entertained for him whom he addressed; still a letter
on such a subject from such a person was not agreeable to Coningsby, and
his reply to it was direct to his grandfather; Lord Monmouth, however,
had entirely given over writing letters.Coningsby had met at Paris, on his way to England, Lord and Lady
Everingham, and he had returned with them.This revival of an old
acquaintance was both agreeable and fortunate for our hero.The vivacity
of a clever and charming woman pleasantly disturbed the brooding memory
of Coningsby.There is no mortification however keen, no misery however
desperate, which the spirit of woman cannot in some degree lighten or
alleviate.About, too, to make his formal entrance into the great
world, he could not have secured a more valuable and accomplished
female friend.She gave him every instruction, every intimation that
was necessary; cleared the social difficulties which in some degree are
experienced on their entrance into the world even by the most highly
connected, unless they have this benign assistance; planted him
immediately in the position which was expedient; took care that he was
invited at once to the right houses; and, with the aid of her husband,
that he should become a member of the right clubs.'And who is to have the blue ribbon, Lord Eskdale?'said the Duchess to
that nobleman, as he entered and approached to pay his respects.'If I were Melbourne, I would keep it open,' replied his Lordship.'It
is a mistake to give away too quickly.''But suppose they go out,' said her Grace.there is always a last day to clear the House.The cliff will not be sapped before then.We made a
mistake last year about the ladies.''Quarrels about women are always a mistake.One should make it a rule to
give up to them, and then they are sure to give up to us.''You have no great faith in our firmness?''Male firmness is very often obstinacy: women have always something
better, worth all qualities; they have tact.''A compliment to the sex from so finished a critic as Lord Eskdale is
appreciated.'But at this moment the arrival of some guests terminated the
conversation, and Lord Eskdale moved away, and approached a group which
Lady Everingham was enlightening.'My dear Lord Fitz-booby,' her Ladyship observed, 'in politics we
require faith as well as in all other things.'Lord Fitz-booby looked rather perplexed; but, possessed of considerable
official experience, having held high posts, some in the cabinet, for
nearly a quarter of a century, he was too versed to acknowledge that he
had not understood a single word that had been addressed to him for the
last ten minutes.He looked on with the same grave, attentive stolidity,
occasionally nodding his head, as he was wont of yore when he received
a deputation on sugar duties or joint-stock banks, and when he made,
as was his custom when particularly perplexed, an occasional note on a
sheet of foolscap paper.'An Opposition in an age of revolution,' continued Lady Everingham,
'must be founded on principles.It cannot depend on mere personal
ability and party address taking advantage of circumstances.You have
not enunciated a principle for the last ten years; and when you seemed
on the point of acceding to power, it was not on a great question of
national interest, but a technical dispute respecting the constitution
of an exhausted sugar colony.''If you are a Conservative party, we wish to know what you want to
conserve,' said Lord Vere.'If it had not been for the Whig abolition of slavery,' said Lord
Fitz-booby, goaded into repartee, 'Jamaica would not have been an
exhausted sugar colony.''Then what you do want to conserve is slavery?''No,' said Lord Fitz-booby, 'I am never for retracing our steps.''But will you advance, will you move?And where will you advance, and
how will you move?''I think we have had quite enough of advancing,' said his Lordship.'I
had no idea your Ladyship was a member of the Movement party,' he added,
with a sarcastic grin.'But if it were bad, Lord Fitz-booby, to move where we are, as you
and your friends have always maintained, how can you reconcile it to
principle to remain there?''I would make the best of a bad bargain,' said Lord Fitz-booby.'With
a Conservative government, a reformed Constitution would be less
dangerous.''What are your distinctive principles that
render the peril less?''I appeal to Lord Eskdale,' said Lord Fitz-booby; 'there is Lady
Everingham turned quite a Radical, I declare.Is not your Lordship of
opinion that the country must be safer with a Conservative government
than with a Liberal?''I think the country is always tolerably secure,' said Lord Eskdale.Lady Theresa, leaning on the arm of Mr.Lyle, came up at this moment,
and unconsciously made a diversion in favour of Lord Fitz-booby.'Pray, Theresa,' said Lady Everingham, 'where is Mr.It so happened that on this day Coningsby
and Henry Sydney dined at Grillion's, at an university club, where,
among many friends whom Coningsby had not met for a long time, and among
delightful reminiscences, the unconscious hours stole on.It was late
when they quitted Grillion's, and Coningsby's brougham was detained for
a considerable time before its driver could insinuate himself into the
line, which indeed he would never have succeeded in doing had not he
fortunately come across the coachman of the Duke of Agincourt, who being
of the same politics as himself, belonging to the same club, and always
black-balling the same men, let him in from a legitimate party feeling;
so they arrived in Arlington Street at a very late hour.Coningsby was springing up the staircase, now not so crowded as it had
been, and met a retiring party; he was about to say a passing word to a
gentleman as he went by, when, suddenly, Coningsby turned deadly pale.The gentleman could hardly be the cause, for it was the gracious and
handsome presence of Lord Beaumanoir: the lady resting on his arm was
Edith.They moved on while he was motionless; yet Edith and himself
had exchanged glances.His was one of astonishment; but what was the
expression of hers?She must have recognised him before he had observed
her.She was collected, and she expressed the purpose of her mind in
a distant and haughty recognition.Coningsby remained for a moment
stupefied; then suddenly turning back, he bounded downstairs and hurried
into the cloak-room.He met Lady Wallinger; he spoke rapidly, he held
her hand, did not listen to her answers, his eyes wandered about.There
were many persons present, at length he recognised Edith enveloped in
her mantle.He went forward, he looked at her, as if he would have read
her soul; he said something.She changed colour as he addressed her,
but seemed instantly by an effort to rally and regain her equanimity;
replied to his inquiries with extreme brevity, and Lady Wallinger's
carriage being announced, moved away with the same slight haughty salute
as before, on the arm of Lord Beaumanoir.Sadness fell over the once happy family of Millbank after the departure
of Coningsby from Hellingsley.When the first pang was over, Edith
had found some solace in the sympathy of her aunt, who had always
appreciated and admired Coningsby; but it was a sympathy which aspired
only to soften sorrow, and not to create hope.But Lady Wallinger,
though she lengthened her visit for the sake of her niece, in time
quitted them; and then the name of Coningsby was never heard by Edith.Her brother, shortly after the sorrowful and abrupt departure of his
friend, had gone to the factories, where he remained, and of which, in
future, it was intended that he should assume the principal direction.Millbank himself, sustained at first by the society of his friend
Sir Joseph, to whom he was attached, and occupied with daily reports
from his establishment and the transaction of the affairs with his
numerous and busy constituents, was for a while scarcely conscious of
the alteration which had taken place in the demeanour of his daughter.But when they were once more alone together, it was impossible any
longer to be blind to the great change.That happy and equable gaiety of
spirit, which seemed to spring from an innocent enjoyment of existence,
and which had ever distinguished Edith, was wanting.She was not indeed always moody and dispirited, but she was
fitful, unequal in her tone.That temper whose sweetness had been a
domestic proverb had become a little uncertain.Not that her affection
for her father was diminished, but there were snatches of unusual
irritability which momentarily escaped her, followed by bursts of
tenderness that were the creatures of compunction.And often, after some
hasty word, she would throw her arms round her father's neck with the
fondness of remorse.She pursued her usual avocations, for she had
really too well-regulated a mind, she was in truth a person of
too strong an intellect, to neglect any source of occupation and
distraction.Her flowers, her pencil, and her books supplied her with
these; and music soothed, and at times beguiled, her agitated thoughts.But there was no joy in the house, and in time Mr.Millbank was vexed, irritated, grieved.Edith, his Edith, the pride
and delight of his existence, who had been to him only a source of
exultation and felicity, was no longer happy, was perhaps pining away;
and there was the appearance, the unjust appearance that he, her fond
father, was the cause and occasion of all this wretchedness.It would
appear that the name of Coningsby, to which he now owed a great debt of
gratitude, was still doomed to bear him mortification and misery.Truly
had the young man said that there was a curse upon their two families.And yet, on reflection, it still seemed to Mr.Millbank that he had
acted with as much wisdom and real kindness as decision.The union was impossible; the speedier their
separation, therefore, clearly the better.Unfortunate, indeed, had been
his absence from Hellingsley; unquestionably his presence might have
prevented the catastrophe.Millbank could not shut his eyes to the devotion of his son to
Coningsby.He felt he could count on no assistance in this respect from
that quarter.Yet how hard upon him that he should seem to figure as
a despot or a tyrant to his own children, whom he loved, when he had
absolutely acted in an inevitable manner!Edith seemed sad, Oswald
sullen; all was changed.All the objects for which this clear-headed,
strong-minded, kind-hearted man had been working all his life, seemed
to be frustrated.Because a young man had made love to his
daughter, who was really in no manner entitled to do so.Millbank found Hellingsley, under existing
circumstances, extremely wearisome; and he proposed to his daughter that
they should pay a visit to their earlier home.Edith assented without
difficulty, but without interest.Millbank immediately
perceived, the change was a judicious one; for certainly the spirits
of Edith seemed to improve after her return to their valley.There were
more objects of interest: change, too, is always beneficial.Millbank had been aware that Oswald had received a letter from
Coningsby, written before he quitted Spain, perhaps he might have
recognised a more satisfactory reason for the transient liveliness of
his daughter which had so greatly gratified him.About a month after Christmas, the meeting of Parliament summoned Mr.Millbank up to London; and he had wished Edith to accompany him.But
London in February to Edith, without friends or connections, her father
always occupied and absent from her day and night, seemed to them
all, on reflection, to be a life not very conducive to health or
cheerfulness, and therefore she remained with her brother.Oswald had
heard from Coningsby again from Rome; but at the period he wrote he did
not anticipate his return to England.His tone was affectionate, but
dispirited.Lady Wallinger went up to London after Easter for the season, and Mr.Millbank, now that there was a constant companion for his daughter, took
a house and carried Edith back with him to London.Lady Wallinger,
who had great wealth and great tact, had obtained by degrees a
not inconsiderable position in society.She had a fine house in a
fashionable situation, and gave profuse entertainments.The Whigs
were under obligations to her husband, and the great Whig ladies were
gratified to find in his wife a polished and pleasing person, to whom
they could be courteous without any annoyance.So that Edith, under the
auspices of her aunt, found herself at once in circles which otherwise
she might not easily have entered, but which her beauty, grace, and
experience of the most refined society of the Continent, qualified
her to shine in.One evening they met the Marquis of Beaumanoir, their
friend of Rome and Paris, and admirer of Edith, who from that time was
seldom from their side.His mother, the Duchess, immediately called both
on the Millbanks and the Wallingers; glad, not only to please her son,
but to express that consideration for Mr.Millbank which the Duke always
wished to show.It was, however, of no use; nothing would induce Mr.Millbank ever to enter what he called aristocratic society.He liked the
House of Commons; never paired off; never missed a moment of it; worked
at committees all the morning, listened attentively to debates all the
night; always dined at Bellamy's when there was a house; and when there
was not, liked dining at the Fishmongers' Company, the Russia Company,
great Emigration banquets, and other joint-stock festivities.That was
his idea of rational society; business and pleasure combined; a good
dinner, and good speeches afterwards.Edith was aware that Coningsby had returned to England, for her brother
had heard from him on his arrival; but Oswald had not heard since.A season in London only represented in the mind of Edith the chance,
perhaps the certainty, of meeting Coningsby again; of communing together
over the catastrophe of last summer; of soothing and solacing each
other's unhappiness, and perhaps, with the sanguine imagination of
youth, foreseeing a more felicitous future.She had been nearly a
fortnight in town, and though moving frequently in the same circles as
Coningsby, they had not yet met.It was one of those results which
could rarely occur; but even chance enters too frequently in the
league against lovers.The invitation to the assembly at ---- House was
therefore peculiarly gratifying to Edith, since she could scarcely
doubt that if Coningsby were in town, which her casual inquiries of Lord
Beaumanoir induced her to believe was the case, he would be present.Never, therefore, had she repaired to an assembly with such a flattering
spirit; and yet there was a fascinating anxiety about it that bewilders
the young heart.In vain Edith surveyed the rooms to catch the form of that being, whom
for a moment she had never ceased to cherish and muse over.He was not
there; and at the very moment when, disappointed and mortified, she most
required solace, she learned from Mr.Melton that Lady Theresa Sydney,
whom she chanced to admire, was going to be married, and to Mr.His silence, perhaps his shunning of her were no
longer inexplicable.What a return for all her romantic devotion in her
sad solitude at Hellingsley.Was this the end of their twilight rambles,
and the sweet pathos of their mutual loves?There seemed to be no truth
in man, no joy in life!All the feelings that she had so generously
lavished, all returned upon herself.She could have burst into a passion
of tears and buried herself in a cloister.Instead of that, civilisation made her listen with a serene though
tortured countenance; but as soon as it was in her power, pleading a
headache to Lady Wallinger, she effected, or thought she had effected,
her escape from a scene which harrowed her heart.As for Coningsby, he passed a sleepless night, agitated by the
unexpected presence of Edith and distracted by the manner in which
she had received him.To say that her appearance had revived all his
passionate affection for her would convey an unjust impression of the
nature of his feelings.His affection had never for a moment swerved; it
was profound and firm.But unquestionably this sudden vision had brought
before him, in startling and more vivid colours, the relations that
subsisted between them.There was the being whom he loved and who loved
him; and whatever were the barriers which the circumstances of life
placed against their union, they were partakers of the solemn sacrament
of an unpolluted heart.Coningsby, as we have mentioned, had signified to Oswald his return to
England: he had hitherto omitted to write again; not because his spirit
faltered, but he was wearied of whispering hope without foundation, and
mourning over his chagrined fortunes.Once more in England, once more
placed in communication with his grandfather, he felt with increased
conviction the difficulties which surrounded him.The society of Lady
Everingham and her sister, who had been at the same time her visitor,
had been a relaxation, and a beneficial one, to a mind suffering
too much from the tension of one idea.But Coningsby had treated the
matrimonial project of his gay-minded hostess with the courteous levity
in which he believed it had first half originated.He admired and liked
Lady Theresa; but there was a reason why he should not marry her, even
had his own heart not been absorbed by one of those passions from which
men of deep and earnest character never emancipate themselves.After musing and meditating again and again over everything that had
occurred, Coningsby fell asleep when the morning had far advanced,
resolved to rise when a little refreshed and find out Lady Wallinger,
who, he felt sure, would receive him with kindness.Yet it was fated that this step should not be taken, for while he was
at breakfast, his servant brought him a letter from Monmouth House,
apprising him that his grandfather wished to see him as soon as possible
on urgent business.Lord Monmouth was sitting in the same dressing-room in which he was
first introduced to the reader; on the table were several packets of
papers that were open and in course of reference; and he dictated his
observations to Monsieur Villebecque, who was writing at his left hand.Thus were they occupied when Coningsby was ushered into the room.'You see, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, 'that I am much occupied to-day,
yet the business on which I wish to communicate with you is so pressing
that it could not be postponed.'He made a sign to Villebecque, and his
secretary instantly retired.'I was right in pressing your return to England,' continued Lord
Monmouth to his grandson, who was a little anxious as to the impending
communication, which he could not in any way anticipate.'These are not
times when young men should be out of sight.You may be astonished, but
it is a fact.They are going to dissolve their own House of Commons.Notwithstanding this and the Queen's name, we can beat them; but the
race requires the finest jockeying.Tadpole has
been here to me about Darlford; he came specially with a message, I may
say an appeal, from one to whom I can refuse nothing; the Government
count on the seat, though with the new Registration 'tis nearly a tie.If we had a good candidate we could win.He is too
much of the old clique; used up; a hack; besides, a beaten horse.We are
assured the name of Coningsby would be a host; there is a considerable
section who support the present fellow who will not vote against a
Coningsby.They have thought of you as a fit person, and I have approved
of the suggestion.You will, therefore, be the candidate for Darlford
with my entire sanction and support, and I have no doubt you will be
successful.You may be sure I shall spare nothing: and it will be very
gratifying to me, after being robbed of all our boroughs, that the only
Coningsby who cares to enter Parliament, should nevertheless be able to
do so as early as I could fairly desire.'Millbank on the hustings of Darlford!The fierce passions,
the gross insults, the hot blood and the cool lies, the ruffianism and
the ribaldry, perhaps the domestic discomfiture and mortification, which
he was about to be the means of bringing on the roof he loved best
in the world, occurred to him with anguish.The countenance of
Edith, haughty and mournful last night, rose to him again.He saw her
canvassing for her father, and against him.And for what was
he to make this terrible and costly sacrifice For his ambition?Not even
for that Divinity or Daemon for which we all immolate so much!Mighty
ambition, forsooth, to succeed to the Rigbys!To enter the House of
Commons a slave and a tool; to move according to instructions, and
to labour for the low designs of petty spirits, without even the
consolation of being a dupe.What sympathy could there exist between
Coningsby and the 'great Conservative party,' that for ten years in
an age of revolution had never promulgated a principle; whose only
intelligible and consistent policy seemed to be an attempt, very
grateful of course to the feelings of an English Royalist, to revive
Irish Puritanism; who when in power in 1835 had used that power only to
evince their utter ignorance of Church principles; and who were at this
moment, when Coningsby was formally solicited to join their ranks, in
open insurrection against the prerogatives of the English Monarchy?'Do you anticipate then an immediate dissolution, sir?'inquired
Coningsby after a moment's pause.'We must anticipate it; though I think it doubtful.It may be next
month; it may be in the autumn; they may tide over another year, as Lord
Eskdale thinks, and his opinion always weighs with me.Tadpole believes they will dissolve at once.But whether they dissolve
now, or in a month's time, or in the autumn, or next year, our course
is clear.Monday next, there is a great Conservative dinner at Darlford.You
must attend it; that will be the finest opportunity in the world for you
to announce yourself.''Don't you think, sir,' said Coningsby, 'that such an announcement would
be rather premature?It is, in fact, embarking in a contest which may
last a year; perhaps more.''What you say is very true,' said Lord Monmouth; 'no doubt it is very
troublesome; very disgusting; any canvassing is.But we must take things
as we find them.You cannot get into Parliament now in the good old
gentlemanlike way; and we ought to be thankful that this interest has
been fostered for our purpose.'Coningsby looked on the carpet, cleared his throat as if about to speak,
and then gave something like a sigh.'I think you had better be off the day after to-morrow,' said Lord
Monmouth.'I have sent instructions to the steward to do all he can in
so short a time, for I wish you to entertain the principal people.''You are most kind, you are always most kind to me, dear sir,' said
Coningsby, in a hesitating tone, and with an air of great embarrassment,
'but, in truth, I have no wish to enter Parliament.''I feel that I am not sufficiently prepared for so great a
responsibility as a seat in the House of Commons,' said Coningsby.How can any one have a more agreeable seat?The only person to
whom you are responsible is your own relation, who brings you in.And I
don't suppose there can be any difference on any point between us.You
are certainly still young; but I was younger by nearly two years when
I first went in; and I found no difficulty.All you have got to do is to vote with your party.As for speaking, if
you have a talent that way, take my advice; don't be in a hurry.Learn
to know the House; learn the House to know you.If a man be discreet, he
cannot enter Parliament too soon.''It is not exactly that, sir,' said Coningsby.'Then what is it, my dear Harry?You see to-day I have much to do; yet
as your business is pressing, I would not postpone seeing you an hour.I
thought you would have been very much gratified.''You mentioned that I had nothing to do but to vote with my party, sir,'
replied Coningsby.'You mean, of course, by that term what is understood
by the Conservative party.''I am sorry,' said Coningsby, rather pale, but speaking with firmness,
'I am sorry that I could not support the Conservative party.'exclaimed Lord Monmouth, starting in his seat,'some woman
has got hold of him, and made him a Whig!''No, my dear grandfather,' said Coningsby, scarcely able to repress a
smile, serious as the interview was becoming, 'nothing of the kind, I
assure you.No person can be more anti-Whig.''I don't know what you are driving at, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
hard, dry tone.'I wish to be frank, sir,' said Coningsby, 'and am very sensible of your
goodness in permitting me to speak to you on the subject.What I mean to
say is, that I have for a long time looked upon the Conservative party
as a body who have betrayed their trust; more from ignorance, I admit,
than from design; yet clearly a body of individuals totally unequal
to the exigencies of the epoch, and indeed unconscious of its real
character.''Well, between ourselves, I am quite of the same opinion.But we must
mount higher; we must go to '28 for the real mischief.But what is the
use of lamenting the past?Peel is the only man; suited to the times and
all that; at least we must say so, and try to believe so; we can't go
back.And it is our own fault that we have let the chief power out of
the hands of our own order.It was never thought of in the time of your
great-grandfather, sir.And if a commoner were for a season permitted
to be the nominal Premier to do the detail, there was always a secret
committee of great 1688 nobles to give him his instructions.''I should be very sorry to see secret committees of great 1688 nobles
again,' said Coningsby.'Then what the devil do you want to see?''Political faith,' said Coningsby, 'instead of political infidelity.''Before I support Conservative principles,' continued Coningsby, 'I
merely wish to be informed what those principles aim to conserve.It
would not appear to be the prerogative of the Crown, since the principal
portion of a Conservative oration now is an invective against a late
royal act which they describe as a Bed-chamber plot.Is it the Church
which they wish to conserve?What is a threatened Appropriation Clause
against an actual Church Commission in the hands of Parliamentary
Laymen?Well, then, if it
is neither the Crown nor the Church, whose rights and privileges this
Conservative party propose to vindicate, is it your House, the House
of Lords, whose powers they are prepared to uphold?Is it not notorious
that the very man whom you have elected as your leader in that House,
declares among his Conservative adherents, that henceforth the assembly
that used to furnish those very Committees of great revolution nobles
that you mention, is to initiate nothing; and, without a struggle, is
to subside into that undisturbed repose which resembles the Imperial
tranquillity that secured the frontiers by paying tribute?''All this is vastly fine,' said Lord Monmouth; 'but I see no means by
which I can attain my object but by supporting Peel.After all, what is
the end of all parties and all politics?I want to
turn our coronet into a ducal one, and to get your grandmother's barony
called out of abeyance in your favour.It is impossible that Peel can
refuse me.I have already purchased an ample estate with the view
of entailing it on you and your issue.You will make a considerable
alliance; you may marry, if you please, Lady Theresa Sydney.Count on my at once entering into any arrangement
conducive to your happiness.''My dear grandfather, you have ever been to me only too kind and
generous.''To whom should I be kind but to you, my own blood, that has never
crossed me, and of whom I have reason to be proud?Yes, Harry, it
gratifies me to hear you admired and to learn your success.All I want
now is to see you in Parliament.There is a sort of stiffness about every man, no matter what may be his
talents, who enters Parliament late in life; and now, fortunately, the
occasion offers.You will go down on Friday; feed the notabilities
well; speak out; praise Peel; abuse O'Connell and the ladies of the
Bed-chamber; anathematise all waverers; say a good deal about Ireland;
stick to the Irish Registration Bill, that's a good card; and, above
all, my dear Harry, don't spare that fellow Millbank.Remember, in
turning him out you not only gain a vote for the Conservative cause
and our coronet, but you crush my foe.Spare nothing for that object; I
count on you, boy.''I should grieve to be backward in anything that concerned your
interest or your honour, sir,' said Coningsby, with an air of great
embarrassment.'I am sure you would, I am sure you would,' said Lord Monmouth, in a
tone of some kindness.'And I feel at this moment,' continued Coningsby, 'that there is no
personal sacrifice which I am not prepared to make for them, except one.My interests, my affections, they should not be placed in the balance,
if yours, sir, were at stake, though there are circumstances which might
involve me in a position of as much mental distress as a man could well
endure; but I claim for my convictions, my dear grandfather, a generous
tolerance.''I can't follow you, sir,' said Lord Monmouth, again in his hard tone.'Our interests are inseparable, and therefore there can never be
any sacrifice of conduct on your part.What you mean by sacrifice of
affections, I don't comprehend; but as for your opinions, you have no
business to have any other than those I uphold.'I am sure I wish to express them with no unbecoming confidence,'
replied Coningsby; 'I have never intruded them on your ear before;
but this being an occasion when you yourself said, sir, I was about
to commence my public career, I confess I thought it was my duty to be
frank; I would not entail on myself long years of mortification by one
of those ill-considered entrances into political life which so many
public men have cause to deplore.''You go with your family, sir, like a gentleman; you are not to consider
your opinions, like a philosopher or a political adventurer.''Yes, sir,' said Coningsby, with animation, 'but men going with their
families like gentlemen, and losing sight of every principle on which
the society of this country ought to be established, produced the Reform
Bill.'said Lord Monmouth; 'if the Duke had not
quarrelled with Lord Grey on a Coal Committee, we should never have had
the Reform Bill.'You are in as great peril now as you were in 1830,' said Coningsby.'No, no, no,' said Lord Monmouth; 'the Tory party is organised now; they
will not catch us napping again: these Conservative Associations have
done the business.''At the best to turn
out the Whigs.And when you have turned out the Whigs, what then?You
may get your ducal coronet, sir.But a duke now is not so great a man
as a baron was but a century back.We cannot struggle against the
irresistible stream of circumstances.Power has left our order; this is
not an age for factitious aristocracy.As for my grandmother's barony, I
should look upon the termination of its abeyance in my favour as the
act of my political extinction.What we want, sir, is not to fashion
new dukes and furbish up old baronies, but to establish great principles
which may maintain the realm and secure the happiness of the people.Let
me see authority once more honoured; a solemn reverence again the habit
of our lives; let me see property acknowledging, as in the old days
of faith, that labour is his twin brother, and that the essence of all
tenure is the performance of duty; let results such as these be brought
about, and let me participate, however feebly, in the great fulfilment,
and public life then indeed becomes a noble career, and a seat in
Parliament an enviable distinction.''I tell you what it is, Harry,' said Lord Monmouth, very drily,'members
of this family may think as they like, but they must act as I please.You must go down on Friday to Darlford and declare yourself a candidate
for the town, or I shall reconsider our mutual positions.I would say,
you must go to-morrow; but it is only courteous to Rigby to give him a
previous intimation of your movement.I
sent for Rigby this morning on other business which now occupies me, and
find he is out of town.He will return to-morrow; and will be here at
three o'clock, when you can meet him.You will meet him, I doubt not,
like a man of sense,' added Lord Monmouth, looking at Coningsby with a
glance such as he had never before encountered, 'who is not prepared to
sacrifice all the objects of life for the pursuit of some fantastical
puerilities.'His Lordship rang a bell on his table for Villebecque; and to prevent
any further conversation, resumed his papers.It would have been difficult for any person, unconscious of crime,
to have felt more dejected than Coningsby when he rode out of the
court-yard of Monmouth House.The love of Edith would have consoled
him for the destruction of his prosperity; the proud fulfilment of his
ambition might in time have proved some compensation for his crushed
affections; but his present position seemed to offer no single source
of solace.There came over him that irresistible conviction that is at
times the dark doom of all of us, that the bright period of our life is
past; that a future awaits us only of anxiety, failure, mortification,
despair; that none of our resplendent visions can ever be realised:
and that we add but one more victim to the long and dreary catalogue of
baffled aspirations.Nor could he indeed by any combination see the means to extricate
himself from the perils that were encompassing him.There was something
about his grandfather that defied persuasion.Prone as eloquent
youth generally is to believe in the resistless power of its appeals,
Coningsby despaired at once of ever moving Lord Monmouth.There had been
a callous dryness in his manner, an unswerving purpose in his spirit,
that at once baffled all attempts at influence.Nor could Coningsby
forget the look he received when he quitted the room.There was no
possibility of mistaking it; it said at once, without periphrasis,
'Cross my purpose, and I will crush you!'This was the moment when the sympathy, if not the counsels, of
friendship might have been grateful.A clever woman might have afforded
even more than sympathy; some happy device that might have even released
him from the mesh in which he was involved.And once Coningsby had
turned his horse's head to Park Lane to call on Lady Everingham.But
surely if there were a sacred secret in the world, it was the one which
subsisted between himself and Edith.Then there was Lady Wallinger; he could at least speak with freedom to
her.He looked in for a moment at a club
to take up the 'Court Guide' and find her direction.A few men were
standing in a bow window.Cassilis say,

'So Beau, they say, is booked at last; the new beauty, have you heard?''I saw him very sweet on her last night,' rejoined his companion.'Deuced deal, they say,' replied Mr.The father is a cotton
lord, and they all have loads of tin, you know.'He is in Parliament, is not he?'''Gad, I believe he is,' said Mr.Cassilis; 'I never know who is in
Parliament in these days.I remember when there were only ten men in the
House of Commons who were not either members of Brookes' or this place.'I hear 'tis an old affair of Beau,' said another gentleman.'It was all
done a year ago at Rome or Paris.''They say she refused him then,' said Mr.'Well, that is tolerably cool for a manufacturer's daughter,' said his
friend.'The Duke will be deuced glad to see Beau settled, I take it,' said Mr.'A good deal depends on the tin,' said his friend.Coningsby threw down the 'Court Guide' with a sinking heart.In spite
of every insuperable difficulty, hitherto the end and object of all his
aspirations and all his exploits, sometimes even almost unconsciously
to himself, was Edith.The strange manner of last night was
fatally explained.The heart that once had been his was now another's.To the man who still loves there is in that conviction the most profound
and desolate sorrow of which our nature is capable.All the recollection
of the past, all the once-cherished prospects of the future, blend into
one bewildering anguish.Coningsby quitted the club, and mounting his
horse, rode rapidly out of town, almost unconscious of his direction.He found himself at length in a green lane near Willesden, silent and
undisturbed; he pulled up his horse, and summoned all his mind to the
contemplation of his prospects.Now, should he return to his grandfather, accept his
mission, and go down to Darlford on Friday?Favour and fortune, power,
prosperity, rank, distinction would be the consequence of this step;
might not he add even vengeance?Was there to be no term to his
endurance?Might not he teach this proud, prejudiced manufacturer, with
all his virulence and despotic caprices, a memorable lesson?And his
daughter, too, this betrothed, after all, of a young noble, with her
flush futurity of splendour and enjoyment, was she to hear of him only,
if indeed she heard of him at all, as of one toiling or trifling in the
humbler positions of existence; and wonder, with a blush, that he ever
could have been the hero of her romantic girlhood?His cheek burnt at the possibility of such ignominy!It was a conjuncture in his life that required decision.He thought of
his companions who looked up to him with such ardent anticipations of
his fame, of delight in his career, and confidence in his leading; were
all these high and fond fancies to be balked?On the very threshold of
life was he to blunder?'Tis the first step that leads to all, and
his was to be a wilful error.He remembered his first visit to his
grandfather, and the delight of his friends at Eton at his report on his
return.After eight years of initiation was he to lose that favour then
so highly prized, when the results which they had so long counted on
were on the very eve of accomplishment?Parliament and riches, and rank
and power; these were facts, realities, substances, that none could
mistake.Was he to sacrifice them for speculations, theories, shadows,
perhaps the vapours of a green and conceited brain?He was like Caesar by the starry river's side, watching the image of the
planets on its fatal waters.The sun set; the twilight spell fell upon his soul; the exaltation
of his spirit died away.Beautiful thoughts, full of sweetness and
tranquillity and consolation, came clustering round his heart like
seraphs.He thought of Edith in her hours of fondness; he thought of
the pure and solemn moments when to mingle his name with the heroes of
humanity was his aspiration, and to achieve immortal fame the inspiring
purpose of his life.What were the tawdry accidents of vulgar ambition
to him?No domestic despot could deprive him of his intellect, his
knowledge, the sustaining power of an unpolluted conscience.If he
possessed the intelligence in which he had confidence, the world
would recognise his voice even if not placed upon a pedestal.If the
principles of his philosophy were true, the great heart of the nation
would respond to their expression.Coningsby felt at this moment a
profound conviction which never again deserted him, that the conduct
which would violate the affections of the heart, or the dictates of the
conscience, however it may lead to immediate success, is a fatal error.Conscious that he was perhaps verging on some painful vicissitude of his
life, he devoted himself to a love that seemed hopeless, and to a fame
that was perhaps a dream.It was under the influence of these solemn resolutions that he wrote,
on his return home, a letter to Lord Monmouth, in which he expressed
all that affection which he really felt for his grandfather, and all
the pangs which it cost him to adhere to the conclusions he had already
announced.In terms of tenderness, and even humility, he declined to
become a candidate for Darlford, or even to enter Parliament, except as
the master of his own conduct.CHAPTER V.


Lady Monmouth was reclining on a sofa in that beautiful boudoir which
had been fitted up under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, but as he
then believed for the Princess Colonna.The walls were hung with amber
satin, painted by Delaroche with such subjects as might be expected from
his brilliant and picturesque pencil.Fair forms, heroes and heroines
in dazzling costume, the offspring of chivalry merging into what is
commonly styled civilisation, moved in graceful or fantastic groups amid
palaces and gardens.The ceiling, carved in the deep honeycomb fashion
of the Saracens, was richly gilt and picked out in violet.Upon a violet
carpet of velvet was represented the marriage of Cupid and Psyche.It was about two hours after Coningsby had quitted Monmouth House, and
Flora came in, sent for by Lady Monmouth as was her custom, to read to
her as she was employed with some light work.''Tis a new book of Sue,' said Lucretia.Flora, seated by her side, began to read.Reading was an accomplishment
which distinguished Flora; but to-day her voice faltered, her expression
was uncertain; she seemed but imperfectly to comprehend her page.More
than once Lady Monmouth looked round at her with an inquisitive glance.madam,' she at last exclaimed, 'if you would but speak to Mr.said Lady Monmouth, turning quickly on the sofa; then,
collecting herself in an instant, she continued with less abruptness,
and more suavity than usual, 'Tell me, Flora, what is it; what is the
matter?''My Lord,' sobbed Flora, 'has quarrelled with Mr.An expression of eager interest came over the countenance of Lucretia.'I do not know they have quarrelled; it is not, perhaps, a right term;
but my Lord is very angry with Mr.'Not very angry, I should think, Flora; and about what?'very angry, madam,' said Flora, shaking her head mournfully.'My
Lord told M. Villebecque that perhaps Mr.Coningsby would never enter
the house again.'Coningsby has only left this hour or two.He will not
do what my Lord wishes, about some seat in the Chamber.I do not know
exactly what it is; but my Lord is in one of his moods of terror: my
father is frightened even to go into his room when he is so.'Coningsby came, and he found that Mr.Lady Monmouth rose from her sofa, and walked once or twice up and down
the room.Then turning to Flora, she said, 'Go away now: the book is
stupid; it does not amuse me.Stop: find out all you can for me about
the quarrel before I speak to Mr.Lucretia remained for some time in meditation;
then she wrote a few lines, which she despatched at once to Mr.What a great man was the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby!Here was one
of the first peers of England, and one of the finest ladies in London,
both waiting with equal anxiety his return to town; and unable to
transact two affairs of vast importance, yet wholly unconnected, without
his interposition!What was the secret of the influence of this man,
confided in by everybody, trusted by none?His counsels were not deep,
his expedients were not felicitous; he had no feeling, and he could
create no sympathy.It is that, in most of the transactions of life,
there is some portion which no one cares to accomplish, and which
everybody wishes to be achieved.In the eye of the world he had constantly the appearance of being
mixed up with high dealings, and negotiations and arrangements of fine
management, whereas in truth, notwithstanding his splendid livery and
the airs he gave himself in the servants' hall, his real business in
life had ever been, to do the dirty work.Rigby had been shut up much at his villa of late.He was concocting,
you could not term it composing, an article, a'very slashing article,'
which was to prove that the penny postage must be the destruction of the
aristocracy.It was a grand subject, treated in his highest style.His
parallel portraits of Rowland Hill the conqueror of Almarez and Rowland
Hill the deviser of the cheap postage were enormously fine.It was full
of passages in italics, little words in great capitals, and almost drew
tears.The statistical details also were highly interesting and novel.Several of the old postmen, both twopenny and general, who had been in
office with himself, and who were inspired with an equal zeal against
that spirit of reform of which they had alike been victims, supplied him
with information which nothing but a breach of ministerial duty could
have furnished.The prophetic peroration as to the irresistible progress
of democracy was almost as powerful as one of Rigby's speeches on
Aldborough or Amersham.There never was a fellow for giving a good
hearty kick to the people like Rigby.Himself sprung from the dregs of
the populace, this was disinterested.What could be more patriotic and
magnanimous than his Jeremiads over the fall of the Montmorencis and the
Crillons, or the possible catastrophe of the Percys and the Manners!The
truth of all this hullabaloo was that Rigby had a sly pension which,
by an inevitable association of ideas, he always connected with the
maintenance of an aristocracy.All his rigmarole dissertations on the
French revolution were impelled by this secret influence; and when he
wailed over 'la guerre aux chateaux,' and moaned like a mandrake over
Nottingham Castle in flames, the rogue had an eye all the while to
quarter-day!Arriving in town the day after Coningsby's interview with his
grandfather, Mr.Rigby found a summons to Monmouth House waiting him,
and an urgent note from Lucretia begging that he would permit nothing
to prevent him seeing her for a few minutes before he called on the
Marquess.Lucretia, acting on the unconscious intimation of Flora, had in the
course of four-and-twenty hours obtained pretty ample and accurate
details of the cause of contention between Coningsby and her husband.Rigby not only that Lord Monmouth was
highly incensed against his grandson, but that the cause of their
misunderstanding arose about a seat in the House of Commons, and that
seat too the one which Mr.Rigby had long appropriated to himself,
and over whose registration he had watched with such affectionate
solicitude.Lady Monmouth arranged this information like a firstrate artist, and
gave it a grouping and a colour which produced the liveliest effect
upon her confederate.The countenance of Rigby was almost ghastly as
he received the intelligence; a grin, half of malice, half of terror,
played over his features.'I told you to beware of him long ago,' said Lady Monmouth.'He is, he
has ever been, in the way of both of us.''He is in my power,' said Rigby.'He is in love with the daughter of Millbank, the man who bought
Hellingsley.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, in a prolonged tone.'He was at Coningsby all last summer, hanging about her.I found the
younger Millbank quite domiciliated at the Castle; a fact which, of
itself, if known to Lord Monmouth, would ensure the lad's annihilation.''And you kept this fine news for a winter campaign, my good Mr.Rigby,'
said Lady Monmouth, with a subtle smile.'The time is not always ripe,' said Mr.Let us not conceal it from ourselves that,
since his first visit to Coningsby, we have neither of us really been in
the same position which we then occupied, or believed we should occupy.My Lord, though you would scarcely believe it, has a weakness for this
boy; and though I by my marriage, and you by your zealous ability,
have apparently secured a permanent hold upon his habits, I have never
doubted that when the crisis comes we shall find that the golden fruit
is plucked by one who has not watched the garden.There is
no reason why we two should clash together: we can both of us find what
we want, and more securely if we work in company.''I trust my devotion to you has never been doubted, dear madam.'Rid
me of this Coningsby, and I will secure you all that you want.'It shall be done,' said Rigby; 'it must be done.If once the notion
gets wind that one of the Castle family may perchance stand for
Darlford, all the present combinations will be disorganised.'So I hear for certain,' said Lucretia.'Be sure there is no time to
lose.What does he want with you to-day?''I know not: there are so many things.''To be sure; and yet I cannot doubt he will speak of this quarrel.Whatever his mood, the subject may be
introduced.If good, you will guide him more easily; if dark, the love
for the Hellingsley girl, the fact of the brother being in his castle,
drinking his wine, riding his horses, ordering about his servants; you
will omit no details: a Millbank quite at home at Coningsby will lash
him to madness!Go,
go, or he may hear that you have arrived.I shall be at home all the
morning.It will be but gallant that you should pay me a little visit
when you have transacted your business._Au revoir!_'

Lady Monmouth took up again her French novel; but her eyes soon glanced
over the page, unattached by its contents.Her own existence was too
interesting to find any excitement in fiction.It was nearly three years
since her marriage; that great step which she ever had a conviction was
to lead to results still greater.Of late she had often been filled with
a presentiment that they were near at hand; never more so than on
this day.Irresistible was the current of associations that led her to
meditate on freedom, wealth, power; on a career which should at the same
time dazzle the imagination and gratify her heart.Notwithstanding the
gossip of Paris, founded on no authentic knowledge of her husband's
character or information, based on the haphazard observations of the
floating multitude, Lucretia herself had no reason to fear that her
influence over Lord Monmouth, if exerted, was materially diminished.But
satisfied that he had formed no other tie, with her ever the test of
her position, she had not thought it expedient, and certainly would have
found it irksome, to maintain that influence by any ostentatious means.She knew that Lord Monmouth was capricious, easily wearied, soon palled;
and that on men who have no affections, affection has no hold.Their
passions or their fancies, on the contrary, as it seemed to her, are
rather stimulated by neglect or indifference, provided that they are not
systematic; and the circumstance of a wife being admired by one who is
not her husband sometimes wonderfully revives the passion or renovates
the respect of him who should be devoted to her.The health of Lord Monmouth was the subject which never was long absent
from the vigilance or meditation of Lucretia.She was well assured that
his life was no longer secure.She knew that after their marriage he had
made a will, which secured to her a large portion of his great wealth in
case of their having no issue, and after the accident at Paris all
hope in that respect was over.Recently the extreme anxiety which Lord
Monmouth had evinced about terminating the abeyance of the barony to
which his first wife was a co-heiress in favour of his grandson, had
alarmed Lucretia.To establish in the land another branch of the house
of Coningsby was evidently the last excitement of Lord Monmouth, and
perhaps a permanent one.If the idea were once accepted, notwithstanding
the limit to its endowment which Lord Monmouth might at the first start
contemplate, Lucretia had sufficiently studied his temperament to be
convinced that all his energies and all his resources would ultimately
be devoted to its practical fulfilment.Her original prejudice against
Coningsby and jealousy of his influence had therefore of late been
considerably aggravated; and the intelligence that for the first time
there was a misunderstanding between Coningsby and her husband filled
her with excitement and hope.She knew her Lord well enough to feel
assured that the cause for displeasure in the present instance could not
be a light one; she resolved instantly to labour that it should not
be transient; and it so happened that she had applied for aid in this
endeavour to the very individual in whose power it rested to accomplish
all her desire, while in doing so he felt at the same time he was
defending his own position and advancing his own interests.Lady Monmouth was now waiting with some excitement the return of Mr.His interview with his patron was of unusual length.An hour, and
more than an hour, had elapsed.Lady Monmouth again threw aside the book
which more than once she had discarded.She paced the room, restless
rather than disquieted.She had complete confidence in Rigby's ability
for the occasion; and with her knowledge of Lord Monmouth's character,
she could not contemplate the possibility of failure, if the
circumstances were adroitly introduced to his consideration.Still time
stole on: the harassing and exhausting process of suspense was acting
on her nervous system.She began to think that Rigby had not found
the occasion favourable for the catastrophe; that Lord Monmouth, from
apprehension of disturbing Rigby and entailing explanations on himself,
had avoided the necessary communication; that her skilful combination
for the moment had missed.Two hours had now elapsed, and Lucretia, in a
state of considerable irritation, was about to inquire whether Mr.Rigby
were with his Lordship when the door of her boudoir opened, and that
gentleman appeared.'Now sit down and
tell me what has passed.'Lady Monmouth pointed to the seat which Flora had occupied.'I thank your Ladyship,' said Mr.Rigby, with a somewhat grave and yet
perplexed expression of countenance, and seating himself at some little
distance from his companion, 'but I am very well here.'Instead of responding to the invitation of Lady
Monmouth to communicate with his usual readiness and volubility, Mr.Rigby was silent, and, if it were possible to use such an expression
with regard to such a gentleman, apparently embarrassed.'Well,' said Lady Monmouth, 'does he know about the Millbanks?''His Lordship was greatly shocked,' replied Mr.Rigby, with a pious
expression of features.As his Lordship
very justly observed, "It is impossible to say what is going on under my
own roof, or to what I can trust."''But he made an exception in your favour, I dare say, my dear Mr.'Lord Monmouth was pleased to say that I possessed his entire
confidence,' said Mr.Rigby, 'and that he looked to me in his
difficulties.''The steps which his Lordship is about to take with reference to the
establishment generally,' said Mr.Rigby, 'will allow the connection
that at present subsists between that gentleman and his noble relative,
now that Lord Monmouth's eyes are open to his real character, to
terminate naturally, without the necessity of any formal explanation.''But what do you mean by the steps he is going to take in his
establishment generally?''Lord Monmouth thinks he requires change of scene.'exclaimed Lady Monmouth, with
great impatience.'I hope he is not going again to that dreadful castle in Lancashire.''Lord Monmouth was thinking that, as you were tired of Paris, you might
find some of the German Baths agreeable.''Why, there is nothing that Lord Monmouth dislikes so much as a German
bathing-place!''Then how capricious in him wanting to go to them?''He does not want to go to them!'said Lady Monmouth, in a lower voice, and
looking him full in the face with a glance seldom bestowed.There was a churlish and unusual look about Rigby.It was as if
malignant, and yet at the same time a little frightened, he had screwed
himself into doggedness.He suggests that if your Ladyship were
to pass the summer at Kissengen, for example, and a paragraph in the
_Morning Post_ were to announce that his Lordship was about to join you
there, all awkwardness would be removed; and no one could for a moment
take the liberty of supposing, even if his Lordship did not ultimately
reach you, that anything like a separation had occurred.''I would never have consented to
interfere in the affair, but to secure that most desirable point.''I will see Lord Monmouth at once,' said Lucretia, rising, her natural
pallor aggravated into a ghoul-like tint.'His Lordship has gone out,' said Mr.'Our conversation, sir, then finishes; I wait his return.''His Lordship will never return to Monmouth House again.'And
he really thinks that I am to be crushed by such an instrument as this!He may leave Monmouth House, but I shall not.'Still anxious to secure an amicable separation,' said Mr.Rigby, 'your
Ladyship must allow me to place the circumstances of the case fairly
before your excellent judgment.Lord Monmouth has decided upon a course:
you know as well as I that he never swerves from his resolutions.He has
left peremptory instructions, and he will listen to no appeal.He has
empowered me to represent to your Ladyship that he wishes in every way
to consider your convenience.He suggests that everything, in short,
should be arranged as if his Lordship were himself unhappily no more;
that your Ladyship should at once enter into your jointure, which
shall be made payable quarterly to your order, provided you can find
it convenient to live upon the Continent,' added Mr.Rigby, with some
hesitation.'Why, then, we will leave your Ladyship to the assertion of your
rights.''I beg your Ladyship's pardon.I speak as the friend of the family, the
trustee of your marriage settlement, well known also as Lord Monmouth's
executor,' said Mr.Rigby, his countenance gradually regaining its
usual callous confidence, and some degree of self-complacency, as he
remembered the good things which he enumerated.'I have decided,' said Lady Monmouth.Your
master has mistaken my character and his own position.He shall rue the
day that he assailed me.''I should be sorry if there were any violence,' said Mr.Rigby,
'especially as everything is left to my management and control.An
office, indeed, which I only accepted for your mutual advantage.I think, upon reflection, I might put before your Ladyship some
considerations which might induce you, on the whole, to be of opinion
that it will be better for us to draw together in this business, as we
have hitherto, indeed, throughout an acquaintance now of some years.'Rigby was assuming all his usual tone of brazen familiarity.'Your self-confidence exceeds even Lord Monmouth's estimate of it,' said
Lucretia.'Now, now, you are unkind.I am
interfering in this business for your sake.It would have fallen to another, who would have fulfilled
it without any delicacy and consideration for your feelings.View my
interposition in that light, my dear Lady Monmouth, and circumstances
will assume altogether a new colour.''I beg that you will quit the house, sir.''I would with pleasure, to oblige you, were
it in my power; but Lord Monmouth has particularly desired that I should
take up my residence here permanently.For your Ladyship's sake, I wish
everything to be accomplished with tranquillity, and, if possible,
friendliness and good feeling.You can have even a week for the
preparations for your departure, if necessary.Any carriages, too, that you desire; your jewels, at least all
those that are not at the bankers'.The arrangement about your jointure,
your letters of credit, even your passport, I will attend to myself;
only too happy if, by this painful interference, I have in any way
contributed to soften the annoyance which, at the first blush, you may
naturally experience, but which, like everything else, take my word,
will wear off.''I shall send for Lord Eskdale,' said Lady Monmouth.Rigby, 'that Lord Eskdale will give you the
same advice as myself, if he only reads your Ladyship's letters,' he
added slowly, 'to Prince Trautsmansdorff.''Pardon me,' said Rigby, putting his hand in his pocket, as if to guard
some treasure, 'I have no wish to revive painful associations; but I
have them, and I must act upon them, if you persist in treating me as
a foe, who am in reality your best friend; which indeed I ought to be,
having the honour of acting as trustee under your marriage settlement,
and having known you so many years.''Leave me for the present alone,' said Lady Monmouth.'Send me my
servant, if I have one.I shall not remain here the week which you
mention, but quit at once this house, which I wish I had never entered.Rigby, you are now lord of Monmouth House, and yet I cannot
help feeling you too will be discharged before he dies.'Rigby made Lady Monmouth a bow such as became the master of the
house, and then withdrew.A paragraph in the _Morning Post_, a few days after his interview with
his grandfather, announcing that Lord and Lady Monmouth had quitted town
for the baths of Kissengen, startled Coningsby, who called the same day
at Monmouth House in consequence.There he learnt more authentic details
of their unexpected movements.It appeared that Lady Monmouth had
certainly departed; and the porter, with a rather sceptical visage,
informed Coningsby that Lord Monmouth was to follow; but when, he could
not tell.At present his Lordship was at Brighton, and in a few days was
about to take possession of a villa at Richmond, which had for some time
been fitting up for him under the superintendence of Mr.Rigby, who, as
Coningsby also learnt, now permanently resided at Monmouth House.All
this intelligence made Coningsby ponder.He was sufficiently acquainted
with the parties concerned to feel assured that he had not learnt the
whole truth.What had really taken place, and what was the real cause of
the occurrences, were equally mystical to him: all he was convinced of
was, that some great domestic revolution had been suddenly effected.Coningsby entertained for his grandfather a sincere affection.With the
exception of their last unfortunate interview, he had experienced from
Lord Monmouth nothing but kindness both in phrase and deed.There was
also something in Lord Monmouth, when he pleased it, rather fascinating
to young men; and as Coningsby had never occasioned him any feelings but
pleasurable ones, he was always disposed to make himself delightful to
his grandson.The experience of a consummate man of the world, advanced
in life, detailed without rigidity to youth, with frankness and
facility, is bewitching.Lord Monmouth was never garrulous: he was
always pithy, and could be picturesque.He revealed a character in a
sentence, and detected the ruling passion with the hand of a master.Besides, he had seen everybody and had done everything; and though, on
the whole, too indolent for conversation, and loving to be talked to,
these were circumstances which made his too rare communications the more
precious.With these feelings, Coningsby resolved, the moment that he learned that
his grandfather was established at Richmond, to pay him a visit.He
was informed that Lord Monmouth was at home, and he was shown into a
drawing-room, where he found two French ladies in their bonnets, whom he
soon discovered to be actresses.They also had come down to pay a visit
to his grandfather, and were by no means displeased to pass the interval
that must elapse before they had that pleasure in chatting with his
grandson.Coningsby found them extremely amusing; with the finest
spirits in the world, imperturbable good temper, and an unconscious
practical philosophy that defied the devil Care and all his works.And
well it was that he found such agreeable companions, for time flowed on,
and no summons arrived to call him to his grandfather's presence, and
no herald to announce his grandfather's advent.The ladies and Coningsby
had exhausted badinage; they had examined and criticised all the
furniture, had rifled the vases of their prettiest flowers; and
Clotilde, who had already sung several times, was proposing a duet to
Ermengarde, when a servant entered, and told the ladies that a carriage
was in attendance to give them an airing, and after that Lord Monmouth
hoped they would return and dine with him; then turning to Coningsby, he
informed him, with his lord's compliments, that Lord Monmouth was sorry
he was too much engaged to see him.Nothing was to be done but to put a tolerably good face upon it.'Embrace Lord Monmouth for me,' said Coningsby to his fair friends, 'and
tell him I think it very unkind that he did not ask me to dinner with
you.'Coningsby said this with a gay air, but really with a depressed spirit.He felt convinced that his grandfather was deeply displeased with him;
and as he rode away from the villa, he could not resist the strong
impression that he was destined never to re-enter it.It so happened that the idle message which Coningsby had left
for his grandfather, and which he never seriously supposed for a moment
that his late companions would have given their host, operated entirely
in his favour.Whatever were the feelings with respect to Coningsby at
the bottom of Lord Monmouth's heart, he was actuated in his refusal to
see him not more from displeasure than from an anticipatory horror of
something like a scene.Even a surrender from Coningsby without terms,
and an offer to declare himself a candidate for Darlford, or to do
anything else that his grandfather wished, would have been disagreeable
to Lord Monmouth in his present mood.As in politics a revolution is
often followed by a season of torpor, so in the case of Lord Monmouth
the separation from his wife, which had for a long period occupied his
meditation, was succeeded by a vein of mental dissipation.He did not
wish to be reminded by anything or any person that he had still in
some degree the misfortune of being a responsible member of society.He wanted to be surrounded by individuals who were above or below the
conventional interests of what is called 'the World.'He wanted to hear
nothing of those painful and embarrassing influences which from our
contracted experience and want of enlightenment we magnify into such
undue importance.For this purpose he wished to have about him persons
whose knowledge of the cares of life concerned only the means of
existence, and whose sense of its objects referred only to the sources
of enjoyment; persons who had not been educated in the idolatry of
Respectability; that is to say, of realising such an amount of what is
termed character by a hypocritical deference to the prejudices of the
community as may enable them, at suitable times, and under convenient
circumstances and disguises, to plunder the public.With these feelings, Lord Monmouth recoiled at this moment from
grandsons and relations and ties of all kinds.He did not wish to be
reminded of his identity, but to swim unmolested and undisturbed in
his Epicurean dream.When, therefore, his fair visitors; Clotilde, who
opened her mouth only to breathe roses and diamonds, and Ermengarde, who
was so good-natured that she sacrificed even her lovers to her friends;
saw him merely to exclaim at the same moment, and with the same voices
of thrilling joyousness,--

'Why did not you ask him to dinner?'And then, without waiting for his reply, entered with that rapidity of
elocution which Frenchwomen can alone command into the catalogue of his
charms and accomplishments, Lord Monmouth began to regret that he really
had not seen Coningsby, who, it appeared, might have greatly contributed
to the pleasure of the day.The message, which was duly given,
however, settled the business.Lord Monmouth felt that any chance of
explanations, or even allusions to the past, was out of the question;
and to defend himself from the accusations of his animated guests, he
said,

'Well, he shall come to dine with you next time.'There is no end to the influence of woman on our life.It is at the
bottom of everything that happens to us.And so it was, that, in spite
of all the combinations of Lucretia and Mr.Rigby, and the mortification
and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually
made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a
month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to
receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.Clotilde and Ermengarde had wits as sparkling
as their eyes.There was a manager of the Opera, a great friend of
Villebecque, and his wife, a splendid lady, who had been a prima donna
of celebrity, and still had a commanding voice for a chamber; a Carlist
nobleman who lived upon his traditions, and who, though without a sou,
could tell of a festival given by his family, before the revolution,
which had cost a million of francs; and a Neapolitan physician, in whom
Lord Monmouth had great confidence, and who himself believed in the
elixir vitae, made up the party, with Lucian Gay, Coningsby, and Mr.Our hero remarked that Villebecque on this occasion sat at the
bottom of the table, but Flora did not appear.In the meantime, the month which brought about this satisfactory and
at one time unexpected result was fruitful also in other circumstances
still more interesting.Coningsby and Edith met frequently, if to
breathe the same atmosphere in the same crowded saloons can be described
as meeting; ever watching each other's movements, and yet studious never
to encounter each other's glance.The charms of Miss Millbank had
become an universal topic, they were celebrated in ball-rooms, they were
discussed at clubs: Edith was the beauty of the season.All admired her,
many sighed even to express their admiration; but the devotion of Lord
Beaumanoir, who always hovered about her, deterred them from a rivalry
which might have made the boldest despair.As for Coningsby, he passed
his life principally with the various members of the Sydney family, and
was almost daily riding with Lady Everingham and her sister, generally
accompanied by Lord Henry and his friend Eustace Lyle, between whom,
indeed, and Coningsby there were relations of intimacy scarcely less
inseparable.Coningsby had spoken to Lady Everingham of the rumoured
marriage of her elder brother, and found, although the family had not
yet been formally apprised of it, she entertained little doubt of
its ultimate occurrence.She admired Miss Millbank, with whom her
acquaintance continued slight; and she wished, of course, that her
brother should marry and be happy.'But Percy is often in love,' she
would add, 'and never likes us to be very intimate with his inamoratas.He thinks it destroys the romance; and that domestic familiarity may
compromise his heroic character.However,' she added, 'I really believe
that will be a match.'On the whole, though he bore a serene aspect to the world, Coningsby
passed this month in a state of restless misery.His soul was brooding
on one subject, and he had no confidant: he could not resist the spell
that impelled him to the society where Edith might at least be seen, and
the circle in which he lived was one in which her name was frequently
mentioned.Alone, in his solitary rooms in the Albany, he felt all his
desolation; and often a few minutes before he figured in the world,
apparently followed and courted by all, he had been plunged in the
darkest fits of irremediable wretchedness.He had, of course, frequently met Lady Wallinger, but their salutations,
though never omitted, and on each side cordial, were brief.There seemed
to be a tacit understanding between them not to refer to a subject
fruitful in painful reminiscences.In the fulfilment of a project originally formed
in the playing-fields of Eton, often recurred to at Cambridge, and
cherished with the fondness with which men cling to a scheme of early
youth, Coningsby, Henry Sydney, Vere, and Buckhurst had engaged some
moors together this year; and in a few days they were about to quit town
for Scotland.They had pressed Eustace Lyle to accompany them, but he,
who in general seemed to have no pleasure greater than their society,
had surprised them by declining their invitation, with some vague
mention that he rather thought he should go abroad.It was the last day of July, and all the world were at a breakfast
given, at a fanciful cottage situate in beautiful gardens on the banks
of the Thames, by Lady Everingham.The weather was as bright as the
romances of Boccaccio; there were pyramids of strawberries, in bowls
colossal enough to hold orange-trees; and the choicest band filled the
air with enchanting strains, while a brilliant multitude sauntered on
turf like velvet, or roamed in desultory existence amid the quivering
shades of winding walks.'My fete was prophetic,' said Lady Everingham, when she saw Coningsby.'I am glad it is connected with an incident.Tell me what we are to
celebrate.''Then I, too, will prophesy, and name the hero of the romance, Eustace
Lyle.''You have been more prescient than I,' said Lady Everingham, 'perhaps
because I was thinking too much of some one else.''It seems to me an union which all must acknowledge perfect.I have had my suspicions a long time; and when
Eustace refused to go to the moors with us, though I said nothing, I was
convinced.''At any rate,' said Lady Everingham, sighing, with a rather smiling
face, 'we are kinsfolk, Mr.Coningsby; though I would gladly have wished
to have been more.'Happiness,' he
added, in a mournful tone, 'I fear can never be mine.''tis a tale too strange and sorrowful for a day when, like Seged,
we must all determine to be happy.''Here comes a group that will make you gay,' said Coningsby as he
moved on.Edith and the Wallingers, accompanied by Lord Beaumanoir, Mr.Melton, and Sir Charles Buckhurst, formed the party.They seemed profuse
in their congratulations to Lady Everingham, having already learnt the
intelligence from her brother.Coningsby stopped to speak to Lady St.Julians, who had still a daughter
to marry.Both Augustina, who was at Coningsby Castle, and Clara
Isabella, who ought to have been there, had each secured the right man.But Adelaide Victoria had now appeared, and Lady St.Julians had a great
regard for the favourite grandson of Lord Monmouth, and also for the
influential friend of Lord Vere and Sir Charles Buckhurst.In case
Coningsby did not determine to become her son-in-law himself, he might
counsel either of his friends to a judicious decision on an inevitable
act.Ormsby, who seemed
occupied with some delicacies.no, no, no; those days are passed.I think there is a little
easterly wind with all this fine appearance.''I am for in-door nature myself,' said Lord Eskdale.'Do you know, I do
not half like the way Monmouth is going on?He never gets out of that
villa of his.'I had a letter from her to-day: she writes in good spirits.I am sorry
it broke up, and yet I never thought it would last so long.''I gave them two years,' said Mr.'Lord Monmouth lived with his
first wife two years.And afterwards with the Mirandola at Milan, at
least nearly two years; it was a year and ten months.I must know,
for he called me in to settle affairs.I took the lady to the baths at
Lucca, on the pretence that Monmouth would meet us there.I remember I wanted
to bet Cassilis, at White's, on it when he married; but I thought, being
his intimate friend; the oldest friend he has, indeed, and one of his
trustees; it was perhaps as well not to do it.''You should have made the bet with himself,' said Lord Eskdale, 'and
then there never would have been a separation.''Hah, hah, hah!About an hour after this, Coningsby, who had just quitted the Duchess,
met, on a terrace by the river, Lady Wallinger, walking with Mrs.Guy
Flouncey and a Russian Prince, whom that lady was enchanting.Coningsby
was about to pass with some slight courtesy, but Lady Wallinger stopped
and would speak to him, on slight subjects, the weather and the fete,
but yet adroitly enough managed to make him turn and join her.Guy Flouncey walked on a little before with her Russian admirer.Lady
Wallinger followed with Coningsby.'The match that has been proclaimed to-day has greatly surprised me,'
said Lady Wallinger.said Coningsby: 'I confess I was long prepared for it.And it
seems to me the most natural alliance conceivable, and one that every
one must approve.''Lady Everingham seems much surprised at it.'Lady Everingham is a brilliant personage, and cannot deign to
observe obvious circumstances.'Coningsby, that I always thought you were engaged to
Lady Theresa?''Indeed, we were informed more than a month ago that you were positively
going to be married to her.''I am not one of those who can shift their affections with such
rapidity, Lady Wallinger.''You remember our meeting you on the
stairs at ---- House, Mr.'Edith had just been informed that you were going to be married to Lady
Theresa.''Not surely by him to whom she is herself going to be married?''I am not aware that she is going to be married to any one.Lord
Beaumanoir admires her, has always admired her.But Edith has given
him no encouragement, at least gave him no encouragement as long as she
believed; but why dwell on such an unhappy subject, Mr.I
am to blame; I have been to blame perhaps before, but indeed I think it
cruel, very cruel, that Edith and you are kept asunder.''You have always been my best, my dearest friend, and are the most
amiable and admirable of women.But tell me, is it indeed true that
Edith is not going to be married?'Guy Flouncey turned round, and assuring Lady
Wallinger that the Prince and herself had agreed to refer some point
to her about the most transcendental ethics of flirtation, this deeply
interesting conversation was arrested, and Lady Wallinger, with
becoming suavity, was obliged to listen to the lady's lively appeal of
exaggerated nonsense and the Prince's affected protests, while Coningsby
walked by her side, pale and agitated, and then offered his arm to Lady
Wallinger, which she accepted with an affectionate pressure.At the end
of the terrace they met some other guests, and soon were immersed in the
multitude that thronged the lawn.'There is Sir Joseph,' said Lady Wallinger, and Coningsby looked up,
and saw Edith on his arm.Lord
Beaumanoir was there, but he seemed to shrink into nothing to-day before
Buckhurst, who was captivated for the moment by Edith, and hearing
that no knight was resolute enough to try a fall with the Marquess, was
impelled by his talent for action to enter the lists.He had talked down
everybody, unhorsed every cavalier.Nobody had a chance against him:
he answered all your questions before you asked them; contradicted
everybody with the intrepidity of a Rigby; annihilated your anecdotes by
historiettes infinitely more piquant; and if anybody chanced to make a
joke which he could not excel, declared immediately that it was a Joe
Miller.He was absurd, extravagant, grotesque, noisy; but he was young,
rattling, and interesting, from his health and spirits.Edith was
extremely amused by him, and was encouraging by her smile his spiritual
excesses, when they all suddenly met Lady Wallinger and Coningsby.The eyes of Edith and Coningsby met for the first time since they so
cruelly encountered on the staircase of ---- House.A deep, quick blush
suffused her face, her eyes gleamed with a sudden coruscation; suddenly
and quickly she put forth her hand.he presses once more that hand which permanently to retain is the
passion of his life, yet which may never be his!It seemed that for the
ravishing delight of that moment he could have borne with cheerfulness
all the dark and harrowing misery of the year that had passed away since
he embraced her in the woods of Hellingsley, and pledged his faith by
the waters of the rushing Darl.He seized the occasion which offered itself, a moment to walk by her
side, and to snatch some brief instants of unreserved communion.'And now we are to each other as before?''And will be, come what come may.'CHAPTER I.


It was merry Christmas at St.There was a yule log blazing
on every hearth in that wide domain, from the hall of the squire to the
peasant's roof.The Buttery Hatch was open for the whole week from noon
to sunset; all comers might take their fill, and each carry away as much
bold beef, white bread, and jolly ale as a strong man could bear in
a basket with one hand.For every woman a red cloak, and a coat of
broadcloth for every man.All day long, carts laden with fuel and warm
raiment were traversing the various districts, distributing comfort and
dispensing cheer.For a Christian gentleman of high degree was Eustace
Lyle.Within his hall, too, he holds his revel, and his beauteous bride
welcomes their guests, from her noble parents to the faithful tenants of
the house.All classes are mingled in the joyous equality that becomes
the season, at once sacred and merry.There are carols for the eventful
eve, and mummers for the festive day.The Duke and Duchess, and every member of the family, had consented this
year to keep their Christmas with the newly-married couple.Coningsby,
too, was there, and all his friends.The party was numerous, gay,
hearty, and happy; for they were all united by sympathy.They were planning that Henry Sydney should be appointed Lord of
Misrule, or ordained Abbot of Unreason at the least, so successful had
been his revival of the Mummers, the Hobby-horse not forgotten.Their host had entrusted to Lord Henry the restoration of many old
observances; and the joyous feeling which this celebration of Christmas
had diffused throughout an extensive district was a fresh argument in
favour of Lord Henry's principle, that a mere mechanical mitigation of
the material necessities of the humbler classes, a mitigation which must
inevitably be limited, can never alone avail sufficiently to ameliorate
their condition; that their condition is not merely 'a knife and fork
question,' to use the coarse and shallow phrase of the Utilitarian
school; that a simple satisfaction of the grosser necessities of our
nature will not make a happy people; that you must cultivate the heart
as well as seek to content the belly; and that the surest means to
elevate the character of the people is to appeal to their affections.There is nothing more interesting than to trace predisposition.An
indefinite, yet strong sympathy with the peasantry of the realm had been
one of the characteristic sensibilities of Lord Henry at Eton.Yet a
schoolboy, he had busied himself with their pastimes and the details of
their cottage economy.As he advanced in life the horizon of his views
expanded with his intelligence and his experience; and the son of one of
the noblest of our houses, to whom the delights of life are offered with
fatal facility, on the very threshold of his career he devoted his
time and thought, labour and life, to one vast and noble purpose, the
elevation of the condition of the great body of the people.'I vote for Buckhurst being Lord of Misrule,' said Lord Henry: 'I will
be content with being his gentleman usher.''It shall be put to the vote,' said Lord Vere.'No one has a chance against Buckhurst,' said Coningsby.'Now, Sir Charles,' said Lady Everingham, 'your absolute sway is about
to commence.'The first thing must be my formal installation,' said Buckhurst.'I
vote the Boar's head be carried in procession thrice round the hall, and
Beau shall be the champion to challenge all who may question my right.Duke, you shall be my chief butler, the Duchess my herb-woman.She is to
walk before me, and scatter rosemary.Coningsby shall carry the Boar's
head; Lady Theresa and Lady Everingham shall sing the canticle; Lord
Everingham shall be marshal of the lists, and put all in the stocks who
are found sober and decorous; Lyle shall be the palmer from the Holy
Land, and Vere shall ride the Hobby-horse.Some must carry cups of
Hippocras, some lighted tapers; all must join in chorus.'He ceased his instructions, and all hurried away to carry them into
effect.Some hastily arrayed themselves in fanciful dresses, the ladies
in robes of white, with garlands of flowers; some drew pieces of armour
from the wall, and decked themselves with helm and hauberk; others waved
ancient banners.They brought in the Boar's head on a large silver dish,
and Coningsby raised it aloft.They formed into procession, the Duchess
distributing rosemary; Buckhurst swaggering with all the majesty of
Tamerlane, his mock court irresistibly humorous with their servility;
and the sweet voice of Lady Everingham chanting the first verse of the
canticle, followed in the second by the rich tones of Lady Theresa:

  I.
        Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade in hande bring I,
  With garlandes gay and rosemary:
  I pray you all singe merrily,
        Qui estis in convivio.Caput Apri defero
        Reddens laudes Domino.The Boar's heade I understande
  Is the chief servyce in this lande
  Loke whereever it be fande,
        Servite cum cantico.Then they stopped; and the Lord
of Misrule ascended his throne, and his courtiers formed round him
in circle.Behind him they held the ancient banners and waved their
glittering arms, and placed on a lofty and illuminated pedestal the
Boar's head covered with garlands.It was a good picture, and the Lord
of Misrule sustained his part with untiring energy.He was addressing
his court in a pompous rhapsody of merry nonsense, when a servant
approached Coningsby, and told him that he was wanted without.A despatch had arrived for him from
London.Without any prescience of its purpose, he nevertheless broke
the seal with a trembling hand.His presence was immediately desired in
town: Lord Monmouth was dead.This was a crisis in the life of Coningsby; yet, like many critical
epochs, the person most interested in it was not sufficiently aware
of its character.The first feeling which he experienced at the
intelligence was sincere affliction.He was fond of his grandfather; had
received great kindness from him, and at a period of life when it was
most welcome.The neglect and hardships of his early years, instead of
leaving a prejudice against one who, by some, might be esteemed their
author, had by their contrast only rendered Coningsby more keenly
sensible of the solicitude and enjoyment which had been lavished on his
happy youth.The next impression on his mind was undoubtedly a natural and reasonable
speculation on the effect of this bereavement on his fortunes.Lord
Monmouth had more than once assured Coningsby that he had provided for
him as became a near relative to whom he was attached, and in a manner
which ought to satisfy the wants and wishes of an English gentleman.The
allowance which Lord Monmouth had made him, as considerable as usually
accorded to the eldest sons of wealthy peers, might justify him in
estimating his future patrimony as extremely ample.He was aware,
indeed, that at a subsequent period his grandfather had projected for
him fortunes of a still more elevated character.He looked to Coningsby
as the future representative of an ancient barony, and had been
purchasing territory with the view of supporting the title.But
Coningsby did not by any means firmly reckon on these views being
realised.He had a suspicion that in thwarting the wishes of his
grandfather in not becoming a candidate for Darlford, he had at the
moment arrested arrangements which, from the tone of Lord Monmouth's
communication, he believed were then in progress for that purpose;
and he thought it improbable, with his knowledge of his grandfather's
habits, that Lord Monmouth had found either time or inclination to
resume before his decease the completion of these plans.Indeed there
was a period when, in adopting the course which he pursued with respect
to Darlford, Coningsby was well aware that he perilled more than the
large fortune which was to accompany the barony.Had not a separation
between Lord Monmouth and his wife taken place simultaneously with
Coningsby's difference with his grandfather, he was conscious that the
consequences might have been even altogether fatal to his prospects; but
the absence of her evil influence at such a conjuncture, its permanent
removal, indeed, from the scene, coupled with his fortunate though not
formal reconciliation with Lord Monmouth, had long ago banished from his
memory all those apprehensions to which he had felt it impossible at the
time to shut his eyes.Before he left town for Scotland he had made a
farewell visit to his grandfather, who, though not as cordial as in
old days, had been gracious; and Coningsby, during his excursion to the
moors, and his various visits to the country, had continued at intervals
to write to his grandfather, as had been for some years his custom.On
the whole, with an indefinite feeling which, in spite of many a rational
effort, did nevertheless haunt his mind, that this great and sudden
event might exercise a vast and beneficial influence on his worldly
position, Coningsby could not but feel some consolation in the
affliction which he sincerely experienced, in the hope that he might at
all events now offer to Edith a home worthy of her charms, her virtues,
and her love.Although he had not seen her since their hurried yet sweet
reconciliation in the gardens of Lady Everingham, Coningsby was never
long without indirect intelligence of the incidents of her life; and the
correspondence between Lady Everingham and Henry Sydney, while they
were at the moors, had apprised him that Lord Beaumanoir's suit had
terminated unsuccessfully almost immediately after his brother had
quitted London.It was late in the evening when Coningsby arrived in town: he called at
once on Lord Eskdale, who was one of Lord Monmouth's executors; and he
persuaded Coningsby, whom he saw depressed, to dine with him alone.'You should not be seen at a club,' said the good-natured peer; 'and I
remember myself in old days what was the wealth of an Albanian larder.'Lord Eskdale, at dinner, talked frankly of the disposition of Lord
Monmouth's property.He spoke as a matter of course that Coningsby was
his grandfather's principal heir.'I don't know whether you will be happier with a large fortune?''It is a troublesome thing: nobody is satisfied with
what you do with it; very often not yourself.To maintain an equable
expenditure; not to spend too much on one thing, too little on another,
is an art.There must be a harmony, a keeping, in disbursement, which
very few men have.The thing to have is about ten
thousand a year, and the world to think you have only five.There is
some enjoyment then; one is let alone.But the instant you have a large
fortune, duties commence.And then impudent fellows borrow your money;
and if you ask them for it again, they go about town saying you are a
screw.'Lord Monmouth had died suddenly at his Richmond villa, which latterly
he never quitted, at a little supper, with no persons near him but those
who were amusing.He suddenly found he could not lift his glass to his
lips, and being extremely polite, waited a few minutes before he asked
Clotilde, who was singing a sparkling drinking-song, to do him that
service.When, in accordance with his request, she reached him, it was
too late.The ladies shrieked, being frightened: at first they were
in despair, but, after reflection, they evinced some intention of
plundering the house.Villebecque, who was absent at the moment, arrived
in time; and everybody became orderly and broken-hearted.The body had been removed to Monmouth House, where it had been embalmed
and laid in state.There was
nobody in town; some distinguished connections, however, came up from
the country, though it was a period inconvenient for such movements.After the funeral, the will was to be read in the principal saloon of
Monmouth House, one of those gorgeous apartments that had excited the
boyish wonder of Coningsby on his first visit to that paternal roof, and
now hung in black, adorned with the escutcheon of the deceased peer.The testamentary dispositions of the late lord were still unknown,
though the names of his executors had been announced by his family
solicitor, in whose custody the will and codicils had always remained.The executors under the will were Lord Eskdale, Mr.By a subsequent appointment Sidonia had been added.Coningsby, who had been chief mourner,
stood on the right hand of the solicitor, who sat at the end of a long
table, round which, in groups, were ranged all who had attended the
funeral, including several of the superior members of the household,
among them M. Villebecque.The solicitor rose and explained that though Lord Monmouth had been in
the habit of very frequently adding codicils to his will, the original
will, however changed or modified, had never been revoked; it was
therefore necessary to commence by reading that instrument.So saying,
he sat down, and breaking the seals of a large packet, he produced the
will of Philip Augustus, Marquess of Monmouth, which had been retained
in his custody since its execution.By this will, of the date of 1829, the sum of 10,000_l._ was left to
Coningsby, then unknown to his grandfather; the same sum to Mr.There was a great number of legacies, none of superior amount, most of
them of less: these were chiefly left to old male companions, and women
in various countries.There was an almost inconceivable number of small
annuities to faithful servants, decayed actors, and obscure foreigners.The residue of his personal estate was left to four gentlemen, three of
whom had quitted this world before the legator; the bequests, therefore,
had lapsed.The fourth residuary legatee, in whom, according to the
terms of the will, all would have consequently centred, was Mr.There followed several codicils which did not materially affect the
previous disposition; one of them leaving a legacy of 20,000_l._ to
the Princess Colonna; until they arrived at the latter part of the year
1832, when a codicil increased the 10,000_l._ left under the will to
Coningsby to 50,000_l._.After Coningsby's visit to the Castle in 1836 a very important change
occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.The legacy of
50,000_l._ in his favour was revoked, and the same sum left to the
Princess Lucretia.A similar amount was bequeathed to Mr.Rigby; and
Coningsby was left sole residuary legatee.An estate of about
nine thousand a year, which Lord Monmouth had himself purchased, and was
therefore in his own disposition, was left to Coningsby.Rigby was reduced to 20,000_l._, and the whole of his residue left
to his issue by Lady Monmouth.In case he died without issue, the estate
bequeathed to Coningsby to be taken into account, and the residue then
to be divided equally between Lady Monmouth and his grandson.It was
under this instrument that Sidonia had been appointed an executor and
to whom Lord Monmouth left, among others, the celebrated picture of
the Holy Family by Murillo, as his friend had often admired it.To Lord
Eskdale he left all his female miniatures, and to Mr.Ormsby his rare
and splendid collection of French novels, and all his wines, except his
Tokay, which he left, with his library, to Sir Robert Peel; though this
legacy was afterwards revoked, in consequence of Sir Robert's conduct
about the Irish corporations.The solicitor paused and begged permission to send for a glass of water.While this was arranging there was a murmur at the lower part of the
room, but little disposition to conversation among those in the vicinity
of the lawyer.Coningsby was silent, his brow a little knit.Rigby
was pale and restless, but said nothing.Ormsby took a pinch of
snuff, and offered his box to Lord Eskdale, who was next to him.They
exchanged glances, and made some observation about the weather.Sidonia
stood apart, with his arms folded.He had not, of course attended the
funeral, nor had he as yet exchanged any recognition with Coningsby.'Now, gentlemen,' said the solicitor, 'if you please, I will proceed.'They came to the year 1839, the year Coningsby was at Hellingsley.This
appeared to be a critical period in the fortunes of Lady Monmouth; while
Coningsby's reached to the culminating point.Rigby was reduced to
his original legacy under the will of 10,000_l._; a sum of equal amount
was bequeathed to Armand Villebecque, in acknowledgment of faithful
services; all the dispositions in favour of Lady Monmouth were revoked,
and she was limited to her moderate jointure of 3,000_l._ per annum,
under the marriage settlement; while everything, without reserve, was
left absolutely to Coningsby.A subsequent codicil determined that the 10,000_l._ left to Mr.Rigby
should be equally divided between him and Lucian Gay; but as some
compensation Lord Monmouth left to the Right Honourable Nicholas Rigby
the bust of that gentleman, which he had himself presented to his
Lordship, and which, at his desire, had been placed in the vestibule
at Coningsby Castle, from the amiable motive that after Lord Monmouth's
decease Mr.Rigby might wish, perhaps, to present it to some other
friend.Ormsby took care not to catch the eye of Mr.As for Coningsby, he saw nobody.He maintained, during the extraordinary
situation in which he was placed, a firm demeanour; but serene and
regulated as he appeared to the spectators, his nerves were really
strung to a high pitch.It bore the date of June 1840, and was
made at Brighton, immediately after the separation with Lady Monmouth.It was the sight of this instrument that sustained Rigby at this great
emergency.He had a wild conviction that, after all, it must set all
right.He felt assured that, as Lady Monmouth had already been disposed
of, it must principally refer to the disinheritance of Coningsby,
secured by Rigby's well-timed and malignant misrepresentations of what
had occurred in Lancashire during the preceding summer.And then to whom
could Lord Monmouth leave his money?However he might cut and carve up
his fortunes, Rigby, and especially at a moment when he had so served
him, must come in for a considerable slice.All the dispositions in favour of'my
grandson Harry Coningsby' were revoked; and he inherited from his
grandfather only the interest of the sum of 10,000_l._ which had been
originally bequeathed to him in his orphan boyhood.The executors had
the power of investing the principal in any way they thought proper
for his advancement in life, provided always it was not placed in 'the
capital stock of any manufactory.'Coningsby turned pale; he lost his abstracted look; he caught the eye
of Rigby; he read the latent malice of that nevertheless anxious
countenance.What passed through the mind and being of Coningsby was
thought and sensation enough for a year; but it was as the flash that
reveals a whole country, yet ceases to be ere one can say it lightens.There was a revelation to him of an inward power that should baffle
these conventional calamities, a natural and sacred confidence in his
youth and health, and knowledge and convictions.Even the recollection
of Edith was not unaccompanied with some sustaining associations.At
least the mightiest foe to their union was departed.All this was the impression of an instant, simultaneous with the reading
of the words of form with which the last testamentary disposition of the
Marquess of Monmouth left the sum of 30,000_l._ to Armand Villebecque;
and all the rest, residue, and remainder of his unentailed property,
wheresoever and whatsoever it might be, amounting in value to nearly a
million sterling, was given, devised, and bequeathed to Flora, commonly
called Flora Villebecque, the step-child of the said Armand Villebecque,
'but who is my natural daughter by Marie Estelle Matteau, an actress at
the Theatre Francais in the years 1811-15, by the name of Stella.'said Coningsby, with a grave rather than agitated
countenance, to Sidonia, as his friend came up to greet him, without,
however, any expression of condolence.'This time next year you will not think so,' said Sidonia.'The principal annoyance of this sort of miscarriage,' said Sidonia,
'is the condolence of the gentle world.For the present we
will not speak of it.'So saying, Sidonia good-naturedly got Coningsby
out of the room.They walked together to Sidonia's house in Carlton Gardens, neither of
them making the slightest allusion to the catastrophe; Sidonia inquiring
where he had been, what he had been doing, since they last met, and
himself conversing in his usual vein, though with a little more feeling
in his manner than was his custom.When they had arrived there, Sidonia
ordered their dinner instantly, and during the interval between the
command and its appearance, he called Coningsby's attention to an old
German painting he had just received, its brilliant colouring and quaint
costumes.'Eat, and an appetite will come,' said Sidonia, when he observed
Coningsby somewhat reluctant.'Take some of that Chablis: it will put
you right; you will find it delicious.'In this way some twenty minutes passed; their meal was over, and they
were alone together.'I have been thinking all this time of your position,' said Sidonia.'A sorry one, I fear,' said Coningsby.'I really cannot see that,' said his friend.'You have experienced this
morning a disappointment, but not a calamity.If you had lost your eye
it would have been a calamity: no combination of circumstances could
have given you another.There are really no miseries except natural
miseries; conventional misfortunes are mere illusions.What seems
conventionally, in a limited view, a great misfortune, if subsequently
viewed in its results, is often the happiest incident in one's life.''I hope the day may come when I may feel this.''Now is the moment when philosophy is of use; that is to say, now is
the moment when you should clearly comprehend the circumstances which
surround you.You think, for
example, that you have just experienced a great calamity, because you
have lost the fortune on which you counted?''I ask you again, which would you have rather lost, your grandfather's
inheritance or your right leg?''Most certainly my inheritance,'

'Or your left arm?''Would you have received the inheritance on condition that your front
teeth should be knocked out?''Would you have given up a year of your life for that fortune trebled?''Even at twenty-three I would have refused the terms.''Come, come, Coningsby, the calamity cannot be very great.''Why, you have put it in an ingenious point of view; and yet it is
not so easy to convince a man, that he should be content who has lost
everything.''You have a great many things at this moment that you separately prefer
to the fortune that you have forfeited.How then can you be said to have
lost everything?''You have health, youth, good looks, great abilities, considerable
knowledge, a fine courage, a lofty spirit, and no contemptible
experience.With each of these qualities one might make a fortune; the
combination ought to command the highest.''You console me,' said Coningsby, with a faint blush and a fainter
smile.I think you are a most
fortunate young man; I should not have thought you more fortunate if
you had been your grandfather's heir; perhaps less so.But I wish you
to comprehend your position: if you understand it you will cease to
lament.''Bring your intelligence to bear on the right object.I make you no
offers of fortune, because I know you would not accept them, and indeed
I have no wish to see you a lounger in life.If you had inherited a
great patrimony, it is possible your natural character and previous
culture might have saved you from its paralysing influence; but it is a
question, even with you.Now you are free; that is to say, you are free,
if you are not in debt.A man who has not seen the world, whose fancy is
harassed with glittering images of pleasures he has never experienced,
cannot live on 300_l._ per annum; but you can.You have nothing to haunt
your thoughts, or disturb the abstraction of your studies.You have seen
the most beautiful women; you have banqueted in palaces; you know what
heroes, and wits, and statesmen are made of: and you can draw on
your memory instead of your imagination for all those dazzling and
interesting objects that make the inexperienced restless, and are the
cause of what are called scrapes.But you can do nothing if you be in
debt.Before, therefore, we proceed, I must beg you
to be frank on this head.If you have any absolute or contingent
incumbrances, tell me of them without reserve, and permit me to clear
them at once to any amount.You will sensibly oblige me in so doing:
because I am interested in watching your career, and if the racer start
with a clog my psychological observations will be imperfect.''You are, indeed, a friend; and had I debts I would ask you to pay
them.My grandfather was so lavish in his
allowance to me that I never got into difficulties.Besides, there
are horses and things without end which I must sell, and money at
Drummonds'.''That will produce your outfit, whatever the course you adopt.I
conceive there are two careers which deserve your consideration.In the
first place there is Diplomacy.If you decide upon that, I can assist
you.There exist between me and the Minister such relations that I can
at once secure you that first step which is so difficult to obtain.After that, much, if not all, depends on yourself.But I could advance
you, provided you were capable.You should, at least, not languish for
want of preferment.In an important post, I could throw in your way
advantages which would soon permit you to control cabinets.I doubt not your success, and for such a career,
speedy.Suppose
yourself in a dozen years a Plenipotentiary at a chief court, or at
a critical post, with a red ribbon and the Privy Council in immediate
perspective; and, after a lengthened career, a pension and a peerage.A Diplomatist is, after all,
a phantom.There is a want of nationality about his being.I always look
upon Diplomatists as the Hebrews of politics; without country, political
creeds, popular convictions, that strong reality of existence which
pervades the career of an eminent citizen in a free and great country.''You read my thoughts,' said Coningsby.'I should be sorry to sever
myself from England.''There remains then the other, the greater, the nobler career,' said
Sidonia, 'which in England may give you all, the Bar.I am absolutely
persuaded that with the requisite qualifications, and with perseverance,
success at the Bar is certain.It may be retarded or precipitated by
circumstances, but cannot be ultimately affected.You have a right to
count with your friends on no lack of opportunities when you are ripe
for them.You appear to me to have all the qualities necessary for the
Bar; and you may count on that perseverance which is indispensable, for
the reason I have before mentioned, because it will be sustained by your
experience.''I have resolved,' said Coningsby; 'I will try for the Great Seal.'Alone in his chambers, no longer under the sustaining influence of
Sidonia's converse and counsel, the shades of night descending
and bearing gloom to the gloomy, all the excitement of his spirit
evaporated, the heart of Coningsby sank.All now depended on himself,
and in that self he had no trust.And even success
could only be conducted to him by the course of many years.His career,
even if prosperous, was now to commence by the greatest sacrifice which
the heart of man could be called upon to sustain.Upon the stern altar
of his fortunes he must immolate his first and enduring love.Before,
he had a perilous position to offer Edith; now he had none.The future
might then have aided them; there was no combination which could improve
his present.Under any circumstances he must, after all his thoughts and
studies, commence a new novitiate, and before he could enter the arena
must pass years of silent and obscure preparation.He looked up, his eye caught that drawing of the towers of Hellingsley
which she had given him in the days of their happy hearts.That was all
that was to remain of their loves.He was to bear it to the future
scene of his labours, to remind him through revolving years of toil and
routine, that he too had had his romance, had roamed in fair gardens,
and whispered in willing ears the secrets of his passion.That drawing
was to become the altar-piece of his life.Coningsby passed an agitated night of broken sleep, waking often with a
consciousness of having experienced some great misfortune, yet with an
indefinite conception of its nature.It was a gloomy day, a raw north-easter blowing up the cloisters of
the Albany, in which the fog was lingering, the newspaper on his
breakfast-table, full of rumoured particulars of his grandfather's
will, which had of course been duly digested by all who knew him.To the bright, bracing morn of that merry
Christmas!That radiant and cheerful scene, and those gracious and
beaming personages, seemed another world and order of beings to the
one he now inhabited, and the people with whom he must now commune.It was the wild excitement of despair, the frenzied
hope that blends inevitably with absolute ruin, that could alone have
inspired such a hallucination!His
energies could rally no more.He gave orders that he was at home to no
one; and in his morning gown and slippers, with his feet resting on the
fireplace, the once high-souled and noble-hearted Coningsby delivered
himself up to despair.The day passed in a dark trance rather than a reverie.He was like a particle of chaos; at the best,
a glimmering entity of some shadowy Hades.Towards evening the wind
changed, the fog dispersed, there came a clear starry night, brisk and
bright.Coningsby roused himself, dressed, and wrapping his cloak around
him, sallied forth.Once more in the mighty streets, surrounded by
millions, his petty griefs and personal fortunes assumed their proper
position.Well had Sidonia taught him, view everything in its relation
to the rest.Here was the mightiest of
modern cities; the rival even of the most celebrated of the ancient.Whether he inherited or forfeited fortunes, what was it to the passing
throng?They would not share his splendour, or his luxury, or his
comfort.But a word from his lip, a thought from his brain, expressed
at the right time, at the right place, might turn their hearts, might
influence their passions, might change their opinions, might affect
their destiny.As civilisation
advances, the accidents of life become each day less important.The power of man, his greatness and his glory, depend on essential
qualities.Brains every day become more precious than blood.You must
give men new ideas, you must teach them new words, you must modify
their manners, you must change their laws, you must root out prejudices,
subvert convictions, if you wish to be great.Greatness no longer
depends on rentals, the world is too rich; nor on pedigrees, the world
is too knowing.'The greatness of this city destroys my misery,' said Coningsby, 'and my
genius shall conquer its greatness.'This conviction of power in the midst of despair was a revelation of
intrinsic strength.It is indeed the test of a creative spirit.From
that moment all petty fears for an ordinary future quitted him.He felt
that he must be prepared for great sacrifices, for infinite suffering;
that there must devolve on him a bitter inheritance of obscurity,
struggle, envy, and hatred, vulgar prejudice, base criticism, petty
hostilities, but the dawn would break, and the hour arrive, when the
welcome morning hymn of his success and his fame would sound and be
re-echoed.He returned to his rooms; calm, resolute.He slept the deep sleep of
a man void of anxiety, that has neither hope nor fear to haunt his
visions, but is prepared to rise on the morrow collected for the great
human struggle.Fresh, vigorous, not rash or precipitate, yet
determined to lose no time in idle meditation, Coningsby already
resolved at once to quit his present residence, was projecting a visit
to some legal quarter, where he intended in future to reside, when his
servant brought him a note.Coningsby, with
great earnestness, to do her the honour and the kindness of calling on
her at his earliest convenience, at the hotel in Brook Street where she
now resided.It was an interview which Coningsby would rather have avoided; yet it
seemed to him, after a moment's reflection, neither just, nor kind, nor
manly, to refuse her request.She was, after
all, his kin.Was it for a moment to be supposed that he was envious of
her lot?He replied, therefore, that in an hour he would wait upon her.In an hour, then, two individuals are to be brought together whose first
meeting was held under circumstances most strangely different.Then
Coningsby was the patron, a generous and spontaneous one, of a being
obscure, almost friendless, and sinking under bitter mortification.His favour could not be the less appreciated because he was the
chosen relative of a powerful noble.That noble was no more; his vast
inheritance had devolved on the disregarded, even despised actress,
whose suffering emotions Coningsby had then soothed, and whose fortune
had risen on the destruction of all his prospects, and the balk of all
his aspirations.Flora was alone when Coningsby was ushered into the room.The extreme
delicacy of her appearance was increased by her deep mourning; and
seated in a cushioned chair, from which she seemed to rise with an
effort, she certainly presented little of the character of a fortunate
and prosperous heiress.'You are very good to come to me,' she said, faintly smiling.Coningsby extended his hand to her affectionately, in which she placed
her own, looking down much embarrassed.'You have an agreeable situation here,' said Coningsby, trying to break
the first awkwardness of their meeting.'Yes; but I hope not to stop here long?''No; I hope never to leave England!'There was a slight pause; and then Flora sighed and said,

'I wish to speak to you on a subject that gives me pain; yet of which I
must speak.'I am sure,' said Coningsby, in a tone of great kindness, 'that you
could injure no one.''It was not mine by any right, legal or moral.There were others who
might have urged an equal claim to it; and there are many who will now
think that you might have preferred a superior one.''You had enemies; I was not one.They sought to benefit themselves by
injuring you.They have not benefited themselves; let them not say that
they have at least injured you.''We will not care what they say,' said Coningsby; 'I can sustain my
lot.'She sighed again with a downcast
glance.Then looking up embarrassed and blushing deeply, she added, 'I
wish to restore to you that fortune of which I have unconsciously and
unwillingly deprived you.''The fortune is yours, dear Flora, by every right,' said Coningsby,
much moved; 'and there is no one who wishes more fervently that it may
contribute to your happiness than I do.''It is killing me,' said Flora, mournfully; then speaking with unusual
animation, with a degree of excitement, she continued, 'I must tell what
I feel.I am happy in the inheritance, if you
generously receive it from me, because Providence has made me the means
of baffling your enemies.I never thought to be so happy as I shall be
if you will generously accept this fortune, always intended for you.I
have lived then for a purpose; I have not lived in vain; I have returned
to you some service, however humble, for all your goodness to me in my
unhappiness.''You are, as I have ever thought you, the kindest and most
tender-hearted of beings.But you misconceive our mutual positions,
my gentle Flora.The custom of the world does not permit such acts to
either of us as you contemplate.It is left you by
one on whose affections you had the highest claim.I will not say
that so large an inheritance does not bring with it an alarming
responsibility; but you are not unequal to it.You have a good heart; you have good sense; you have a
well-principled being.Your spirit will mount with your fortunes, and
blend with them.'I shall soon learn to find content, if not happiness, from other
sources,' said Coningsby; 'and mere riches, however vast, could at no
time have secured my felicity.''But they may secure that which brings felicity,' said Flora, speaking
in a choking voice, and not meeting the glance of Coningsby.'You had
some views in life which displeased him who has done all this; they may
be, they must be, affected by this fatal caprice.Speak to me, for I
cannot speak, dear Mr.Coningsby; do not let me believe that I, who
would sacrifice my life for your happiness, am the cause of such
calamities!''Whatever be my lot, I repeat I can sustain it,' said Coningsby, with a
cheek of scarlet.he is angry with me,' exclaimed Flora; 'he is angry with me!'and
the tears stole down her pale cheek.dear Flora; I have no other feelings to you than those of
affection and respect,' and Coningsby, much agitated, drew his chair
nearer to her, and took her hand.'I am gratified by these kind wishes,
though they are utterly impracticable; but they are the witnesses of
your sweet disposition and your noble spirit.There never shall exist
between us, under any circumstances, other feelings than those of kin
and kindness.'When she saw that, she started, and seemed to
summon all her energies.'You are going,' she exclaimed, 'and I have said nothing, I have said
nothing; and I shall never see you again.This fortune is yours; it must be yours.Do
not think I am speaking from a momentary impulse.I have
lived so much alone, I have had so little to deceive or to delude me,
that I know myself.If you will not let me do justice you declare my
doom.I cannot live if my existence is the cause of all your prospects
being blasted, and the sweetest dreams of your life being defeated.When
I die, these riches will be yours; that you cannot prevent.Refuse my
present offer, and you seal the fate of that unhappy Flora whose fragile
life has hung for years on the memory of your kindness.''You must not say these words, dear Flora; you must not indulge in these
gloomy feelings.You must live, and you must live happily.You have
every charm and virtue which should secure happiness.The duties and
the affections of existence will fall to your lot.It is one that will
always interest me, for I shall ever be your friend.You have conferred
on me one of the most delightful of feelings, gratitude, and for that I
bless you.CHAPTER V.


About a week after this interview with Flora, as Coningsby one morning
was about to sally forth from the Albany to visit some chambers in the
Temple, to which his notice had been attracted, there was a loud ring, a
bustle in the hall, and Henry Sydney and Buckhurst were ushered in.There never was such a cordial meeting; and yet the faces of his
friends were serious.The truth is, the paragraphs in the newspapers had
circulated in the country, they had written to Coningsby, and after a
brief delay he had confirmed their worst apprehensions.Immediately they
came up to town.Henry Sydney, a younger son, could offer little but
sympathy, but he declared it was his intention also to study for the
bar, so that they should not be divided.Buckhurst, after many embraces
and some ordinary talk, took Coningsby aside, and said, 'My dear fellow,
I have no objection to Henry Sydney hearing everything I say, but still
these are subjects which men like to be discussed in private.Of course
I expect you to share my fortune.There was something in Buckhurst's fervent resolution very lovable and a
little humorous, just enough to put one in good temper with human nature
and life.If there were any fellow's fortune in the world that Coningsby
would share, Buckhurst's would have had the preference; but while he
pressed his hand, and with a glance in which a tear and a smile seemed
to contend for mastery, he gently indicated why such arrangements were,
with our present manners, impossible.'I see,' said Buckhurst, after a moment's thought, 'I quite agree with
you.The thing cannot be done; and, to tell you the truth, a fortune
is a bore.What I vote that we three do at once is, to take plenty of
ready-money, and enter the Austrian service.'There is something in that,' said Coningsby.'In the meantime, suppose
you two fellows walk with me to the Temple, for I have an appointment to
look at some chambers.'It was a fine day, and it was by no means a gloomy walk.Though the
two friends had arrived full of indignation against Lord Monmouth, and
miserable about their companion, once more in his society, and finding
little difference in his carriage, they assumed unconsciously their
habitual tone.As for Buckhurst, he was delighted with the Temple, which
he visited for the first time.The tombs in the
church convinced him that the Crusades were the only career.He would
have himself become a law student if he might have prosecuted his
studies in chain armour.The calmer Henry Sydney was consoled for the
misfortunes of Coningsby by a fanciful project himself to pass a portion
of his life amid these halls and courts, gardens and terraces, that
maintain in the heart of a great city in the nineteenth century, so much
of the grave romance and picturesque decorum of our past manners.Henry Sydney was sanguine; he was reconciled to the disinheritance of
Coningsby by the conviction that it was a providential dispensation to
make him a Lord Chancellor.These faithful friends remained in town with Coningsby until he was
established in Paper Buildings, and had become a pupil of a celebrated
special pleader.They would have remained longer had not he himself
suggested that it was better that they should part.It seemed a terrible
catastrophe after all the visions of their boyish days, their college
dreams, and their dazzling adventures in the world.'And this is the end of Coningsby, the brilliant Coningsby, that we all
loved, that was to be our leader!'said Buckhurst to Lord Henry as
they quitted him.'Well, come what may, life has lost something of its
bloom.''The great thing now,' said Lord Henry, 'is to keep up the chain of
our friendship.We must write to him very often, and contrive to be
frequently together.It is dreadful to think that in the ways of life
our hearts may become estranged.I never felt more wretched than I do at
this moment, and yet I have faith that we shall not lose him.'said Buckhurst; 'but I feel my plan about the Austrian service
was, after all, the only thing.He might
have been prime minister; several strangers have been; and as for war,
look at Brown and Laudohn, and half a hundred others.I had a much
better chance of being a field-marshal than he has of being a Lord
Chancellor.''I feel quite convinced that Coningsby will be Lord Chancellor,' said
Henry Sydney, gravely.This change of life for Coningsby was a great social revolution.Within a month after the death of his grandfather
his name had been erased from all his fashionable clubs, and his horses
and carriages sold, and he had become a student of the Temple.He
entirely devoted himself to his new pursuit.His being was completely
absorbed in it.There was nothing to haunt his mind; no unexperienced
scene or sensation of life to distract his intelligence.One sacred
thought alone indeed there remained, shrined in the innermost sanctuary
of his heart and consciousness.But it was a tradition, no longer a
hope.The moment that he had fairly recovered from the first shock of
his grandfather's will; had clearly ascertained the consequences to
himself, and had resolved on the course to pursue; he had communicated
unreservedly with Oswald Millbank, and had renounced those pretensions
to the hand of his sister which it ill became the destitute to prefer.Millbank met Henry Sydney and
Buckhurst at the chambers of Coningsby.Once more they were all
four together; but under what different circumstances, and with what
different prospects from those which attended their separation at Eton!Alone with Coningsby, Millbank spoke to him things which letters could
not convey.He bore to him all the sympathy and devotion of Edith; but
they would not conceal from themselves that, at this moment, and in the
present state of affairs, all was hopeless.In no way did Coningsby ever
permit himself to intimate to Oswald the cause of his disinheritance.He
was, of course, silent on it to his other friends; as any communication
of the kind must have touched on a subject that was consecrated in his
inmost soul.The state of political parties in England in the spring of 1841 offered
a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated
in the first chapter of this work.The banners of the Conservative camp
at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the
Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex.The Whigs were not
yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it.The
mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining
office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national
and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and
party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into
the corps of Whig authority a kind of galvanic action, which only the
superficial could mistake for vitality.Even to form a basis for their
future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged
to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility
of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm.It was
clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.Under all the circumstances of the case, the conduct of the Whig
Cabinet, in their final propositions, cannot be described as deficient
either in boldness or prudence.The policy which they recommended was
in itself a sagacious and spirited policy; but they erred in supposing
that, at the period it was brought forward, any measure promoted by the
Whigs could have obtained general favour in the country.The Whigs were
known to be feeble; they were looked upon as tricksters.The country
knew they were opposed by a powerful party; and though there certainly
never was any authority for the belief, the country did believe that
that powerful party were influenced by great principles; had in their
view a definite and national policy; and would secure to England,
instead of a feeble administration and fluctuating opinions, energy and
a creed.The future effect of the Whig propositions of '41 will not be
detrimental to that party, even if in the interval they be appropriated
piecemeal, as will probably be the case, by their Conservative
successors.But for the moment, and in the plight in which the Whig
party found themselves, it was impossible to have devised measures more
conducive to their precipitate fall.Great interests were menaced by a
weak government.Tadpole and Taper
saw it in a moment.They snuffed the factious air, and felt the coming
storm.Notwithstanding the extreme congeniality of these worthies,
there was a little latent jealousy between them.Tadpole worshipped
Registration: Taper, adored a Cry.Tadpole always maintained that it
was the winnowing of the electoral lists that could alone gain the day;
Taper, on the contrary, faithful to ancient traditions, was ever of
opinion that the game must ultimately be won by popular clamour.It
always seemed so impossible that the Conservative party could ever be
popular; the extreme graciousness and personal popularity of the leaders
not being sufficiently apparent to be esteemed an adequate set-off
against the inveterate odium that attached to their opinions; that the
Tadpole philosophy was the favoured tenet in high places; and Taper had
had his knuckles well rapped more than once for manoeuvring too actively
against the New Poor-law, and for hiring several link-boys to bawl
a much-wronged lady's name in the Park when the Court prorogued
Parliament.And now, after all, in 1841, it seemed that Taper was right.There was
a great clamour in every quarter, and the clamour was against the Whigs
and in favour of Conservative principles.What Canadian timber-merchants
meant by Conservative principles, it is not difficult to conjecture;
or West Indian planters.It was tolerably clear on the hustings
what squires and farmers, and their followers, meant by Conservative
principles.What they mean by Conservative principles now is another
question: and whether Conservative principles mean something higher than
a perpetuation of fiscal arrangements, some of them impolitic, none of
them important.But no matter what different bodies of men understood by
the cry in which they all joined, the Cry existed.Taper beat Tadpole;
and the great Conservative party beat the shattered and exhausted Whigs.Notwithstanding the abstraction of his legal studies, Coningsby could
not be altogether insensible to the political crisis.In the political
world of course he never mixed, but the friends of his boyhood were
deeply interested in affairs, and they lost no opportunity which
he would permit them, of cultivating his society.Their occasional
fellowship, a visit now and then to Sidonia, and a call sometimes
on Flora, who lived at Richmond, comprised his social relations.His
general acquaintance did not desert him, but he was out of sight, and
did not wish to be remembered.Ormsby asked him to dinner, and
occasionally mourned over his fate in the bow window of White's; while
Lord Eskdale even went to see him in the Temple, was interested in his
progress, and said, with an encouraging look, that, when he was called
to the bar, all his friends must join and get up the steam.Rigby, who was walking with the Duke of Agincourt,
which was probably the reason he could not notice a lawyer.Lord Eskdale had obtained from Villebecque accurate details as to the
cause of Coningsby being disinherited.Our hero, if one in such fallen
fortunes may still be described as a hero, had mentioned to Lord Eskdale
his sorrow that his grandfather had died in anger with him; but Lord
Eskdale, without dwelling on the subject, had assured him that he had
reason to believe that if Lord Monmouth had lived, affairs would have
been different.He had altered the disposition of his property at a
moment of great and general irritation and excitement; and had been too
indolent, perhaps really too indisposed, which he was unwilling ever to
acknowledge, to recur to a calmer and more equitable settlement.Lord
Eskdale had been more frank with Sidonia, and had told him all about
the refusal to become a candidate for Darlford against Mr.Millbank; the
communication of Rigby to Lord Monmouth, as to the presence of Oswald
Millbank at the castle, and the love of Coningsby for his sister; all
these details, furnished by Villebecque to Lord Eskdale, had been truly
transferred by that nobleman to his co-executor; and Sidonia, when he
had sufficiently digested them, had made Lady Wallinger acquainted with
the whole history.The dissolution of the Whig Parliament by the Whigs, the project of
which had reached Lord Monmouth a year before, and yet in which nobody
believed to the last moment, at length took place.All the world was
dispersed in the heart of the season, and our solitary student of the
Temple, in his lonely chambers, notwithstanding all his efforts, found
his eye rather wander over the pages of Tidd and Chitty as he remembered
that the great event to which he had so looked forward was now
occurring, and he, after all, was no actor in the mighty drama.It was
to have been the epoch of his life; when he was to have found himself
in that proud position for which all the studies, and meditations, and
higher impulses of his nature had been preparing him.It was a keen
trial of a man.Every one of his friends and old companions were
candidates, and with sanguine prospects.Lord Henry was certain for a
division of his county; Buckhurst harangued a large agricultural
borough in his vicinity; Eustace Lyle and Vere stood in coalition for
a Yorkshire town; and Oswald Millbank solicited the suffrages of an
important manufacturing constituency.They sent their addresses to
Coningsby.He was deeply interested as he traced in them the influence
of his own mind; often recognised the very expressions to which he
had habituated them.Amid the confusion of a general election, no
unimpassioned critic had time to canvass the language of an address to
an isolated constituency; yet an intelligent speculator on the movements
of political parties might have detected in these public declarations
some intimation of new views, and of a tone of political feeling that
has unfortunately been too long absent from the public life of this
country.It was the end of a sultry July day, the last ray of the sun shooting
down Pall Mall sweltering with dust; there was a crowd round the doors
of the Carlton and the Reform Clubs, and every now and then an express
arrived with the agitating bulletin of a fresh defeat or a new triumph.He was going to dine at the Oxford
and Cambridge Club, the only club on whose list he had retained his
name, that he might occasionally have the pleasure of meeting an Eton or
Cambridge friend without the annoyance of encountering any of his former
fashionable acquaintances.The latter did not notice him, but Mr.Tadpole, more good-natured, bestowed on him a rough nod, not unmarked by
a slight expression of coarse pity.Coningsby ordered his dinner, and then took up the evening papers, where
he learnt the return of Vere and Lyle; and read a speech of Buckhurst
denouncing the Venetian Constitution, to the amazement of several
thousand persons, apparently not a little terrified by this unknown
danger, now first introduced to their notice.Being true Englishmen,
they were all against Buckhurst's opponent, who was of the Venetian
party, and who ended by calling out Buckhurst for his personalities.Coningsby had dined, and was reading in the library, when a waiter
brought up a third edition of the _Sun_, with electioneering bulletins
from the manufacturing districts to the very latest hour.Some large
letters which expressed the name of Darlford caught his eye.There
seemed great excitement in that borough; strange proceedings had
happened.The column was headed, 'Extraordinary Affair!His eye glanced over an animated speech of Mr.Millbank, his
countenance changed, his heart palpitated.Millbank had resigned
the representation of the town, but not from weakness; his avocations
demanded his presence; he had been requested to let his son supply his
place, but his son was otherwise provided for; he should always take a
deep interest in the town and trade of Darlford; he hoped that the
link between the borough and Hellingsley would be ever cherished; loud
cheering; he wished in parting from them to take a step which should
conciliate all parties, put an end to local heats and factious
contentions, and secure the town an able and worthy representative.For
these reasons he begged to propose to them a gentleman who bore a
name which many of them greatly honoured; for himself, he knew the
individual, and it was his firm opinion that whether they considered his
talents, his character, or the ancient connection of his family with
the district, he could not propose a candidate more worthy of their
confidence than HARRY CONINGSBY, ESQ.This proposition was received with that wild enthusiasm which
occasionally bursts out in the most civilised communities.The contest
between Millbank and Rigby was equally balanced, neither party was
over-confident.The Conservatives were not particularly zealous in
behalf of their champion; there was no Marquess of Monmouth and no
Coningsby Castle now to back him; he was fighting on his own resources,
and he was a beaten horse.The Liberals did not like the prospect of a
defeat, and dreaded the mortification of Rigby's triumph.The Moderate
men, who thought more of local than political circumstances, liked the
name of Coningsby.Millbank had dexterously prepared his leading
supporters for the substitution.Some traits of the character and
conduct of Coningsby had been cleverly circulated.Thus there was a
combination of many favourable causes in his favour.In half an hour's
time his image was stamped on the brain of every inhabitant of the
borough as an interesting and accomplished youth, who had been wronged,
and who deserved to be rewarded.It was whispered that Rigby was his
enemy.Rigby into the river, or to burn down his hotel, in case he was
prudent enough not to show.Rigby determined to fight to the last.All his hopes were now staked on the successful result of this contest.It were impossible if he were returned that his friends could refuse him
high office.The whole of Lord Monmouth's reduced legacy was devoted
to this end.The third edition of the _Sun_ left Mr.Rigby in vain
attempting to address an infuriated populace.Here was a revolution in the fortunes of our forlorn Coningsby!When his
grandfather first sent for him to Monmouth House, his destiny was
not verging on greater vicissitudes.He rose from his seat, and was
surprised that all the silent gentlemen who were about him did not mark
his agitation.It was now an hour
to midnight, and to-morrow the almost unconscious candidate was to go to
the poll.In a tumult of suppressed emotion, Coningsby returned to his
chambers.He found a letter in his box from Oswald Millbank, who had
been twice at the Temple.Oswald had been returned without a contest,
and had reached Darlford in time to hear Coningsby nominated.He set off
instantly to London, and left at his friend's chambers a rapid narrative
of what had happened, with information that he should call on him
again on the morrow at nine o'clock, when they were to repair together
immediately to Darlford in time for Coningsby to be chaired, for no one
entertained a doubt of his triumph.Coningsby did not sleep a wink that night, and yet when he rose early
felt fresh enough for any exploit, however difficult or hazardous.He
felt as an Egyptian does when the Nile rises after its elevation had
been despaired of.At the very lowest ebb of his fortunes, an event
had occurred which seemed to restore all.He dared not contemplate the
ultimate result of all these wonderful changes.Enough for him, that
when all seemed dark, he was about to be returned to Parliament by
the father of Edith, and his vanquished rival who was to bite the dust
before him was the author of all his misfortunes.Love, Vengeance,
Justice, the glorious pride of having acted rightly, the triumphant
sense of complete and absolute success, here were chaotic materials from
which order was at length evolved; and all subsided in an overwhelming
feeling of gratitude to that Providence that had so signally protected
him.It seemed
that Oswald was as excited as Coningsby.His eye sparkled, his manner
was energetic.'We must talk it all over during our journey.We have not a minute to
spare.'During that journey Coningsby learned something of the course of affairs
which gradually had brought about so singular a revolution in his
favour.We mentioned that Sidonia had acquired a thorough knowledge of
the circumstances which had occasioned and attended the disinheritance
of Coningsby.These he had told to Lady Wallinger, first by letter,
afterwards in more detail on her arrival in London.Lady Wallinger had
conferred with her husband.She was not surprised at the goodness of
Coningsby, and she sympathised with all his calamities.He had ever been
the favourite of her judgment, and her romance had always consisted in
blending his destinies with those of her beloved Edith.Sir Joseph was a
judicious man, who never cared to commit himself; a little selfish, but
good, just, and honourable, with some impulses, only a little afraid
of them; but then his wife stepped in like an angel, and gave them the
right direction.They were both absolutely impressed with Coningsby's
admirable conduct, and Lady Wallinger was determined that her husband
should express to others the convictions which he acknowledged in unison
with herself.Millbank, who stared; but Sir
Joseph spoke feebly.Lady Wallinger conveyed all this intelligence, and
all her impressions, to Oswald and Edith.The younger Millbank talked
with his father, who, making no admissions, listened with interest,
inveighed against Lord Monmouth, and condemned his will.Millbank made inquiries about Coningsby, took an
interest in his career, and, like Lord Eskdale, declared that when he
was called to the bar, his friends would have an opportunity to evince
their sincerity.Affairs remained in this state, until Oswald thought
that circumstances were sufficiently ripe to urge his father on
the subject.The position which Oswald had assumed at Millbank had
necessarily made him acquainted with the affairs and fortune of his
father.When he computed the vast wealth which he knew was at his
parent's command, and recalled Coningsby in his humble chambers, toiling
after all his noble efforts without any results, and his sister pining
in a provincial solitude, Oswald began to curse wealth, and to
ask himself what was the use of all their marvellous industry and
supernatural skill?He addressed his father with that irresistible
frankness which a strong faith can alone inspire.What are the objects
of wealth, if not to bless those who possess our hearts?The only
daughter, the friend to whom the only son was indebted for his life,
here are two beings surely whom one would care to bless, and both are
unhappy.Millbank listened without prejudice, for he was already
convinced.But he felt some interest in the present conduct of
Coningsby.A Coningsby working for his bread was a novel incident for
him.He was resolved to
convince himself of the fact.And perhaps he would have gone on yet
for a little time, and watched the progress of the experiment,
already interested and delighted by what had reached him, had not the
dissolution brought affairs to a crisis.The misery of Oswald at the
position of Coningsby, the silent sadness of Edith, his own conviction,
which assured him that he could do nothing wiser or better than take
this young man to his heart, so ordained it that Mr.Millbank, who
was after all the creature of impulse, decided suddenly, and decided
rightly.Never making a single admission to all the representations of
his son, Mr.Millbank in a moment did all that his son could have dared
to desire.This is a very imperfect and crude intimation of what had occurred
at Millbank and Hellingsley; yet it conveys a faint sketch of the
enchanting intelligence that Oswald conveyed to Coningsby during their
rapid travel.When they arrived at Birmingham, they found a messenger
and a despatch, informing Coningsby, that at mid-day, at Darlford, he
was at the head of the poll by an overwhelming majority, and that Mr.He was, however, requested to remain at Birmingham,
as they did not wish him to enter Darlford, except to be chaired, so
he was to arrive there in the morning.At Birmingham, therefore, they
remained.There was Oswald's election to talk of as well as Coningsby's.They had
hardly had time for this.Men must have been at school together, to enjoy the real fun of meeting
thus, and realising boyish dreams.Often, years ago, they had talked
of these things, and assumed these results; but those were words and
dreams, these were positive facts; after some doubts and struggles, in
the freshness of their youth, Oswald Millbank and Harry Coningsby
were members of the British Parliament; public characters, responsible
agents, with a career.This afternoon, at Birmingham, was as happy an afternoon as usually
falls to the lot of man.Both of these companions were labouring under
that degree of excitement which is necessary to felicity.Edith was no longer a forbidden or a sorrowful
subject.There was rapture in their again meeting under such
circumstances.Then there were their friends; that dear Buckhurst, who
had just been called out for styling his opponent a Venetian, and all
their companions of early days.What a sudden and marvellous change in
all their destinies!Life was a pantomime; the wand was waved, and it
seemed that the schoolfellows had of a sudden become elements of power,
springs of the great machine.A train arrived; restless they sallied forth, to seek diversion in the
dispersion of the passengers.Coningsby and Millbank, with that glance,
a little inquisitive, even impertinent, if we must confess it, with
which one greets a stranger when he emerges from a public conveyance,
were lounging on the platform.The train arrived; stopped; the doors
were thrown open, and from one of them emerged Mr.Coningsby, who
had dined, was greatly tempted to take off his hat and make him a bow,
but he refrained.He was evidently
used up; a man without a resource; the sight of Coningsby his last blow;
he had met his fate.'My dear fellow,' said Coningsby, 'I remember I wanted you to dine with
my grandfather at Montem, and that fellow would not ask you.About eleven o'clock the next morning they arrived at the Darlford
station.Here they were met by an anxious deputation, who received
Coningsby as if he were a prophet, and ushered him into a car covered
with satin and blue ribbons, and drawn by six beautiful grey horses,
caparisoned in his colours, and riden by postilions, whose very whips
were blue and white.Triumphant music sounded; banners waved; the
multitude were marshalled
