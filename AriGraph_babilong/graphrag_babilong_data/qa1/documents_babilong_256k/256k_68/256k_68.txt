291 ff) urges the claims of the book and resents
    Fitzgerald’s rather scornful characterization of the French
    critics who received the work as Sterne’s (see Life of Sterne,
    1864, II, p. 429).Hédouin refers to Jules Janin (“Essai sur la
    vie et les ouvrages de Sterne”) and Balzac (“Physiologie du
    mariage,” Meditation xvii,) as citing from the work as genuine.Barbey d’Aurevilly is, however, noted as contending in _la Patrie_
    against the authenticity.This is probably the article to be found
    in his collection of Essays, “XIX Siècle, Les oeuvres et les
    hommes,” Paris, 1890, pp.Fitzgerald mentions Chasles among
    French critics who accept the book.Springer is incorrect in his
    assertion that the Koran appeared seven years after Sterne’s
    death, but he is probably building on the incorrect statement in
    the _Quarterly Review_ (XCIV, pp.Springer also asserts
    erroneously that it was never published in Sterne’s collected
    works.He is evidently disposed to make a case for the Koran and
    finds really his chief proof in the fact that both Goethe and Jean
    Paul accepted it unquestioningly.Bodmer quotes Sterne from the
    Koran in a letter to Denis, April 4, 1771, “M.by Retzer, Wien, 1801, II, p.120, and other German
    authors have in a similar way made quotations from this work,
    without questioning its authenticity.][Footnote 80: Leipzig, Schwickert, 1771, pp.[Footnote 82: Hamburg, Herold, 1778, pp.[Footnote 84: Anhang to XXV-XXXVI, Vol.[Footnote 85: As products of the year 1760, one may note:

STERNE’S INFLUENCE IN GERMANY


Thus in manifold ways Sterne was introduced into German life and
letters.[1] He stood as a figure of benignant humanity, of lavish
sympathy with every earthly affliction, he became a guide and mentor,[2]
an awakener and consoler, and probably more than all, a sanction for
emotional expression.Not only in literature, but in the conduct of life
was Yorick judged a preceptor.The most important attempt to turn
Yorick’s teachings to practical service in modifying conduct in human
relationships was the introduction and use of the so-called
“Lorenzodosen.” The considerable popularity of this remarkable conceit
is tangible evidence of Sterne’s influence in Germany and stands in
striking contrast to the wavering enthusiasm, vigorous denunciation and
half-hearted acknowledgment which marked Sterne’s career in England.A century of criticism has disallowed Sterne’s claim as a prophet, but
unquestionably he received in Germany the honors which a foreign land
proverbially accords.To Johann Georg Jacobi, the author of the “Winterreise” and
“Sommerreise,” two well-known imitations of Sterne, the sentimental
world was indebted for this practical manner of expressing adherence to
a sentimental creed.[3] In the _Hamburgischer Correspondent_ he
published an open letter to Gleim, dated April 4, 1769, about the time
of the inception of the “Winterreise,” in which letter he relates at
considerable length the origin of the idea.[4] A few days before this
the author was reading to his brother, Fritz Jacobi, the philosopher,
novelist and friend of Goethe, and a number of ladies, from Sterne’s
Sentimental Journey the story of the poor Franciscan who begged alms of
Yorick.“We read,” says Jacobi, “how Yorick used this snuff-box to
invoke its former possessor’s gentle, patient spirit, and to keep his
own composed in the midst of life’s conflicts.The good Monk had died:
Yorick sat by his grave, took out the little snuff-box, plucked a few
nettles from the head of the grave, and wept.We looked at one another
in silence: each rejoiced to find tears in the others’ eyes; we honored
the death of the venerable old man Lorenzo and the good-hearted
Englishman.In our opinion, too, the Franciscan deserved more to be
canonized than all the saints of the calendar.Gentleness, contentedness
with the world, patience invincible, pardon for the errors of mankind,
these are the primary virtues he teaches his disciples.” The moment was
too precious not to be emphasized by something rememberable, perceptible
to the senses, and they all purchased for themselves horn snuff-boxes,
and had the words “Pater Lorenzo” written in golden letters on the
outside of the cover and “Yorick” within.Oath was taken for the sake of
Saint Lorenzo to give something to every Franciscan who might ask of
them, and further: “If anyone in our company should allow himself to be
carried away by anger, his friend holds out to him the snuff-box, and we
have too much feeling to withstand this reminder even in the greatest
violence of passion.” It is suggested also that the ladies, who use no
tobacco, should at least have such a snuff-box on their night-stands,
because to them belong in such a high degree those gentle feelings which
were to be associated with the article.This letter printed in the Hamburg paper was to explain the snuff-box,
which Jacobi had sent to Gleim a few days before, and the desire is also
expressed to spread the order.Jacobi goes on to say: “Perhaps in the future, I may have the pleasure
of meeting a stranger here and there who will hand me the horn snuff-box
with its golden letters.I shall embrace him as intimately as one Free
Mason does another after the sign has been given.what a joy it
would be to me, if I could introduce so precious a custom among my
fellow-townsmen.” A reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5]
sharply condemns Jacobi for his conceit in printing publicly a letter
meant for his friend or friends, and, to judge from the words with which
Jacobi accompanies the abridged form of the letter in the later editions
it would seem that Jacobi himself was later ashamed of the whole affair.The idea, however, was warmly received, and among the teary, sentimental
enthusiasts the horn snuff-box soon became the fad.A few days after the
publication of this letter, Wittenberg,[6] the journalist in Hamburg,
writes to Jacobi (April 21) that many in Hamburg desire to possess these
snuff-boxes, and he adds: “A hundred or so are now being manufactured;
besides the name Lorenzo, the following legend is to appear on the
cover: Animae quales non candidiores terra tulit.” Wittenberg explains
that this Latin motto was a suggestion of his own, selfishly made,
for thereby he might win the opportunity of explaining it to the fair
ladies, and exacting kisses for the service.Wittenberg asserts that a
lady (Longo guesses a certain Johanna Friederike Behrens) was the first
to suggest the manufacture of the article at Hamburg.A second letter[7]
from Wittenberg to Jacobi four months later (August 21, 1769) announces
the sending of nine snuff-boxes to Jacobi, and the price is given as
one-half a reichsthaler.Jacobi himself says in his note to the later
edition that merchants made a speculation out of the fad, and that a
multitude of such boxes were sent out through all Germany, even to
Denmark and Livonia: “they were in every hand,” he says.Graf Solms had
such boxes made of tin with the name Jacobi inside.Both Martin and
Werner instance the request[8] of a Protestant vicar, Johann David Goll
in Trossingen, for a “Lorenzodose” with the promise to subscribe to the
oath of the order, and, though Protestant, to name the Catholic
Franciscan his brother.According to a spicy review[9] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[10] these snuff-boxes were sold in
Hamburg wrapped in a printed copy of Jacobi’s letter to Gleim, and the
reviewer adds, “like Grenough’s tooth-tincture in the directions for its
use.”[11] Nicolai in “Sebaldus Nothanker” refers to the Lorenzo cult
with evident ridicule.[12]

There were other efforts to make Yorick’s example an efficient power of
beneficent brotherliness.Kaufmann attempted to found a Lorenzo order of
the horn snuff-box.Düntzer, in his study of Kaufmann,[13] states that
this was only an effort on Kaufmann’s part to embrace a timely
opportunity to make himself prominent.This endeavor was made according
to Düntzer, during Kaufmann’s residence in Strassburg, which the
investigator assigns to the years 1774-75.Leuchsenring,[14] the
eccentric sentimentalist, who for a time belonged to the Darmstadt
circle and whom Goethe satirized in “Pater Brey,” cherished also for a
time the idea of founding an order of “Empfindsamkeit.”

In the literary remains of Johann Christ Hofmann[15] in Coburg was found
the “patent” of an order of “Sanftmuth und Versöhnung.” A “Lorenzodose”
was found with it marked XXVIII, and the seven rules of the order, dated
Coburg “im Ordens-Comtoir, den 10 August, 1769,” are merely a topical
enlargement and ordering of Jacobi’s original idea.Appell states that Jacobi explained through a friend that he knew
nothing of this order and had no share in its founding.Longo complains
that Appell does not give the source of his information, but Jacobi in
his note to the so-called “Stiftungs-Brief” in the edition of 1807
quotes the article in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog” as his only knowledge
of this order, certainly implying his previous ignorance of its
existence.Somewhat akin to these attempts to incorporate Yorick’s ideas is the
fantastic laying out of the park at Marienwerder near Hanover, of which
Matthison writes in his “Vaterländische Besuche,”[16] and in a letter to
the Hofrath von Köpken in Magdeburg,[17] dated October 17, 1785.After a
sympathetic description of the secluded park, he tells how labyrinthine
paths lead to an eminence “where the unprepared stranger is surprised by
the sight of a cemetery.On the crosses there one reads beloved names
from Yorick’s Journey and Tristram Shandy.Father Lorenzo, Eliza, Maria
of Moulines, Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby and Yorick were gathered by a
poetic fancy to this graveyard.” The letter gives a similar description
and adds the epitaph on Trim’s monument, “Weed his grave clean, ye men
of goodness, for he was your brother,”[18] a quotation, which in its
fuller form, Matthison uses in a letter[19] to Bonstetten, Heidelberg,
February 7, 1794, in speaking of Böck the actor.It is impossible to
determine whose eccentric and tasteless enthusiasm is represented by
this mortuary arrangement.Louise von Ziegler, known in the Darmstadt circle as Lila, whom Merck
admired and, according to Caroline Flaschsland, “almost compared with
Yorick’s Maria,” was so sentimental that she had her grave made in her
garden, evidently for purposes of contemplation, and she led a lamb
about which ate and drank with her.Upon the death of this animal,
“a faithful dog” took its place.Thus was Maria of Moulines
remembered.[20]

It has already been noted that Yorick’s sympathy for the brute creation
found cordial response in Germany, such regard being accepted as a part
of his message.That the spread of such sentimental notions was not
confined to the printed word, but passed over into actual regulation of
conduct is admirably illustrated by an anecdote related in Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ in the January number for 1776, by a correspondent
who signs himself “S.” A friend was visiting him; they went to walk, and
the narrator having his gun with him shot with it two young doves.“What have the doves done to you?” he queries.“Nothing,” is the reply, “but they will taste good to you.” “But they
were alive,” interposed the friend, “and would have caressed
(geschnäbelt) one another,” and later he refuses to partake of the
doves.Connection with Yorick is established by the narrator himself:
“If my friend had not read Yorick’s story about the sparrow, he would
have had no rule of conduct here about shooting doves, and my doves
would have tasted better to him.” The influence of Yorick was, however,
quite possibly indirect through Jacobi as intermediary; for the latter
describes a sentimental family who refused to allow their doves to be
killed.The author of this letter, however, refers directly to Yorick,
to the very similar episode of the sparrows narrated in the continuation
of the Sentimental Journey, but an adventure original with the German
Bode.This is probably the source of Jacobi’s narrative.The other side of Yorick’s character, less comprehensible, less capable
of translation into tangibilities, was not disregarded.His humor and
whimsicality, though much less potent, were yet influential.Ramler said
in a letter to Gebler dated November 14, 1775, that everyone wished to
jest like Sterne,[21] and the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (October
31, 1775), at almost precisely the same time, discourses at some length
on the then prevailing epidemic of whimsicality, showing that
shallowness beheld in the then existing interest in humor a
justification for all sorts of eccentric behavior and inconsistent
wilfulness.Naturally Sterne’s influence in the world of letters may be traced most
obviously in the slavish imitation of his style, his sentiment, his
whims,--this phase represented in general by now forgotten triflers; but
it also enters into the thought of the great minds in the fatherland and
becomes interwoven with their culture.Their own expressions of
indebtedness are here often available in assigning a measure of
relationship.And finally along certain general lines the German Yorick
exercised an influence over the way men thought and wanted to think.The direct imitations of Sterne are very numerous, a crowd of followers,
a motley procession of would-be Yoricks, set out on one expedition or
another.Musäus[22] in a review of certain sentimental meanderings in
the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[23] remarked that the increase of
such journeyings threatened to bring about a new epoch in the taste of
the time.He adds that the good Yorick presumably never anticipated
becoming the founder of a fashionable sect.Other
expressions of alarm or disapprobation might be cited.Through Sterne’s influence the account of travels became more personal,
less purely topographical, more volatile and merry, more subjective.[24]
Goethe in a passage in the “Campagne in Frankreich,” to which reference
is made later, acknowledges this impulse as derived from Yorick.Its
presence was felt even when there was no outward effort at sentimental
journeying.The suggestion that the record of a journey was personal and
tinged with humor was essential to its popularity.It was probably
purely an effort to make use of this appeal which led the author of
“Bemerkungen eines Reisenden durch Deutschland, Frankreich, England und
Holland,”[25] a work of purely practical observation, to place upon his
title-page the alluring lines from Gay: “Life is a jest and all things
shew it.I thought so once, but now I know it;” a promise of humorous
attitude which does not find fulfilment in the heavy volumes of purely
objective description which follow.Probably the first German book to bear the name Yorick in its title was
a short satirical sketch entitled, “Yorick und die Bibliothek der
elenden Scribenten, an Hrn.--” 1768, 8vo (Anspach),[26] which is linked
to the quite disgustingly scurrilous Antikriticus controversy.Attempts at whimsicality, imitations also of the Shandean gallery of
originals appear, and the more particularly Shandean style of narration
is adopted in the novels of the period which deal with middle-class
domestic life.Of books directly inspired by Sterne, or following more
or less slavishly his guidance, a considerable proportion has
undoubtedly been consigned to merited oblivion.In many cases it is
possible to determine from contemporary reviews the nature of the
individual product, and the probable extent of indebtedness to the
British model.If it were possible to find and examine them all with a
view to establishing extent of relationship, the identity of motifs,
the borrowing of thought and sentiment, such a work would give us little
more than we learn from consideration of representative examples.In the
following chapter the attempt will be made to treat a number of typical
products.Baker in his article on Sterne in Germany adopts the rather
hazardous expedient of judging merely by title and taking from Goedeke’s
“Grundriss,” works which suggests a dependence on Sterne.[27]

The early relation of several great men of letters to Sterne has been
already treated in connection with the gradual awakening of Germany to
the new force.Wieland was one of Sterne’s most ardent admirers, one of
his most intelligent interpreters; but since his relationship to Sterne
has been made the theme of special study,[28] there will be needed here
but a brief recapitulation with some additional comment.Especially in
the productions of the years 1768-1774 are the direct allusions to
Sterne and his works numerous, the adaptations of motifs frequent, and
imitation of literary style unmistakable.Behmer finds no demonstrable
evidence of Sterne’s influence in Wieland’s work prior to two poems of
the year 1768, “Endymions Traum” and “Chloe;” but in the works of the
years immediately following there is abundant evidence both in style and
in subject matter, in the fund of allusion and illustration, to
establish the author’s indebtedness to Sterne.Behmer analyzes from this
standpoint the following works: “Beiträge zur geheimen Geschichte des
menschlichen Verstandes und Herzens;” “Sokrates Mainomenos oder die
Dialogen des Diogenes von Sinope;” “Der neue Amadis;” “Der goldene
Spiegel;” “Geschichte des Philosophen Danischmende;” “Gedanken über eine
alte Aufschrift;” “Geschichte der Abderiten.”[29]

In these works, but in different measure in each, Behmer finds Sterne
copied stylistically, in the constant conversations about the worth of
the book, the comparative value of the different chapters and the
difficulty of managing the material, in the fashion of inconsequence in
unexplained beginnings and abrupt endings, in the heaping up of words of
similar meaning, or similar ending, and in the frequent digressions.Sterne also is held responsible for the manner of introducing the
immorally suggestive, for the introduction of learned quotations and
references to authorities, for the sport made of the learned professions
and the satire upon all kinds of pedantry and overwrought enthusiasm.Though the direct, demonstrable influence of Sterne upon Wieland’s
literary activity dies out gradually[30] and naturally, with the growth
of his own genius, his admiration for the English favorite abides with
him, passing on into succeeding periods of his development, as his
former enthusiasm for Richardson failed to do.[31] More than twenty
years later, when more sober days had stilled the first unbridled
outburst of sentimentalism, Wieland speaks yet of Sterne in terms of
unaltered devotion: in an article published in the _Merkur_,[32] Sterne
is called among all authors the one “from whom I would last part,”[33]
and the subject of the article itself is an indication of his concern
for the fate of Yorick among his fellow-countrymen.It is in the form of
an epistle to Herr.zu D., and is a vigorous protest against
heedless imitation of Sterne, representing chiefly the perils of such
endeavor and the bathos of the failure.Wieland includes in the letter
some “specimen passages from a novel in the style of Tristram Shandy,”
which he asserts were sent him by the author.The quotations are almost
flat burlesque in their impossible idiocy, and one can easily appreciate
Wieland’s despairing cry with which the article ends.A few words of comment upon Behmer’s work will be in place.He accepts
as genuine the two added volumes of the Sentimental Journey and the
Koran, though he admits that the former were published by a friend, not
“without additions of his own,” and he uses these volumes directly at
least in one instance in establishing his parallels, the rescue of the
naked woman from the fire in the third volume of the Journey, and the
similar rescue from the waters in the “Nachlass des Diogenes.”[34] That
Sterne had any connection with these volumes is improbable, and the
Koran is surely a pure fabrication.Behmer seeks in a few words to deny
the reproach cast upon Sterne that he had no understanding of the
beauties of nature, but Behmer is certainly claiming too much when he
speaks of the “Farbenprächtige Schilderungen der ihm ungewohnten
sonnenverklärten Landschaft,” which Sterne gives us “repeatedly” in the
Sentimental Journey, and he finds his most secure evidence for Yorick’s
“genuine and pure” feeling for nature in the oft-quoted passage
beginning, “I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba and cry
‘’Tis all barren.’” It would surely be difficult to find these repeated
instances, for, in the whole work, Sterne gives absolutely no
description of natural scenery beyond the most casual, incidental
reference: the familiar passage is also misinterpreted, it betrays no
appreciation of inanimate nature in itself, and is but a cry in
condemnation of those who fail to find exercise for their sympathetic
emotions.Sterne mentions the “sweet myrtle” and “melancholy
cypress,”[35] not as indicative of his own affection for nature, but as
exemplifying his own exceeding personal need of expenditure of human
sympathy, as indeed the very limit to which sensibility can go, when the
desert denies possibility of human intercourse.Sterne’s attitude is
much better illustrated at the beginning of the “Road to Versailles”:
“As there was nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for
in traveling, I cannot fill up the blank better than with a short
history of this self-same bird.” In other words, he met no possibility
for exercising the emotions.Behmer’s statement with reference to
Sterne, “that his authorship proceeds anyway from a parody of
Richardson,” is surely not demonstrable, nor that “this whole fashion of
composition is indeed but ridicule of Richardson.” Richardson’s star had
paled perceptibly before Sterne began to write, and the period of his
immense popularity lies nearly twenty years before.There is not the
slightest reason to suppose that his works have any connection
whatsoever with Richardson’s novels.One is tempted to think that Behmer
confuses Sterne with Fielding, whose career as a novelist did begin as a
parodist of the vain little printer.That the “Starling” in the
Sentimental Journey, which is passed on from hand to hand, and the
burden of government which wanders similarly in “Der Goldene Spiegel”
constitute a parallelism, as Behmer suggests (p.It could also be hardly demonstrated that what Behmer calls
“die Sternische Einführungsweise”[36] (p.54), as used in the
“Geschichte der Abderiten,” is peculiar to Sterne or even characteristic
of him.19) seems to be ignorant of any reprints or
translations of the Koran, the letters and the sermons, save those
coming from Switzerland.Bauer’s study of the Sterne-Wieland relation is much briefer
(thirty-five pages) and much less satisfactory because less thorough,
yet it contains some few valuable individual points and cited
parallelisms.Bauer errs in stating that Shandy appeared 1759-67 in
York, implying that the whole work was issued there.He gives the dates
of Sterne’s first visit to Paris, also incorrectly, as 1760-62.Finally, Wieland cannot be classed among the slavish imitators of
Yorick; he is too independent a thinker, too insistent a pedagogue to
allow himself to be led more than outwardly by the foreign model.He has
something of his own to say and is genuinely serious in a large portion
of his own philosophic speculations: hence, his connection with Sterne,
being largely stylistic and illustrative, may be designated as a drapery
of foreign humor about his own seriousness of theorizing.Wieland’s
Hellenic tendencies make the use of British humor all the more
incongruous.[37]

Herder’s early acquaintance with Sterne has been already treated.Subsequent writings offer also occasional indication of an abiding
admiration.Soon after his arrival in Paris he wrote to Hartknoch
praising Sterne’s characterization of the French people.[38] The fifth
“Wäldchen,” which is concerned with the laughable, contains reference to
Sterne.[39]

With Lessing the case is similar: a striking statement of personal
regard has been recorded, but Lessing’s literary work of the following
years does not betray a significant influence from Yorick.To be sure,
allusion is made to Sterne a few times in letters[40] and elsewhere,
but no direct manifestation of devotion is discoverable.The compelling
consciousness of his own message, his vigorous interest in deeper
problems of religion and philosophy, the then increasing worth of native
German literature, may well have overshadowed the influence of the
volatile Briton.Goethe’s expressions of admiration for Sterne and indebtedness to him
are familiar.Near the end of his life (December 16, 1828), when the
poet was interested in observing the history and sources of his own
culture, and was intent upon recording his own experience for the
edification and clarification of the people, he says in conversation
with Eckermann: “I am infinitely indebted to Shakespeare, Sterne and
Goldsmith.”[41] And a year later in a letter to Zelter,[42] (Weimar,
December 25, 1829), “The influence Goldsmith and Sterne exercised upon
me, just at the chief point of my development, cannot be estimated.This
high, benevolent irony, this just and comprehensive way of viewing
things, this gentleness to all opposition, this equanimity under every
change, and whatever else all the kindred virtues may be termed--such
things were a most admirable training for me, and surely, these are the
sentiments which in the end lead us back from all the mistaken paths of
life.”

In the same conversation with Eckermann from which the first quotation
is made, Goethe seems to defy the investigator who would endeavor to
define his indebtedness to Sterne, its nature and its measure.The
occasion was an attempt on the part of certain writers to determine the
authorship of certain distichs printed in both Schiller’s and Goethe’s
works.Upon a remark of Eckermann’s that this effort to hunt down a
man’s originality and to trace sources is very common in the literary
world, Goethe says: “Das ist sehr lächerlich, man könnte ebenso gut
einen wohlgenährten Mann nach den Ochsen, Schafen und Schweinen fragen,
die er gegessen und die ihm Kräfte gegeben.” An investigation such as
Goethe seems to warn us against here would be one of tremendous
difficulty, a theme for a separate work.It is purposed here to gather
only information with reference to Goethe’s expressed or implied
attitude toward Sterne, his opinion of the British master, and to note
certain connections between Goethe’s work and that of Sterne,
connections which are obvious or have been already a matter of comment
and discussion.In Strassburg under Herder’s[43] guidance, Goethe seems first to have
read the works of Sterne.His life in Frankfurt during the interval
between his two periods of university residence was not of a nature
calculated to increase his acquaintance with current literature, and his
studies did not lead to interest in literary novelty.This is his own
statement in “Dichtung und Wahrheit.”[44] That Herder’s enthusiasm for
Sterne was generous has already been shown by letters written in the few
years previous to his sojourn in Strassburg.Letters written to
Merck[45] (Strassburg, 1770-1771) would seem to show that then too
Sterne still stood high in his esteem.Whatever the exact time of
Goethe’s first acquaintance with Sterne, we know that he recommended the
British writer to Jung-Stilling for the latter’s cultivation in
letters.[46] Less than a year after Goethe’s departure from Strassburg,
we find him reading aloud to the Darmstadt circle the story of poor Le
Fevre from Tristram Shandy.This is reported in a letter, dated May 8,
1772, by Caroline Flachsland, Herder’s fiancée.[47] It is not evident
whether they read Sterne in the original or in the translation of
Zückert, the only one then available, unless possibly the reader gave a
translation as he read.Later in the same letter, Caroline mentions the
“Empfindsame Reisen,” possibly meaning Bode’s translation.She also
records reading Shakespeare in Wieland’s rendering, but as she speaks
later still of peeping into the English books which Herder had sent
Merck, it is a hazardous thing to reason from her mastery of English at
that time to the use of original or translation on the occasion of
Goethe’s reading.Contemporary criticism saw in the Martin of “Götz von Berlichingen”
a likeness to Sterne’s creations;[48] and in the other great work of the
pre-Weimarian period, in “Werther,” though no direct influence rewards
one’s search, one must acknowledge the presence of a mental and
emotional state to which Sterne was a contributor.Indeed Goethe himself
suggests this relationship.Speaking of “Werther” in the “Campagne in
Frankreich,”[49] he observes in a well-known passage that Werther did
not cause the disease, only exposed it, and that Yorick shared in
preparing the ground-work of sentimentalism on which “Werther” is built.According to the quarto edition of 1837, the first series of letters
from Switzerland dates from 1775, although they were not published till
1808, in the eleventh volume of the edition begun in 1806.Scherer,
in his “History of German Literature,” asserts that these letters are
written in imitation of Sterne, but it is difficult to see the occasion
for such a statement.The letters are, in spite of all haziness
concerning the time of their origin and Goethe’s exact purpose regarding
them,[50] a “fragment of Werther’s travels” and are confessedly cast in
a sentimental tone, which one might easily attribute to a Werther,
in whom hyperesthesia has not yet developed to delirium, an earlier
Werther.Yorick’s whim and sentiment are quite wanting, and the
sensuousness, especially as pertains to corporeal beauty, is distinctly
Goethean.Goethe’s accounts of his own travels are quite free from the Sterne
flavor; in fact he distinctly says that through the influence of the
Sentimental Journey all records of journeys had been mostly given up to
the feelings and opinions of the traveler, but that he, after his
Italian journey, had endeavored to keep himself objective.Robert Riemann in his study of Goethe’s novels,[52] calls Friedrich
in “Wilhelm Meister’s Lehrjahre” a representative of Sterne’s humor, and
he finds in Mittler in the “Wahlverwandtschaften” a union of seriousness
and the comic of caricature, reminiscent of Sterne and Hippel.Friedrich
is mercurial, petulant, utterly irresponsible, a creature of mirth and
laughter, subject to unreasoning fits of passion.One might, in thinking
of another character in fiction, designate Friedrich as faun-like.In
all of this one can, however, find little if any demonstrable likeness
to Sterne or Sterne’s creations.It is rather difficult also to see
wherein the character of Mittler is reminiscent of Sterne.Mittler is
introduced with the obvious purpose of representing certain opinions and
of aiding the development of the story by his insistence upon them.He
represents a brusque, practical kind of benevolence, and his
eccentricity lies only in the extraordinary occupation which he has
chosen for himself.Riemann also traces to Sterne, Fielding and their
German followers, Goethe’s occasional use of the direct appeal to the
reader.Doubtless Sterne’s example here was a force in extending this
rhetorical convention.It is claimed by Goebel[53] that Goethe’s “Homunculus,” suggested to the
master partly by reading of Paracelsus and partly by Sterne’s mediation,
is in some characteristics of his being dependent directly on Sterne’s
creation.In a meeting of the “Gesellschaft für deutsche Litteratur,”
November, 1896, Brandl expressed the opinion that Maria of Moulines was
a prototype of Mignon in “Wilhelm Meister.”[54]

The references to Sterne in Goethe’s works, in his letters and
conversations, are fairly numerous in the aggregate, but not especially
striking relatively.In the conversations with Eckermann there are
several other allusions besides those already mentioned.Goethe calls
Eckermann a second Shandy for suffering illness without calling a
physician, even as Walter Shandy failed to attend to the squeaking
door-hinge.[55] Eckermann himself draws on Sterne for illustrations in
Yorick’s description of Paris,[56] and on January 24, 1830, at a time
when we know that Goethe was re-reading Sterne, Eckermann refers to
Yorick’s (?)doctrine of the reasonable use of grief.[57] That Goethe
near the end of his life turned again to Sterne’s masterpiece is proved
by a letter to Zelter, October 5, 1830;[58] he adds here too that his
admiration has increased with the years, speaking particularly of
Sterne’s gay arraignment of pedantry and philistinism.But a few days
before this, October 1, 1830, in a conversation reported by Riemer,[59]
he expresses the same opinion and adds that Sterne was the first to
raise himself and us from pedantry and philistinism.By these remarks
Goethe commits himself in at least one respect to a favorable view of
Sterne’s influence on German letters.A few other minor allusions to
Sterne may be of interest.In an article in the _Horen_ (1795,
V. Stück,) entitled “Literarischer Sansculottismus,” Goethe mentions
Smelfungus as a type of growler.[60] In the “Wanderjahre”[61] there is a
reference to Yorick’s classification of travelers.Düntzer, in Schnorr’s
_Archiv_,[62] explains a passage in a letter of Goethe’s to Johanna
Fahlmer (August, 1775), “die Verworrenheiten des Diego und Juliens” as
an allusion to the “Intricacies of Diego and Julia” in Slawkenbergius’s
tale,[63] and to the traveler’s conversation with his beast.In a letter
to Frau von Stein[64] five years later (September 18, 1780) Goethe used
this same expression, and the editor of the letters avails himself of
Düntzer’s explanation.Düntzer further explains the word θεοδοκος,
used in Goethe’s Tagebuch with reference to the Duke, in connection with
the term θεοδιδακτος applied to Walter Shandy.The word is, however,
somewhat illegible in the manuscript.It was printed thus in the edition
of the Tagebuch published by Robert Keil, but when Düntzer himself, nine
years after the article in the _Archiv_, published an edition of the
Tagebücher he accepted a reading θεοτατος,[65] meaning, as he says, “ein
voller Gott,” thereby tacitly retracting his former theory of connection
with Sterne.The best known relationship between Goethe and Sterne is in connection
with the so-called plagiarisms in the appendix to the third volume of
the “Wanderjahre.” Here, in the second edition, were printed under the
title “Aus Makariens Archiv” various maxims and sentiments.Among these
were a number of sayings, reflections, axioms, which were later
discovered to have been taken bodily from the second part of the Koran,
the best known Sterne-forgery.Alfred Hédouin, in “Le Monde Maçonnique”
(1863), in an article “Goethe plagiaire de Sterne,” first located the
quotations.[66]

Mention has already been made of the account of Robert Springer, which
is probably the last published essay on the subject.It is entitled “Ist
Goethe ein Plagiarius Lorenz Sternes?” and is found in the volume
“Essays zur Kritik und Philosophie und zur Goethe-Litteratur.”[67]
Springer cites at some length the liberal opinions of Molière, La
Bruyère, Wieland, Heine and others concerning the literary appropriation
of another’s thought.He then proceeds to quote Goethe’s equally
generous views on the subject, and adds the uncritical fling that if
Goethe robbed Sterne, it was an honor to Sterne, a gain to his literary
fame.Near the end of his paper, Springer arrives at the question in
hand and states positively that these maxims, with their miscellaneous
companions, were never published by Goethe, but were found by the
editors of his literary remains among his miscellaneous papers, and then
issued in the ninth volume of the posthumous works.Hédouin had
suggested this possible explanation.Springer adds that the editors were
unaware of the source of this material and supposed it to be original
with Goethe.The facts of the case are, however, as follows: “Wilhelm Meister’s
Wanderjahre” was published first in 1821.[68] In 1829, a new and revised
edition was issued in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand.” Eckermann in his
conversations with Goethe[69] relates the circumstances under which the
appendices were added to the earlier work.When the book was in press,
the publisher discovered that of the three volumes planned, the last two
were going to be too thin, and begged for more material to fill out
their scantiness.In this perplexity Goethe brought to Eckermann two
packets of miscellaneous notes to be edited and added to those two
slender volumes.In this way arose the collection of sayings, scraps and
quotations “Im Sinne der Wanderer” and “Aus Makariens Archiv.” It was
later agreed that Eckermann, when Goethe’s literary remains should be
published, should place the matter elsewhere, ordered into logical
divisions of thought.All of the sentences here under special
consideration were published in the twenty-third volume of the “Ausgabe
letzter Hand,” which is dated 1830,[70] and are to be found there, on
pages 271-275 and 278-281.They are reprinted in the identical order in
the ninth volume of the “Nachgelassene Werke,” which also bore the
title, Vol.XLIX of “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” there found on pages 121-125
and 127-131.Evidently Springer found them here in the posthumous works,
and did not look for them in the previous volume, which was published
two years or thereabouts before Goethe’s death.Of the sentiments, sentences and quotations dealing with Sterne, there
are twenty which are translations from the Koran, in Loeper’s edition of
“Sprüche in Prosa,”[71] Nos.491-507 and 543-544; seventeen others (Nos.490, 508-509, 521-533, 535) contain direct appreciative criticism of
Sterne; No.538 is a comment upon a Latin quotation in the Koran and No.545 is a translation of another quotation in the same work.532
gives a quotation from Sterne, “Ich habe mein Elend nicht wie ein weiser
Mann benutzt,” which Loeper says he has been unable to find in any of
Sterne’s works.It is, however, in a letter[72] to John Hall Stevenson,
written probably in August, 1761.Loeper did not succeed in finding Nos.534, 536, 537, although their
position indicates that they were quotations from Sterne, but No.534 is
in a letter to Garrick from Paris, March 19, 1762.The German
translation however conveys a different impression from the original
English.The other two are not located; in spite of their position, the
way in which the book was put together would certainly allow for the
possibility of extraneous material creeping in.At their first
appearance in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” five Sprüche, Nos.491, 543,
534, 536, 537, were supplied with quotation marks, though the source was
not indicated.Thus it is seen that the most of the quotations were
published as original during Goethe’s lifetime, but he probably never
considered it of sufficient consequence to disavow their authorship in
public.It is quite possible that the way in which they were forced into
“Wilhelm Meister” was distasteful to him afterwards, and he did not care
to call attention to them.Goethe’s opinion of Sterne as expressed in the sentiments which
accompany the quotations from the Koran is significant.“Yorick Sterne,”
he says, “war der schönste Geist, der je gewirkt hat; wer ihn liest,
fühlet sich sogleich frei und schön; sein Humor ist unnachahmlich, und
nicht jeder Humor befreit die Seele” (490).“Sagacität und Penetration
sind bei ihm grenzenlos” (528).Goethe asserts here that every person of
culture should at that very time read Sterne’s works, so that the
nineteenth century might learn “what we owed him and perceive what we
might owe him.” Goethe took Sterne’s narrative of his journey as a
representation of an actual trip, or else he is speaking of Sterne’s
letters in the following:

“Seine Heiterkeit, Genügsamkeit, Duldsamkeit auf der Reise, wo diese
Eigenschaften am meisten geprüft werden, finden nicht leicht
Ihresgleichen” (No.529), and Goethe’s opinion of Sterne’s indecency is
characteristic of Goethe’s attitude.He says: “Das Element der
Lüsternheit, in dem er sich so zierlich und sinnig benimmt, würde vielen
Andern zum Verderben gereichen.”

The juxtaposition of these quotations and this appreciation of Sterne is
proof sufficient that Goethe considered Sterne the author of the Koran
at the time when the notes were made.At precisely what time this
occurred it is now impossible to determine, but the drift of the
comment, combined with our knowledge from sources already mentioned,
that Goethe turned again to Sterne in the latter years of his life,
would indicate that the quotations were made in the latter part of the
twenties, and that the re-reading of Sterne included the Koran.Since
the translations which Goethe gives are not identical with those in the
rendering ascribed to Bode (1778), Loeper suggests Goethe himself as the
translator of the individual quotations.Loeper is ignorant of the
earlier translation of Gellius, which Goethe may have used.[73]

There is yet another possibility of connection between Goethe and the
Koran.This work contained the story of the Graf von Gleichen, which is
acknowledged to have been a precursor of Goethe’s “Stella.” Düntzer in
his “Erläuterungen zu den deutschen Klassikern” says it is impossible to
determine whence Goethe took the story for “Stella.” He mentions that it
was contained in Bayle’s Dictionary, which is known to have been in
Goethe’s father’s library, and two other books, both dating from the
sixteenth century, are noted as possible sources.It seems rather more
probable that Goethe found the story in the Koran, which was published
but a few years before “Stella” was written and translated but a year
later, 1771, that is, but four years, or even less, before the
appearance of “Stella” (1775).[74]

Precisely in the spirit of the opinions quoted above is the little
essay[75] on Sterne which was published in the sixth volume of “Ueber
Kunst und Alterthum,” in which Goethe designates Sterne as a man “who
first stimulated and propagated the great epoch of purer knowledge of
humanity, noble toleration and tender love, in the second half of the
last century.” Goethe further calls attenion to Sterne’s disclosure of
human peculiarities (Eigenheiten), and the importance and interest of
these native, governing idiosyncrasies.A thorough
consideration of these problems, especially as concerns the cultural
indebtedness of Goethe to the English master would be a task demanding a
separate work.Goethe was an assimilator and summed up in himself the
spirit of a century, the attitude of predecessors and contemporaries.C. F. D. Schubart wrote a poem entitled “Yorick,”[76] beginning

  “Als Yorik starb, da flog
  Sein Seelchen auf den Himmel
  So leicht wie ein Seufzerchen.”

The angels ask him for news of earth, and the greater part of the poem
is occupied with his account of human fate.The relation is quite
characteristic of Schubart in its gruesomeness, its insistence upon
all-surrounding death and dissolution; but it contains no suggestion of
Sterne’s manner, or point of view.The only explanation of association
between the poem and its title is that Schubart shared the one-sided
German estimate of Sterne’s character and hence represented him as a
sympathetic messenger bringing to heaven on his death some tidings of
human weakness.In certain other manifestations, relatively subordinate, the German
literature of the latter part of the eighteenth century and the
beginning of the nineteenth and the life embodied therein are different
from what they would have been had it not been for Sterne’s example.Some of these secondary fruits of the Sterne cult have been mentioned
incidentally and exemplified in the foregoing pages.It would perhaps be
conducive to definiteness to gather them here.Sterne’s incontinuity of narration, the purposeful irrelation of parts,
the use of anecdote and episode, which to the stumbling reader reduce
his books to collections of disconnected essays and instances, gave to
German mediocrity a sanction to publish a mass of multifarious,
unrelated, and nondescript thought and incident.It is to be noted that
the spurious books such as the Koran, which Germany never clearly
sundered from the original, were direct examples in England of such
disjointed, patchwork books.Such a volume with a significant title is
“Mein Kontingent zur Modelectüre.”[77] Further, eccentricity in
typography, in outward form, may be largely attributed to Sterne’s
influence, although in individual cases no direct connection is
traceable.Thus, to the vagaries of Shandy is due probably the license
of the author of “Karl Blumenberg, eine tragisch-komische
Geschichte,”[78] who fills half pages with dashes and whole lines with
“Ha!Ha!”

As has been suggested already, Sterne’s example was potent in fostering
the use of such stylistic peculiarities, as the direct appeal to, and
conversation with the reader about the work, and its progress, and the
various features of the situation.It was in use by Sterne’s
predecessors in England and by their followers in Germany, before Sterne
can be said to have exercised any influence; for example, Hermes uses
the device constantly in “Miss Fanny Wilkes,” but Sterne undoubtedly
contributed largely to its popularity.One may perhaps trace to Sterne’s
blank pages and similar vagaries the eccentricity of the author of
“Ueber die Moralische Schönheit und Philosophie des Lebens,”[79] whose
eighth chapter is titled “Vom Stolz, eine Erzählung,” this title
occupying one page; the next page (210) is blank; the following page is
adorned with an urnlike decoration beneath which we read, “Es war einmal
ein Priester.” These three pages complete the chapter.The author of
“Dorset und Julie” (Leipzig, 1773-4) is also guilty of similar Yorickian
follies.[80]

Sterne’s ideas found approbation and currency apart from his general
message of the sentimental and humorous attitude toward the world and
its course.For example, the hobby-horse theory was warmly received, and
it became a permanent figure in Germany, often, and especially at first,
with playful reminder of Yorick’s use of the term.[81] Yorick’s
mock-scientific division of travelers seems to have met with especial
approval, and evidently became a part of conversational, and epistolary
commonplace allusion.Goethe in a letter to Marianne Willemer, November
9, 1830,[82] with direct reference to Sterne proposes for his son, then
traveling in Italy, the additional designation of the “bold” or
“complete” traveler.Carl August in a letter to Knebel,[83] dated
December 26, 1785, makes quite extended allusion to the classification.Lessing writes to Mendelssohn December 12, 1780: “The traveler whom you
sent to me a while ago was an inquisitive traveler.The one with whom I
now answer is an emigrating one.” The passage which follows is an
apology for thus adding to Yorick’s list.The two travelers were
respectively one Fliess and Alexander Daveson.[84] Nicolai makes similar
allusion to the “curious” traveler of Sterne’s classification near the
beginning of his “Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die
Schweiz im Jahre 1781.”[85]

Further search would increase the number of such allusions indefinitely.A few will be mentioned in the following chapter.One of Walter Shandy’s favorite contentions was the fortuitous
dependence of great events upon insignificant details.In his
philosophy, trifles were the determining factors of existence.The
adoption of this theory in Germany, as a principle in developing events
or character in fiction, is unquestionable in Wezel’s “Tobias Knaut,”
and elsewhere.The narrative, “Die Grosse Begebenheit aus kleinen
Ursachen” in the second volume of the _Erholungen_,[86] represents a
wholesale appropriation of the idea,--to be sure not new in Shandy, but
most strikingly exemplified there.In “Sebaldus Nothanker” the Revelation of St.John is a Sterne-like
hobby-horse and is so regarded by a reviewer in the _Magazin der
deutschen Critik_.[87] Schottenius in Knigge’s “Reise nach Braunschweig”
rides his hobby in the shape of his fifty-seven sermons.[88] Lessing
uses the Steckenpferd in a letter to Mendelssohn, November 5, 1768
(Lachmann edition, XII, p.212), and numerous other examples of direct
or indirect allusion might be cited.Sterne’s worn-out coin was a simile
adopted and felt to be pointed.[89]

Jacob Minor in a suggestive article in _Euphorion_,[90] entitled
“Wahrheit und Lüge auf dem Theater und in der Literatur,” expressed the
opinion that Sterne was instrumental in sharpening powers of observation
with reference to self-deception in little things, to all the deceiving
impulses of the human soul.It is held that through Sterne’s inspiration
Wieland and Goethe were rendered zealous to combat false ideals and
life-lies in greater things.It is maintained that Tieck also was
schooled in Sterne, and, by means of powers of observation sharpened in
this way, was enabled to portray the conscious or unconscious life-lie.[Footnote 1: A writer in the _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_, 1775
    (II, 787 ff.), asserts that Sterne’s works are the favorite
    reading of the German nation.][Footnote 2: A further illustration may be found in the following
    discourse: “Von einigen Hindernissen des akademischen Fleisses.Eine Rede bey dem Anfange der öffentlichen Vorlesungen gehalten,”
    von J. C. C. Ferber, Professor zu Helmstädt (1773, 8vo), reviewed
    in _Magazin der deutschen Critik_, III, St.This
    academic guide of youth speaks of Sterne in the following words:
    “Wie tief dringt dieser Philosoph in die verborgensten Gänge des
    menschlichen Herzens, wie richtig entdeckt er die geheimsten
    Federn der Handlungen, wie entlarvt, wie verabscheuungsvoll steht
    vor ihm das Laster, wie liebenswürdig die Tugend!wie interessant
    sind seine Schilderungen, wie eindringend seine Lehren!und woher
    diese grosse Kenntniss des Menschen, woher diese getreue
    Bezeichnung der Natur, diese sanften Empfindungen, die seine
    geistvolle Sprache hervorbringt?Dieser Saame der Tugend, den er
    mit wohlthätiger Hand ausstreuet?” Yorick held up to college or
    university students as a champion of virtue is certainly an
    extraordinary spectacle.A critic in the _Frankfurter Gel.Anz._,
    August 18, 1772, in criticising the make-up of a so-called
    “Landbibliothek,” recommends books “die geschickt sind, die guten
    einfältigen, ungekünstelten Empfindungen reiner Seelen zu
    unterhalten, einen Yorick vor allen . . ..” The long article on
    Sterne’s character in the _Götting.84-92, 1780,
    “Etwas über Sterne: Schreiben an Prof.Lichtenberg” undoubtedly
    helped to establish this opinion of Sterne authoritatively.In it
    Sterne’s weaknesses are acknowledged, but the tendency is to
    emphasize the tender, sympathetic side of his character.The
    conception of Yorick there presented is quite different from the
    one held by Lichtenberg himself.][Footnote 3: The story of the “Lorenzodosen” is given quite fully
    in Longo’s monograph, “Laurence Sterne und Johann Georg Jacobi”
    (Wien, 1898, pp.39-44), and the sketch given here is based upon
    his investigation, with consultation of the sources there cited.Nothing new is likely to be added to his account, but because of
    its important illustrative bearing on the whole story of Sterne in
    Germany, a fairly complete account is given here.Longo refers to
    the following as literature on the subject:

    their day, are not given by Goedeke; and Baker, judging only by
    one external, naturally misses Sterne products which have no
    distinctively imitative title, and includes others which have no
    connection with Sterne.For example, he gives Gellius’s “Yoricks
    Nachgelassene Werke,” which is but a translation of the Koran,
    and hence in no way an example of German imitation; he gives also
    Schummel’s “Fritzens Reise nach Dessau” (1776) and “Reise nach
    Schlesien” (1792), Nonne’s “Amors Reisen nach Fockzana zum
    Friedenscongress” (1773), none of which has anything to do with
    Sterne.“Trim oder der Sieg der Liebe über die Philosophie”
    (Leipzig, 1776), by Ludw.v. Hopffgarten, also cited by
    Baker, undoubtedly owes its name only to Sterne.See _Jenaische
    Zeitungen von gel.deutsche
    Bibl._, XXXIV, 2, p.484; similarly “Lottchens Reise ins
    Zuchthaus” by Kirtsten, 1777, is given in Baker’s list, but the
    work “Reise” is evidently used here only in a figurative sense,
    the story being but the relation of character deterioration,
    a downward journey toward the titular place of punishment.See

    “Tagereise” and “Geschichte eines empfundenen Tages” as if they

    of a long list of German Sentimental Journeys which began with von
    Thümmel’s ‘Reise in die mittäglichen Provinzen Frankreichs.’” This
    work really belongs comparatively late in the story of imitations.Two of Knigge’s books are also included.[Footnote 28: “Laurence Sterne und C. M. Wieland, von Karl August
    Behmer, Forschungen zur neueren Litteraturgeschichte IX.München,

    briefer study of this connection: a Programm by F. Bauer, “Ueber

    1898.A. Mager published, 1890, at Marburg, “Wieland’s Nachlass
    des Diogenes von Sinope und das englische Vorbild,” a school
    “Abhandlung,” which dealt with a connection between this work of
    Wieland and Sterne.Wood (“Einfluss Fieldings auf die deutsche
    Litteratur,” Yokohama, 1895) finds constant imitation of Sterne in
    “Don Silvio,” which, from Behmer’s proof concerning the dates of
    Wieland’s acquaintance with Sterne, can hardly be possible.][Footnote 29: Some other works are mentioned as containing
    references and allusions.][Footnote 30: In “Oberon” alone of Wieland’s later works does
    Behmer discover Sterne’s influence and there no longer in the
    style, but in the adaptation of motif.][Footnote 31: See Erich Schmidt’s “Richardson, Rousseau und

    expressions of adoration in the whole epoch of Sterne’s
    popularity.][Footnote 34: Since Germany did not sharply separate the work of
    Sterne from his continuator, this is, of course, to be classed

IMITATORS OF STERNE


Among the disciples of Sterne in Germany whose literary imitation may be
regarded as typical of their master’s influence, Johann Georg Jacobi is
perhaps the best known.His relation to the famous “Lorenzodosen”
conceit is sufficient to link his name with that of Yorick.Martin[1]
asserts that he was called “Uncle Toby” in Gleim’s circle because of his
enthusiasm for Sterne.The indebtedness of Jacobi to Sterne is the
subject of a special study by Dr.Joseph Longo, “Laurence Sterne und
Johann Georg Jacobi;” and the period of Jacobi’s literary work which
falls under the spell of Yorick has also been treated in an inaugural
dissertation, “Ueber Johann Georg Jacobi’s Jugendwerke,” by Georg
Ransohoff.The detail of Jacobi’s indebtedness to Sterne is to be found
in these two works.Longo was unable to settle definitely the date of Jacobi’s first
acquaintance with Sterne.The first mention made of him is in the letter
to Gleim of April 4, 1769, and a few days afterward,--April 10,--the
intelligence is afforded that he himself is working on a “journey.” The
“Winterreise” was published at Düsseldorf in the middle of June, 1769.Externally the work seems more under the influence of the French
wanderer Chapelle, since prose and verse are used irregularly
alternating, a style quite different from the English model.There are
short and unnumbered chapters, as in the Sentimental Journey, but,
unlike Sterne, Jacobi, with one exception, names no places and makes no
attempt at description of place or people, other than the sentimental
individuals encountered on the way.He makes no analysis of national, or
even local characteristics: the journey, in short, is almost completely
without place-influence.There is in the volume much more exuberance of
fancy, grotesque at times, a more conscious exercise of the picturing
imagination than we find in Sterne.There is use, too, of mythological
figures quite foreign to Sterne, an obvious reminiscence of Jacobi’s
Anacreontic experience.He exaggerates Yorick’s sentimentalism, is more
weepy, more tender, more sympathizing; yet, as Longo does not
sufficiently emphasize, he does not touch the whimsical side of Yorick’s
work.Jacobi, unlike his model, but in common with other German
imitators, is insistent in instruction and serious in contention for pet
theories, as is exemplified by the discussion of the doctrine of
immortality.There are opinions to be maintained, there is a message to
be delivered.Jacobi in this does not give the lie to his nationality.Like other German imitators, too, he took up with especial feeling the
relations between man and the animal world, an attitude to be connected
with several familiar episodes in Sterne.[2] The two chapters, “Der
Heerd” and “Der Taubenschlag,” tell of a sentimental farmer who mourns
over the fact that his son has cut down a tree in which the nightingale
was wont to nest.A similar sentimental regard is cherished in this
family for the doves, which no one killed, because no one could eat
them.Even as Yorick meets a Franciscan, Jacobi encounters a Jesuit
whose heart leaps to meet his own, and later, after the real journey is
done, a visit to a lonely cloister gives opportunity for converse with a
monk, like Pater Lorenzo,--tender, simple and humane.The “Sommerreise,” according to Longo, appeared in the latter part of
September, 1769, a less important work, which, in the edition of 1807,
Jacobi considered unworthy of preservation.Imitation of Sterne is
marked: following a criticism by Wieland the author attempts to be
humorous, but with dubious success; he introduces a Sterne-like
sentimental character which had not been used in the “Winterreise,”
a beggar-soldier, and he repeats the motif of human sympathy for animals
in the story of the lamb.Sympathy with erring womanhood is expressed in
the incidents related in “Die Fischerhütte” and “Der Geistliche.” These
two books were confessedly inspired by Yorick, and contemporary
criticism treated them as Yorick products.The _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_, published by Jacobi’s friend Klotz, would
naturally favor the volumes.Its review of the “Winterreise” is
non-critical and chiefly remarkable for the denial of foreign imitation.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_,[3] in reviewing the same work pays
a significant tribute to Sterne, praising his power of disclosing the
good and beautiful in the seemingly commonplace.In direct criticism of
the book, the reviewer calls it a journey of fancy, the work of a
youthful poet rather than that of a sensitive philosopher.Wieland is
credited with the astounding opinion that he prefers the “Sommerreise”
to Yorick’s journey.[4] Longo’s characterization of Sterne is in the
main satisfactory, yet there is distinctly traceable the tendency to
ignore or minimize the whimsical elements of Sterne’s work: this is the
natural result of his approach to Sterne, through Jacobi, who understood
only the sentimentalism of the English master.[5]

Among the works of sentiment which were acknowledged imitations of
Yorick, along with Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” probably the most typical and
best known was the “Empfindsame Reisen durch Deutschland” by Johann
Gottlieb Schummel.Its importance as a document in the history of
sentimentalism is rather as an example of tendency than as a force
contributing materially to the spread of the movement.Its influence was
probably not great, though one reviewer does hint at a following.[6] Yet
the book has been remembered more persistently than any other work of
its genre, except Jacobi’s works, undoubtedly in part because it was
superior to many of its kind, partly, also, because its author won later
and maintained a position of some eminence, as a writer and a pedagogue;
but largely because Goethe’s well-known review of it in the _Frankfurter
Gelehrte Anzeigen_ has been cited as a remarkably acute contribution to
the discriminating criticism of the genuine and the affected in the
eighteenth-century literature of feeling, and has drawn attention from
the very fact of its source to the object of its criticism.Schummel was born in May, 1748, and hence was but twenty years of age
when Germany began to thrill in response to Yorick’s sentiments.It is
probable that the first volume was written while Schummel was still a
university student in 1768-1770.He assumed a position as teacher in
1771, but the first volume came out at Easter of that year; this would
probably throw its composition back into the year before.The second
volume appeared at Michaelmas of the same year.His publisher was
Zimmermann at Wittenberg and Zerbst, and the first volume at any rate
was issued in a new edition.The third volume came out in the spring of
1772.[7] Schummel’s title, “Empfindsame Reisen,” is, of course, taken
from the newly coined word in Bode’s title, but in face of this fact it
is rather remarkable to find that several quotations from Sterne’s
Journey, given in the course of the work, are from the Mittelstedt
translation.On two occasions, indeed, Schummel uses the title of the
Mittelstedt rendering as first published, “Versuch über die menschliche
Natur.”[8]

These facts lead one to believe that Schummel drew his inspiration from
the reading of this translation.This is interesting in connection with
Böttiger’s claim that the whole cavalcade of sentimental travelers who
trotted along after Yorick with all sorts of animals and vehicles was a
proof of the excellence and power of Bode’s translation.As one would
naturally infer from the title of Schummel’s fiction, the Sentimental
Journey is more constantly drawn upon as a source of ideas, motifs,
expression, and method, than Tristram Shandy, but the allusions to
Sterne’s earlier book, and the direct adaptations from it are both
numerous and generous.This fact has not been recognized by the critics,
and is not an easy inference from the contemporary reviews.The book is the result of an immediate impulse to imitation felt
irresistibly on the reading of Sterne’s narrative.That the critics and
readers of that day treated with serious consideration the efforts of a
callow youth of twenty or twenty-one in this direction is indicative
either of comparative vigor of execution, or of prepossession of the
critical world in favor of the literary genre,--doubtless of both.Schummel confesses that the desire to write came directly after the book
had been read.“I had just finished reading it,” he says, “and Heaven
knows with what pleasure, every word from ‘as far as this matter is
concerned’ on to ‘I seized the hand of the lady’s maid,’ were imprinted
in my soul with small invisible letters.” The characters of the Journey
stood “life-size in his very soul.” Involuntarily his inventive powers
had sketched several plans for a continuation, releasing Yorick from the
hand of the _fille de chambre_.But what he attempts is not a
continuation but a German parallel.In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its
argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey:
the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English
model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the
incidents are quite slavishly copied.A complete summary of the thread
of incident on which the various sentimental adventures, whimsical
speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with: it is only
necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a model can
be established.Schummel’s narrative is often for many successive pages
absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any attempt at
Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment.At the
pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling.A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the
appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of
imitation, and the nature of the method.In outward form the Sentimental
Journey is copied.The volume is not divided into chapters, but there
are named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of
section-headings.Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to
strike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: “Is he dead, the old
cousin?” are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on
receipt of the news, and in Yorick fashion he calls for guesses
concerning the mien with which the words were said.The conversation of
the various human passions with Yorick concerning the advisability of
offering the lady in Calais a seat in his chaise is here directly
imitated in the questions put by avarice, vanity, etc., concerning the
cousin’s death.The actual journey does not begin until page 97, a brief
autobiography of the hero occupying the first part of the book; this
inconsequence is confessedly intended to be a Tristram Shandy whim.[9]
The author’s relation to his parents is adapted directly from Shandy,
since he here possesses an incapable, unpractical, philosophizing
father, who determines upon methods for the superior education of his
son; and a simple, silly mockery of a mother.Left, however, an orphan, he begins his sentimental adventures: thrust
on the world he falls in with a kindly baker’s wife whose conduct toward
him brings tears to the eyes of the ten-year old lad, this showing his
early appetite for sentimental journeying.A large part of this first
section relating to his early life and youthful struggles, his kindly
benefactor, his adventure with Potiphar’s wife, is simple and direct,
with only an occasional hint of Yorick’s influence in word or phrase, as
if the author, now and then, recalled the purpose and the inspiration.For example, not until near the bottom of page 30 does it occur to him
to be abrupt and indulge in Shandean eccentricities, and then again,
after a few lines, he resumes the natural order of discourse.And again,
on page 83, he breaks off into attempted frivolity and Yorick
whimsicality of narration.In starting out upon his journey the author
says: “I will tread in Yorick’s foot-prints, what matters it if I do not
fill them out?My heart is not so broad as his, the sooner can it be
filled; my head is not so sound; my brain not so regularly formed.My
eyes are not so clear, but for that he was born in England and I in
Germany; he is a man and I am but a youth, in short, he is Yorick and I
am not Yorick.” He determines to journey where it is most sentimental
and passes the various lands in review in making his decision.Having
fastened upon Germany, he questions himself similarly with reference to
the cities.Yorick’s love of lists, of mock-serious discrimination, of
inconsequential reasonings is here copied.The call upon epic, tragic,
lyric poets, musicians, etc., which follows here is a further imitation
of Yorick’s list-making and pseudo-scientific method.On his way to Leipzig, in the post-chaise, the author falls in with a
clergyman: the manner of this meeting is intended to be Sterne-like:
Schummel sighs, the companion remarks, “You too are an unhappy one,” and
they join hands while the human heart beams in the traveler’s eyes.But, apart from these external incidents of their
meeting, the matter of their converse is in no way inspired by Sterne.It joins itself with the narrative of the author’s visit to a church in
a village by the wayside, and deals in general with the nature of the
clergyman’s relation to his people and the general mediocrity and
ineptitude of the average homiletical discourse, the failure of
clergymen to relate their pulpit utterance to the life of the common
Christian,--all of which is genuine, sane and original, undoubtedly a
real protest on the part of Schummel, the pedagogue, against a
prevailing abuse of his time and other times.This section represents
unquestionably the earnest convictions of its author, and is written
with professional zeal.This division is followed by an evidently
purposeful return to Sterne’s eccentricity of manner.The author begins
a division of his narrative, “Der zerbrochene Postwagen,” which is
probably meant to coincide with the post-chaise accident in Shandy’s
travels, writes a few lines in it, then begins the section again,
something like the interrupted story of the King of Bohemia and his
Seven Castles.Then follows an abrupt discursive study of his aptitudes
and proclivities, interspersed with Latin exclamations, interrogation
points and dashes.“What a parenthesis is that!” he cries, and a few
lines further on, “I burn with longing to begin a parenthesis again.” On
his arrival in Leipzig, Schummel imitates closely Sterne’s satirical
guide-book description of Calais[10] in his brief account of the city,
breaking off abruptly like Sterne, and roundly berating all
“Reisebeschreiber.” Here in fitting contrast with this superficial
enumeration of facts stands his brief traveler’s creed, an interest in
people rather than in places, all of which is derived from Sterne’s
chapter, “In the Street, Calais,” in which the master discloses the
sentimental possibilities of traveling and typifies the superficial,
unemotional wanderer in the persons of Smelfungus and Mundungus, and
from the familiar passage in “The Passport, Versailles,” beginning, “But
I could wish to spy out the nakedness, etc.” No sooner is he arrived in
Leipzig, than he accomplishes a sentimental rescue of an unfortunate
woman on the street.In the expression of her immediate needs, Schummel
indulges for the first time in a row of stars, with the obvious
intention of raising a low suggestion, which he contradicts with
mock-innocent questionings a few lines later, thereby fastening the
attention on the possibility of vulgar interpretation.Sterne is guilty
of this device in numerous instances in both his works, and the English
continuation of the Sentimental Journey relies upon it in greater and
more revolting measure.Once established in his hotel, the author betakes himself to the
theater: this very act he feels will bring upon him the censure of the
critics, for Yorick went to the theater too.“A merchant’s boy went
along before me,” he says in naïve defense, “was he also an imitator of
Yorick?” On the way he meets a fair maid-in-waiting, and the relation
between her and the traveler, developed here and later, is inspired
directly by Yorick’s connection with the fair _fille de chambre_.Schummel imitates Sterne’s excessive detail of description, devoting a
whole paragraph to his manner of removing his hat before a lady whom he
encounters on this walk to the theater.This was another phase of
Sterne’s pseudo-scientific method: he describes the trivial with the
attitude of the trained observer, registering minutely the detail of
phenomena, a mock-parade of scholarship illustrated by his description
of Trim’s attitude while reading his sermon, or the dropping of the hat
in the kitchen during the memorable scene when the news of Bobby’s death
is brought.In Schummel’s narration of his adventures in the house of ill-repute
there are numerous sentimental excrescences in his conduct with the poor
prisoner there, due largely to Yorick’s pattern, such as their weeping
on one another’s breast, and his wiping away her tears and his, drawn
from Yorick’s amiable service for Maria of Moulines, an act seemingly
expressing the most refined human sympathy.The remaining events of this
first volume include an unexpected meeting with the kind baker’s wife,
which takes place at Gellert’s grave.Yorick’s imitators were especially
fond of re-introducing a sentimental relationship.Yorick led the way in
his renewed acquaintance with the _fille de chambre_; Stevenson in his
continuation went to extremes in exploiting this cheap device.Other motifs derived from Sterne, less integral, may be briefly
summarized.From the Sentimental Journey is taken the motif that
valuable or interesting papers be used to wrap ordinary articles of
trade: here herring are wrapped in fragments of the father’s philosophy;
in the Sentimental Journey we find a similar degrading use for the
“Fragment.” Schummel breaks off the chapter “La Naïve,”[11] under the
Sternesque subterfuge of having to deliver manuscript to an insistent
publisher.Yorick writes his preface to the Journey in the
“Désobligeant,” that is, in the midst of the narrative itself.Schummel
modifies the eccentricity merely by placing his foreword at the end of
the volume.The value of it, he says, will repay the reader for waiting
so long,--a statement which finds little justification in the preface
itself.It begins, “Auweh!Diable, mein
Rücken, mein Fuss!” and so on for half a page,--a pitiful effort to
follow the English master’s wilful and skilful incoherence.The
following pages, however, once this outbreak is at an end, contain a
modicum of sense, the feeble, apologetic explanation of his desire in
imitating Yorick, given in forethought of the critics’ condemnation.Similarly the position of the dedication is unusual, in the midst of the
volume, even as the dedication of Shandy was roguishly delayed.The
dedication itself, however, is not an imitation of Sterne’s clever
satire, but, addressed to Yorick himself, is a striking example of
burning personal devotion and over-wrought praise.Schummel hopes[12] in
Sterne fashion to write a chapter on “Vorübergeben,” or in the chapter
“Das Komödienhaus” (pp.185-210) to write a digression on “Walking
behind a maid.” Like Sterne, he writes in praise of digressions.[13] In
imitation of Sterne is conceived the digressive speculation concerning
the door through which at the beginning of the book he is cast into the
rude world.Among further expressions savoring of Sterne, may be
mentioned a “Centner of curses” (p.39), a “Quentchen of curses,” and
the analytical description of a tone of voice as one-fourth questioning,
five-eighths entreating and one-eighth commanding (p. 229).The direct allusions to Sterne and his works are numerous.A list of
Sterne characters which were indelibly impressed upon his mind is found
near the very beginning (pp.3-4); other allusions are to M. Dessein
(p.65), La Fleur’s “Courierstiefel” (p.115), the words of the dying
Yorick (p.128), the pococurantism of Mrs.187), the division
of travelers into types (p.200), Yorick’s
violin-playing (p.274), the foolish fat scullion (p.290), Yorick’s
description of a maid’s (p.188) eyes, “als ob sie zwischen vier Wänden
einem Garaus machen könnten.”

The second volume is even more incoherent in narration, and contains
less genuine occurrence and more ill-considered attempts at
whimsicality, yet throughout this volume there are indications that the
author is awakening to the vulnerability of his position, and this is in
no other particular more easily discernible than in the half-hearted
defiance of the critics and his anticipation of their censure.The
change, so extraordinary in the third volume, is foreshadowed in the
second.Purely sentimental, effusive, and abundantly teary is the story
of the rescued baker’s wife.In this excess of sentiment, Schummel shows
his intellectual appreciation of Sterne’s individual treatment of the
humane and pathetic, for near the end of the poor woman’s narrative the
author seems to recollect a fundamental sentence of Sterne’s creed, the
inevitable admixture of the whimsical, and here he introduces into the
sentimental relation a Shandean idiosyncrasy: from page 43 the narrative
leaps back to the beginning of the volume, and Schummel advises the
reader to turn back and re-read, referring incidentally to his confused
fashion of narration.The awkwardness with which this is done proves
Schummel’s inability to follow Yorick, though its use shows his
appreciation of Sterne’s peculiar genius.The visit of the author, the
baker’s wife and her daughter (the former lady’s maid) to the graveyard
is Yorickian in flavor, and the plucking of nettles from the grave of
the dead epileptic is a direct borrowing.Attempts to be immorally,
sensuously suggestive in the manner of Sterne are found in the so-called
chapter on “Button-holes,” here cast in a more Shandean vein, and in the
adventure “die ängstliche Nacht,”--in the latter case resembling more
the less frank, more insinuating method of the Sentimental Journey.The
sentimental attitude toward man’s dumb companions is imitated in his
adventure with the house-dog; the author fears the barking of this
animal may disturb the sleep of the poor baker’s wife: he beats the dog
into silence, then grows remorseful and wishes “that I had given him no
blow,” or that the dog might at least give him back the blows.His
thought that the dog might be pretending its pain, he designates a
subtle subterfuge of his troubled conscience, and Goethe, in the review
mentioned above, exclaims, “A fine pendant to Yorick’s scene with the
Monk.”

Distinctly Shandean are the numerous digressions, as on imitation
(p.16), on authors and fairs (p.226-238)
“ein ganz originelles Gemische von Wiz, Belesenheit, Scharfsinn,
gesunder Philosophie, Erfahrung, Algebra und Mechanik,” or (p.253) “Von
der Entstehungsart eines Buches nach Erfindung der Buchdrukerkunst,”
which in reference to Sterne’s phrase, is called a “jungfräuliche
Materie.” He promises (pp.75 and 108), like Sterne, to write numerous
chapters on extraordinary subjects,--indeed, he announces his intention
of supplementing the missing sections of Shandy on “Button-holes” and on
the “Right and Left (sic) end of a Woman.” His own promised effusions
are to be “Ueber die roten und schwarzen Röcke,” “über die Verbindung
der Theologie mit Schwarz,” “Europäischenfrauenzimmerschuhabsätze,” half
a one “Ueber die Schuhsohlen” and “Ueber meinen Namen.”

His additions to Shandy are flat and witless, that on the “Right and
Wrong End of a Woman” (pp.degenerating into three brief
narratives displaying woman’s susceptibility to flattery, the whole idea
probably adapted from Sterne’s chapter, “An Act of Charity;” the chapter
on “Button-holes” is made a part of the general narrative of his
relation to his “Naïve.” Weakly whimsical is his seeking pardon for the
discourse with which the Frenchman (pp.62-66), under the pretext that
it belonged somewhere else and had inadvertently crept in.Shandean also
is the black margin to pages 199-206, the line upside down (p.175),
the twelve irregularly printed lines (p.331), inserted to indicate his
efforts in writing with a burned hand, the lines of dashes and
exclamation points, the mathematical, financial calculation of the worth
of his book from various points of view, and the description of the
maiden’s walk (p. 291).Sterne’s mock-scientific method, as already
noted, is observable again in the statement of the position of the
dagger “at an angle of 30°” (p. 248).His coining of new words, for
which he is censured by the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, is also a
legacy of Yorick’s method.The third volume bears little relation to Sterne aside from its title,
and one can only wonder, in view of the criticism of the two parts
already published and the nature of the author’s own partial revulsion
of feeling, that he did not give up publishing it altogether, or choose
another title, and sunder the work entirely from the foregoing volumes,
with which it has in fact so contradictory a connection.It may be that
his relations to the publisher demanded the issuing of the third part
under the same title.This volume is easily divisible into several distinct parts, which are
linked with one another, and to the preceding narrative, only by a
conventional thread of introduction.These comprise: the story of
Caroline and Rosenfeld, a typical eighteenth century tale of love,
seduction and flight; the hosts’ ballad, “Es war einmahl ein Edelmann;”
the play, “Die unschuldige Ehebrecherin” and “Mein Tagebuch,” the
journal of an honest preacher, and a further sincere exploitation of
Schummel’s ideas upon the clergyman’s office, his ideal of simplicity,
kindliness, and humanity.In the latter part of the book Schummel
resumes his original narrative, and indulges once more in the luxury of
sentimental adventure, but without the former abortive attempts at
imitating Sterne’s peculiarities of diction.This last resumption of the
sentimental creed introduces to us one event evidently inspired by
Yorick: he meets a poor, maimed soldier-beggar.Since misfortune has
deprived the narrator himself of his possessions, he can give nothing
and goes a begging for the beggar’s sake, introducing the new and highly
sentimental idea of “vicarious begging” (pp.In the following
episode, a visit to a child-murderess, Schummel leaves a page entirely
blank as an appropriate proof of incapacity to express his emotions
attendant on the execution of the unfortunate.Sterne also left a page
blank for the description of the Widow Wadman’s charms.At the very end of the book Schummel drops his narrative altogether and
discourses upon his own work.It would be difficult to find in any
literature so complete a condemnation of one’s own serious and extensive
endeavor, so candid a criticism of one’s own work, so frank an
acknowledgment of the pettiness of one’s achievement.He says his work,
as an imitation of Sterne’s two novels, has “few or absolutely no
beauties of the original, and many faults of its own.” He states that
his enthusiasm for Tristram has been somewhat dampened by Sonnenfels and
Riedel; he sees now faults which should not have been imitated; the
frivolous attitude of the narrator toward his father and mother is
deprecated, and the suggestion is given that this feature was derived
from Tristram’s own frankness concerning the eccentricities and
incapacities of his parents.He begs reference to a passage in the
second volume[14] where the author alludes with warmth of appreciation
to his real father and mother; that is, genuine regard overcame the
temporary blindness, real affection arose and thrust out the transitory
inclination to an alien whimsicality.Schummel admits that he has utterly failed in his effort to characterize
the German people in the way Sterne treated the English and French; he
confesses that the ninety-page autobiography which precedes the journey
itself was intended to be Tristram-like, but openly stigmatizes his own
failure as “ill conceived, incoherent and not very well told!” After
mentioning some few incidents and passages in this first section which
he regards as passable, he boldly condemns the rest as “almost beneath
all criticism,” and the same words are used with reference to much that
follows, in which he confesses to imitation, bad taste and intolerable
indelicacy.He calls his pathetic attempts at whimsical mannerisms
(Heideldum, etc.), “kläglich, überaus kläglich,” expresses the opinion
that one would not be surprised at the reader who would throw away the
whole book at such a passage.The words of the preacher in the two
sections where he is allowed to air his opinions still meet with his
approval, and the same is true of one or two other sections.In
conclusion, he states that the first part contains hardly one hundred
good pages, and that the second part is worse than the first, so that he
is unwilling to look at it again and seek out its faults.The absence of
allusions to Sterne’s writings is marked, except in the critical section
at the end, he mentions Sterne but once (p.239), where he calls him
“schnurrigt.” This alteration of feeling must have taken place in a
brief space of time, for the third volume is signed April 25, 1772.It
is not easy to establish with probability the works of Sonnenfels and
Riedel which are credited with a share in this revulsion of feeling.In all of this Schummel is a discriminating critic of his own work; he
is also discerning in his assertion that the narrative contained in his
volume is conceived more in the vein of Fielding and Richardson.The
Sterne elements are rather embroidered on to the other fabric, or, as he
himself says, using another figure, “only fried in Shandy fat.”[15]

Goethe’s criticism of the second volume, already alluded to, is found in
the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ in the issue of March 3, 1772.The
nature of the review is familiar: Goethe calls the book a thistle which
he has found on Yorick’s grave.“Alles,” he says, “hat es dem guten
Yorick geraubt, Speer, Helm und Lanze, nur Schade!inwendig steckt der
Herr Präceptor S. zu Magdeburg.Yorick empfand, und dieser setzt
sich hin zu empfinden.Yorick wird von seiner Laune ergriffen, und
weinte und lachte in einer Minute und durch die Magie der Sympathie
lachen und weinen wir mit: hier aber steht einer und überlegt: wie lache
und weine ich?was werden die Leute sagen, wenn ich lache und weine?”
etc.Schummel is stigmatized as a childish imitator and his book is
censured as “beneath criticism,” oddly enough the very judgment its own
author accords but a few weeks later on the completion of the third
volume.The review contains several citations illustrative of Schummel’s
style.The first two parts were reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek_.[16] The length of the review is testimony to the interest
in the book, and the tone of the article, though frankly unfavorable,
is not so emphatically censorious as the one first noted.It is observed
that Schummel has attempted the impossible,--the adoption of another’s
“Laune,” and hence his failure.The reviewer notes, often with generous
quotations, the more noticeable, direct imitations from Sterne, the
conversation of the emotions, the nettle-plucking at the grave, the
eccentric orthography and the new-coined words.Several passages of
comment or comparison testify to the then current admiration of Yorick,
and the conventional German interpretation of his character; “sein
gutes, empfindungsvolles Herz, mit Tugend und sittlichem Gefühl
erfüllt.” The review is signed “Sr:”[17]

A critic in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ for January
17, 1772, treating the first two volumes, expresses the opinion that
Jacobi, the author of the “Tagereise,” and Schummel have little but the
title from Yorick.The author’s seeking for opportunity to dissolve in
emotion is contrasted unfavorably with Yorick’s method, the affected
style is condemned, yet it is admitted that the work promises better
things from its talented author; his power of observation and his good
heart are not to be unacknowledged.The severity of the review is
directed against the imitators already arising.The _Magazin der deutschen Critik_[18] reviews the third volume with
favorable comment; the comedy which Schummel saw fit to insert is
received with rather extraordinary praise, and the author is urged to
continue work in the drama; a desire is expressed even for a fourth
part.The _Hamburgische Neue Zeitung_, June 4 and October 29, 1771,
places Schummel unhesitatingly beside the English master, calls him as
original as his pattern, to Sterne belongs the honor only of the
invention.The author is hailed as a genius whose talents should be
supported, so that Germany would not have to envy England her
Yorick.[19]

After Schummel’s remarkable self-chastisement, one could hardly expect
to find in his subsequent works evidence of Sterne’s influence, save as
unconsciously a dimmed admiration might exert a certain force.Probably
contemporaneous with the composition of the third volume of the work,
but possibly earlier, Schummel wrote the fourth part of a ponderous
novel by a fellow Silesian, Christian Opitz, entitled “Die Gleichheit
der menschlichen Herzen, bey der Ungleichheit ihrer äusserlichen
Umstände in der Geschichte Herrn Redlichs und seiner Bedienten.” Goedeke
implies that Opitz was the author of all but the last part, but the
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[20] maintains that each
part has a different author, and quotes the preface to the fourth as
substantiation.According to this review both the second and fourth
parts are characterized by a humorous fashion in writing, and the last
is praised as being the best of the four.It seems probable that
Schummel’s enthusiasm for Sterne played its part in the composition of
this work.Possibly encouraged by the critic’s approbation, Schummel devoted his
literary effort for the following years largely to the drama.In 1774 he
published his “Uebersetzer-Bibliothek zum Gebrauche der Uebersetzer,
Schulmänner und Liebhaber der alten Litteratur.” The reviewer[21] in the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ finds passages in this book in which
the author of the “Empfindsame Reisen” is visible,--where his fancy runs
away with his reason,--and a passage is quoted in which reference is
made to Slawkenberg’s book on noses.It would seem that the seeking for
wit survived the crude sentimentality.Two years later Schummel published “Fritzen’s Reise nach Dessau,”[22]
a work composed of letters from a twelve-year old boy, written on a
journey from Magdeburg to Dessau.The letters are quite without whim or
sentiment, and the book has been remembered for the extended description
of Basedow’s experimental school, “Philantropin” (opened in 1774).Its
account has been the source of the information given of this endeavor in
some pedagogical treatises[23] and it was re-issued, as a document in
the history of pedagogical experiment, in Leipzig, by Albert Richter in
1891.About fifteen years later still the “Reise durch Schlesien”[24]
was issued.It is a simple narrative of a real journey with description
of places and people, frankly personal, almost epistolary in form,
without a suggestion of Sterne-like whim or sentiment.One passage is
significant as indicating the author’s realization of his change of
attitude.The sight of a group of prisoners bound by a chain calls to
his memory his former sentimental extravagance, and he exclaims: “Twenty
years ago, when I was still a sentimental traveler, I would have wasted
many an ‘Oh’ and ‘alas’ over this scene; at present, since I have
learned to know the world and mankind somewhat more intimately, I think
otherwise.”

Johann Christian Bock (1724-1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet of the
Ackerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the
production of “Die Tagereise,” which was published at Leipzig in 1770.The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title “Die Geschichte eines
empfundenen Tages.”[25] The only change in the new edition was the
addition of a number of copperplate engravings.The book is inspired in
part by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary
Jacobi.Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean
influence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey.In
outward form the book resembles Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” since verse is
introduced to vary the prose narrative.The attitude of the author
toward his journey, undertaken with conscious purpose, is characteristic
of the whole set of emotional sentiment-seekers, who found in their
Yorick a challenge to go and do likewise: “Everybody is journeying,
I thought, and took Yorick and Jacobi with me.I will really see
whether I too may not chance upon a _fille de chambre_ or a
harvest-maid,” is a very significant statement of his inspiration and
intention.Once started on his journey, the author falls in with a poor
warrior-beggar, an adaptation of Sterne’s Chevalier de St.Louis,[26]
and he puts in verse Yorick’s expressed sentiment that the king and the
fatherland should not allow the faithful soldier to fall into such
distress.Bock’s next sentimental adventure is with a fair peasant-maid whom he
sees weeping by the wayside.Through Yorick-like insistence of sympathy,
he finally wins from her information concerning the tender situation:
a stern stepfather, an unwelcome suitor of his choosing, and a lover of
her own.Her inability to write and thus communicate with the latter is
the immediate cause of the present overflow.The traveler beholds in
this predicament a remarkable sentimental opportunity and offers his
services; he strokes her cheek, her tears are dried, and they part like
brother and sister.The episode is unquestionably inspired by the
episode of Maria of Moulines; in the latter development of the affair,
the sentiment, which is expressed, that the girl’s innocence is her own
defense is borrowed directly from Yorick’s statement concerning the
_fille de chambre_.[27] The traveler’s questioning of his own motives in
“Die Ueberlegung”[28] is distinctly Sterne-like, and it demonstrates
also Bock’s appreciation of this quizzical element in Yorick’s attitude
toward his own sentimental behavior.The relation of man to the domestic
animals is treated sentimentally in the episode of the old beggar and
his dead dog:[29] the tears of the beggar, his affection for the beast,
their genuine comradeship, and the dog’s devotion after the world had
forsaken his master, are all part and parcel of that fantastic humane
movement which has its source in Yorick’s dead ass.Bock practically
confesses his inspiration by direct allusion to the episode in Yorick.Bock defends with warmth the old peasant and his grief.The wanderer’s acquaintance with the lady’s companion[30] is adapted
from Yorick’s _fille de chambre_ connection, and Bock cannot avoid a
fleshly suggestion, distinctly in the style of Yorick in the section,
the “Spider.”[31] The return journey in the sentimental moonlight
affords the author another opportunity for the exercise of his broad
human sympathy: he meets a poor woman, a day-laborer with her child,
gives them a few coins and doubts whether king or bishop could be more
content with the benediction of the apostolic chair than he with the
blessing of this unfortunate,--a sentiment derived from Yorick’s
overcolored veneration for the horn snuff-box.The churchyard scene with which the journey ends is more openly
fanciful, down-right visionary in tone, but the manner is very
emphatically not that of Sterne, though in the midst the Sterne motif of
nettle-plucking is introduced.This sentimental episode took hold of
German imagination with peculiar force.The hobby-horse idea also was
sure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.[32]

But apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the
foreign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is
genuine and original: the author’s German patriotism, his praise of the
old days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled “Die Gaststube,” his
“Trinklied eines Deutschen,” his disquisition on the position of the
poet in the world (“ein eignes Kapitel”), and his adulation of Gellert
at the latter’s grave.The reviewer in the _Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften_[33] chides the unnamed, youthful author for not
allowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for being led on
by Jacobi’s success to hasten his exercises into print.In reality Bock
was no longer youthful (forty-six) when the “Tagereise” was published.The _Almanach der deutschen Musen_ for 1771, calls the book “an
unsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,” and wishes that this
“Rhapsodie von Cruditäten” might be the last one thrust on the market as
a “Sentimental Journey.” The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[34]
comments also on the double inspiration, and the insufficiency and
tiresomeness of the performance.And yet Boie[35] says the papers
praised the little book; for himself, however, he observes, he little
desires to read it, and adds “What will our Yoricks yet come to?At last
they will get pretty insignificant, I think, if they keep on this way.”

Bock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the
early seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1) Empfindsame
Reise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick
angestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771--really published at the end of
the previous year; (2) . . .am Ostertage, 1772; (3) Am Pfingsttage,
1772; (4) Am Johannistage, 1773; (5) Am Weynachtstage, 1773.These books
were issued anonymously, and Schröder’s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3)
under Bock’s name, but there seems no good reason to doubt his
authorship of them all.Indeed, his claim to (1) is, according to the
_Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the
“Tagereise” in the introduction, and by the initials signed.None of
them are given by Goedeke.The books are evidently only in a general way
dependent on the Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all
sorts of subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some
relation to the festival in which they appear.In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that the
title only is derived from Yorick,[36] and states that he was forced to
this misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but
“Empfindsame Reisen.” It is also to be noted that the description
beneath the title, “von einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,” is omitted
after the first volume.The review of (4) and (5) in the _Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter_ finds this a commendable resumption of proper
humility.The observations are evidently loosely strung together without
the pretense of a narrative, such as “Allgemeines Perspectiv durch alle
Visitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines
Weisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschlüsse, Empfindsame Art sein
Geld gut unterzubringen,” etc.[37] An obvious purpose inspires the
writer, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the meditations
are distinctly religious.That some of the observations had a local
significance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental tendency
there, may account for the warm reception by the _Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent_.[38]

Some contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias Claudius
and Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of mental
and emotional fibre is suggested.No one claimed an influence working
from the English master.Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm Röseler in his
introductory poem to a study of “Matthias Claudius und sein Humor”[39]
calls Asmus, “Deutschland’s Yorick,” thereby agreeing almost verbally
with the German correspondent of the _Deutsches Museum_, who wrote from
London nearly a hundred years before, September 14, 1778, “Asmus.is the German Sterne,” an assertion which was denied by a later
correspondent, who asserts that Claudius’s manner is very different from
that of Sterne.[40]

August von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on
Sterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, “Die Geschichte
meines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.”[41] The
influence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story:
he commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and
grandmother, and the circumstances of his father’s birth.The
grandfather is an original undoubtedly modeled on lines suggested by
Sterne’s hobby-horse idea.He had been chosen in days gone by to greet
the reigning prince on the latter’s return from a journey, and the old
man harks back to this circumstance with “hobby-horsical” persistence,
whatever the subject of conversation, even as all matters led Uncle Toby
to military fortification, and the elder Shandy to one of his pet
theories.In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed.When the
news comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man
discuss multifarious and irrelevant topics in a fashion reminiscent of
the conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while similar events
are going on above.Later in the book we have long lists, or catalogues
of things which resemble one of Sterne’s favorite mannerisms.But the
greater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far removed from its
inception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a gallery of
originals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.Göschen’s “Reise von Johann”[42] is a product of the late renascence of
sentimental journeying.Master and servant are represented in this book
as traveling through southern Germany, a pair as closely related in head
and heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain Shandy and Corporal Trim.The style is of rather forced buoyancy and sprightliness, with
intentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt at humor of
narration, which is choked by characteristic national desire to convey
information, and a fatal propensity to description of places,[43] even
when some satirical purpose underlies the account, as in the description
of Erlangen and its university.The servant Johann has mild adventures
with the maids in the various inns, which are reminiscent of Yorick,
and in one case it borders on the openly suggestive and more Shandean
method.[44] A distinctly borrowed motif is the accidental finding of
papers which contain matters of interest.This is twice resorted to;
a former occupant of the room in the inn in Nürnberg had left valuable
notes of travel; and Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on
self-destruction, takes from her a box with papers, disclosing a
revolting story, baldly told.German mediocrity, imitating Yorick in
this regard, and failing of his delicacy and subtlety, brought forth
hideous offspring.An attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in
the “Furth Catechismus in Frage und Antwort” (pp.71-74), and genuinely
sentimental adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp.70-71)
and the village funeral (pp.This book is classed by Ebeling[45] without sufficient reason as an
imitation of von Thümmel.This statement is probably derived from the
letter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following
lines.Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,
December 29, 1795.[46] The abundance of material for the Xenien project
is commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list of
vulnerable possibilities we read: “Thümmel, Göschen als sein
Stallmeister--” a collocation of names easily attributable, in
consideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature
of their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author
on another,[47] or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the fact
that Göschen was von Thümmel’s publisher.Nor is there anything in the
correspondence to justify Ebeling’s harshness in saying concerning this
volume of Göschen, that it “enjoyed the honor of being ridiculed
(verhöhnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.”
Goethe replies (December 30), in approval, and exclaims, “How fine
Charis and Johann will appear beside one another.”[48] The suggestion
concerning a possible use of Göschen’s book in the Xenien was never
carried out.It will be remembered that Göschen submitted the manuscript of his book
to Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement
“that he had laughed heartily at some of the whims.[49]” Garve, in a
letter dated March 8, 1875, speaks of Göschen’s book in terms of
moderate praise.[50]

The “Empfindsame Reise von Oldenburg nach Bremen,”[51] the author of
which was a Hanoverian army officer, H. J. C. Hedemann, is characterized
by Ebeling as emphatically not inspired by Sterne.[52] Although it is
not a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and Bock conceived it,
and is thus not an example of the earliest period of imitation, and
although it contains no passages of teary sentimentality in attitude
toward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all connection with
Sterne’s manner.It would seem as if, having outgrown the earlier
Yorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human brotherhood,
perhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution, certain would-be
men of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as through a glass
darkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in lumbering,
Teutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of sentimentalism, and
to build success for their wares on remembrance of a defaced idol.This
view of later sentimental journeying is practically acknowledged at any
rate in a contemporary review, the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_ for
August 22, 1796, which remarks: “A sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet,
wo einige bekannte Sachen und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz
heben sollen.”[53]

Hedemann’s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is
openly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.His endeavor is markedly in Sterne’s manner in his attitude toward the
writing of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing
the material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the
various parts of the book.Quite in Sterne’s fashion, and to be
associated with Sterne’s frequent promises of chapters, and statements
concerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination “to
mention some things beforehand about which I don’t know anything to
say,” and his rather humorous enumeration of them.The author satirizes
the real sentimental traveler of Sterne’s earlier imitators in the
following passage (second chapter):

“It really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,
if no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is
surely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be
managed with strict economy.If one leaps over the most interesting
events entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at
least of not filling many pages.”

Likewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the
satirical purpose is evident.He has not gone far on his journey when he
is met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines
that there is a “Schlagbaum” in the way.After the children have opened
the barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little
coin, concludes, as a “sentimental traveler,” to give it to the other
sex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct.He
reflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,--all of
which is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to trivial
acts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past conduct,
which was copied by Sterne’s imitators from numerous instances in the
works of Yorick.Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in which
he beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a paper
throne; and of particular significance here is the explanation that the
whole company who do “erhabene Dummheit” honor formerly lived in cities
of the kingdom, but “now they are on journeys.” Further examples of a
humorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it would be a
“great error” to write an account of a journey without weaving in an
anecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all duties of such
a traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to accomplish it, and his
formal declaration: “I, the undersigned, do vow and make promise to be
in love before twenty-four hours are past.” The story with which his
volume closes, “Das Ständchen,” is rather entertaining and is told
graphically, easily, without whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian
_double entendre_.[54]

Another work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning
shade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole
remaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the
“Empfindsame Reise nach Schilda” (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo.von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the _Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung_
(1794, I, p.416) as a free revision of an old popular tale, “Das
lustige und lächerliche Lalenburg.” The book is evidently without
sentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and joke combined with
caricature and half-serious tilting against unimportant literary
celebrities.[55]

Certain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously connected
with Sterne may be grouped together here.To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous product,
“Zween Tage eines Schwindsüchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,” von L. . . .(Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the sentiment is “not
entirely like Yorick’s,” and the _Altonaer Reichs-Postreuter_ (July 2,
1772) adds that “not at all like Yorick’s” would have been nearer the
truth.This book is mentioned by Hillebrand with implication that it is
the extreme example of the absurd sentimental tendency, probably judging
merely from the title,[56] for the book is doubtless merely thoughtful,
contemplative, with a minimum of overwrought feeling.According to the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_ (1775, pp.592-3),
another product of the earlier seventies, the “Leben und Schicksale des
Martin Dickius,” by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many places a clever
imitation of Sterne,[57] although the author claims, like Wezel in
“Tobias Knaut,” not to have read Shandy until after the book was
written.Surely the digression on noses which the author allows himself
is suspicious.Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which reference
has been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent criticism as
an imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel “Beyträge zur Geschichte
des teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,”[58] although the general
tenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance, seemed to promise a
more independent, a more competent and felicitous performance.Kurz
expresses this opinion, which may have been derived from criticisms in
the eighteenth century journals.The _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,
July 28, 1775, does not, however, take this view; but seems to be in the
novel a genuine exemplification of the author’s theories as previously
expressed.[59] The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[60] calls the book
didactic, a tract against certain essentially German follies.Merck, in
the _Teutscher Merkur_,[61] says the imitation of Sterne is quite too
obvious, though Blankenburg denies it.Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,
belongs undoubtedly “Die Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont” (1773),
the author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was
translated or Jacobi published.He says he is not worthy to pack
Yorick’s bag or weave Jacobi’s arbor,[62] but the review of the
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ evidently regards it as a product,
nevertheless, of Yorick’s impulse.Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau
la Roche[63] says that the “Empfindsamkeit” of Rosalie in the first part
of “Rosaliens Briefe” is derived from Yorick.The “Leben, Thaten und
Meynungen des D. J. Pet.Menadie” (Halle, 1777-1781) is charged by the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_ with attempt at Shandy-like
eccentricity of narrative and love of digression.[64]

One little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick’s spell, is worthy
of particular mention because at its time it received from the reviewers
a more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file of
Sentimental Journeys.It is “M . . ..” by E. A. A. von Göchhausen
(1740-1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed
worthy of several later editions.Its dependence on Sterne is confessed
and obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes
defiantly.The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both
in outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness
dwindles away steadily as the book advances.Göchhausen, as other
imitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously
now and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to
say, a message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to
follow his model.The absurd title stands, of course, for “Meine Reisen” and the puerile
abbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were intended to be
a Sterne-like jest, a pitiful one.Why Goedeke should suggest “Meine
Randglossen” is quite inexplicable, since Göchhausen himself in the very
first chapter indicates the real title.Beneath the enigmatical title
stands an alleged quotation from Shandy: “Ein Autor borgt, bettelt und
stiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey meiner Seele!die Originalität
fast so rar geworden ist als die Ehrlichkeit.”[65] The book itself, like
Sterne’s Journey, is divided into brief chapters unnumbered but named.As the author loses Yorick from sight, the chapters grow longer.Göchhausen has availed himself of an odd device to disarm
criticism,--a plan used once or twice by Schummel: occasionally when the
imitation is obvious, he repudiates the charge sarcastically, or
anticipates with irony the critics’ censure.For example, he gives
directions to his servant Pumper to pack for the journey; a reader
exclaims, “a portmanteau, Mr.Author, so that everything, even to that,
shall be just like Yorick,” and in the following passage the author
quarrels with the critics who allow no one to travel with a portmanteau,
because an English clergyman traveled with one.Pumper’s
misunderstanding of this objection is used as a farther ridicule of the
critics.When on the journey, the author converses with two poor
wandering monks, whose conversation, at any rate, is a witness to their
content, the whole being a legacy of the Lorenzo episode, and the author
entitles the chapter: “The members of the religious order, or, as some
critics will call it, a wretchedly unsuccessful imitation.” In the next
chapter, “Der Visitator” (pp.in which the author encounters
customs annoyances, the critic is again allowed to complain that
everything is stolen from Yorick, a protest which is answered by the
author quite naïvely, “Yorick journeyed, ate, drank; I do too.” In “Die
Pause” the author stands before the inn door and fancies that a number
of spies (Ausspäher) stand there waiting for him; he protests that
Yorick encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a very different
sort of folk.On page 253 he exclaims, “für diesen schreibe ich dieses
Kapitel nicht und ich--beklage ihn!” Here a footnote suggests “Das
übrige des Diebstahls vid.Yorick’s Gefangenen.” Similarly when he calls
his servant his “La Fleur,” he converses with the critics about his
theft from Yorick.The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about the
name of the book.The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the motto, is
clinched by reference to this quotation in the section “Apologie,” and
by the following chapter, which is entitled “Yorick.” The latter is the
most unequivocal and, withal, the most successful imitation of Yorick’s
manner which the volume offers.The author is sitting on a sofa reading
the Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such a trip is awakened in him.Someone knocks and the door is opened by the postman, as the narrator is
opening his “Lorenzodose,” and the story of the poor monk is touching
his heart now for the twentieth time as strongly as ever.The postman
asks postage on the letter as well as his own trivial fee.The author
counts over money, miscounts it, then in counting forgets all about it,
puts the money away and continues the reading of Yorick.The postman
interrupts him; the author grows impatient and says, “You want four
groschen?” and is inexplicably vexed at the honesty of the man who says
it is only three pfennigs for himself and the four groschen for the
post.Here is a direct following of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules
his behavior toward an inferior, who is modest in his request.After the
incident, his spite, his head and his heart and his “ich” converse in
true Sterne fashion as to the advisability of his beginning to read
Yorick again.He reasons with himself concerning his conduct toward the
postman, then in an apostrophe to Yorick he condemns himself for failing
in this little test.This conversation occupies so much time that he
cannot run after the postman, but he resolves that nothing, not even the
fly that lights on his nose, shall bring him so far as to forget
wherefore his friend J . . . .sent him a “Lorenzodose.” And at the end
of the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,
disclosing the letters of the word “Yorick.” The “Lorenzodose” is
mentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by
opening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the
treasure.[66]

Following this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to “My dear
J . . .,” who, at the author’s request, had sent him on June 29th a
“Lorenzodose.” Jacobi’s accompanying words are given.The author
acknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the self-conquest
demanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been won.Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the volume
contains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment.The servant Pumper
is a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the dewdrops from
the blades of grass.Cast in the real Yorick mould is the scene in which
Pumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master’s expostulation that
God created the little beast also, Pumper is touched, wipes the blood
off with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness, indulging in a
pathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick’s ass episode.Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator’s conduct
toward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author asserts that
he has never eaten a roll, put on a white shirt, traveled in a
comfortable carriage, or been borne by a strong horse, without bemoaning
those who were less fortunately circumstanced.A similar and truly
Sterne-like triumph of feeling over convention is the traveler’s
insistence that Pumper shall ride with him inside the coach; seemingly a
point derived from Jacobi’s failure to be equally democratic.[67]

Sterne’s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially
his distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his
material is here imitated.For example: near the close of a chapter the
author summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title
“Der Brief” and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says
the latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced
in the following one.Yet with Yorick’s inconsequence, the narrator is
led aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, “But where is
Pumper?” with the answer, “Heaven and my readers know, it was to no
purpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last
one to which the title will be just as appropriate)”, and the next
chapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning “As to whether Pumper
will appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I am not really
sure myself.”

The whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the
author’s reasoning with him, a Sterne device, is employed so constantly
in the book as to become a wearying mannerism.Examples have already
been cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is devoted
to such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later the
reader objects to the narrator’s drinking coffee without giving a
chapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what
the chapter is going to be because of the author’s leap; the reader
guesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions
in the moon.The chapter “Der Einwurf” is occupied entirely with the
reader’s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of
fancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the
book; here the author discloses himself.[68] Sterne-like whim is found
in the chapter “Die Nacht,” which consists of a single sentence: “Ich
schenke Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig
verschlafen.” Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the
chapter entitled “Der Monolog,” which consists of four lines of dots,
and the question, “Didn’t you think all this too, my readers?”
Typographical eccentricity is observed also in the arrangement of the
conversation of the ladies A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter.Like Sterne, our author makes lists of things; probably inspired by
Yorick’s apostrophe to the “Sensorium” is our traveler’s appeal to the
spring of joy.The description of the fashion of walking observed in the
maid in the moon is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel’s
journey.Göchhausen’s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is
considerable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers;
his stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.The literary journals accepted Göchhausen’s work as a Yorick imitation,
condemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the book worthy
of their praise.[69]

Probably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure the
style of Tristram Shandy is Wezel’s once famous “Tobias Knaut,” the
“Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt,
aus Familiennachrichten gesammelt.”[70] In this work the influence of
Fielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne.The historians of
literature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of
the period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge
of human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.[71] They
unite also in the opinion that “Tobias Knaut” places Wezel in the ranks
of Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in
part the novel must be regarded as a satire on “Empfindsamkeit” and
hence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne’s
dominion, especially to the distinctively German Sterne.That this
impulse, which later became the guiding principle of “Wilhelmine Arend,”
was already strong in “Tobias Knaut” is hinted at by Gervinus, but
passed over in silence by other writers.Kurz, following Wieland, who
reviewed the novel in his _Merkur_, finds that the influence of Sterne
was baneful.Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as
obscuring and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents
of the author.[72]

A brief investigation of Wezel’s novel will easily demonstrate his
indebtedness to Sterne.Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the
charge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when “Tobias”
was begun.Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes
Tristram at some length.[73] This inconsistency is occasion for censure
on the part of the reviewers.Wezel’s story begins, like Shandy, “ab ovo,” and, in resemblance to
Sterne’s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child
before its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.The work is episodical and
digressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in
Sterne’s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the
personality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family
of originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne.This
is not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely
extraneous in event, and nature of interest.The story of the new-found
son, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for
its connection with the Knaut family is very remote.This very story,
interpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page
digression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the
author states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of
his “Lateinische Pneumatologie,”--a genuine Sternian pretense, reminding
one of the “Tristrapaedia.” Whimsicality of manner distinctly
reminiscent of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or
lists of things, as in Chapter III, “Deduktionen, Dissertationen,
Argumentationen a priori und a posteriori,” and so on; plainly adapted
from Sterne’s idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large
red letters occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of
the second volume, which reads as follows: “Dienst-freundliche Anzeige.Jedermann, der an ernsten Gesprächen keinen Gefallen findet, wird
freundschaftlich ersucht alle folgende Blätter, deren Inhalt einem
Gespräche ähnlich sieht, wohlbedächtig zu überschlagen, d.h.von dieser
Anzeige an gerechnet.Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich vom 22.Absatze fahren können,--Cuique Suum.” The following page is blank: this
is closely akin to Sterne’s vagaries.Like Sterne, he makes promise of
chapter-subject.[74] Similarly dependent on Sterne’s example, is the
Fragment in Chapter VIII, Volume III, which breaks off suddenly under
the plea that the rest could not be found.Like Sterne, our author
satirizes detailed description in the excessive account of the
infinitesimals of personal discomfort after a carouse.[75] He makes also
obscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by typographical eccentricities
(I, p. 153).To be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets
is the humor “Man leuterirte, appelirte--irte,--irte,--irte.”

The author’s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are
sketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,--for example, the
beginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the difficulties
of chronicling what has happened during the preceding learned
disquisition.When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse, this is
accompanied by the sighs of the author, a really audible one being put
in a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative style for which
Sterne must be held responsible.Similar to this is the author’s
statement (Chap.II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope, Wieland and
all the rest could not unite the characteristics which had just been
predicated of Selmann.Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the reader
about the way of telling the story, indulging[76] in a mock-serious line
of reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes.Further conversation
with the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in Volume I,
and in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, “Wake up, ladies and
gentlemen,” and continues at some length a conversation with these
fancied personages about the progress of the book.Wezel in a few cases
adopted the worst feature of Sterne’s work and was guilty of bad taste
in precisely Yorick’s style: Tobias’s adventure with the so-called
soldier’s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but
the following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in
the pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding.Sterne’s indecent
suggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the
Original’s aversion to women.A similar censure could be spoken
regarding the adventure in the tavern,[77] where the author hesitates on
the edge of grossness.Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the
accidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the
“Original,” left behind in the hotel, played their rôle in the tale.The treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an
imitation of Yorick’s famous visit in the rural cottage.A parallel to
Walter Shandy’s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles is
found in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance suggested
the sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias’s inability to take
off his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy’s future
life.This is a reminder of Tristram’s obliquity in his manner of
setting up his top.As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the
location of the soul.The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick
and the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to
chastise the thirst for “originals” and overwrought sentimentalism.His
generosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick.As a boy he
would empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life
was one round of Shandean speculation, largely about the relationships
of trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating his
motives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.Wezel’s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the
account of the “Original” (Chap.II), who was cold when
others were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was
not full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host
because it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a
woman.Selmann longs to meet such an original.Selmann also thinks he
has found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with
“Nein,” greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that
this was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage
over Selmann himself.So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias
ride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to
be merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental
friend.Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two
maidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and
write a lament over its demise.In jest, too, it is said that the
Captain made a “sentimental journey through the stables.” The author
converses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,
a convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal.The novelist
makes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed making a
long citation from a learned Chinese book.An expression suggesting
Sterne is the oath taken “bey den Nachthemden aller Musen,”[78] and an
intentional inconsequence of narration, giving occasion to conversation
regarding the author’s control of his work, is the sudden passing over
of the six years which Tobias spent in Selmann’s house.[79]

In connection with Wezel’s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products in
Germany, it is interesting to consider his poem: “Die unvermuthete
Nachbarschaft.Ein Gespräch,” which was the second in a volume of three
poems entitled “Epistel an die deutschen Dichter,” the name of the first
poem, and published in Leipzig in 1775.This slight work is written for
the most part in couplets and covers twenty-three pages.Wezel
represents Doktor Young, the author of the gloomy “Night Thoughts” and
“Der gute Lacher,--Lorenz Sterne” as occupying positions side by side in
his book-case.This proximity gives rise to a conversation between the
two antipodal British authors: Sterne says:

  “Wir brauchen beide vielen Raum,
  Your Reverence viel zum Händeringen,
  Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.”

and later,

 .“Und will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;
  Jüngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die
  Narrheit mich beym Rocke.Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,--Du!Du lachtest dich gesund.”

To Sterne’s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young
naturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life’s
evanescence and joy’s certain blight.But Sterne, though acknowledging
the transitoriness of life’s pleasures, denies Young’s deductions.Yorick’s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young’s picture and
one must admit that it has no justification in Sterne’s writings.On the
contrary, Yorick’s life was one long flight from the grim enemy.The
idea of death cherished by Asmus in his “Freund Hein,” the welcome
guest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne.Death
comes to Yorick in full dress, a youth, a Mercury:

  “Er thuts, er kommt zu mir, ‘Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!’
  So ruft er auf mich zu.‘Dein Haus fängt an zu wanken,
  Die Mauern spalten sich; Gewölb und Balken schwanken,
  Was nuzt dir so ein Haus?.’”

so he takes the wreathèd cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,
embracing him.“Das ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,
  Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schmückst,
  Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht’s in wenig Wochen,
  Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine Hände drückst?Ganz nach Bequemlichkeit!du bist mir zwar willkommen.”

The latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of the
part played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in Sterne’s
works only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a relation sometimes delicate
and clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the indelicate and sensual, is a
foregone conclusion.Undoubtedly some found in the general approbation
which was accorded Sterne’s books a sanction for forcing upon the public
the products of their own diseased imaginations.This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by
Wegener’s “Raritäten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des Küsters von
Rummelsberg.”[80] The first volume is dedicated to “Sebaldus Nothanker,”
and the long document claims for the author unusual distinction, in thus
foregoing the possibility of reward or favor, since he dedicates his
book to a fictitious personage.The idea of the book is to present
“merry observations” for every day in the year.With the end of the
fourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to the
_Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_, the sixth volume includes May 22.The
present writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover whether
the year was rounded out in this way.The author claims to write “neither for surly Catos nor for those fond
of vulgar jests and smutty books,” but for those who will laugh.At the
close of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: “In
order to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne, I made
a decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly; indeed I
have burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of it with
warm English ale, but”--he had the insight and courtesy to add--“it
helped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps in the
footprints of one who can walk nimbly.” The very nature of this author’s
dependence on Sterne excludes here any extended analysis of the
connection.The style is abrupt, full of affected gaiety and raillery,
conversational and journalistic.The stories, observations and
reflections, in prose and verse, represent one and all the ribaldry of
Sterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for example, by the story of
the abbess of Andouillets, but without the charm and grace with which
that tale begins.The author copies Sterne in the tone of his
lucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.In the first
volume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne is the
introduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for January
11.The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes, present a
somewhat Sternesque appearance.These volumes are reviewed in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[81]
with full appreciation of their pernicious influence, and with open
acknowledgment that their success demonstrates a pervision of taste in
the fatherland.The author of the “Litterarische Reise durch
Deutschland”[82] advises his sister, to whom his letters are directed,
to put her handkerchief before her mouth at the very mention of Wegener,
and fears that the very name has befouled his pen.A similar
condemnation is meted out in Wieland’s _Merkur_.[83]

A similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a somewhat
similar collection of stories, “Der Geist der Romane im letzten Viertel
des 18ten Jahrhunderts,” Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which the
author (S. G.claims to follow the spirit of the period and
gives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin whitewash of
teary sentimentalism.The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his writings
in the German literary world of the century succeeding the era of his
great popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task.Such
references in books, letters and periodicals multiply beyond possibility
of systematic study.One might take the works[84] of Friedrich Matthison
as a case in point.He visits the grave of Musäus, even as Tristram
Shandy sought for the resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III,
p.312); as he travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would
have afforded Yorick’s “Empfindsamkeit” the finest material for an
Ash-Wednesday sermon (IV, p. 67).Sterne’s expressions are cited:
“Erdwasserball” for the earth (V, p.57), “Wo keine Pflanze, die da
nichts zu suchen hatte, eine bleibende Stäte fand” (V, p.302); two
farmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as “Nach dem Ideal Yoricks” (VI,
pp.He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets (VI,
64); he narrates (VIII, pp.203-4) an anecdote of Sterne which has just
been printed in the _Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten_ (1769, p.Levade in Lausanne, who bore a striking resemblance to
Sterne (V, p.279), and refers to Yorick in other minor regards (VII,
158; VIII, pp.51, 77, and Briefe II, 76).Yet in spite of this evident
infatuation, Matthison’s account of his own travels cannot be classed as
an imitation of Yorick, but is purely objective, descriptive, without
search for humor or pathos, with no introduction of personalities save
friends and celebrities.Heinse alluded to Sterne frequently in his
letters to Gleim (1770-1771),[85] but after August 23, 1771, Sterne
vanished from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts
until 1802, a fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for
Sterne and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of
Yorick’s personal hold.Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and
duration of his popularity, may not be without interest: Kästner
“Vermischte Schriften,” II, p.134 (Steckenpferd); Lenz “Gesammelte
Werke,” Berlin, 1828, Vol.312; letter from the Duchess Amalie,
August 2, 1779, in “Briefe an und von Merck,” Darmstadt, 1838; letter of
Caroline Herder to Knebel, April 2, 1799, in “K. L.von Knebel’s
Literarischer Nachlass,” Leipzig, 1835, p.324 (Yorick’s “heiliges
Sensorium”); a rather unfavorable but apologetic criticism of Shandy in
the “Hinterlassene Schriften” of Charlotta Sophia Sidonia Seidelinn,
Nürnberg, 1793, p.227; “Schiller’s Briefe,” edited by Fritz Jonas, I,
pp.136, 239; in Hamann’s letters, “Leben und Schriften,” edited by Dr.C. H. Gildermeister, Gotha, 1875, II, p.16,
163; in C. L. Jünger’s “Anlage zu einem Familiengespräch über die
Physiognomik” in _Deutsches Museum_, II, pp.781-809, where the French
barber who proposes to dip Yorick’s wig in the sea is taken as a type of
exaggeration.And a similar reference is found in Wieland’s _Merkur_,
1799, I, p.15: Yorick’s Sensorium is again cited, _Merkur_, 1791, II,
p. 95.Other references in the _Merkur_ are: 1774, III, p.52; 1791, I,
p.19-21; _Deutsches Museum_, IV, pp.66, 462; _Neuer Gelehrter Mercurius_, Altona, 1773, August 19, in review
of Goethe’s “Götz;” _Almanach der deutschen Musen_, 1771, p. 93.And
thus the references scatter themselves down the decades.“Das Wörtlein
Und,” by F. A. Krummacher (Duisberg und Essen, 1811), bore a motto taken
from the Koran, and contained the story of Uncle Toby and the fly with a
personal application, and Yorick’s division of travelers is copied
bodily and applied to critics.Friedrich Hebbel, probably in 1828, gave
his Newfoundland dog the name of Yorick-Sterne-Monarch.[86] Yorick is
familiarly mentioned in Wilhelm Raabe’s “Chronik der Sperlingsgasse”
(1857), and in Ernst von Wolzogen’s “Der Dornenweg,” two characters
address one another in Yorick similes.Indeed, in the summer of 1902,
a Berlin newspaper was publishing “Eine Empfindsame Reise in einem
Automobile.”[87]

Musäus is named as an imitator of Sterne by Koberstein, and Erich
Schmidt implies in his “Richardson, Rousseau und Goethe,” that he
followed Sterne in his “Grandison der Zweite,” which could hardly be
possible, for “Grandison der Zweite” was first published in 1760, and
was probably written during 1759, that is, before Sterne had published
Tristram Shandy.Adolph von Knigge is also mentioned by Koberstein as a
follower of Sterne, and Baker includes Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” and “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” in his list.Their connection with Sterne cannot be designated as other than remote;
the former is a merry vagabond story, reminding one much more of the
tavern and way-faring adventures in Fielding and Smollett, and
suggesting Sterne only in the constant conversation with the reader
about the progress of the book and the mechanism of its construction.One example of the hobby-horse idea in this narration may perhaps be
traced to Sterne.The “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” has even
less connection; it shares only in the increase of interest in personal
accounts of travel.Knigge’s novels, “Peter Claus” and “Der Roman meines
Lebens,” are decidedly not imitations of Sterne; a clue to the character
of the former may be obtained from the fact that it was translated into
English as “The German Gil Blas.” “Der Roman meines Lebens” is a typical
eighteenth century love-story written in letters, with numerous
characters, various intrigues and unexpected adventures; indeed, a part
of the plot, involving the abduction of one of the characters, reminds
one of “Clarissa Harlowe.” Sterne is, however, incidentally mentioned in
both books, is quoted in “Peter Claus” (Chapter VI, Vol.II), and Walter
Shandy’s theory of Christian names is cited in “Der Roman meines
Lebens.”[88] That Knigge had no sympathy with exaggerated sentimentalism
is seen in a passage in his “Umgang mit Menschen.”[89] Knigge admired
and appreciated the real Sterne and speaks in his “Ueber Schriftsteller
und Schriftstellerei”[90] of Yorick’s sharpening observation regarding
the little but yet important traits of character.Moritz August von Thümmel in his famous “Reise in die mittäglichen
Provinzen von Frankreich” adopted Sterne’s general idea of sentimental
journeying, shorn largely of the capriciousness and whimsicality which
marked Sterne’s pilgrimage.He followed Sterne also in driving the
sensuous to the borderland of the sensual.Hippel’s novels, “Lebensläufe nach aufsteigender Linie” and “Kreuz und
Querzüge des Ritters A. bis Z.” were purely Shandean products in which a
humor unmistakably imitated from Sterne struggles rather unsuccessfully
with pedagogical seriousness.Jean Paul was undoubtedly indebted to
Sterne for a part of his literary equipment, and his works afford proof
both of his occupation with Sterne’s writings and its effect upon his
own.A study of Hippel’s “Lebensläufe” in connection with both Sterne
and Jean Paul was suggested but a few years after Hippel’s death by a
reviewer in the _Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_[91] as a
fruitful topic for investigation.A detailed, minute study of von
Thümmel, Hippel and Jean Paul[92] in connection with the English master
is purposed as a continuation of the present essay.Heine’s pictures of
travel, too, have something of Sterne in them.[Footnote 1: _Quellen und Forschungen_, II, p. 27.][Footnote 2: Jacobi remarked, in his preface to the “Winterreise”
    in the edition of 1807, that this section, “Der Taubenschlag” is
    not to be reckoned as bearing the trace of the then condemned
    “Empfindeley,” for many authors, ancient and modern, have taken up
    the cause of animals against man; yet Sterne is probably the
    source of Jacobi’s expression of his feeling.][Footnote 3: XI, 2, pp.[Footnote 4: For reviews of the “Sommerreise” see _Allg.deutsche

    Sentimental Journey which was re-issued in four volumes, Hamburg
    and Bremen, 1769, whereas the edition was practically identical
    with the previous one, and the two added volumes were those of
    Stevenson’s continuation.Longo calls Sterne’s Eliza “Elisha”
    (p.28) and Tristram’s father becomes Sir Walter Shandy (p.37),
    an unwarranted exaltation of the retired merchant.][Footnote 6: Review in the _Jenaische Zeitungen von Gel.Sachen_]

OPPOSITION TO STERNE AND HIS TYPE OF SENTIMENTALISM


Sterne’s influence in Germany lived its own life, and gradually and
imperceptibly died out of letters, as an actuating principle.Yet its
dominion was not achieved without some measure of opposition.The
sweeping condemnation which the soberer critics heaped upon the
incapacities of his imitators has been exemplified in the accounts
already given of Schummel, Bock and others.It would be interesting to
follow a little more closely this current of antagonism.The tone of
protest was largely directed, the edge of satire was chiefly whetted,
against the misunderstanding adaptation of Yorick’s ways of thinking and
writing, and only here and there were voices raised to detract in any
way from the genius of Sterne.He never suffered in Germany such an
eclipse of fame as was his fate in England.He was to the end of the
chapter a recognized prophet, an uplifter and leader.The far-seeing,
clear-minded critics, as Lessing, Goethe and Herder, expressed
themselves quite unequivocally in this regard, and there was later no
withdrawal of former appreciation.Indeed, Goethe’s significant words
already quoted came from the last years of his life, when the new
century had learned to smile almost incredulously at the relation of a
bygone folly.In the very heyday of Sterne’s popularity, 1772, a critic of Wieland’s
“Diogenes” in the _Auserlesene Bibliothek der neuesten deutschen
Litteratur_[1] bewails Wieland’s imitation of Yorick, whom the critic
deems a far inferior writer, “Sterne, whose works will disappear, while
Wieland’s masterpieces are still the pleasure of latest posterity.” This
review of “Diogenes” is, perhaps, rather more an exaggerated compliment
to Wieland than a studied blow at Sterne, and this thought is recognized
by the reviewer in the _Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen_,[2] who
designates the compliment as “dubious” and “insulting,” especially in
view of Wieland’s own personal esteem for Sterne.Yet these words, even
as a relative depreciation of Sterne during the period of his most
universal popularity, are not insignificant.Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
a tutor at Saarbrücken, in 1770, records that one member of a reading
club which he had founded “regarded his taste as insulted because I sent
him “Yorick’s Empfindsame Reise.”[3] But Wagner regarded this instance
as a proof of Saarbrücken ignorance, stupidity and lack of taste; hence
the incident is but a wavering testimony when one seeks to determine the
amount and nature of opposition to Yorick.We find another derogatory fling at Sterne himself and a regret at the
extent of his influence in an anonymous book entitled “Betrachtungen
über die englischen Dichter,”[4] published at the end of the great
Yorick decade.The author compares Sterne most unfavorably with Addison:
“If the humor of the _Spectator_ and _Tatler_ be set off against the
digressive whimsicality of Sterne,” he says, “it is, as if one of the
Graces stood beside a Bacchante.And yet the pampered taste of the
present day takes more pleasure in a Yorick than in an Addison.” But a
reviewer in the _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[5] discounts this
author’s criticisms of men of established fame, such as Shakespeare,
Swift, Yorick, and suggests youth, or brief acquaintance with English
literature, as occasion for his inadequate judgments.Indeed, Yorick
disciples were quick to resent any shadow cast upon his name.Thus the
remark in a letter printed in the _Deutsches Museum_ that Asmus was the
German Yorick “only a better moral character,” called forth a long
article in the same periodical for September, 1779, by L. H. N.,[6]
vigorously defending Sterne as a man and a writer.The greatness of his
human heart and the breadth and depth of his sympathies are given as the
unanswerable proofs of his moral worth.This defense is vehemently
seconded in the same magazine by Joseph von Retzer.The one great opponent of the whole sentimental tendency, whose censure
of Sterne’s disciples involved also a denunciation of the master
himself, was the Göttingen professor, Georg Christopher Lichtenberg.[7]
In his inner nature Lichtenberg had much in common with Sterne and
Sterne’s imitators in Germany, with the whole ecstatic, eccentric
movement of the time.Julian Schmidt[8] says: “So much is sure, at any
rate, that the greatest adversary of the new literature was of one flesh
and blood with it.”[9] But his period of residence in England shortly
after Sterne’s death and his association then and afterwards with
Englishmen of eminence render his attitude toward Sterne in large
measure an English one, and make an idealization either of the man or of
his work impossible for him.The contradiction between the greatness of heart evinced in Sterne’s
novels and the narrow selfishness of the author himself is repeatedly
noted by Lichtenberg.His knowledge of Sterne’s character was derived
from acquaintance with many of Yorick’s intimate friends in London.In
“Beobachtungen über den Menschen,” he says: “I can’t help smiling when
the good souls who read Sterne with tears of rapture in their eyes fancy
that he is mirroring himself in his book.Sterne’s simplicity, his warm
heart, over-flowing with feeling, his soul, sympathizing with everything
good and noble, and all the other expressions, whatever they may be; and
the sigh ‘Alas, poor Yorick,’ which expresses everything at once--have
become proverbial among us Germans. . . .Yorick was a crawling
parasite, a flatterer of the great, an unendurable burr on the clothing
of those upon whom he had determined to sponge!”[10]

In “Timorus” he calls Sterne “ein scandalum Ecclesiae”;[11] he doubts
the reality of Sterne’s nobler emotions and condemns him as a clever
juggler with words, who by artful manipulation of certain devices
aroused in us sympathy, and he snatches away the mask of loving, hearty
sympathy and discloses the grinning mountebank.With keen insight into
Sterne’s mind and method, he lays down a law by which, he says, it is
always possible to discover whether the author of a touching passage has
really been moved himself, or has merely with astute knowledge of the
human heart drawn our tears by a sly choice of touching features.[12]

Akin to this is the following passage in which the author is
unquestionably thinking of Sterne, although he does not mention him:
“A heart ever full of kindly feeling is the greatest gift which Heaven
can bestow; on the other hand, the itching to keep scribbling about it,
and to fancy oneself great in this scribbling is one of the greatest
punishments which can be inflicted upon one who writes.”[13] He exposes
the heartlessness of Sterne’s pretended sympathy: “A three groschen
piece is ever better than a tear,”[14] and “sympathy is a poor kind of
alms-giving,”[15] are obviously thoughts suggested by Yorick’s
sentimentalism.[16]

The folly of the “Lorenzodosen” is several times mentioned with open or
covert ridicule[17] and the imitators of Sterne are repeatedly told the
fruitlessness of their endeavor and the absurdity of their
accomplishment.[18] His “Vorschlag zu einem Orbis Pictus für deutsche
dramatische Schriftsteller, Romanendichter und Schauspieler”[19] is a
satire on the lack of originality among those who boasted of it, and
sought to win attention through pure eccentricities.The Fragments[20] are concerned, as the editors say, with an evil of the
literature in those days, the period of the Sentimentalists and the
“Kraftgenies.” Among the seven fragments may be noted: “Lorenzo
Eschenheimers empfindsame Reise nach Laputa,” a clever satirical sketch
in the manner of Swift, bitterly castigating that of which the English
people claim to be the discoverers (sentimental journeying) and the
Germans think themselves the improvers.In “Bittschrift der
Wahnsinnigen” and “Parakletor” the unwholesome literary tendencies of
the age are further satirized.His brief essay, “Ueber die
Vornamen,”[21] is confessedly suggested by Sterne and the sketch “Dass
du auf dem Blockberg wärst,”[22] with its mention of the green book
entitled “Echte deutsche Flüche und Verwünschungen für alle Stände,” is
manifestly to be connected in its genesis with Sterne’s famous
collection of oaths.[23] Lichtenberg’s comparison of Sterne and Fielding
is familiar and significant.[24] “Aus Lichtenbergs Nachlass: Aufsätze,
Gedichte, Tagebuchblätter, Briefe,” edited by Albert Leitzmann,[25]
contains additional mention of Sterne.The name of Helfreich Peter Sturz may well be coupled with that of
Lichtenberg, as an opponent of the Sterne cult and its German
distortions, for his information and point of view were likewise drawn
direct from English sources.Sturz accompanied King Christian VII of
Denmark on his journey to France and England, which lasted from May 6,
1768, to January 14, 1769[26]; hence his stay in England falls in a time
but a few months after Sterne’s death (March 18, 1768), when the
ungrateful metropolis was yet redolent of the late lion’s wit and humor.Sturz was an accomplished linguist and a complete master of English,
hence found it easy to associate with Englishmen of distinction whom he
was privileged to meet through the favor of his royal patron.He became
acquainted with Garrick, who was one of Sterne’s intimate friends, and
from him Sturz learned much of Yorick, especially that more wholesome
revulsion of feeling against Sterne’s obscenities and looseness of
speech, which set in on English soil as soon as the potent personality
of the author himself had ceased to compel silence and blind opinion.England began to wonder at its own infatuation, and, gaining
perspective, to view the writings of Sterne in a more rational light.Into the first spread of this reaction Sturz was introduced, and the
estimate of Sterne which he carried away with him was undoubtedly
 by it.In his second letter written to the _Deutsches Museum_
and dated August 24, 1768, but strangely not printed till April,
1777,[27] he quotes Garrick with reference to Sterne, a notable word of
personal censure, coming in the Germany of that decade, when Yorick’s
admirers were most vehement in their claims.Garrick called him “a lewd
companion, who was more loose in his intercourse than in his writings
and generally drove all ladies away by his obscenities.”[28] Sturz adds
that all his acquaintances asserted that Sterne’s moral character went
through a process of disintegration in London.In the _Deutsches Museum_ for July, 1776, Sturz printed a poem entitled
“Die Mode,” in which he treats of the slavery of fashion and in several
stanzas deprecates the influence of Yorick.[29]

  “Und so schwingt sich, zum Genie erklärt,
  Strephon kühn auf Yorick’s Steckenpferd.Trabt mäandrisch über Berg und Auen,
  Reist empfindsam durch sein Dorfgebiet,
  Oder singt die Jugend zu erbauen
  Ganz Gefühl dem Gartengott ein Lied.Gott der Gärten, stöhnt die Bürgerin,
  Lächle gütig, Rasen und Schasmin
  Haucht Gerüche!Fliehet Handlungssorgen,
  Dass mein Liebster heute noch in Ruh
  Sein Mark-Einsaz-Lomber spiele--Morgen,
  Schliessen wir die Unglücksbude zu!”

A passage at the end of the appendix to the twelfth Reisebrief is
further indication of his opposition to and his contempt for the frenzy
of German sentimentalism.The poems of Goeckingk contain allusions[30] to Sterne, to be sure
partly indistinctive and insignificant, which, however, tend in the main
to a ridicule of the Yorick cult and place their author ultimately among
the satirical opponents of sentimentalism.In the “Epistel an Goldhagen
in Petershage,” 1771, he writes:

  “Doch geb ich wohl zu überlegen,
  Was für den Weisen besser sey:
  Die Welt wie Yorick mit zu nehmen?Nach Königen, wie Diogen,
  Sich keinen Fuss breit zu bequemen,”--

a query which suggests the hesitant point of view relative to the
advantage of Yorick’s excess of universal sympathy.In “Will auch ’n
Genie werden” the poet steps out more unmistakably as an adversary of
the movement and as a skeptical observer of the exercise of Yorick-like
sympathy.“Doch, ich Patronus, merkt das wohl,
    Geh, im zerrissnen Kittel,
  Hab’ aber alle Taschen voll
    Yorickischer Capittel.Doch lass’ ich, wenn mir’s Kurzweil schafft,
    Die Hülfe fleh’nden Armen
  Durch meinen Schweitzer, Peter Kraft,
    Zerprügeln ohn’ Erbarmen.”

Goeckingk openly satirizes the sentimental cult in the poem “Der
Empfindsame”

  “Herr Mops, der um das dritte Wort
  Empfindsamkeit im Munde führet,
  Und wenn ein Grashalm ihm verdorrt,
  Gleich einen Thränenstrom verlieret--
     .Mit meinem Weibchen thut er schier
  Gleich so bekannt wie ein Franzose;
  All’ Augenblicke bot er ihr
  Toback aus eines Bettlers Dose
  Mit dem, am Zaun in tiefem Schlaf
  Er einen Tausch wie Yorik traf.Der Unempfindsamkeit zum Hohn
  Hielt er auf eine Mück’ im Glase
  Beweglich einen Leichsermon,
  Purrt’ eine Flieg’ ihm an der Nase,
  Macht’ er das Fenster auf, und sprach:
  Zieh Oheim Toby’s Fliege nach!Durch Mops ist warlich meine Magd
  Nicht mehr bey Trost, nicht mehr bey Sinnen
  So sehr hat ihr sein Lob behagt,
  Dass sie empfindsam allen Spinnen
  Zu meinem Hause, frank und frey
  Verstattet ihre Weberey.Er trat mein Hündchen auf das Bein,
  Hilf Himmel!Welch’ ein Lamentiren!Es hätte mögen einen Stein
  Der Strasse zum Erbarmen rühren,
  Auch wedelt’ ihm in einem Nu
  Das Hündgen schon Vergebung zu.Hündchen, du beschämst mich sehr,
  Denn dass mir Mops von meinem Leben
  Drey Stunden stahl, wie schwer, wie schwer,
  Wird’s halten, das ihm zu vergeben?Denn Spinnen werden oben ein
  Wohl gar noch meine Mörder seyn.”

This poem is a rather successful bit of ridicule cast on the
over-sentimental who sought to follow Yorick’s foot-prints.The other allusions to Sterne[31] are concerned with his hobby-horse
idea, for this seems to gain the poet’s approbation and to have no share
in his censure.The dangers of overwrought sentimentality, of heedless surrender to the
emotions and reveling in their exercise,--perils to whose magnitude
Sterne so largely contributed--were grasped by saner minds, and
energetic protest was entered against such degradation of mind and
futile expenditure of feeling.Joachim Heinrich Campe, the pedagogical theorist, published in 1779[32]
a brochure, “Ueber Empfindsamkeit und Empfindelei in pädagogischer
Hinsicht,” in which he deprecates the tendency of “Empfindsamkeit” to
degenerate into “Empfindelei,” and explains at some length the
deleterious effects of an unbridled “Empfindsamkeit” and an unrestrained
outpouring of sympathetic emotions which finds no actual expression, no
relief in deeds.The substance of this warning essay is repeated, often
word for word, but considerably amplified with new material, and
rendered more convincing by increased breadth of outlook and
positiveness of assertion, the fruit of six years of observation and
reflection, as part of a treatise, entitled, “Von der nöthigen Sorge für
die Erhaltung des Gleichgewichts unter den menschlichen Kräften:
Besondere Warnung vor dem Modefehler die Empfindsamkeit zu überspannen.”
It is in the third volume of the “Allgemeine Revision des gesammten
Schul- und Erziehungswesens.”[33] The differentiation between
“Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei” is again and more accessibly repeated
in Campe’s later work, “Ueber die Reinigung und Bereicherung der
deutschen Sprache.”[34] In the second form of this essay (1785) Campe
speaks of the sentimental fever as an epidemic by no means entirely
cured.His analysis of “Empfindsamkeit” is briefly as follows: “Empfindsamkeit
ist die Empfänglichkeit zu Empfindnissen, in denen etwas Sittliches d.i.Freude oder Schmerz über etwas sittlich Gutes oder sittlich Böses, ist;”
yet in common use the term is applied only to a certain high degree of
such susceptibility.This sensitiveness is either in harmony or discord
with the other powers of the body, especially with the reason: if
equilibrium is maintained, this sensitiveness is a fair, worthy,
beneficent capacity (Fähigkeit); if exalted over other forces, it
becomes to the individual and to society the most destructive and
baneful gift which refinement and culture may bestow.Campe proposes to
limit the use of the word “Empfindsamkeit” to the justly proportioned
manifestation of this susceptibility; the irrational, exaggerated
development he would designate “überspannte Empfindsamkeit.”
“Empfindelei,” he says, “ist Empfindsamkeit, die sich auf eine
kleinliche alberne, vernunftlose und lächerliche Weise, also da äussert,
wo sie nicht hingehörte.” Campe goes yet further in his distinctions and
invents the monstrous word, “Empfindsamlichkeit” for the sentimentality
which is superficial, affected, sham (geheuchelte).Campe’s newly coined
word was never accepted, and in spite of his own efforts and those of
others to honor the word “Empfindsamkeit” and restrict it to the
commendable exercise of human sympathy, the opposite process was
victorious and “Empfindsamkeit,” maligned and scorned, came to mean
almost exclusively, unless distinctly modified, both what Campe
designates as “überspannte Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei,” and also
the absurd hypocrisy of the emotions which he seeks to cover with his
new word.Campe’s farther consideration contains a synopsis of method
for distinguishing “Empfindsamkeit” from “Empfindelei:” in the first
place through the manner of their incitement,--the former is natural,
the latter is fantastic, working without sense of the natural properties
of things.In this connection he instances as examples, Yorick’s feeling
of shame after his heartless and wilful treatment of Father Lorenzo,
and, in contrast with this, the shallowness of Sterne’s imitators who
whimpered over the death of a violet, and stretched out their arms and
threw kisses to the moon and stars.In the second place they are
distinguished in the manner of their expression: “Empfindsamkeit” is
“secret, unpretentious, laconic and serious;” the latter attracts
attention, is theatrical, voluble, whining, vain.Thirdly, they are
known by their fruits, in the one case by deeds, in the other by shallow
pretension.In the latter part of his volume, Campe treats the problem
of preventing the perverted form of sensibility by educative endeavor.The word “Empfindsamkeit” was afterwards used sometimes simply as an
equivalent of “Empfindung,” or sensation, without implication of the
manner of sensing: for example one finds in the _Morgenblatt_[35] a poem
named “Empfindsamkeiten am Rheinfalle vom Felsen der Galerie
abgeschrieben.” In the poem various travelers are made to express their
thoughts in view of the waterfall.A poet cries, “Ye gods, what a hell
of waters;” a tradesman, “away with the rock;” a Briton complains of the
“confounded noise,” and so on.It is plain that the word suffered a
generalization of meaning.A poetical expression of Campe’s main message is found in a book called
“Winterzeitvertreib eines königlichen preussischen Offiziers.”[36]
A poem entitled “Das empfindsame Herz” (p.210) has the following lines:

  “Freund, ein empfindsames Herz ist nicht für diese Welt,
  Von Schelmen wird’s verlacht, von Thoren wirds geprellt,
  Doch üb’ im Stillen das, was seine Stimme spricht.Dein Lohn ist dir gewiss, nur hier auf Erden nicht.”

In a similar vein of protest is the letter of G. Hartmann[37] to Denis,
dated Tübingen, February 10, 1773, in which the writer condemns the
affected sentimentalism of Jacobi and others as damaging to morals.“O best teacher,” he pleads with Denis, “continue to represent these
performances as unworthy.”

Möser in his “Patriotische Phantasien”[38] represents himself as
replying to a maid-in-waiting who writes in distress about her young
mistress, because the latter is suffering from “epidemic”
sentimentalism, and is absurdly unreasonable in her practical incapacity
and her surrender to her feelings.Möser’s sound advice is the
substitution of genuine emotion.The whole section is entitled “Für die
Empfindsamen.”

Knigge, in his “Umgang mit Menschen,” plainly has those Germans in mind
who saw in Uncle Toby’s treatment of the fly an incentive to
unreasonable emphasis upon the relations between man and the animal
world, when, in the chapter on the treatment of animals, he protests
against the silly, childish enthusiasm of those who cannot see a hen
killed, but partake of fowl greedily on the table, or who passionately
open the window for a fly.[39] A work was also translated from the
French of Mistelet, which dealt with the problem of “Empfindsamkeit:”
it was entitled “Ueber die Empfindsamkeit in Rücksicht auf das Drama,
die Romane und die Erziehung.”[40] An article condemning exaggerated
sentimentality was published in the _Deutsches Museum_ for February,
1783, under the title “Etwas über deutsche Empfindsamkeit.”

Goethe’s “Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit” is a merry satire on the
sentimental movement, but is not to be connected directly with Sterne,
since Goethe is more particularly concerned with the petty imitators of
his own “Werther.” Baumgartner in his Life of Goethe asserts that
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey was one of the books found inside the
ridiculous doll which the love-sick Prince Oronaro took about with him.This is not a necessary interpretation, for Andrason, when he took up
the first book, exclaimed merely “Empfindsamkeiten,” and, as Strehlke
observes,[41] it is not necessary here to think of a single work,
because the term was probably used in a general way, referring possibly
to a number of then popular imitations.The satires on “Empfindsamkeit” began to grow numerous at the end of the
seventies and the beginning of the eighties, so that the _Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung_, in October, 1785, feels justified in remarking that
such attempts are gradually growing as numerous as the “Empfindsame
Romane” themselves, and wishes, “so may they rot together in a
grave of oblivion.”[42] Anton Reiser, the hero of Karl Philipp
Moritz’sautobiographical novel (Berlin, 1785-90), begins a satire on
affected sentimentalism, which was to bring shafts of ridicule to bear
on the popular sham, and to throw appreciative light on the real
manifestation of genuine feeling.[43] A kindred satire was “Die
Geschichte eines Genies,” Leipzig, 1780, two volumes, in which the
prevailing fashion of digression is incidentally satirized.[44]

The most extensive satire on the sentimental movement, and most vehement
protest against its excesses is the four volume novel, “Der
Empfindsame,”[45] published anonymously in Erfurt, 1781-3, but
acknowledged in the introduction to the fourth volume by its author,
Christian Friedrich Timme.He had already published one novel in which
he exemplified in some measure characteristics of the novelists whom he
later sought to condemn and satirize, that is, this first novel,
“Faramond’s Familiengeschichte,”[46] is digressive and episodical.“Der
Empfindsame” is much too bulky to be really effective as a satire; the
reiteration of satirical jibes, the repetition of satirical motifs
slightly varied, or thinly veiled, recoil upon the force of the work
itself and injure the effect.The maintenance of a single satire through
the thirteen to fourteen hundred pages which four such volumes contain
is a Herculean task which we can associate only with a genius like
Cervantes.Then, too, Timme is an excellent narrator, and his original
purpose is constantly obscured by his own interest and the reader’s
interest in Timme’s own story, in his original creations, in the variety
of his characters.These obtrude upon the original aim of the book and
absorb the action of the story in such a measure that Timme often for
whole chapters and sections seems to forget entirely the convention of
his outsetting.His attack is threefold, the centers of his opposition being “Werther,”
“Siegwart” and Sterne, as represented by their followers and imitators.But the campaign is so simple, and the satirist has been to such trouble
to label with care the direction of his own blows, that it is not
difficult to separate the thrusts intended for each of his foes.Timme’s initial purpose is easily illustrated by reference to his first
chapter, where his point of view is compactly put and the soundness of
his critical judgment and the forcefulness of his satirical bent are
unequivocally demonstrated: This chapter, which, as he says, “may serve
instead of preface and introduction,” is really both, for the narrative
really begins only in the second chapter.“Every nation, every age,”
he says, “has its own doll as a plaything for its children, and
sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit) is ours.” Then with lightness and grace,
coupled with unquestionable critical acumen, he traces briefly the
growth of “Empfindsamkeit” in Germany.“Kaum war der liebenswürdige
Sterne auf sein Steckenpferd gestiegen, und hatte es uns vorgeritten;
so versammelten sich wie gewöhnlich in Teutschland alle Jungen an ihn
herum, hingen sich an ihn, oder schnizten sich sein Steckenpferd in der
Geschwindigkeit nach, oder brachen Stecken vom nächsten Zaun oder rissen
aus einem Reissigbündel den ersten besten Prügel, setzten sich darauf
und ritten mit einer solchen Wut hinter ihm drein, dass sie einen
Luftwirbel veranlassten, der alles, was ihm zu nahe kam, wie ein
reissender Strom mit sich fortris, wär es nur unter den Jungen
geblieben, so hätte es noch sein mögen; aber unglücklicherweise fanden
auch Männer Geschmack an dem artigen Spielchen, sprangen vom ihrem Weg
ab und ritten mit Stok und Degen und Amtsperüken unter den Knaben
einher.Freilich erreichte keiner seinen Meister, den sie sehr bald aus
dem Gesicht verloren, und nun die possirlichsten Sprünge von der Welt
machen und doch bildet sich jeder der Affen ein, er reite so schön wie
der Yorick.”[47]

This lively description of Sterne’s part in this uprising is, perhaps,
the best brief characterization of the phenomenon and is all the more
significant as coming from the pen of a contemporary, and written only
about a decade after the inception of the sentimental movement as
influenced and furthered by the translation of the Sentimental Journey.It represents a remarkable critical insight into contemporaneous
literary movements, the rarest of all critical gifts, but it has been
overlooked by investigators who have sought and borrowed brief words to
characterize the epoch.[48]

The contribution of “Werther” and “Siegwart” to the sentimental frenzy
are even as succinctly and graphically designated; the latter book,
published in 1776, is held responsible for a recrudescence of the
phenomenon, because it gave a new direction, a new tone to the faltering
outbursts of Sterne’s followers and indicated a more comprehensible and
hence more efficient, outlet for their sentimentalism.Now again, “every
nook resounded with the whining sentimentality, with sighs, kisses,
forget-me-nots, moonshine, tears and ecstasies;” those hearts excited by
Yorick’s gospel, gropingly endeavoring to find an outlet for their own
emotions which, in their opinion were characteristic of their arouser
and stimulator, found through “Siegwart” a solution of their problem,
a relief for their emotional excess.Timme insists that his attack is only on Yorick’s mistaken followers and
not on Sterne himself.He contrasts the man and his imitators at the
outset sharply by comments on a quotation from the novel, “Fragmente zur
Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit”[49] as typifying the outcry of these petty
imitators against the heartlessness of their misunderstanding
critics,--“Sanfter, dultender Yorick,” he cries, “das war nicht deine
Sprache!Du priesest dich nicht mit einer pharisäischen
Selbstgenügsamkeit und schimpftest nicht auf die, die dir nicht ähnlich
waren, ‘Doch!sprachst Du am Grabe Lorenzos, doch ich bin so weichherzig
wie ein Weib, aber ich bitte die Welt nicht zu lachen, sondern mich zu
bedauern!’ Ruhe deinem Staube, sanfter, liebevoller Dulter!und nur
einen Funken deines Geistes deinen Affen.”[50] He writes not for the
“gentle, tender souls on whom the spirit of Yorick rests,”[51] for those
whose feelings are easily aroused and who make quick emotional return,
who love and do the good, the beautiful, the noble; but for those who
“bei dem wonnigen Wehen und Anhauchen der Gottheithaltenden Natur, in
huldigem Liebessinn und himmelsüssem Frohsein dahin schmelzt.die ihr
vom Sang der Liebe, von Mondschein und Tränen euch nährt,” etc.,
etc.[52] In these few words he discriminates between the man and his
influence, and outlines his intentions to satirize and chastise the
insidious disease which had fastened itself upon the literature of the
time.This passage, with its implied sincerity of appreciation for the
real Yorick, is typical of Timme’s attitude throughout the book, and his
concern lest he should appear at any time to draw the English novelist
into his condemnation leads him to reiterate this statement of purpose
and to insist upon the contrast.Brükmann, a young theological student, for a time an intimate of the
Kurt home, is evidently intended to represent the soberer, well-balanced
thought of the time in opposition to the feverish sentimental frenzy of
the Kurt household.He makes an exception of Yorick in his condemnation
of the literary favorites, the popular novelists of that day, but he
deplores the effects of misunderstood imitation of Yorick’s work, and
argues his case with vehemence against this sentimental group.[53]
Brükmann differentiates too the different kinds of sentimentalism and
their effects in much the same fashion as Campe in his treatise
published two years before.[54] In all this Brükmann may be regarded as
the mouth-piece of the author.The clever daughter of the gentleman who
entertains Pank at his home reads a satirical poem on the then popular
literature, but expressly disclaims any attack on Yorick or “Siegwart,”
and asserts that her bitterness is intended for their imitators.Lotte,
Pank’s sensible and unsentimental, long-suffering fiancée, makes further
comment on the “apes” of Yorick, “Werther,” and “Siegwart.”

The unfolding of the story is at the beginning closely suggestive of
Tristram Shandy and is evidently intended to follow the Sterne novel in
a measure as a model.As has already been suggested, Timme’s own
narrative powers balk the continuity of the satire, but aid the interest
and the movement of the story.The movement later is, in large measure,
simple and direct.The hero is first introduced at his christening, and
the discussion of fitting names in the imposing family council is taken
from Walter Shandy’s hobby.The narrative here, in Sterne fashion, is
interrupted by a Shandean digression[55] concerning the influence of
clergymen’s collars and neck-bands upon the thoughts and minds of their
audiences.Such questions of chance influence of trifles upon the
greater events of life is a constant theme of speculation among the
pragmatics; no petty detail is overlooked in the possibility of its
portentous consequences.Walter Shandy’s hyperbolic philosophy turned
about such a focus, the exaltation of insignificant trifles into
mainsprings of action.In Shandy fashion the story doubles on itself after the introduction and
gives minute details of young Kurt’s family and the circumstances prior
to his birth.The later discussion[56] in the family council concerning
the necessary qualities in the tutor to be hired for the young Kurt is
distinctly a borrowing from Shandy.[57] Timme imitates Sterne’s method
of ridiculing pedantry; the requirements listed by the Diaconus and the
professor are touches of Walter Shandy’s misapplied, warped, and
undigested wisdom.In the nineteenth chapter of the third volume[58] we
find a Sterne passage associating itself with Shandy rather more than
the Sentimental Journey.It is a playful thrust at a score of places in
Shandy in which the author converses with the reader about the progress
of the book, and allows the mechanism of book-printing and the vagaries
of publishers to obtrude themselves upon the relation between writer and
reader.As a reminiscence of similar promises frequent in Shandy, the
author promises in the first chapter of the fourth volume to write a
book with an eccentric title dealing with a list of absurdities.[59]

But by far the greater proportion of the allusions to Sterne associate
themselves with the Sentimental Journey.A former acquaintance of Frau
Kurt, whose favorite reading was Shandy, Wieland’s “Sympatien” and the
Sentimental Journey, serves to satirize the influence of Yorick’s ass
episode; this gentleman wept at the sight of an ox at work, and never
ate meat lest he might incur the guilt of the murder of these sighing
creatures.[60]

The most constantly recurring form of satire is that of contradiction
between the sentimental expression of elevated, universal sympathy and
broader humanity and the failure to seize an immediately presented
opportunity to embody desire in deed.Thus Frau Kurt,[61] buried in
“Siegwart,” refuses persistently to be disturbed by those in immediate
need of a succoring hand.Pankraz and his mother while on a drive
discover an old man weeping inconsolably over the death of his dog.[62]
The scene of the dead ass at Nampont occurs at once to Madame Kurt and
she compares the sentimental content of these two experiences in
deprivation, finding the palm of sympathy due to the melancholy
dog-bewailer before her, thereby exalting the sentimental privilege of
her own experience as a witness.Quoting Yorick, she cries: “Shame on
the world!If men only loved one another as this man loves his dog!”[63]
At this very moment the reality of her sympathy is put to the test by
the approach of a wretched woman bearing a wretched child, begging for
assistance, but Frau Kurt, steeped in the delight of her sympathetic
emotion, repulses her rudely.Pankraz, on going home, takes his Yorick
and reads again the chapter containing the dead-ass episode; he spends
much time in determining which event was the more affecting, and tears
flow at the thought of both animals.In the midst of his vehement curses
on “unempfindsame Menschen,” “a curse upon you, you hard-hearted
monsters, who treat God’s creatures unkindly,” etc., he rebukes the
gentle advances of his pet cat Riepel, rebuffs her for disturbing his
“Wonnegefühl,” in such a heartless and cruel way that, through an
accident in his rapt delight at human sympathy, the ultimate result is
the poor creature’s death by his own fault.In the second volume[64] Timme repeats this method of satire, varying
conditions only, yet forcing the matter forward, ultimately, into the
grotesque comic, but again taking his cue from Yorick’s narrative about
the ass at Nampont, acknowledging specifically his linking of the
adventure of Madame Kurt to the episode in the Sentimental Journey.Frau
Kurt’s ardent sympathy is aroused for a goat drawing a wagon, and driven
by a peasant.She endeavors to interpret the sighs of the beast and
finally insists upon the release of the animal, which she asserts is
calling to her for aid.The poor goat’s parting bleat after its
departing owner is construed as a curse on the latter’s hardheartedness.During the whole scene the
neighboring village is in flames, houses are consumed and poor people
rendered homeless, but Frau Kurt expresses no concern, even regarding
the catastrophe as a merited affliction, because of the villagers’ lack
of sympathy with their domestic animals.The same means of satire is
again employed in the twelfth chapter of the same volume.[65] Pankraz,
overcome with pain because Lotte, his betrothed, fails to unite in his
sentimental enthusiasm and persists in common-sense, tries to bury his
grief in a wild ride through night and storm.His horse tramples
ruthlessly on a poor old man in the road; the latter cries for help, but
Pank, buried in contemplation of Lotte’s lack of sensibility, turns a
deaf ear to the appeal.In the seventeenth chapter of the third volume, a sentimental journey is
proposed, and most of the fourth volume is an account of this
undertaking and the events arising from its complications.Pankraz’s
adventures are largely repetitions of former motifs, and illustrate the
fate indissolubly linked with an imitation of Sterne’s related converse
with the fair sex.[66]

The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries.Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes.Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.[67]

Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of suggestions
aroused through fancied parallels between his own circumstances and
those related of Yorick.He finds a sorrowing woman[68] sitting, like
Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar tree.Pankraz insists upon carrying
out this striking analogy farther, which the woman, though she betrays
no knowledge of the Sentimental Journey, is not loath to accede to, as
it coincides with her own nefarious purposes.Timme in the following
scene strikes a blow at the abjectly sensual involved in much of the
then sentimental, unrecognized and unrealized.Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.[69] He buys the poor
creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the goat.The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee.The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs.Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it.The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,--a point already enforced in the conduct of Frau Kurt’s
goat.In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to “Eliza”
is brought into the narrative.Pankraz writes a letter wherein he
declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs.Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy[70] of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere.The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”

The elaborate division of moral preachers[71] into classes may be
further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered.And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters.But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked.On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened.And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time.Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies.Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion.Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries.The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and adaptation
of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and bespeaks
admiration and commendation.Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but it
never received the critical examination its merits deserved.Wieland’s
_Teutscher Merkur_ and the _Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften_
ignore it completely.The _Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen_ announces the
book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the book itself is not reviewed
in its columns.The _Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen_ accords
it a colorless and unappreciative review in which Timme is reproached
for lack of order in his work (a censure more applicable to the first
volume), and further for his treatment of German authors then
popular.[72] The latter statement stamps the review as unsympathetic
with Timme’s satirical purpose.In the _Erfurtische gelehrte
Zeitung_,[73] in the very house of its own publication, the novel is
treated in a long review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of
comprehension and indignant denunciation.The reviewer fears that the
author is a “Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the
public will find no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting
(Schnaken).He is incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were
then degenerate as compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s
attack on the popular writers is emphatically resented.“Aber nun kömmt
das Schlimme erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten
Schenies, aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden,
dem Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w.zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”

In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed.Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself.It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.The _Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek_[74] alone seems to grasp the full
significance of the satire.“We acknowledge gladly,” says the reviewer,
“that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the rise,
development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence of
this moral pestilence;.that the author has penetrated deep into
the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for an
engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”

The second and third volumes are reviewed[75] with a brief word of
continued approbation.A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes.The book is more
earnest in its conception.Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel.He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
_dénouement_.The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination.This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a sad, a gentle, a vehement, a dallying,
a serious, a melancholy, sentimentality, the last being the most poetic,
the most perilous.The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing.In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality.This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure.She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.The story begins in letters,--a method of story-telling which was the
legacy of Richardson’s popularity--and this device is again employed in
the second volume (Part VII).Wilhelmine Arend is one of those whom
sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.We read of
her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a feather, that
she turned white and trembled when Dr.Braun hacked worms to pieces in
conducting a biological experiment.On one occasion she refused to drive
home, as this would take the horses out in the noonday sun and disturb
their noonday meal,--an exorbitant sympathy with brute creation which
owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.It is not necessary here to relate
the whole story.Wilhelmine’s excessive sentimentality estranges her
from her husband, a weak brutish man, who has no comprehension of her
feelings.He finds a refuge in the debasing affections of a French
opera-singer, Pouilly, and gradually sinks to the very lowest level of
degradation.This all is accomplished by the interposition and active
concern of friends, by efforts at reunion managed by benevolent
intriguers and kindly advisers.Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its sane
characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the observations
upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book are
trenchant, and often markedly clever.Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing.The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode.The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out.Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made.Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition.Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly because his leading character is not convincing, but
largely because his satirical exaggeration, and distortion of
characteristics, which by a process of selection renders satire
efficient, fails to make the exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but
renders her pitiful.At the same time this satirical warping impairs the
value of the book as a serious presentation of a prevailing malady.A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”[76] In this book we have a character with a
heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is attributed
“an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist a single
impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the present
impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of Graf.Z.,
the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife, their
reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness of
heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of the
same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”

Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary review,
“Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein blaues
Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777, 8vo).The book purports to be the
posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted with Yorick’s
German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick himself.The
_Almanach der deutschen Musen_ (1778, pp.99-100) finds that the author
misjudges Yorick.The book is written in part if not entirely in verse.In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s _Merkur_ writes, begging this
authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey, M . . .and “die Beyträge zur Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und
Verstandes,” and thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”

In this way it is seen how from various sources and in various ways
protest was made against the real or distorted message of Laurence
Sterne.[Footnote 2: 1772, July 7.][Footnote 3: See Erich Schmidt’s “Heinrich Leopold Wagner,
    Goethe’s Jugendgenosse,” 2d edition, Jena, 1879, p. 82.][Footnote 4: Berlin, 1779, pp.[Footnote 5: XLIV, 1, p.[Footnote 6: Probably Ludwig Heinrich von Nicolay, the poet and

    that the underlying thought of Musäus in his “Physiognomische
    Reisen” would, if handled by Lichtenberg, have made the most
    fruitful stuff for a humorous novel in Sterne’s style.][Footnote 12: II, 11-12: “Im ersten Fall wird er nie, nach dem die
    Stelle vorüber ist, seinen Sieg plötzlich aufgeben.So wie bei ihm
    sich die Leidenschaft kühlt, kühlt sie sich auch bei uns und er
    bringt uns ab, ohne dass wir es wissen.Hingegen im letztern Fall
    nimmt er sich selten die Mühe, sich seines Sieges zu bedienen,
    sondern wirft den Leser oft mehr zur Bewunderung seiner Kunst, als
    seines Herzens in eine andere Art von Verfassung hinein, die ihn
    selbst nichts kostet als Witz, den Leser fast um alles bringt, was
    er vorher gewonnen hatte.”]

  durch Frankreich und Italien, übersetzt von A. Lewald.Saart is coming soon, and the boys may take a dram, too.A sweet young Miss
    And a glass of Anis--
    I shall surely come in for this.[Hides it in his red handkerchief.]No--now--you
know what I want to say.I don't need to ask if----[Pours the dram.]No--no--go ahead--just a little more.No matter, I shan't spill a drop.Lips to the glass, sucks up the liquor.]When you have my years!--Hardly slept a wink last night--and
no nap this afternoon.That's what he would like to do----

MARIETJE.Now, if I had my choice----

KNEIR.The Matron at the Home has to
help dress him.the Englishman says: "The old man misses the kisses, and
the young man kisses the misses."Yes, that means, "Woman, take your cat inside, its beginning to
rain."Good day, Daantje; day, Cobus; and day, Marietje; and day,
Jo.No, I'm not going to do it--my door is ajar--and the cat may
tip over the oil stove.No, just give it to me this way--so--so--many
happy returns, and may your boys--Where are the boys?Geert has gone to say good bye, and Barend has gone with Mees
to take the mattresses and chests in the yawl.They'll soon be here,
for they must be on board by three o'clock.There was a lot of everything and more too.The bride was
full,--three glasses "roses without thorns," two of "perfect love,"
and surely four glasses of "love in a mist."Where she stowed
it all I don't know.Give me the old fashioned dram, brandy and syrup--eh!He's come here to sleep--you look as if you hadn't been to
bed at all.In his bed--he, he, he!No, I say, don't take out your chew.No, you'd never guess how I got it.Less than ten
minutes ago I met Bos the ship-owner, and he gave me--he gave me a
little white roll--of--of tissue paper with tobacco inside.Yes, catch me smoking a thing like that in--in paper--that's a
chew with a shirt on.And you're a crosspatch without a shirt.No, I'm not going to
sit down.Day, Simon--shove in, room for you here.Give him just one, for a parting cup.Is there much work in the dry dock, Simon?No, if I sit down I stay too long.Well then, half a
glass--no--no cookies.It looks like all hands on deck
here!Uh--ja----

MARIETJE.The deuce, but you're touchy!We've got a quarter of an hour,
boys!Fallen asleep with a ginger nut in his hand.Sick in the night--afraid to call the matron; walked about
in his bare feet; got chilled.It's easy for you to talk, but if you disturb her, she keeps
you in for two weeks.Poor devils--I don't want to live to be so old.We're not even married
yet--and he's a widower already!I don't need a belaying pin----[Sings.]"Sailing, sailing, don't wait to be called;
    Starboard watch, spring from your bunk;
    Let the man at the wheel go to his rest;
    The rain is good and the wind is down.It's sailing, it's sailing,
    It's sailing for the starboard watch."[The others join him in beating time on the table with their fists.]You'll do the same when you're as old
as I am.You might have said that a while back when you
looked like a wet dish rag.Now we can make up a song about you, pasting paper
bags--just as Domela--he he he!My nevvy Geert pastes paper bags,
    Hi-ha, ho!My nevvy Geert----

SAART.DAAN., JO., MARIETJE AND COBUS.I'm blest if I see----

MARIETJE.They must--they must--not--not--that's fast.You must--you must----

MARIETJE.The ribs--and--and----[Firmly.]That's fast!----

GEERT, JO., COBUS, DAANTJE AND SAART.You went together to take the mattresses and chests----

MEES.Can't repeat a word of it--afraid--afraid--always afraid----[To
Marietje, who has induced her father to rise.]Now--now--Kneir, many happy returns.Perhaps he's saying good-bye to his girl.[Sound of Jelle's
fiddle outside.]Do sit still--one would think you'd eaten horse flesh.Poor old fellow, gets blinder every day.Yes, play that tune of--of--what do you call 'em?You know, Jelle, the one--that one that goes [Sings.]"I know
a song that charms the heart."Give us----[Jelle begins the Marseillaise.]"Alloose--vodela--bedeije--deboe--debie--de boolebie."That's the French of a dead codfish!I've laid in a French port--and say, it
was first rate!When I said pain they gave me bread--and when I said
"open the port," they opened the door.Let's use the
Dutch words we've got for it."Arise men, brothers, all united!Your wrongs, your sorrows be avenged"--

BOS.[Who has stood at the open window listening during the singing,
yells angrily.]It's high time you were all on board!Oh--Oh--how he scared me--he!I couldn't think where the voice came from.How stupid of you to roar like a weaned pig, when you know
Meneer Bos lives only two doors away.You'll never eat a sack of salt with him.What business had you to sing those low songs, anyway?If he
hadn't taken me by surprise!An old frog like that before your eyes
of a sudden.Ach, please don't, Geert.I'm afraid that if Meneer
Bos----[Motions to Jelle to stop.]This one is afraid to sail, this one of the Matron of the Old
Men's Home, this one of a little ship owner!Forbids me in my own
house!Commands me as though I were a servant!Fun is fun, but if you were a ship owner, you wouldn't want
your sailors singing like socialists either.When he knows how dependent I am, too.Is it an
honor to do his cleaning!For mopping the office floor and
licking his muddy boots you get fifty cents twice a week and the
scraps off their plates.Oh, what a row I'll get Saturday!If you hadn't all your
life allowed this braggart who began with nothing to walk over you
and treat you as a slave, while father and my brothers lost their
lives on the sea making money for him, you'd give him a scolding and
damn his hide for his insolence in opening his jaw.Next
year Mother will give you pennies to play."Arise men, brothers,
all unite-e-ed"----

KNEIR.Stop tormenting your old mother on her birthday.[Jelle
holds out his hand.]Here, you can't stand on one leg.I'll wait a few minutes for Barend.The
boys will come by here any way.Don't you catch on that those two are--A good voyage.Have I staid so long--and my door ajar![Brusquely coming through the kitchen door.]Skipper Hengst has my orders.[Cobus
and Daantje slink away, stopping outside to listen at the window.]Yes, Meneer, he is all ready to go.That other boy of yours that Hengst engaged--refuses to go.[They bow in a
scared way and hastily go on.]This looks like a dive--drunkenness
and rioting.Mother's birthday or not, we do as we please here.You change your tone or----

GEERT.Ach--dear Geert--Don't take offense, Meneer--he's
quick tempered, and in anger one says----

BOS.Dirt is all the thanks you get for
being good to you people.If you're not on board in
ten minutes, I'll send the police for you!You send--what do you take me for, any way!What I take him for--he asks that--dares to ask----[To
Kneirtje.]You'll come to me again recommending a trouble-maker kicked
out by the Navy.You
pay wages and I do the work.You're just a big overgrown boy, that's all!If it wasn't for Mother--I'd----

KNEIR.Kneir, Kneir,
consider well what you do--I gave you an advance in good faith----

KNEIR.Ach, yes, Meneer--Ach, yes----

BOS.Yes, Meneer--you and the priest----

BOS.One of your sons refuses to go, the other--you'll come to a bad
end, my little friend.On board I'm a sailor--I'm the skipper
here.A ship owner layin' down the law; don't do
this and don't do that!Boring his nose through the window when you
don't sing to suit him.For my part, sing, but a sensible sailor expecting to marry ought
to appreciate it when his employer is looking out for his good.You
young fellows have no respect for grey hairs.for grey hairs that
have become grey in want and misery----

BOS.Your mother's seen me, as child,
standing before the bait trays.I also have stood in an East wind
that froze your ears, biting off bait heads----

GEERT.We don't care for your stories, Meneer.You have
become a rich man, and a tyrant.Good!--you are perhaps no worse than
the rest, but don't interfere with me in my own house.We may all become different, and perhaps my son may
live to see the day when he will come, as I did, twelve years ago,
crying to the office, to ask if there's any news of his father and
his two brothers!and not find their employer sitting by his warm fire
and his strong box, drinking grog.He may not be damned for coming so
often to ask the same thing, nor be turned from the door with snubs
and the message, "When there's anything to tell you'll hear of it."You lie--I never did anything of the sort.I won't soil any more words over it.My father's hair was grey, my mother's hair is grey, Jelle,
the poor devil who can't find a place in the Old Men's Home because
on one occasion in his life he was light-fingered--Jelle has also
grey hairs.If you hear him or crooked
Jacob, it's the same cuckoo song.But
now I'll give another word of advice, my friend, before you go under
sail.You have an old mother, you expect to marry, good; you've been
in prison six months--I won't talk of that; you have barked out your
insolence to me in your own house, but if you attempt any of this
talk on board the Hope you'll find out there is a muster roll.When you've become older--and wiser--you'll be ashamed of your
insolence--"the ship owner by his warm stove, and his grog"----

GEERT.And his strong box----

BOS.And his cares, you haven't the wits to understand!Who hauls the fish out of the sea?Who
risks his life every hour of the day?Who doesn't take off his
clothes in five or six weeks?Who walks with hands covered with salt
sores,--without water to wash face or hands?Who sleep like beasts
two in a bunk?Who leave wives and mothers behind to beg alms?Twelve
head of us are presently going to sea--we get twenty-five per cent
of the catch, you seventy-five.We do the work, you sit safely at
home.Your ship is insured, and we--we can go to the bottom in case
of accident--we are not worth insuring----

KNEIR.You should be a clown in a
circus!Twenty-seven per cent isn't enough for him----

GEERT.I'll never eat salted codfish from your generosity!Our whole
share is in "profit and loss."When luck is with us we each make eight
guilders a week, one guilder a day when we're lucky.One guilder a
day at sea, to prepare salt fish, cod with livers for the people in
the cities--hahaha!--a guilder a day--when you're lucky and don't go
to the bottom.You fellows know what you're about when you engage us
on shares.[Old and young heads of fishermen appear at the window.]And say to the skipper--no, never mind--I'll
be there myself----[A pause.]Now I'll
take two minutes more, blockhead, to rub under your nose something
I tried three times to say, but you gave me no chance to get in a
word.When you lie in your bunk tonight--as a beast, of course!--try
and think of my risks, by a poor catch--lost nets and cordage--by
damages and lightning in the mast, by running aground, and God knows
what else.The Jacoba's just had her hatches torn off, the Queen
Wilhelmina half her bulwarks washed away.You don't count that,
for you don't have to pay for it!Three months ago the Expectation
collided with a steamer.Without a thought of the catch or the nets,
the men sprang overboard, leaving the ship to drift!You laugh, boy, because you don't realize what cares I
have.On the Mathilde last week the men smuggled gin and tobacco in
their mattresses to sell to the English.If you were talking about conditions in Middelharnis or Pernis,
you'd have reason for it.My men don't pay the harbor costs, don't
pay for bait, towing, provisions, barrels, salt.I don't expect you
to pay the loss of the cordage, if a gaff or a boom breaks.I go into
my own pocket for it.I gave your mother an advance, your brother
Barend deserts.No, Meneer, I can't believe that.Hengst telephoned me from the harbor, else I wouldn't have
been here to be insulted by your oldest son, who's disturbing the
whole neighborhood roaring his scandalous songs!If you're not on board on time I'll apply "Article
Sixteen" and fine you twenty-five guilders.As for you, my wife doesn't need you at
present, you're all a bad lot here.Ach, Meneer, it isn't my fault!After this voyage you can look for
another employer, who enjoys throwing pearls before swine better than
I do!Don't hang your head so soon, Aunt!Geert was in the right----

KNEIR.Great God, if he should desert--if he
deserts--he also goes to prison--two sons who----

GEERT.Aren't you going to wish me a good voyage--or don't you think
that necessary?Yes, I'm coming----

JO.I'm sorry for her, the poor thing.You gave him a
talking to, didn't you?[Picks a geranium from a flower
pot.]And you will
think of me every night, will you?Truus saw him hanging around the house.If that coward refuses to go,
your sitting at home won't help a damn.Don't forget your chewing tobacco
and your cigars----

GEERT.If you're too late--I'll never look at you again!I'll shout the whole village together if you don't
immediately run and follow Geert and Jo.If you can keep Geert from going--call him back!Have you gone crazy with fear, you big coward?The Good Hope is no good, no good--her ribs are
rotten--the planking is rotten!----

KNEIR.Don't stand there telling stories to excuse yourself.Simon, the ship carpenter--that drunken sot who can't speak
two words.First you sign, then you
run away!Me--you may beat me to death!--but I won't go on an unseaworthy
ship!Hasn't the ship been lying in the
dry docks?There was no caulking her any more--Simon----

KNEIR.March, take your package of
chewing tobacco.I'm not going--I'm not going.You don't know--you
didn't see it!The last voyage she had a foot of water in her hold!A ship that has just returned from her fourth
voyage to the herring catch and that has brought fourteen loads!Has
it suddenly become unseaworthy, because you, you miserable coward,
are going along?I looked in the hold--the barrels were
floating.You can see death that is hiding down there.Bilge water, as in every ship!Tell that
to your grandmother, not to an old sailor's wife.Skipper Hengst
is a child, eh!Isn't Hengst going and Mees and Gerrit and Jacob
and Nellis--your own brother and Truus' little Peter?Do you claim
to know more than old seamen?I'm not going to
stand it to see you taken aboard by the police----

BAR.Oh, Mother dear, Mother dear, don't make me go!Oh, God; how you have punished me in my children--my children
are driving me to beggary.I've taken an advance--Bos has refused to
give me any more cleaning to do--and--and----[Firmly.]Well, then,
let them come for you--you'd better be taken than run away.Oh, oh,
that this should happen in my family----

BAR.You'll not get out----

BAR.I don't know what I'm doing--I might hurt----

KNEIR.Now he is brave, against his sixty year old mother----Raise
your hand if you dare![Falls on a chair shaking his head between his hands.]Oh, oh,
oh--If they take me aboard, you'll never see me again--you'll never
see Geert again----

KNEIR.It's tempting God to rave this
way with fear----[Friendlier tone.]Come, a man of your age must
not cry like a child--come!I wanted to surprise you with Father's
earrings--come!Mother dear--I don't dare--I don't dare--I shall drown--hide
me--hide me----

KNEIR.If I believed a word of your talk,
would I let Geert go?There's a
package of tobacco, and one of cigars.Now sit still, and I'll put
in your earrings--look--[Talking as to a child.]--real silver--ships
on them with sails--sit still, now--there's one--there's two--walk
to the looking glass----

BAR.No--no!----

KNEIR.Come now, you're making me weak for nothing--please,
dear boy--I do love you and your brother--you're all I have on
earth.Every night I will pray to the good God to bring you
home safely.You must get used to it, then you will become a brave
seaman--and--and----[Cries.][Holds the
mirror before him.]Look at your earrings--what?----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Coming in through door at left, good-natured
manner.]Skipper Hengst has requested the Police----If you please,
my little man, we have no time to lose.The ship--is rotten----

2ND POLICEMAN.Then you should not have
mustered in.[Taps him kindly
on the shoulder.][Clings desperately to the
bedstead and door jamb.]I shall
drown in the dirty, stinking sea!Oh God, Oh
God, Oh God![Crawls up against the wall, beside himself with terror.]The boy is afraid----

1ST POLICEMAN.[Sobbing as she seizes Barend's hands.]Come now, boy--come
now--God will not forsake you----

BAR.[Moaning as he loosens his hold, sobs despairingly.]You'll
never see me again, never again----

1ST POLICEMAN.[They exeunt, dragging Barend.]Oh, oh----

TRUUS.What was the matter,
Kneir?Barend had to be taken by the police.Oh, and now
I'm ashamed to go walk through the village, to tell them good bye--the
disgrace--the disgrace----

                                CURTAIN.A lighted lamp--the illuminated
chimney gives a red glow.Kneirtje lying on bed, dressed, Jo reading
to her from prayerbook.]in piteousness,
      To your poor children of the sea,
    Reach down your arms in their distress;
      With God their intercessor be.Unto the Heart Divine your prayer
    Will make an end to all their care."[A
knock--she tiptoes to cook-shed door, puts her finger to her lips in
warning to Clementine and Kaps, who enter.]She's not herself yet,
feverish and coughing.I've brought her a plate of soup, and a half dozen
eggs.I've brought you some veal soup, Kneir.I'd like to see you carry a full pan with the sand blowing in
your eyes.There's five--and--[Looking at his hand, which drips with egg
yolk.][Bringing out his handkerchief and purse covered with egg.]He calls that putting them away
carefully.My purse, my handkerchief, my cork screw.I don't know why Father keeps that bookkeeper, deaf,
and cross.They haven't
forgotten the row with your sons yet.Mouth shut, or I'll get a
scolding.May Jo go to the beach with me to look at the sea?Go on the beach in such a
storm!I got a tap aft that struck the spot.The tree beside the pig stye was broken in two like a pipe stem.Did it come down on the pig stye?Uncle Cobus,
how do you come to be out, after eight o'clock, in this beastly
weather?The beans and pork gravy he ate----

CLEMENTINE.Beans and pork gravy for a sick old man?The matron broils him a chicken or a beefsteak--Eh?She's
even cross because she's got to beat an egg for his breakfast.This
afternoon he was delirious, talking of setting out the nets, and paying
out the buoy line.I sez to the matron, "His time's come.""Look out or
yours'll come," sez she.I sez, "The doctor should be sent for.""Mind
your own business," sez she, "am I the Matron or are you?"Then I
sez, "You're the matron."Just now, she sez,
"You'd better go for the doctor."As if it couldn't a been done this
afternoon.I go to the doctor and the doctor's out of town.Now I've
been to Simon to take me to town in his dog car.If drunken Simon drives, you're likely to roll off
the <DW18>.Must the doctor ride in the dog
car?Go on, now, tell us the rest.What I want to say is, that it's a blessing for Daantje he's
out of his head, 'fraid as he's always been of death.That's all in the way you look at it.If my time
should come tomorrow, then, I think, we must all!The waters of the sea
will not wash away that fact.On the fifth
day He created the Sea, great whales and the moving creatures that
abound therein, and said: "Be fruitful," and He blessed them.That
was evening and that was morning, that was the fifth day.And on the
sixth day He created man and said also: "Be fruitful," and blessed
them.That was again evening and again morning, that was the sixth
day.When I was on the herring
catch, or on the salting voyage, there were times when I didn't dare
use the cleaning knife.Because when you shove a herring's head
to the left with your thumb, and you lift out the gullet with the
blade, the creature looks at you with such knowing eyes, and yet
you clean two hundred in an hour.And when you cut throats out of
fourteen hundred cod, that makes twenty-eight hundred eyes that look
at you!I had few
equals in boning and cutting livers.Tja, tja, and how afraid they all
were!They looked up at the clouds as if they were saying:
"How about this now.I say:
we take the fish and God takes us.We must all, the beasts must,
and the men must, and because we all must, none of us should--now,
that's just as if you'd pour a full barrel into an empty one.I'd
be afraid to be left alone in the empty barrel, with every one else
in the other barrel.No, being afraid is no good; being afraid is
standing on your toes and looking over the edge.You act as if you'd had
a dram.Am I right about the pig
stye or not?Hear how the poor animal is going on out there.I'm sure
the wall has fallen in.You pour yourself out a bowl, Uncle Cobus!I'll give her a
helping hand.Cobus, I'll thank God when the Good Hope is safely in.But the Hope is an old ship,
and old ships are the last to go down.No, that's what every old sailor says.All the same, I shall pray
God tonight.But the Jacoba is out and the
Mathilda is out and the Expectation is out.The Good Hope is rotten--so--so----[Stops anxiously.]That's what----Why--that's what----I thought----It just
occurred to me.If the Good Hope was rotten, then your father would----

CLEMENTINE.Oh, shut your fool mouth, you'll make Kneir anxious.Quick,
Kneir, shut the door, for the lamp.How scared Barend will be, and just as
they're homeward bound.The evening is still so long and
so gloomy--Yes?[Enter Simon and Marietje, who is crying.]Stop your damn
howling----

KNEIRTJE.Her lover is also--be a good seaman's
wife.You girls haven't had any trouble
yet!If it wasn't for Daan----

JO.Here, this will warm you up, Simon.It's happened to me before
with the dog car, in a tempest like this.And when the
doctor came, Katrien was dead and the child was dead, but if you ask
me, I'd rather sit in my dog car tonight than to be on the sea.No, don't let us waste our time.Let's talk, then we won't
think of anything.Last night was stormy, too, and I had such a bad dream.I can't rightly say it was a dream.There was a rap on the
window, once.Soon as I lay down there came another rap, so.[Raps on
the table with her knuckles.]And then I saw Mees, his face was pale,
pale as--God!Each time--like that, so----[Raps.]You stupid, you, to scare the old woman into a fit with your
raps.My ears and neck full of sand, and it's
cold.Just throw a couple of blocks on the fire.I couldn't stand it at home either, children asleep, no one
to talk to, and the howling of the wind.Two mooring posts were
washed away.What's that to us----Milk and sugar?Your little son was a brave boy, Truus.I can see him
now as he stood waving good-bye.Yes, that boy's a treasure, barely twelve.You
should have seen him two and a half months ago.The child behaved like an angel, just like a grown
man.He would sit up evenings to chat with me, the child knows more
than I do.The lamb, hope he's not been awfully sea sick.Now, you may not believe it, but red spectacles
keep you from being sea sick.You're like the doctors, they let others swallow their doses.Many's the night I've slept on board; when my husband was
alive I went along on many a voyage.Should like to have seen you in oil skins.Hear, now, the young lady is flattering me.I'm not so bad
looking as that, Miss.Now and then, when things
didn't go to suit him, without speaking ill of the dead, I may say,
he couldn't keep his paws at home; then he'd smash things.I still
have a coffee pot without a handle I keep as a remembrance.--I wouldn't
part with it for a rix dollar.I won't even offer you a guilder!Say, you're such a funny story teller, tell us about the Harlemmer
oil, Saart.Yes, if it hadn't been for Harlemmer oil I might not have been
a widow.Now, then, my man was a comical chap.I'd bought him a knife in a leather sheath, paid a good price
for it too, and when he'd come back in five weeks and I'd ask him:
"Jacob, have you lost your knife?"he'd say, "I don't know about my
knife--you never gave me a knife."But
when he'd undress himself for the first time in five weeks, and pulled
off his rubber boots, bang, the knife would fall on the floor.He
hadn't felt it in all that time.Didn't take off his rubber boots in five weeks?Then I had to scrub 'im with soap and soda; he hadn't seen
water, and covered with vermin.Wish I could get a cent a dozen for all the lice on board;
they get them thrown in with their share of the cargo.Now
then, his last voyage a sheet of water threw him against the bulwarks
just as they pulled the mizzen staysail to larboard, and his leg was
broke.Then they were in a fix--The skipper could poultice and cut a
corn, but he couldn't mend a broken leg.Then they wanted to shove a
plank under it, but Jacob wanted Harlemmer oil rubbed on his leg.Every
day he had them rub it with Harlemmer oil, and again Harlemmer oil,
and some more Harlemmer oil.When they came in
his leg was a sight.You shouldn't have asked me to tell it.Now, yes; you can't bring the dead back to life.And when you
think of it, it's a dirty shame I can't marry again.A year later
the Changeable went down with man and mouse.Then, bless me, you'd
suppose, as your husband was dead, for he'd gone along with his leg
and a half, you could marry another man.First you must
advertise for him in the newspapers three times, and then if in three
times he don't turn up, you may go and get a new license.I don't think I'll ever marry again.That's not surprisin' when you've been married twice already;
if you don't know the men by this time.I wish I could talk about things the way you do.With my first it was a horror; with my second you know
yourselves.I could sit up all night hearing tales of
the sea.Don't tell stories of suffering and death----

SAART.[Quietly knitting and speaking in a toneless voice.]Ach,
it couldn't have happened here, Kneir.We lived in Vlaardingen then,
and I'd been married a year without any children.No, Pietje was Ari's
child--and he went away on the Magnet.And you understand what happened;
else I wouldn't have got acquainted with Ari and be living next door
to you now.The Magnet stayed on the sands or some other place.But
I didn't know that then, and so didn't think of it.Now in Vlaardingen they have a tower and on the tower a lookout.And this lookout hoists a red ball when he sees a lugger or
a trawler or other boat in the distance.And when he sees who it
is, he lets down the ball, runs to the ship owner and the families
to warn them; that's to say: the Albert Koster or the Good Hope is
coming.Now mostly he's no need to warn the family.For, as soon as
the ball is hoisted in the tower, the children run in the streets
shouting, I did it, too, as a child: "The ball is up!Then the women run, and wait below for the lookout to come down,
and when it's their ship they give him pennies.And--and--the Magnet with my first
husband, didn't I say I'd been married a year?The Magnet stayed out
seven weeks--with provisions for six--and each time the children
shouted: "The ball is up, Truus!Then I
ran like mad to the tower.They all knew why
I ran, and when the lookout came down I could have torn the words
out of his mouth.But I would say: "Have you tidings--tidings of
the Magnet?"Then he'd say: "No, it's the Maria," or the Alert,
or the Concordia, and then I'd drag myself away slowly, so slowly,
crying and thinking of my husband.And each day, when
the children shouted, I got a shock through my brain, and each day I
stood by the tower, praying that God--but the Magnet did not come--did
not come.At the last I didn't dare to go to the tower any more when
the ball was hoisted.No longer dared to stand at the door waiting,
if perhaps the lookout himself would bring the message.That lasted
two months--two months--and then--well, then I believed it.Now, that's so short a time since.Ach, child, I'd love to talk about it to every
one, all day long.When you've been left with six children--a good
man--never gave me a harsh word--never.Had it happened six
days later they would have brought him in.They smell when there's
a corpse aboard.Yes, that's true, you never see them otherwise.You'll never marry a fisherman, Miss; but it's sad,
sad; God, so sad!when they lash your dear one to a plank, wrapped in
a piece of sail with a stone in it, three times around the big mast,
and then, one, two, three, in God's name.No, I wasn't thinking of Mees, I was thinking of my little
brother, who was also drowned.Wasn't that on the herring catch?His second voyage, a blow
from the fore sail, and he lay overboard.The
skipper reached him the herring shovel, but it was smooth and it
slipped from his hands.Then Jerusalem, the mate, held out the broom
to him--again he grabbed hold.The three of them pulled him up; then
the broom gave way, he fell back into the waves, and for the third
time the skipper threw him a line.God wanted my little brother, the
line broke, and the end went down with him to the bottom of the sea.frightful!--Grabbed it three times, and lost
it three times.As if the child knew what was coming in the morning, he had
lain crying all night.Crying for Mother, who was
sick.When the skipper tried to console him, he said: "No, skipper,
even if Mother does get well, I eat my last herring today."No, truly, Miss, when he came back from Pieterse's with the
money, Toontje's share of the cargo as rope caster, eighteen guilders
and thirty-five cents for five and a half weeks.Then he simply acted
insane, he threw the money on the ground, then he cursed at--I won't
repeat what--at everything.Mother's sickness and burial
had cost a lot.Eighteen guilders is a heap of money, a big heap.Eighteen guilders for your child, eighteen--[Listening in alarm
to the blasts of the wind.]No, say, Hahaha!----

KNEIRTJE.Yes, yes, if the water could
only speak.Come now, you tell a tale of the sea.Ach, Miss, life on the sea is no tale.Nothing
between yourself and eternity but the thickness of a one-inch
plank.It's hard on the men, and hard on the women.Yesterday I passed
by the garden of the Burgomaster.They sat at table and ate cod from
which the steam was rising, and the children sat with folded hands
saying grace.Then, thought I, in my ignorance--if it was wrong, may
God forgive me--that it wasn't right of the Burgomaster--not right
of him--and not right of the others.For the wind blew so hard out
of the East, and those fish came out of the same water in which our
dead--how shall I say it?--in which our dead--you understand me.It is our living,
and we must not rebel against our living.When the lead was dropped he could tell by the taste of the
sand where they were.Often in the night he'd say we are on the 56th
and on the 56th they'd be.Once
he drifted about two days and nights in a boat with two others.That
was the time they were taking in the net and a fog came up so thick
they couldn't see the buoys, let alone find the lugger.Later when the boat went to pieces--you should
have heard him tell it--how he and old Dirk swam to an overturned
rowboat; he climbed on top."I'll never forget that night," said
he.Dirk was too old or tired to get a hold.Then my husband stuck
his knife into the boat.John journeyed to the bathroom.Dirk tried to grasp it as he was sinking,
and he clutched in such a way that three of his fingers hung
down.Then at the risk of his own life,
my husband pulled Dirk up onto the overturned boat.So the two of
them drifted in the night, and Dirk--old Dirk--from loss of blood
or from fear, went insane.He sat and glared at my husband with the
eyes of a cat.He raved of the devil that was in him.Of Satan, and
the blood, my husband said, ran all over the boat--the waves were
kept busy washing it away.Just at dawn Dirk slipped off, insane
as he was.My man was picked up by a freighter that sailed by.But
it was no use, three years later--that's twelve years ago now--the
Clementine--named after you by your father--stranded on the Doggerbanks
with him and my two oldest.Of what happened to them, I know nothing,
nothing at all.Never a buoy, or a hatch, washed ashore.You can't realize it at first, but after so many years one
can't recall their faces any more, and that's a blessing.For hard it
would be if one remembered.Every sailor's
wife has something like this in her family, it's not new.Truus is
right: "The fish are dearly paid for."We are all in God's hands, and God is great and good.[Beating her
head with her fists.]You're all driving me mad, mad, mad!Her husband and her little brother--and my poor
uncle--those horrible stories--instead of cheering us up!My father was drowned, drowned, drowned,
drowned!There are others--all--drowned, drowned!--and--you are all
miserable wretches--you are![Violently bangs the door shut as she
runs out.]No, child, she will quiet down by herself.Nervous strain
of the last two days.It has grown late, Kneir, and your niece--your niece was a
little unmannerly.Thank you again, Miss, for the soup and eggs.Are you coming to drink a bowl with me tomorrow night?If you see Jo send her in at once.[All go out except
Kneirtje.A fierce wind howls, shrieking
about the house.She listens anxiously at the window, shoves her
chair close to the chimney, stares into the fire.Her lips move in
a muttered prayer while she fingers a rosary.Jo enters, drops into
a chair by the window and nervously unpins her shawl.]And that dear child that came out in the storm to bring me
soup and eggs.Your sons are out in the storm for her and her father.Half the guard
rail is washed away, the pier is under water.You never went on like this
when Geert sailed with the Navy.In a month or two
it will storm again; each time again.And there are many fishermen on
the sea besides our boys.[Her speech sinks into a soft murmur.Her
old fingers handle the rosary.]Barend, we almost drove him away![Seeing that Kneirtje prays, she walks to the window wringing
her hands, pulls up the curtain uncertainly, stares through the window
panes.The wind blows the
curtain on high, the lamp dances, the light puffs out.oh!----

KNEIRTJE.[Jo
lights the lamp, shivering with fear.][To Jo,
who crouches sobbing by the chimney.]If anything happens--then--then----

KNEIRTJE.Now, I ask you, how will it be when you're married?You don't know
what you say, Aunt Kneir!If Geert--[Stops, panting.]That was not
good of you--not good--to have secrets.Your lover--your husband--is
my son.Don't stare that way into the
fire.Even if
it was wrong of you and of him.Come and sit opposite to me, then
together we will--[Lays her prayerbook on the table.]If anything happens----

KNEIRTJE.If anything--anything--anything--then I'll never pray
again, never again.No Mother Mary--then there
is nothing--nothing----

KNEIRTJE.[Opens the prayerbook, touches Jo's arm.Jo looks up, sobbing
passionately, sees the prayerbook, shakes her head fiercely.Again
wailing, drops to the floor, which she beats with her hands.Kneirtje's
trembling voice sounds.][The wind races with wild lashings about the house.]Left, office door, separated from the
main office by a wooden railing.Between this door and railing are
two benches; an old cupboard.In the background; three windows with
view of the sunlit sea.In front of the middle window a standing
desk and high stool.Right, writing table with telephone--a safe,
an inside door.On the walls, notices of wreckage, insurance, maps,
etc.[Kaps, Bos and Mathilde discovered.]Clemens!----

KAPS.: 2,447 ribs, marked Kusta; ten sail sheets, marked 'M."Four deck beams, two spars, five"----

MATHILDE.I have written the circular for the tower
bell.Connect me with the
Burgomaster!Up to my ears
in--[Sweetly.]My little wife asks----

MATHILDE.If Mevrouw will come to the telephone about the circular.If Mevrouw
will come to the telephone a moment?Just so, Burgomaster,--the
ladies--hahaha!Then it can go to the
printers.Do you think I
haven't anything on my mind!That damned----

MATHILDE.No,
she can't come to the telephone herself, she doesn't know
how.My wife has written the circular for
the tower bell."You are no doubt acquainted with the new church."--She
says, "No," the stupid!I am reading, Mevrouw, again."You are no
doubt acquainted with the new church.The church has, as you know,
a high tower; that high tower points upward, and that is good, that is
fortunate, and truly necessary for many children of our generation"----

MATHILDE.Pardon, I was speaking to
my bookkeeper.Yes--yes--ha, ha, ha--[Reads again
from paper.]"But that tower could do something else that also is
good.It can mark the time for us children of the
times.It stands there since 1882 and has never
answered to the question, 'What time is it?'It
was indeed built for it, there are four places visible for faces;
for years in all sorts of ways"--Did you say anything?No?--"for years
the wish has been expressed by the surrounding inhabitants that they
might have a clock--About three hundred guilders are needed.The Committee, Mevrouw"--What did you say?Yes, you know the
names, of course.Yes--Yes--All the ladies of
the Committee naturally sign for the same amount, a hundred guilders
each?Yes--Yes--Very well--My wife will be at home, Mevrouw.Damned nonsense!--a hundred guilders gone to the devil!What
is it to you if there's a clock on the damn thing or not?I'll let you fry in your own fat.She'll be here in her carriage in quarter of an hour.If you drank less grog in the evenings
you wouldn't have such a bad temper in the mornings.You took five guilders out of my purse this morning
while I was asleep.I can keep no----

MATHILDE.Bah, what a man, who counts his money before he goes to bed!Very well, don't give it--Then I can treat the Burgomaster's
wife to a glass of gin presently--three jugs of old gin and not a
single bottle of port or sherry![Bos angrily throws down two rix
dollars.]If it wasn't for me you wouldn't
be throwing rix dollars around!--Bah!IJmuiden, 24 December--Today there were four sloops
in the market with 500 to 800 live and 1,500 to 2,100 dead haddock
and some--live cod--The live cod brought 7 1/4--the dead----

BOS.The dead haddock brought thirteen and a half guilders a basket.Take
your book--turn to the credit page of the Expectation----

KAPS.no--the Good Hope?--We can whistle for her.Fourteen hundred and forty-three guilders and forty-seven cents.How could you be so ungodly stupid, to deduct four
guilders, 88, for the widows and orphans' fund?--1,443--3 per cent off--that's
1,400--that's gross three hundred and 87 guilders--yes, it should be
three guilders, 88, instead of four, 88.If you're going into your dotage, Jackass!There might be something to say against
that, Meneer--you didn't go after me when, when----

BOS.Now, that'll do, that'll do!----

KAPS.And that was an error with a couple of big ciphers after it.[Bos
goes off impatiently at right.]It all depends on what side----

[Looks around, sees Bos is gone, pokes up the fire; fills his pipe from
Bos's tobacco jar, carefully steals a couple of cigars from his box.]Mynheer Bos, eh?--no.Meneer said
that when he got news, he----

SIMON.The Jacoba came in after fifty-nine days' lost time.You are--You know more than you let on.Then it's time--I know more, eh?I'm holding off the ships by
ropes, eh?I warned you folks when that ship lay in the docks.What were
the words I spoke then, eh?All tales on your part for a glass
of gin!You was there, and the Miss was there.I says,
"The ship is rotten, that caulking was damn useless.That a floating
coffin like that"----

KAPS.Are
you so clever that when you're half drunk----

SIMON.Not drunk then, are you such an authority, you a shipmaster's
assistant, that when you say "no," and the owner and the Insurance
Company say "yes," my employer must put his ship in the dry docks?And now, I say--now, I say--that
if Mees, my daughter's betrothed, not to speak of the others, if
Mees--there will be murder.I'll be back in ten
minutes.[Goes back to his desk; the telephone rings.Mynheer
will be back in ten minutes.Mynheer Bos just went round the
corner.How lucky that outside of the children there were three
unmarried men on board.Or you'll break Meneer's
cigars.Kaps, do you want to make a guilder?I'm engaged to Bol, the skipper.He's lying here, with a load of peat for the city.I can't; because they don't know if my husband's dead.The legal limit is----

SAART.You must summons him, 'pro Deo,' three times in the papers and
if he doesn't come then, and that he'll not do, for there aren't any
more ghosts in the world, then you can----

SAART.Now, if you'd attend to this little matter, Bol and I would
always be grateful to you.When your common sense tells you
I haven't seen Jacob in three years and the----

[Cobus enters, trembling with agitation.]There must be tidings of the boys--of--of--the
Hope.Now, there is no use in your coming
to this office day after day.I haven't any good news to give you,
the bad you already know.Sixty-two days----

COB.Ach, ach, ach; Meneer Kaps,
help us out of this uncertainty.My sister--and my niece--are simply
insane with grief.My niece is sitting alone at home--my sister is at the Priest's,
cleaning house.There must be something--there must be something.The water bailiff's clerk said--said--Ach, dear God----[Off.]after that storm--all things
are possible.No, I wouldn't give a cent for it.If they had run into an English harbor, we would have
had tidings.[Laying her sketch book on Kaps's desk.]That's the way he was three months ago,
hale and jolly.No, Miss, I haven't the time.Daantje's death was a blow to him--you always saw them together,
always discussing.Now he hasn't a friend in the "Home"; that makes
a big difference.Well, that's Kneir, that's Barend with the basket on his back,
and that's--[The telephone bell rings.How long
will he be, Kaps?A hatch marked
47--and--[Trembling.][Screams and lets the
receiver fall.]I don't dare listen--Oh, oh!Barend?----Barend?----

CLEMENTINE.A telegram from Nieuwediep.A hatch--and a corpse----

[Enter Bos.]The water bailiff is on the 'phone.The water bailiff?--Step aside--Go along, you!I--I--[Goes timidly off.]A
telegram from Nieuwediep?47?--Well,
that's damned--miserable--that!the corpse--advanced stage of
decomposition!Barend--mustered in as oldest boy!by--oh!--The Expectation has come into Nieuwediep disabled?And
did Skipper Maatsuiker recognize him?So it isn't necessary to send any
one from here for the identification?Yes, damned sad--yes--yes--we
are in God's hand--Yes--yes--I no longer had any doubts--thank
you--yes--I'd like to get the official report as soon as possible.I
will inform the underwriters, bejour!I
never expected to hear of the ship again.Yes--yes--yes--yes--[To Clementine.]What stupidity to repeat what you heard in that woman's
presence.It won't be five minutes now till half the village is
here!You sit there, God save me, and take
on as if your lover was aboard----

CLEMENTINE.When Simon, the shipbuilder's assistant----

BOS.And if he hadn't been, what right have you to stick
your nose into matters you don't understand?Dear God, now I am also guilty----

BOS.Have the novels you read gone to
your head?Are you possessed, to use those words after such
an accident?He said that the ship was a floating coffin.Then I heard
you say that in any case it would be the last voyage for the Hope.That damned boarding school; those damned
boarding school fads!Walk if you like through the village like a fool,
sketching the first rascal or beggar you meet!But don't blab out
things you can be held to account for.Say, rather,
a drunken authority--The North, of Pieterse, and the Surprise and the
Willem III and the Young John.Half of the
fishing fleet and half the merchant fleet are floating coffins.No, Meneer, I don't hear anything.If you had asked me: "Father, how is this?"But you conceited young people meddle with everything and
more, too!What stronger proof is there than the yearly inspection of
the ships by the underwriters?Do you suppose that when I presently
ring up the underwriter and say to him, "Meneer, you can plank down
fourteen hundred guilders"--that he does that on loose grounds?You
ought to have a face as red as a buoy in shame for the way you flapped
out your nonsense!Nonsense; that might take away
my good name, if I wasn't so well known.If I were a ship owner--and I heard----

BOS.God preserve the fishery from an owner who makes drawings and
cries over pretty vases!I stand as a father at the head of a hundred
homes.When you get sensitive you go head over
heels.[Kaps makes a motion that he cannot hear.]The Burgomaster's wife is making a call.Willem Hengst, aged
thirty-seven, married, four children----

BOS.Wait a moment till my daughter----

CLEMENTINE.Jacob Zwart, aged thirty-five years, married,
three children.Gerrit Plas, aged twenty-five years, married, one
child.Geert Vermeer, unmarried, aged twenty-six years.Nellis Boom,
aged thirty-five years, married, seven children.Klaas Steen, aged
twenty-four years, married.Solomon Bergen, aged twenty-five years,
married, one child.Mari Stad, aged forty-five years, married.Barend Vermeer,
aged nineteen years.Pietje Stappers, aged twelve years.Ach, God; don't make me unhappy, Meneer!----

BOS.Stappers----

MARIETJE.You lie!--It isn't
possible!----

BOS.The Burgomaster at Nieuwediep has telegraphed the water
bailiff.Barend Vermeer was washed ashore.You know what that means,
and a hatch of the 47----

TRUUS.Oh, Mother Mary, must I lose that child, too?Oh,
oh, oh, oh!--Pietje--Pietje----

MARIETJE.Then--Then--[Bursts into a hysterical
laugh.]Hahaha!--Hahaha!----

BOS.[Striking the glass from Clementine's hand.][Falling on her knees, her hands catching hold of the railing
gate.]Let me die!--Let me die, please, dear God, dear God!Come Marietje, be calm; get up.And so brave; as he stood there, waving,
when the ship--[Sobs loudly.]There hasn't
been a storm like that in years.Think of Hengst with four children,
and Jacob and Gerrit--And, although it's no consolation, I will hand
you your boy's wages today, if you like.Both of you go home now and
resign yourselves to the inevitable--take her with you--she seems----

MARIETJE.I want to
die, die----

CLEMENTINE.Cry, Marietje, cry, poor lamb----

[They go off.]Are
you too lazy to put pen to paper today?Have you
the Widows' and Orphans' fund at hand?[Bos
throws him the keys.][Opens the safe, shuffles back
to Bos's desk with the book.]Ninety-five widows, fourteen old sailors and fishermen.Yes, the fund fell short some time ago.We will have to put in
another appeal.The Burgomaster's
wife asks if you will come in for a moment.Kaps, here is the copy for the circular.Talk to her about making a public appeal for the unfortunates.Yes, but, Clemens, isn't that overdoing it, two begging
parties?I will do it myself, then--[Both exit.][Goes to his desk
and sits down opposite to him.]I feel so miserable----

KAPS.The statement of
Veritas for October--October alone; lost, 105 sailing vessels and
30 steamships--that's a low estimate; fifteen hundred dead in one
month.Yes, when you see it as it appears
today, so smooth, with the floating gulls, you wouldn't believe that
it murders so many people.[To Jo and Cobus, who sit alone in a dazed way.]We have just run from home--for Saart just as I
said--just as I said----

[Enter Bos.]You stay
where you are, Cobus.You have no doubt heard?----

JO.It happens so often that
they get off in row boats.Not only was there a hatch,
but the corpse was in an extreme state of dissolution.Skipper Maatsuiker of the Expectation identified him, and the
earrings.And if--he should be mistaken----I've
come to ask you for money, Meneer, so I can go to the Helder myself.The Burgomaster of Nieuwediep will take care of that----

[Enter Simon.]I--I--heard----[Makes a strong gesture towards Bos.]I--I--have no evil
intentions----

BOS.Must that drunken
fellow----

SIMON.[Steadying himself by holding to the gate.]No--stay where
you are--I'm going--I--I--only wanted to say how nicely it came
out--with--with--The Good Hope.Don't come so close to me--never come so close to a man with
a knife----No-o-o-o--I have no bad intentions.I only wanted to say,
that I warned you--when--she lay in the docks.Now just for the joke of it--you ask--ask--ask your bookkeeper
and your daughter--who were there----

BOS.You're not worth an answer, you sot!My employer--doesn't do the caulking himself.[To Kaps, who
has advanced to the gate.]Didn't I warn him?--wasn't you there?No, I wasn't there, and even if I
was, I didn't hear anything.Did that drunken sot----

CLEMENTINE.As my daughter do you permit----[Grimly.]I don't remember----

SIMON.That's low--that's low--damned low!I said, the ship was
rotten--rotten----

BOS.You're trying to drag in my bookkeeper
and daughter, and you hear----

COB.Yes, but--yes, but--now I remember also----

BOS.But your daughter--your daughter
says now that she hadn't heard the ship was rotten.And on the second
night of the storm, when she was alone with me at my sister Kneirtje's,
she did say that--that----

CLEMENTINE.Did I--say----

COB.These are my own words
to you: "Now you are fibbing, Miss; for if your father knew the Good
Hope was rotten"----

JO.[Springing up wildly, speaking with piercing distinctness.]I
was there, and Truus was there, and----Oh, you adders!Who
gives you your feed, year in, year out?Haven't you decency enough to
believe us instead of that drunken beggar who reels as he stands there?You had Barend dragged on board by the police; Geert was too
proud to be taken!No,
no, you needn't point to your door!If I staid here
any longer I would spit in your face--spit in your face!For your Aunt's sake I will consider that you
are overwrought; otherwise--otherwise----The Good Hope was seaworthy,
was seaworthy!And even
had the fellow warned me--which is a lie, could I, a business man,
take the word of a drunkard who can no longer get a job because he
is unable to handle tools?I--I told you and him and her--that a floating
coffin like that.Geert and Barend and Mees and the
others![Sinks on the chair
sobbing.]Give me the money to go to Nieuwediep myself, then I won't
speak of it any more.A girl that talks to me as
rudely as you did----

JO.I don't know what I said--and--and--I don't
believe that you--that you--that you would be worse than the devil.The water-bailiff says that it isn't necessary to send any one
to Nieuwediep.What will
become of me now?----

[Cobus and Simon follow her out.]And you--don't you ever dare to set foot again
in my office.Father, I ask myself [Bursts into sobs.]She would be capable of ruining my good name--with
her boarding-school whims.Who ever comes now you send away,
understand?[Sound of Jelle's fiddle
outside.][Falls into his chair, takes
up Clementine's sketch book; spitefully turns the leaves; throws
it on the floor; stoops, jerks out a couple of leaves, tears them
up.Sits in thought a moment, then rings the telephone.]with
Dirksen--Dirksen, I say, the underwriter![Waits, looking
sombre.]It's all up with the
Good Hope.A hatch with my mark washed ashore and the body of a
sailor.I shall wait for you here at my office.[Rings off;
at the last words Kneirtje has entered.]I----[She sinks on the bench, patiently weeping.]Have you mislaid the
policies?You never put a damn thing in its place.The policies are higher, behind
the stocks.[Turning around
with the policies in his hand.]That hussy that
lives with you has been in here kicking up such a scandal that I came
near telephoning for the police.Is it true--is it true
that----The priest said----[Bos nods with a sombre expression.]Oh,
oh----[She stares helplessly, her arms hang limp.]I know you as a respectable woman--and
your husband too.I'm sorry to have to say it to you
now after such a blow, your children and that niece of yours have never
been any good.[Kneirtje's head sinks down.]How many years haven't
we had you around, until your son Geert threatened me with his fists,
mocked my grey hairs, and all but threw me out of your house--and your
other son----[Frightened.]Shall I call Mevrouw or your daughter?with long drawn out sobs,
sits looking before her with a dazed stare.][In an agonized voice, broken with sobs.]And with my own hands I loosened his
fingers from the door post.You have no cause to reproach yourself----

KNEIRTJE.Before he went I hung his
father's rings in his ears.Like--like a lamb to the slaughter----

BOS.Come----

KNEIRTJE.And my oldest boy that I didn't bid good
bye----"If you're too late"--these were his words--"I'll never look
at you again."in God's name, stop!----

KNEIRTJE.Twelve years ago--when the Clementine--I sat here as I am
now.[Sobs with her face between her trembling old hands.]Ach, poor, dear Kneir, I am so sorry for you.My husband and four sons----

MATHILDE.We have written an
appeal, the Burgomaster's wife and I, and it's going to be in all
the papers tomorrow.Here, Kaps----[Hands Kaps a sheet of paper which
he places on desk--Bos motions to her to go.]Let her wait a while,
Clemens.I have a couple of cold chops--that will brace
her up--and--and--let's make up with her.You have no objections
to her coming again to do the cleaning?We won't forget you, do you
hear?Now, my only hope is--my niece's child.She is with child by my
son----[Softly smiling.]No, that isn't a misfortune
now----

BOS.This immorality under your own
roof?Don't you know the rules of the fund, that no aid can be
extended to anyone leading an immoral life, or whose conduct does
not meet with our approval?I leave it to the gentlemen
themselves--to do for me--the gentlemen----

BOS.It will be a tussle with the Committee--the committee of the
fund--your son had been in prison and sang revolutionary songs.And
your niece who----However, I will do my best.I shall recommend
you, but I can't promise anything.There are seven new families,
awaiting aid, sixteen new orphans.My wife wants to give you something to take home
with you.[The bookkeeper rises, disappears
for a moment, and returns with a dish and an enamelled pan.]If you will return the dish when it's convenient,
and if you'll come again Saturday, to do the cleaning.He closes her nerveless hands about the dish and pan;
shuffles back to his stool.Kneirtje sits motionless,
in dazed agony; mumbles--moves her lips--rises with difficulty,
stumbles out of the office.]Appeal, for the
newspapers![Smiling sardonically, he comes to the foreground; leaning
on Bos's desk, he reads.]"Benevolent Fellow Countrymen: Again we
urge upon your generosity an appeal in behalf of a number of destitute
widows and orphans.The lugger Good Hope----[As he continues reading.]End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Good Hope, by Herman Heijermans, Jr."Enough men of character, however, are entering the field through
    these better schools to ensure the upholding of those lofty ideals
    that have characterized the profession in the past and which are
    essential to our continued progress.I think, therefore, that we may
    take a hopeful view of the future.The demand for better prepared
    physicians will eventually close many avenues that are now open to
    students, greatly to the benefit of all.With the curtailing of the
    number of students and a less fierce competition which this will
    bring, there will be less temptation, less necessity, if you will, on
    the part of general practitioners to ask for a division of fees.He
    will come to see that honest dealing on his part with the patient
    requiring special skill will in the long run be the best policy.He
    will make a just, open charge for the services he has rendered and not
    attempt to collect a surreptitious fee through a dishonest surgeon for
    services he has not rendered and could not render.Then, too, there
    will be less inducement and less opportunity for incompetent and
    conscienceless men to disgrace the art of surgery."The public mind is becoming especially active just at this time in
    combating graft in all forms, and is ready to aid in its destruction.The intelligent portion of the laity is becoming alive to the patent
    medicine evil.It is only a question of time when the people will
    demand that the secular papers which go into our homes shall not
    contain the vile, disgusting and suggestive quack advertisements that
    are found to-day.A campaign of reform is being instituted against
    dishonest politicians, financiers, railroad and insurance magnates,
    showing that their methods will be no longer tolerated.The moral
    standards set for professional men and men in public life are going to
    be higher in the future, and with the limelight of public opinion
    turned on the medical and surgical grafter, the evil will cease to
    exist.Hand in hand with this reform let us hope that there will come
    to be established a legal and moral standard of qualification for
    those who assume to do surgery."I feel sure that it is the wish of every member of this association
    to do everything possible to hasten the coming of this day and to aid
    in the uplifting of the art of surgery.Our individual effort in this
    direction must lie largely through the influence we exert over those
    who seek our advice before beginning the study of medicine, and over
    those who, having entered the work, are to follow in our immediate
    footsteps.To the young man who seeks our counsel as to the
    advisability of commencing the study of medicine, it is our duty to
    make a plain statement of what would be expected of him, of the cost
    in time and money, and an estimate of what he might reasonably expect
    as a reward for a life devoted to ceaseless study, toil and
    responsibility.If, from our knowledge of the character, attainments
    and qualifications of the young man we feel that at best he could make
    but a modicum of success in the work, we should endeavor to divert his
    ambition into some other channel."We should advise the 'expectant surgeon' in his preparation to follow
    as nearly as possible the line of study suggested by Richardson.Then
    I would add the advice of Senn, viz: 'To do general practice for
    several years, return to laboratory work and surgical anatomy, attend
    the clinics of different operators, and never cease to be a physician.If this advice is followed there will be less unnecessary operating
    done in the future than has been the case in the past.'The young man
    who enters special work without having had experience as a general
    practitioner, is seriously handicapped.In this age, when we have so
    frequently to deal with the so-called border-line cases, it is
    especially well never to cease being a physician."We would next have the young man assure himself that he is the
    possessor of a well-developed, healthy, working'surgical conscience.'No matter how well qualified he may be, his enthusiasm in the earlier
    years of his work will lead him to do operations that he would refrain
    from in later life.This will be especially true of malignant disease.He knows that early and thorough radical measures alone hold out hope,
    and only by repeated unsuccessful efforts will he learn to temper his
    ambition by the judgment that comes of experience.Pirogoff, the noted
    surgeon, suffered from a malignant growth.Billroth refused to operate
    or advise operation.In writing to another surgeon friend he said: 'I
    am not the bold operator whom you knew years ago in Zurich.Before
    deciding on the necessity of an operation, I always propose to myself
    this question: Would you permit such an operation as you intend
    performing on your patient to be done on yourself?Years and
    experience bring in their train a certain degree of hesitancy.'This,
    coming from one who in his day was the most brilliant operator in the
    world, should be remembered by every surgeon, young and old."In the hands of the skilled,
conscientious surgeon how great are thy powers for good to suffering
humanity!In the hands of shysters "what crimes are committed in thy
name!"With his own school full of shysters and incompetents, and grafters of
"new schools" and "systems" to compete with on every hand, the
conscientious physician seems to be "between the devil and the deep sea!"With quacks to the right of him, quacks to the left of him, quacks in
front of him, all volleying and thundering with their literature to prove
that the old schools, and all schools other than theirs, are frauds,
impostors and poisoners, about all that is left for the layman to do when
sick is to take to the woods.PART TWO

OSTEOPATHY




CHAPTER VII.SOME DEFINITIONS AND HISTORIES.Romantic Story of Osteopathy's Origin--An Asthma Cure--Headache Cured
    by Plowlines--Log Rolling to Relieve Dysentery--Osteopathy is Drugless
    Healing--Osteopathy is Manual Treatment--Liberty of Blood, Nerves and
    Arteries--Perfect Skeletal Alignment and Tonic, Ligamentous, Muscular
    and Facial Relaxation--Andrew T. Still in 1874--Kirksville, Mo., as a
    Mecca--American School of Osteopathy--The Promised Golden Stream of
    Prosperity--Shams and Pretenses--The "Mossbacks"--"Who's Who in
    Osteopathy."The story of the origin of Osteopathy is romantic enough to appeal to the
fancy of impressionists.It is almost as romantic as the finding of the
mysterious stones by the immortal Joe Smith.In this story is embodied the
life history of an old-time doctor and pioneer hero in his restless
migrations about the frontiers of Kansas and Missouri.His thrilling
experiences in the days of border wars and through the Civil War are
narrated, and how the germ of the idea of the true cause and cure of
disease was planted in his mind by the remark of a comrade as the two lay
concealed in a thicket for days to escape border ruffians.Then, later,
how the almost simultaneous death of two or three beloved children, whom
all his medical learning and that of other doctors he had summoned had
been powerless to save, had caused him to renounce forever the belief that
drugs could cure disease.He believed Nature had a true system, and for
this he began a patient search.He wandered here and there, almost in the
condition of the religious reformers of old, who "wandered up and down
clad in sheep-skins and goat-hides, of whom the world was not worthy."In
the name of suffering humanity he desecrated the grave of poor Lo, that he
might read from his red bones some clue to the secret.One Osteopathic journal claims to tell authentically how Still was led to
the discovery of the "great truth."It states that by accidentally curing
a case of asthma by "fooling with the bones of the chest," he was led to
the belief that bones out of normal position cause disease.Still himself tells a rather different story in a popular magazine posing
of late years as a public educator in matters of therapeutics.In this
magazine Still tells how he discovered the principles of Osteopathy by
curing a terrible headache resting the back of his neck across a swing
made of his father's plowlines, and next by writhing on his back across a
log to relieve the pain of dysentery.Accidentally the "lesion" was
corrected, or the proper center "inhibited," and his headache and flux
immediately cured.You can take your choice of these various versions of the wonderful
discovery.Ever since Osteopathy began to attract attention, and people began to
inquire "What is it?"its leading promoters have vied with each other in
trying to construct a good definition for their "great new science."Here are some of the definitions:

"Osteopathy is the science of drugless healing."For a genuine "lesion"
Osteopath that would not do at all.It is too broad and gives too much
scope to the physicians who would do more than "pull bones.""Osteopathy is practical anatomy and physiology skillfully and
scientifically applied as _manual_ treatment of disease."That definition
suits better, because of the "manual treatment."If you are a true
Osteopath you must do it _all_ with your hands.It will not do to use any
mechanical appliances, for if you do you cannot keep up the impression
that you are "handling the body with the skilled touch of a master who
knows every part of his machine.""The human body is a machine run by the unseen force called life, and that
it may run harmoniously it is necessary that there be liberty of blood,
nerves, and arteries from the generating point to destination."This
definition may be impressive to the popular mind, but, upon analysis, we
wonder if any other string of big words might not have had the same
effect."Liberty of blood" is a proposition even a stupid medical man must
admit.Of course, there must be free circulation of blood, and massage, or
hot and cold applications, or exercise, or anything that will stimulate
circulation, is rational.But when "liberty of blood" is mentioned, what
is meant by "liberty of arteries"?"Osteopathy seeks to obtain perfect skeletal alignment and tonic
ligamentous, muscular and facial relaxation."Some Osteopaths and other
therapeutic reformers (?)have contended that medical men purposely used
"big words" and Latin names to confound the laity.What must we think of
the one just given as a popular definition?A good many Osteopaths are becoming disgusted with the big words,
technical terms and "high-sounding nothings" used by so many Osteopathic
writers.The limit of this was never reached, however, until an A.B.,
Ph.D., D.O.wrote an article to elucidate Osteopathy for the general
public in an American encyclopedia.It takes scholarly wisdom to simplify
great truths and bring them to the comprehension of ordinary minds.If
writers for the medical profession want a lesson in the art of simplifying
and popularizing therapeutic science, they should study this article on
Osteopathy in the encyclopedia.A brief history of Osteopathy is perhaps in place.The following summary
is taken from leading Osteopathic journals.As to the personality and
motives of its founders I know but little; of the motives of its leading
promoters a candid public must be the judge.But judgment should be
withheld until all the truth is known.The principles of Osteopathy were discovered by Dr.He was at that time a physician of the old school practicing in
Kansas.His father, brothers and uncles were all medical practitioners.He
was at one time scout surgeon under General Fremont.During the Civil War
he was surgeon in the Union army in a volunteer corps.It was during the
war that he began to lose faith in drugs, and to search for something
natural in combating disease.Then began a long struggle with poverty and abuse.He was obstructed by
his profession and ridiculed by his friends.Fifteen years after the
discovery of Osteopathy found Dr.Still located in the little town of
Kirksville, Mo., where he had gradually attracted a following who had
implicit faith in his power to heal by what to them seemed mysterious
movements.His fame spread beyond the town, and chronic sufferers began to turn
toward Kirksville as a Mecca of healing.Others began to desire Still's
healing powers.In 1892 the American School of Osteopathy was founded,
which from a small beginning has grown until the present buildings and
equipment cost more than $100,000.Hundreds of students are graduated
yearly from this school, and large, well-equipped schools have been
founded in Des Moines, Philadelphia, Boston and California, with a number
of schools of greater or less magnitude scattered in other parts of the
country.More than four thousand Osteopaths were in the field in 1907, and
this number is being augmented every year by a larger number of physicians
than are graduated from Homeopathic colleges, according to Osteopathic
reports.About thirty-five States have given Osteopathy more or less favorable
legal recognition.The discussion of the subject of Osteopathy is of very grave importance.Important to practitioners of the old schools of medicine for reasons I
shall give further on, and of vital importance to the thousands of men and
women who have chosen Osteopathy as their life work.It is even of greater
importance in another sense to the people who are called upon to decide
which system is right, and which school they ought to rely upon when their
lives are at stake.I shall try to speak advisedly and conservatively, as I wish to do no one
injustice.I should be sorry indeed to speak a word that might hinder the
cause of truth and progress.I started out to tell of all that prevents
the sway of truth and honesty in therapeutics.I should come far short of
telling all if I omitted the inconsistencies of this "new science" of
healing that dares to assume the responsibility for human life, and makes
bold to charge that time-tried systems, with their tens of thousands of
practitioners, are wrong, and that the right remedy, or the best remedy
for disease has been unknown through all these years until the coming of
Osteopathy.And further dares to make the still more serious charge that
since the truth has been brought to light, the majority of medical men are
so blinded by prejudice or ignorance that they _will_ not see.This is not the first time I have spoken about inconsistencies in the
practice of Osteopathy.I saw so much of it in a leading Osteopathic
college that when I had finished I could not conscientiously proclaim
myself as an exponent of a "complete and well-rounded system of healing,
adequate for every emergency," as Osteopathy is heralded to be by the
journals published for "Osteopathic physicians" to scatter broadcast among
the people.I practiced Osteopathy for three years, but only as an
Osteopathic specialist.I never during that time accepted responsibility
for human life when I did not feel sure that I could do as much for the
case as any other might do with other means or some other system.Because I practiced as a specialist and would not claim that Osteopathy
would cure everything that any other means might cure, I have never been
called a good disciple of the new science by my brethren.I would not
practice as a grafter, find bones dislocated and "subluxated," and tell
people that they must take two or three months' treatment at twenty-five
dollars per month, to have one or two "subluxations" corrected.In
consequence I was never overwhelmed by the golden stream of prosperity the
literature that made me a convert had assured me would be forthcoming to
all "Osteopathic physicians" of even ordinary ability.As I said, this is not the first time I have spoken of the inconsistencies
of Osteopathy.While yet in active practice I became so disgusted with
some of the shams and pretences that I wrote a long letter to the editor
of an Osteopathic journal published for the good of the profession.This
editor, a bright and capable man, wrote me a nice letter in reply, in
which he agreed with me about quackery and incompetency in our profession.He did not publish the letter I wrote, or express his honest sentiments,
as I had hoped he might.If what I wrote to that editor was the truth, as
he acknowledged in private, it is time the public knew something of it.I
believe, also, that many of the large number of Osteopaths who have been
discouraged or disgusted, and quit the practice, will approve what I am
writing.There is another class of Osteopathic practitioners who, I
believe, will welcome the truth I have to tell.This consists of the large
number of men and women who are practicing Osteopathy as standing for all
that makes up rational physio-therapy.Speaking of those who have quit the practice of Osteopathy, I will say
that they are known by the Osteopathic faculties to be a large and growing
number.Yet Osteopathic literature sent to prospective students tells of
the small per cent.It may not be
known how many fail, but it is known that many have quit.A journey half across one of our Western States disclosed one Osteopath in
the meat business, one in the real estate business, one clerking in a
store, and two, a blind man and his wife, fairly prosperous Osteopathic
physicians.This was along one short line of railroad, and there is no
reason why it may not be taken as a sample of the percentage of those who
have quit in the entire country.I heard three years ago from a bright young man who graduated with honors,
started out with luxurious office rooms in a flourishing city, and was
pointed to as an example of the prosperity that comes to the Osteopath
from the very start.When I heard from him last he was advance
bill-poster for a cheap show.Another bright classmate was carrying a
chain for surveyors in California.I received an Osteopathic journal recently containing a list of names,
about eight hundred of them, of "mossbacks," as we were politely called.I
say "we," for my name was on the list.The journal said these were the
names of Osteopaths whose addresses were lost and no communication could
be had with them.Just for what, aside
from the annual fee to the American Osteopathic Association, was not
clear.I do know what the silence of a good many of them meant.They have quit,
and do not care to read the abuse that some of the Osteopathic journals
are continually heaping upon those who do not keep their names on the
"Who's Who in Osteopathy" list.There is a large percentage of failures in other professions, and it is
not strange that there should be some in Osteopathy.But when Osteopathic
journals dwell upon the large chances of success and prosperity for those
who choose Osteopathy as a profession, those who might become students
should know the other side.THE OSTEOPATHIC PROPAGANDA.Wonderful Growth Claimed to Prove Merit--Osteopathy is Rational
    Physio-Therapy--Growth is in Exact Proportion to Advertising
    Received--Booklets and Journals for Gratuitous
    Distribution--Osteopathy Languishes or Flourishes by Patent Medicine
    Devices--Circular Letter from Secretary of American Osteopathic
    Association--Boosts by Governors and Senators--The Especial Protege of
    Authors--Mark Twain--Opie Reed--Emerson Hough--Sam Jones--The
    Orificial Surgeon--The M.D.Seeking Job as "Professor"--The Lure of
    "Honored Doctor" with "Big Income"--No Competition.Why has it had such a wonderful growth in
popularity?Why have nearly four thousand men and women, most of them
intelligent and some of them educated, espoused it as a profession to
follow as a life work?These are questions I shall now try to answer.Osteopathic promoters and enthusiasts claim that the wonderful growth and
popularity of Osteopathy prove beyond question its merits as a healing
system.I have already dealt at length with reasons why intelligent people
are so ready to fall victims to new systems of healing.The "perfect
adjustment," "perfect functioning" theory of Osteopathy is especially
attractive to people made ripe for some "drugless healing" system by
causes already mentioned.When Osteopathy is practiced as a combination of
all manipulations and other natural aids to the inherent recuperative
powers of the body, it will appeal to reason in such a way and bring such
good results as to make and keep friends.I am fully persuaded, and I believe the facts when presented will
establish it, that it is the physio-therapy in Osteopathy that wins and
holds the favor of intelligent people.But Osteopathy in its own name,
taught as "a well-rounded system of healing adequate for every emergency,"
has grown and spread largely as a "patent medicine" flourishes, _i.e._,
in exact proportion to the advertising it has received.I would not
presume to make this statement as merely my opinion.The question at issue
is too important to be treated as a matter of opinion.I will present
facts, and let my readers settle the point in their own minds.Every week I get booklets or "sample copies" of journals heralding the
wonderful curative powers of Osteopathy.These are published not as
journals for professional reading, but to be sold to the practitioners by
the hundreds or thousands, to be given to their patients for distribution
by these patients to their friends.The publishers of these "boosters"
say, and present testimonials to prove it, that Osteopaths find their
practice languishes or flourishes just in proportion to the numbers of
these journals and booklets they keep circulating in their communities.Here is a sample testimonial I received some time since on a postal card:

    "Gentlemen: Since using your journals more patients have come to me
    than I could treat, many of them coming from neighboring towns.Quite
    a number have had to go home without being treated, leaving their
    names so that they could be notified later, as I can get to them.Your
    booklets bring them O.The boast is often made that Osteopathy is growing in spite of bitter
opposition and persecution, and is doing it on its merits--doing it
because "Truth is mighty and will prevail."At one time I honestly
believed this to be true, but I have been convinced by highest Osteopathic
authority that it is not true.As some of that proof here is an extract
from a circular letter from the secretary of the American Osteopathic
Association:

    "Now, Doctor, we feel that you have the success of Osteopathy at
    heart, and if you realize the activity and complete organization of
    the American Medical Association and their efforts to curb our
    limitations, and do not become a member of this Association, which
    stands opposed to the efforts of the big monopoly, we must believe
    that you are not familiar with the earnestness of the A. O. A. and its
    efforts.We must work in harmonious accord and with an organized
    purpose._When we rest on our oars the death knell begins to sound._
    Can you not see that unless you co-operate with your
    fellow-practitioners in this national effort you are _sounding your
    own limitations_?"This from the _secretary_ of the American Osteopathic Association, when we
have boasted of superior equipment for intelligent physicians.Incidentally we pause to make excuse for the expressions: "Curbing our
limitations" and "sounding your own limitations."But does the idea that when we quit working as an organized body "_our
death knell begins to sound_," indicate that Osteopathic leaders are
content to trust the future of Osteopathy to its merits?If Osteopathic promoters do not feel that the life of their science
depends on boosting, what did the secretary of the A.O.A.mean when he
said, "Upon the success of these efforts depends the weal or woe of
Osteopathy as an independent system"?If truth always grows under
persecution, how can the American Medical Association kill Osteopathy when
it is so well known by the people?Nearly four thousand Osteopaths are scattered in thirty-six States where
they have some legal recognition, and they are treating thousands of
invalids every day.If they are performing the wonderful cures Osteopathic
journals tell of, why are we told that the welfare of the system depends
upon the noise that is made and the boosting that is done?Has it required advertising to keep people using anesthetics since it was
demonstrated that they would prevent pain?Has it required boosting to keep the people resorting to surgery since the
benefits of modern operations have been proved?Does it look as if Osteopathy has been standing or advancing on its
merits?Does it not seem that Osteopathy, as a complete system, is mostly
a _name_, and "lives, moves, and has its being" in boosting?It seems to
have been about the best boosted fad ever fancied by a foolish people.Osteopathic journals have
published again and again the nice things a number of governors said when
they signed the bills investing Osteopathy with the dignity of State
authority.A certain United States senator from Ohio has won more notoriety as a
champion of Osteopathy than he has lasting fame as a statesman.Osteopathy has been the especial protege of authors.Mark Twain once went
up to Albany and routed an army of medical lobbyists who were there to
resist the passage of a bill favorable to Osteopathy.For this heroic deed
Mark is better known to Osteopaths to-day than even for his renowned
history of Huckleberry Finn.He is in danger of losing his reputation as a
champion of the "under dog in the fight."Lately he has gone on the
warpath again.This time to annihilate poor Mother Eddy and her fond
delusion.Opie Reed is a delightful writer while he sticks to the portrayal of droll
Southern character.Ella Wheeler Wilcox is admirable for the beauty and
boldness with which she portrays the passions and emotions of humanity.But they are both better known to Osteopaths for the bouquets they have
tossed at Osteopathy than for their profound human philosophy that used to
be promulgated by the _Chicago American_.Emerson Hough gave a little free advertising in his "Heart's Desire."There may have been "method in his madness," for that Osteopathic horse
doctoring scene no doubt sold many a book for the author.Sam Jones also helped along with some of his striking originality.Sam
said, "There is as much difference between Osteopathy and massage as
between playing a piano and currying a horse."The idea of comparing the
Osteopath's manipulations of the human body to the skilled touch of the
pianist upon his instrument was especially pleasing to Osteopaths.However, Sam displayed about the same comprehension of his subject that
preachers usually exhibit who try to say nice things about the doctors
when they get their doctoring gratis or at reduced rates.These champions of Osteopathy no doubt mean well.They can be excused on
the ground that they got out of place to aid in the cause of "struggling
truth."But what shall we say of medical men, some of them of reputation
and great influence, who uphold and champion new systems under such
conditions that it is questionable whether they do it from principle or
policy?Osteopathic journals have made much of an article written by a famous
"orificial surgeon."The article appears on the first page of a leading
Osteopath journal, and is headed, "An Expert Opinion on Osteopathy."Among
the many good things he says of the "new science" is this: "The full
benefit of a single sitting can be secured in from three to ten minutes
instead of an hour or more, as required by massage."I shall discuss the
time of an average Osteopathic treatment further on, but I should like to
see how long this brother would hold his practice if he were an Osteopath
and treated from three to ten minutes.He also says that "Osteopathy is so beneficial to cases of insanity that
it seems quite probable that this large class of terrible sufferers may be
almost emancipated from their hell."I shall also say more further on of
what I know of Osteopathy's record as an insanity cure.There is this
significant thing in connection with this noted specialist's boost for
Osteopathy.The journal printing this article comments on it in another
number; tells what a great man the specialist is, and incidentally lets
Osteopaths know that if any of them want to add a knowledge of "orificial
surgery" to their "complete science," this doctor is the man from whom to
get it, as he is the "great and only" in his specialty, and is big and
broad enough to appreciate Osteopathy.The most despicable booster of any new system of therapeutics is the
physician who becomes its champion to get a job as "professor" in one of
its colleges.Of course it is a strong temptation to a medical man who has
never made much of a reputation in his own profession.You may ask, "Have there been many such medical men?"Consult the faculty
rolls of the colleges of these new sciences, and you will be surprised, no
doubt, to find how many put M.D.Some of these were honest converts to the system, perhaps.Some wanted
the honor of being "Professor Doctor," maybe, and some may have been lured
by the same bait that attracts so many students into Osteopathic colleges.That is, the positive assurance of "plenty of easy money" in it.One who has studied the real situation in an effort to learn why
Osteopathy has grown so fast as a profession, can hardly miss the
conclusion that advertising keeps the grist of students pouring into
Osteopathic mills.There is scarcely a corner of the United States that
their seductive literature does not reach.Practitioners in the field are
continually reminded by the schools from which they graduated that their
alma mater looks largely to their solicitations to keep up the supply of
recruits.Their advertising, the tales of wonderful cures and big money made, appeal
to all classes.It seems that none are too scholarly and none too ignorant
to become infatuated with the idea of becoming an "honored doctor" with a
"big income."College professors and preachers have been lured from
comfortable positions to become Osteopaths.Shrewd traveling men, seduced
by the picture of a permanent home, have left the road to become
Osteopathic physicians and be "rich and honored."To me, when a student of Osteopathy, it was
pathetic and almost tragic to observe the crowds of men and women who had
been seduced from spheres of drudging usefulness, such as clerking,
teaching, barbering, etc., to become money-making doctors.In their old
callings they had lost all hope of gratifying ambition for fame and
fortune, but were making an honest living.The rosy pictures of honor,
fame and twenty dollars per day, that the numerous Osteopathic circulars
and journals painted, were not to be withstood.These circulars told them that the fields into which they might go and
reap that $20 per day were unlimited.They said: "There are dozens of
ministers ready to occupy each vacant pulpit, and as many applicants for
each vacancy in the schools.Each hamlet has four or five doctors, where
it can support but one.The legal profession is filled to the starving
point.Young licentiates in the older professions all have to pass through
a starving time.The
picture was a rosy dream of triumphant success!When they had mastered the
great science and become "Doctors of Osteopathy," the world was waiting
with open arms and pocketbooks to receive them.THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OSTEOPATHY.Infallible, Touch-the-Button System that Always Cured--Indefinite
    Movements and Manipulations--Wealth of Undeveloped Scientific
    Facts--Osteopaths Taking M.D.Course--The Standpatter and the
    Drifter--The "Lesionist"--"Bone Setting"--"Inhibiting a
    Center"--Chiropractics--"Finest Anatomists in the World"--How to Cure
    Torticollis, Goitre and Enteric Troubles--A Successful
    Osteopath--Timid Old Maids--Osteopathic Philanthropy.Many of them were men and women
with gray heads, who had found themselves stranded at a time of life when
they should have been able to retire on a competency.They had staked
their little all on this last venture, and what was before them if they
should fail heaven only knew.How eagerly they looked forward to the time
when they should have struggled through the lessons in anatomy, chemistry,
physiology, symptomatology and all the rest, and should be ready to
receive the wonderful principles of Osteopathy they were to apply in
performing the miraculous cures that were to make them wealthy and famous.Need I tell the physician who was a conscientious student of anatomy in
his school days, that there was disappointment when the time came to enter
the class in "theory and practice" of Osteopathy?There had been vague ideas of a systematized, infallible, touch-the-button
system that _always_ cured.Instead, we were instructed in a lot of
indefinite movements and manipulations that somehow left us speculating as
to just how much of it all was done for effect.We had heard so often that Osteopathy was a complete satisfying science
_that did things specifically_!Now it began to dawn upon us that there
was indeed a "wealth of undeveloped scientific facts" in Osteopathy, as
those glittering circulars had said when they thought to attract young men
ambitious for original research.They had said, "Much yet remains to be
discovered."Some of us wondered if the "undeveloped" and "undiscovered"
scientific facts were not the main constituents of the "science."The students expected something exact and tangible, and how eagerly they
grasped at anything in the way of bringing quick results in curing the
sick.If Osteopathy is so complete, why did so many students, after they had
received everything the learned (?)professors had to impart, procure
Juettner's "Modern Physio-Therapy" and Ling's "Manual Therapy" and Rosse's
"Cures Without Drugs" and Kellogg's work on "Hydrotherapy"?They felt that
they needed all they could get.It was customary for the students to begin "treating" after they had been
in school a few months, and medical men will hardly be surprised to know
that they worked with more faith in their healing powers and performed
more wonderful (?)cures in their freshman year than they ever did
afterward.I have in mind a student, one of the brightest I ever met, who read a
cheap book on Osteopathic practice, went into a community where he was
unknown, and practiced as an Osteopathic physician.In a few months he had
made enough money to pay his way through an Osteopathic college, which he
entered professing to believe that Osteopathy would cure all the ills
flesh is heir to, but which he left two years later to take a medical
course.degree, but I notice that it is his M.D.Can students be blamed for getting a little weak in faith when men who
told them that the great principles of Osteopathy were sufficient to cure
_everything_, have been known to backslide so far as to go and take
medical courses themselves?How do you suppose it affects students of an Osteopathic college to read
in a representative journal that the secretary of their school, and the
greatest of all its boosters, calls medical men into his own family when
there is sickness in it?There are many men and women practicing to-day who try to be honest and
conscientious, and by using all the good in Osteopathy, massage, Swedish
movements, hydrotherapy, and all the rest of the adjuncts of
physio-therapy, do a great deal of good.The practitioner who does use
these agencies, however, is denounced by the stand-patters as a "drifter."They say he is not a true Osteopath, but a mongrel who is belittling the
great science.That circular letter from the secretary of the American
Osteopathic Association said that one of the greatest needs of
organization was to preserve Osteopathy in its primal purity as it came
from its founder, A. T. Still.If our medical brethren and the laity could read some of the acrimonious
discussions on the question of using adjuncts, they would certainly be
impressed with the exactness (?)There is one idea of Osteopathy that even the popular mind has grasped,
and that is that it is essentially finding "lesions" and correcting them.Yet the question has been very prominent and pertinent among Osteopaths:
"Are you a lesion Osteopath?"Think of it, gentlemen, asking an Osteopath
if he is a "lesionist"!Yet there are plenty of Osteopaths who are stupid
enough (or honest enough) not to be able to find bones "subluxed" every
time they look at a patient.Practitioners who really want to do their
patrons good will use adjuncts even if they are denounced by the
stand-patters.I believe every conscientious Osteopath must sometimes feel that it is
safer to use rational remedies than to rely on "bone setting," or
"inhibiting a center," but for the grafter it is not so spectacular and
involves more hard work.The stand-patters of the American Osteopathic Association have not
eliminated all trouble when they get Osteopaths to stick to the "bone
setting, inhibiting" idea.The chiropractic man threatens to steal their
thunder here.The Chiropractor has found that when it comes to using
mysterious maneuvers and manipulations as bases for mind cure, one thing
is about as good as another, except that the more mysterious a thing
looks the better it works.So the Chiropractor simply gives his healing
"thrusts" or his wonderful "adjustments," touches the buttons along the
spine as it were, when--presto!disease has flown before his healing touch
and blessed health has come to reign instead!The Osteopath denounces the Chiropractor as a brazen fraud who has stolen
all that is good in Chiropractics (if there _is_ anything good) from
Osteopathy.But Chiropractics follows so closely what the "old liner"
calls the true theory of Osteopathy that, between him and the drifter who
gives an hour of crude massage, or uses the forbidden accessories, the
true Osteopath has a hard time maintaining the dignity (?)of Osteopathy
and keeping its practitioners from drifting.Some of the most ardent supporters of true Osteopathy I have ever known
have drifted entirely away from it.After practicing two or three years,
abusing medicine and medical men all the time, and proclaiming to the
people continually that they had in Osteopathy all that a sick world could
ever need, it is suddenly learned that the "Osteopath is gone."He has
"silently folded his tent and stolen away," and where has he gone?He has
gone to a medical college to study that same medicine he has so
industriously abused while he was gathering in the shekels as an
Osteopath.Going to learn and practice the science he has so persistently
denounced as a fraud and a curse to humanity.The intelligent, conscientious Osteopath who dares to brave the scorn of
the stand-patter and use all the legitimate adjuncts of Osteopathy found
in physio-therapy, may do a great deal of good as a physician.I have
found many physicians willing to acknowledge this, and even recommend the
services of such an Osteopath when physio-therapy was indicated.When a physician, however, meets a fellow who claims to have in his
Osteopathy a wonderful system, complete and all-sufficient to cope with
any and all diseases, and that his system is founded on a knowledge of the
relation and function of the various parts and organs of the body such as
no other school of therapeutics has ever been able to discover, then he
knows that he has met a man of the same mental and moral calibre as the
shyster in his own school.He knows he has met a fellow who is exploiting
a thing, that may be good in its way and place, as a graft.And he knows
that this grafter gets his wonderful cures largely as any other quack gets
his; the primary effects of his "scientific manipulations" are on the
minds of those treated.The intelligent physician knows that the Osteopath got his boastedly
superior knowledge of anatomy mostly from the same text-books and same
class of cadavers that other physicians had to master if they graduated
from a reputable school.All that talk we have heard so much about the
Osteopaths being the "finest anatomists in the world" sounds plausible,
and is believed by the laity generally.The quotation I gave above has been much used in Osteopathic literature
as coming from an eminent medical man.What foundation is there for such a
belief?The Osteopath _may_ be a good anatomist.He has about the same
opportunities to learn anatomy the medical student has.If he is a good
and conscientious student he may consider his anatomy of more importance
than does the medical student who is not expecting to do much surgery.If
he is a natural shyster and shirk he can get through a course in
Osteopathy and get his diploma, and this diploma may be about the only
proof he could ever give that he is a "superior anatomist."Great stress has always been laid by Osteopaths upon the amount of study
and research done by their students on the cadaver.I want to give you
some specimens of the learning of the man (an M.D.)who presided over the
dissecting-room when I pursued my "profound research" on the "lateral
half."This great man, whose superior knowledge of anatomy, I presume,
induced by the wise management of the college to employ him as a
demonstrator, in an article written for the organ of the school expresses
himself thus:

    "It is needless to say that the first impression of an M. D. would not
    be favorable to Osteopathy, because he has spent years fixing in his
    mind that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it, but
    give a man morphine or something of the same character with an
    external blister or hot application and in a week or ten days he would
    be all right.In the meanwhile watch the patient's general health,
    relieve the induced constipation by suitable means and rearrange what
    he has disarranged in his treatment.On the other hand, let the
    Osteopath get hold of this patient, and with his _vast_ and we might
    say _perfect_ knowledge of anatomy, he at once, with no other tools
    than his hands, inhibits the nerves supplying the affected parts, and
    in five minutes the patient can freely move his head and shoulders,
    entirely relieved from pain.Would
    he not feel like wiping off the earth with all the Osteopaths?Doctor,
    with your medical education a course in Osteopathy would teach you
    that it is not necessary to subject your patients to myxedema by
    removing the thyroid gland to cure goitre.You would not have to lie
    awake nights studying means to stop one of those troublesome bowel
    complaints in children, nor to insist upon the enforced diet in
    chronic diarrhea, and a thousand other things which are purely
    physiological and are not done by any magical presto change, but by
    methods which are perfectly rational if you will only listen long
    enough to have them explained to you.I will agree that at first
    impression all methods look alike to the medical man, but when
    explained by an intelligent teacher they will bring their just
    reward."Gentlemen of the medical profession, study the above
carefully--punctuation, composition, profound wisdom and all.Surely you
did not read it when it was given to the world a few years ago, or you
would all have been converted to Osteopathy then, and the medical
profession left desolate.We have heard many bad things of medical men,
but never (until we learned it from one who was big-brained enough to
accept Osteopathy when its great truths dawned upon him) did we know that
you are so dull of intellect that it takes you "years to fix in your minds
that if you had a bad case of torticollis not to touch it but to give a
man morphine."And how pleased Osteopaths are to learn from this scholar that the
Osteopath can "take hold" of a case of torticollis, "and with his vast and
we might say perfect knowledge of anatomy" inhibit the nerves and have the
man cured in five minutes.We were glad to learn this great truth from
this learned ex-M.D., as we never should have known, otherwise, that
Osteopathy is so potent.I have had cases of torticollis in my practice, and thought I had done
well if after a half hour of hard work massaging contracted muscles I had
benefited the case.And note the relevancy of these questions, "Would not the medical man be
angry?Would he not feel like wiping off the earth all the Osteopaths?"Gentlemen, can you explain your ex-brother's meaning here?Surely you are
not all so hard-hearted that you would be angry because a poor wry-necked
fellow had been cured in five minutes.To be serious, I ask you to think of "the finest anatomists in the world"
doing their "original research" work in the dissecting-room under the
direction of a man of the scholarly attainments indicated by the
composition and thought of the above article.Do you see now how
Osteopaths get a "vast and perfect knowledge of anatomy"?Do you suppose that the law of "the survival of the fittest" determines
who continues in the practice of Osteopathy and succeeds?Is it true worth
and scholarly ability that get a big reputation of success among medical
men?I know, and many medical men know from competition with him (if they
would admit that such a fellow may be a competitor), that the ignoramus
who as a physician is the product of a diploma mill often has a bigger
reputation and performs more wonderful cures (?)than the educated
Osteopath who really mastered the prescribed course but is too
conscientious to assume responsibility for human life when he is not sure
that he can do all that might be done to save life.I once met an Osteopath whose literary attainments had never reached the
rudiments of an education.He had never really comprehended a single
lesson of his entire course.He told me that he was then on a vacation to
get much-needed rest.He had such a large practice that the physical labor
of it was wearing him out.I knew of this fellow's qualifications, but I
thought he might be one of those happy mortals who have the faculty of
"doing things," even if they cannot learn the theory.To learn the secret
of this fellow's success, if I could, I let him treat me.I had some
contracted muscles that were irritating nerves and holding joints in tense
condition, a typical case, if there are any, for an Osteopathic treatment.I expected him to do some of that
"expert Osteopathic diagnosing" that you have heard of, but he began in an
aimless desultory way, worked almost an hour, found nothing specific, did
nothing but give me a poor unsystematic massage.He was giving me a
"popular treatment."In many towns people have come to estimate the value of an Osteopathic
treatment by its duration.People used to say to me, "You don't treat as
long as Dr.----, who was here before you," and say it in a way indicating
that they were hardly satisfied they had gotten their money's worth.Some
of them would say: "He treated me an hour for seventy-five cents."Does it
seem funny to talk of adjusting lesions on one person for an hour at a
time, three times a week?My picture of incompetency and apparent success of incompetents, is not
overdrawn.The other day I had a marked copy of a local paper from a town
in California.It was a flattering write-up of an old classmate.The
doctor's automobile was mentioned, and he had marked with a cross a fine
auto shown in a picture of the city garage.This fellow had been
considered by all the Simple Simon of the class, inferior in almost every
attribute of true manliness, yet now he flourishes as one of those of our
class to whose success the school can "point with pride."It is interesting to read the long list of "changes of location" among
Osteopaths, yet between the lines there is a sad story that may be read.First, "Doctor Blank has located
in Philadelphia, with twenty-five patients for the first month and rapidly
growing practice."A year or so after another item tells that "Doctor
Blank has located in San Francisco with bright prospects."Then "Doctor
Blank has returned to Missouri on account of his wife's health, and
located in ----, where he has our best wishes for success."Their career
reminds us of Goldsmith's lines:

  "As the hare whom horn and hounds pursue
  Pants to the place from whence at first he flew."There has been many a tragic scene enacted upon the Osteopathic stage, but
the curtain has not been raised for the public to behold them.How many
timid old maids, after saving a few hundred dollars from wages received
for teaching school, have been persuaded that they could learn Osteopathy
while their shattered nerves were repaired and they were made young and
beautiful once more by a course of treatment in the clinics of the school.Then they would be ready to go out to occupy a place of dignity and honor,
and treat ten to thirty patients per month at twenty-five dollars per
patient.Gentlemen of the medical profession, from what you know of the aggressive
spirit that it takes to succeed in professional life to-day (to say
nothing of the physical strength required in the practice of Osteopathy),
what per cent.of these timid old maids do you suppose have "panted to the
place from whence at first they flew," after leaving their pitiful little
savings with the benefactors of humanity who were devoting their splendid
talents to the cause of Osteopathy?If any one doubts that some Osteopathic schools are conducted from other
than philanthropic motives, let him read what the _Osteopathic Physician_
said of a new school founded in California.Of all the fraud, bare-faced
shystering, and flagrant rascality ever exposed in any profession, the
circumstances of the founding of this school, as depicted by the editor of
the _Osteopathic Physician_, furnishes the most disgusting instance.Men
to whom we had clung when the anchor of our faith in Osteopathy seemed
about to drag were held up before us as sneaking, cringing, incompetent
rascals, whose motives in founding the school were commercial in the worst
sense.And how do you suppose Osteopaths out in the field of practice feel
when they receive catalogues from the leading colleges that teach their
system, and these catalogues tell of the superior education the colleges
are equipped to give, and among the pictures of learned members of the
faculty they recognize the faces of old schoolmates, with glasses, pointed
beards and white ties, silk hats maybe, but the same old classmate
of--sometimes not ordinary ability.I spoke a moment ago of old maids being induced to believe that they would
be made over in the clinics of an Osteopathic college.An Osteopathic journal before me says: "If it were generally
known that Osteopathy has a wonderfully rejuvenating effect upon fading
beauty, Osteopathic physicians would be overworked as beauty doctors."Another journal says: "If the aged could know how many years might be
added to their lives by Osteopathy, they would not hesitate to avail
themselves of treatment."A leading D. O. discusses consumption as treated Osteopathically, and
closes his discussion with the statement in big letters: "CONSUMPTION CAN
BE CURED."Another Osteopathic doctor says the curse that was placed upon Mother Eve
in connection with the propagation of the race has been removed by
Osteopathy, and childbirth "positively painless" is a consummated fact.The insane emancipated from
their hell!Asthma
cured by moving a bone!What more in therapeutics is left to be desired?CHAPTER X.

OSTEOPATHY AS RELATED TO SOME OTHER FAKES.Sure Shot Rheumatism Cure--Regular Practitioner's
    Discomfiture--Medicines Alone Failed to Cure Rheumatism--Osteopathy
    Relieves Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains--"Move Things"--"Pop" Stray
    Cervical Vertebrae--Find Something Wrong and Put it Right--Terrible
    Neck-Wrenching, Bone-Twisting Ordeal.A discussion of graft in connection with doctoring would not be complete
if nothing were said about the traveling medicine faker.Every summer our
towns are visited by smooth-tongued frauds who give free shows on the
streets.They harangue the people by the hour with borrowed spiels, full
of big medical terms, and usually full of abuse of regular practitioners,
which local physicians must note with humiliation is too often received by
people without resentment and often with applause.Only last summer I was standing by while one of these grafters was making
his spiel, and gathering dollars by the pocketful for a "sure shot"
rheumatism cure.His was a _sure_ cure, doubly guaranteed; no cure, money
all refunded (if you could get it).A physician standing near laughed
rather a mirthless laugh, and remarked that Barnum was right when he said,
"The American people like to be humbugged."When the medical man left, a
man who had just become the happy possessor of enough of the wonderful
herb to make a quart of the rheumatism router, remarked: "He couldn't be a
worse humbug than that old duffer.He doctored me for six weeks, and told
me all the time that his medicine would cure me in a few days.I got worse
all the time until I went to Dr.----, who told me to use a sack of hot
bran mash on my back, and I was able to get around in two days."In this man's remarks there is an explanation of the reason the crowd
laughed when they heard the quack abusing the regular practitioner, and of
the reason the people handed their hard-earned dollars to the grafter at
the rate of forty in ten minutes, by actual count.If all doctors were
honest and told the people what all authorities have agreed upon about
rheumatism, _i.e._, that internal medication does it little good, and the
main reliance must be on external application, traveling and patent
medicine fakers who make a specialty of rheumatism cure would be "put out
of business," and there would be eliminated one source of much loss of
faith in medicine.I learned by experience as an Osteopath that many people lose faith in
medicine and in the honesty of physicians because of the failure of
medicine to cure rheumatism where the physician had promised a cure.Patients afflicted with other diseases get well anyway, or the sexton puts
them where they cannot tell people of the physician's failure to cure
them.The rheumatic patient lives on, and talks on of "Doc's" failure to
stop his rheumatic pains.All doctors know that rheumatism is the
universal disease of our fickle climate.If it were not for rheumatic
pains, and neuralgic pains that often come from nerves irritated by
contracted muscles, the Osteopath in the average country town would get
more lonesome than he does.People who are otherwise skeptical concerning
the merits of Osteopathy will admit that it seems rational treatment for
rheumatism.Yet this is a disease that Osteopathy of the specific-adjustment,
bone-setting, nerve-inhibiting brand has little beneficial effect upon.All the Osteopathic treatments I ever gave or saw given in cases of
rheumatism that really did any good, were long, laborious massages.The
medical man who as "professor" in an Osteopathic college said, "When the
Osteopath with his _vast_ knowledge of anatomy gets hold of a case of
torticollis he inhibits the nerves and cures it in five minutes," was
talking driveling rot.I have seen some of the best Osteopaths treat wry-neck, and the work they
did was to knead and stretch and pull, which by starting circulation and
working out soreness, gradually relieved the patient.A hot application,
by expanding tissues and stimulating circulation, would have had the same
effect, perhaps more slowly manifested.To call any Osteopathic treatment massage is always resented as an insult
by the guardians of the science.What is the Osteopath doing, who rolls
and twists and pulls and kneads for a full hour, if he isn't giving a
massage treatment?Of course, it sounds more dignified, and perhaps helps
to "preserve the purity of Osteopathy as a separate system," to call it
"reducing subluxations," "correcting lesions," "inhibiting and
stimulating" nerves.The treatment also acts better as a placebo to call
it by these names.As students we were taught that all Osteopathic movements were primarily
to adjust something.Some of us worried for fear we wouldn't know when the
adjusting was complete.We were told that all the movements we were taught
to make were potent to "move things," so we worried again for fear we
might move something in the wrong direction.We were assured, however,
that since the tendency was always toward the normal, all we had to do was
to agitate, stir things up a bit, and the thing out of place would find
its place.We were told that when in the midst of our "agitation" we heard something
"pop," we could be sure the thing out of place had gone back.When a
student had so mastered the great bone-setting science as to be able to
"pop" stray cervical vertebrae he was looked upon with envy by the fellows
who had not joined the association for protection against suits for
malpractice, and did not know just how much of an owl they could make of a
man and not break his neck.The fellow who lacked clairvoyant powers to locate straying things, and
could not always find the "missing link" of the spine, could go through
the prescribed motions just the same.If he could do it with sufficient
facial contortions to indicate supreme physical exertion, and at the same
time preserve the look of serious gravity and professional importance of a
quack medical doctor giving _particular_ directions for the dosing of the
placebo he is leaving, he might manage to make a sound vertebra "pop."This, with his big show of doing something, has its effect on the
patient's mind anyway.We were taught that Osteopathy was applied common sense, that it was all
reasonable and rational, and simply meant "finding something wrong and
putting it right."Some of us thought it only fair to tell our patients
what we were trying to do, and what we did it for.There is where we made
our big mistake.To say we were relaxing muscles, or trying to lift and
tone up a rickety chest wall, or straighten a warped spine, was altogether
too simple.It was like telling a man that you were going to give him a
dose of oil for the bellyache when he wanted an operation for
appendicitis.It was too common, and some would go to an Osteopath who
could find vertebra and ribs and hips displaced, something that would make
the community "sit up and take notice."If one has to be sick, why not
have something worth while?Where Osteopathy has always been so administered that people have the idea
that it means to find things out of place and put them back, it is a
gentleman's job, professional, scientific and genteel.Men have been known
to give twenty to forty treatments a day at two dollars per treatment.In
many communities, however, the adjustment idea has so degenerated that to
give an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a high collar on a hot day.To
strip a hard-muscled, two-hundred-pound laborer down to a
perspiration-soaked and scented undershirt, and manipulate him for an hour
while he has every one of his five hundred work-hardened muscles rigidly
set to protect himself from the terrible neck-wrenching, bone-twisting
ordeal he has been told an Osteopathic treatment would subject him to--I
say when you have tried that sort of a thing for an hour you will conclude
that an Osteopathic treatment is no job for a kid-gloved dandy nor for a
lily-fingered lady, as it has been so glowingly pictured.I know the brethren will say that true Osteopathy does not give an hour's
shotgun treatment, but finds the lesion, corrects it, collects its two
dollars, and quits until "day after to-morrow," when it "corrects" and
_collects_ again as long as there is anything to co--llect!I practiced for three years in a town where people made their first
acquaintance with Osteopathy through the treatments of a man who
afterwards held the position of demonstrator of Osteopathic "movements"
and "manipulations" in one of the largest and boastedly superior schools
of Osteopathy.The people certainly should have received correct ideas of
Osteopathy from him.He was followed in the town by a bright young fellow
from "Pap's" school, where the genuine "lesion," blown-in-the-bottle brand
of Osteopathy has always been taught.This fellow was such an excellent
Osteopath that he made enough money in two years to enable him to quit
Osteopathy forever.This he did, using the money he had gathered as an
Osteopath to take him through a medical college.I followed these two shining lights who I supposed had established
Osteopathy on a correct basis.I started in to give specific treatments as
I had been taught to do; that is, to hunt for the lesion, correct it if I
found it, and quit, even if I had not been more than fifteen or twenty
minutes at it.I found that in many cases my patients were not satisfied.I did not know just what was the matter at first, and lost some desirable
patients (lost their patronage, I mean--they were not in much danger of
dying when they came to me).I was soon enlightened, however, by some more
outspoken than the rest.They said I did not "treat as long as that other
doctor," and when I had done what I thought was indicated at times a
patient would say, "You didn't give me that neck-twisting movement," or
that "leg-pulling treatment."No matter what I thought was indicated, I
had to give all the movements each time that had ever been given before.A physician who has had to dose out something he knew would do no good,
just to satisfy the patient and keep him from sending for another doctor
who he feared might give something worse, can appreciate the violence done
a fellow's conscience as he administers those wonderfully curative
movements.He cannot, however, appreciate the emotions that come from the
strenuous exertion over a sweaty body in a close room on a July day.Incidentally, this difference in the physical exertion necessary to get
the same results has determined a good many to quit Osteopathy and take up
medicine.A young man who had almost completed a course in Osteopathy told
me he was going to study medicine when he had finished Osteopathy, as he
had found that giving "treatments was too d----d hard work."TAPEWORMS AND GALLSTONES.Plug-hatted Faker--Frequency of Tapeworms--Some Tricks Exposed--How
    the Defunct Worm was Passed--Rubber Near-Worm--New Gallstone
    Cure--Relation to Osteopathy--Perfect, Self-Oiling, "Autotherapeutic"
    Machine--Touch the Button--The Truth About the Consumption and
    Insanity Cures.There is another trump card the traveling medical grafter plays, which
wins about as well as the guaranteed rheumatism cure, namely, the tapeworm
fraud.Last summer I heard a plug-hatted faker delivering a lecture to a
street crowd, in which he said that every mother's son or daughter of them
who didn't have the rosy cheek, the sparkling eye and buoyancy of youth
might be sure that a tapeworm of monstrous size was, "like a worm in the
bud," feeding on their "damask cheeks."To prove his assertion and lend
terror to his tale, he held aloft a glass jar containing one of the
monsters that had been driven from its feast on the vitals of its victim
by his never-failing remedy.The person, "saved from a living death,"
stood at the "doctor's" side to corroborate the story, while his
voluptuous wife was kept busy handing out the magical remedy and "pursing
the ducats" given in return.How this one was secured I do not know; but
intelligent people ought to know that cases of tapeworm are not so common
that eight people out of every ten have one, as this grafter positively
asserted.An acquaintance once traveled with one of these tapeworm specialists to
furnish the song and dance performances that are so attractive to the
class of people who furnish the ready victims for grafters.The "specialist" would pick out an emaciated,
credulous individual from his crowd, and tell him that he bore the
unmistakable marks of being the prey of a terrible tapeworm.If he
couldn't sell him a bottle of his worm eradicator, he would give him a
bottle, telling him to take it according to directions and report to him
at his hotel or tent the next day.The man would report that no dead or
dying worm had been sighted.The man was told that if he had taken the medicine as directed the
worm was dead beyond a doubt, but sometimes the "fangs" were fastened so
firmly to the walls of the intestines, in their death agony, that they
would not come away until he had injected a certain preparation that
_always_ "produced the goods."The man was taken into a darkened room for privacy (?), the injection
given, and the defunct worm always came away.At least a worm was always
found in the evacuated material, and how was the deluded one to know that
it was in the vessel or matter injected?Of course, the patient felt
wondrous relief, and was glad to stand up that night and testify that Dr.Grafter was an angel of mercy sent to deliver him from the awful fate of
living where "the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched."I was told recently of a new tapeworm graft that makes the old one look
crude and unscientific.This one actually brings a tapeworm from the
intestines in _every_ case, whether the person had one before the magic
remedy was given or not.The graft is to have a near-worm manufactured of
delicate rubber and compressed into a capsule.The patient swallows the
capsule supposed to contain the worm destroyer.The rubber worm is not
digested, and a strong physic soon produces it, to the great relief of the
"patient" and the greater glory and profit of the shyster.What a
wonderful age of invention and scientific discoveries!Another journal tells of a new gallstone cure that never fails to cause
the stones to be passed even if they are big as walnuts.The graft in this
is that the medicine consists of paraffine dissolved in  oil.The
paraffine does not digest, but collects in  balls, which are passed
by handfuls and are excellent imitations of the real things.How about tapeworms, gallstones and Osteopathy, do you ask?We heard about tapeworms and gallstones when we were in Osteopathic
college.The one thing that was ground into us early and thoroughly was that
Osteopathy was a complete system.No matter what any other system had
done, we were to remember that Osteopathy could do that thing more surely
and more scientifically.Students soon learned that they were never to ask, "_Can_ we treat this?"That indicated skepticism, which was intolerable in the atmosphere of
optimistic faith that surrounded the freshman and sophomore classes
especially.The question was to be put, "_How_ do we treat this?"In the
treatment of worms the question was, "How do we treat worms?"Had not nature made a machine, perfect in all its parts,
self-oiling, "autotherapeutic," and all that?And would nature allow it to
choke up or slip a cog just because a little thing like a worm got tangled
in its gearing?Nature knew that worms would intrude, and had
provided her own vermifuge.The cause of worms is insufficient bile, and
behold, all the Osteopath had to do when he wished to serve notice on the
aforesaid worms to vacate the premises was to touch the button controlling
the stop-cock to the bile-duct, and they left.It was so simple and easy
we wondered how the world could have been so long finding it out.That was the proposition on which we were to
stand.If anything had to be removed, or brought back, or put in place,
all that was necessary was to open the floodgates, release the pent-up
forces of nature, and the thing was done!What a happy condition, to have _perfect_ faith!I remember a report came
to our school of an Osteopathic physician who read a paper before a
convention of his brethren, in which he recorded marvelous cures performed
in cases of tuberculosis.The paper was startling, even revolutionary, yet
it was not too much for our faith.We were almost indignant at some who
ventured to suggest that curing consumption by manipulation might be
claiming too much.These wonderful cures were performed in a town which I
afterward visited.I could find no one who knew of a single case that had
been cured.There were those who knew of cases of tuberculosis he had
treated, that had gone as most other bad cases of that disease go.It is one of the main cases, from
all that I can learn, upon which all the bold claims of Osteopathy as an
insanity cure are based.I remember an article under scare headlines big
enough for a bloody murder, flared out in the local paper.It was yet more
wonderfully heralded in the papers at the county seat.The metropolitan
dailies caught up the echo, which reverberated through Canada and was
finally heard across the seas!Osteopathic journals took it up and made
much of it.Those in school read it with eager satisfaction, and plunged
into their studies with fiercer enthusiasm.Many who had been "almost
persuaded" were induced by it to "cross the Rubicon," and take up the
study of this wonderful new science that could take a raving maniac,
condemned to a mad house by medical men, and with a few scientific twists
of the neck cause raging insanity to give place to gentle sleep that
should wake in sanity and health.Was it any wonder that students flocked to schools that professed to teach
how common plodding mortals could work such miracles?Was it strange that
anxious friends brought dear ones, over whom the black cloud of insanity
cast its shadows, hundreds of miles to be treated by this man?Or to the
Osteopathic colleges, from which, in all cases of which I ever knew, they
returned sadly disappointed?The report of that wonderful cure caused many intelligent laymen (and even
Dr.Pratt) to indulge a hope that insanity might be only a disturbance of
the blood supply to the brain caused by pressure from distorted "neck
bones," or other lesions, and that Osteopaths were to empty our
overcrowded madhouses.I
was told by an intimate friend of this great Osteopath that all these
startling reports we had supposed were published as news the papers were
glad to get because of their important truths, were but shrewd
advertising.I afterward talked with the man, and his friends who were at
the bedside when the miracle was performed, and while they believed that
there had been good done by the treatment, it was all so tame and
commonplace at home compared with its fame abroad that I have wondered
ever since if anything much was really done after all.Honesty--Plain Dealing--Education.I could multiply incidents, but it would grow
monotonous.I believe I have told enough that is disgusting to the
intelligent laity and medical men, and enough that is humiliating to the
capable, honest Osteopath, who practices his "new science" as standing for
all that is good in physio-therapy.I hope I have told, or recalled, something that will help physicians to
see that the way to clear up the turbidity existing in therapeutics to-day
is by open, honest dealing with the laity, and by a campaign of education
that shall impart to them enough of the scientific principles of medicine
so that they may know when they are being imposed upon by quacks and
grafters.I am encouraged to believe I am on the right track.After I had
written this booklet I read, in a report of the convention of the American
Medical Association held in Chicago, that one of the leaders of the
Association told his brethren that the most important work before them as
physicians was to conduct a campaign of education for the masses.It must
be done not only to protect the people, but as well to protect the honest
physician.There is another fact that faces the medical profession, and I believe I
have called attention to conditions that prove it.That is, that the hope
of the profession of "doctoring" being placed on an honest rational basis
lies in a broader and more thorough education of the physician.A broad,
liberal general education to begin with, then all that can be known about
medicine and surgery.Then all that there is in
physio-therapy, under whatsoever name, that promises to aid in curing or
preventing disease.If this humble production aids but a little in any of this great work,
then my object in writing will have been achieved.Butter from America is fifty cents a pound,
and fruits and vegetables from Cape Colony and Natal are equally high in
price and frequently unobtainable.Good board can not be obtained
anywhere for less than five dollars a day, while the best hotels and
clubs charge thrice that amount.Rentals are exceptionally high owing
to the extraordinary land values and the cost of erecting buildings.A
small, brick-lined, corrugated-iron cottage of four rooms, such as a
married mine-employee occupies, costs from fifty to seventy-five dollars
a month, while a two-story brick house in a respectable quarter of the
city rents for one hundred dollars a month.Every object in the city is mutely expressive of a vast expenditure of
money.The idea that everything--the buildings, food, horses, clothing,
machinery, and all that is to be seen--has been carried across oceans
and continents unconsciously associates itself with the cost that it has
entailed.Four-story buildings that in New York or London would be
passed without remark cause mental speculation concerning their cost,
merely because it is so patent that every brick, nail, and board in them
has been conveyed thousands of miles from foreign shores.Electric
lights and street cars, so common in American towns, appear abnormal in
the city in the veldt, and instantly suggest an outlay of great amounts
of money even to the minds which are not accustomed to reducing
everything to dollars and pounds.Leaving the densely settled centre of
the city, where land is worth as much as choice plots on Broadway, and
wandering into the suburbs where the great mines are, the idea of cost
is more firmly implanted into the mind.The huge buildings, covering
acres of ground and thousands of tons of the most costly machinery, seem
to be of natural origin rather than of human handiwork.It is almost
beyond belief that men should be daring enough to convey hundreds of
steamer loads of lumber and machinery halfway around the world at
inestimable cost merely for the yellow metal that Nature has hidden so
far distant from the great centres of population.The cosmopolitanism of the city is a feature which impresses itself most
indelibly upon the mind.In a half-day's stroll in the city
representatives of all the peoples of the earth, with the possible
exception of the American Indian, Eskimos, and South Sea islanders, will
be seen variously engaged in the struggle for gold.On the floors of the
stock exchanges are money barons or their agents, as energetic and sharp
as their prototypes of Wall and Throckmorton Streets.These are chiefly
British, French, and German.Outside, between "The Chains," are readily
discernible the distinguishing features of the Americans, Afrikanders,
Portuguese, Russians, Spaniards, and Italians.A few steps distant is
Commissioner Street, the principal thoroughfare, where the surging
throng is composed of so many different racial representatives that an
analysis of it is not an easy undertaking.He is considered an expert
who can name the native country of every man on the street, and if he
can distinguish between an American and a Canadian he is credited with
being a wise man.In the throng is the tall, well-clothed Briton, with silk hat and frock
coat, closely followed by a sparsely clad Matabele, bearing his master's
account books or golf-sticks.Near them a Chinaman, in circular
red-topped hat and flowing silk robes, is having a heated argument in
broken English with an Irish hansom-driver.Crossing the street are two
stately Arabs, in turbans and white robes, jostling easy-going Indian
coolies with their canes.Bare-headed Cingalese, their long, shiny hair
tied in knots and fastened down with circular combs, noiselessly gliding
along, or stopping suddenly to trade Oriental jewelry for Christian's
money; Malays, Turks, Egyptians, Persians, and New-Zealanders, each with
his distinctive costume; Hottentots, Matabeles, Zulus, Mashonas,
Basutos, and the representatives of hundreds of the other native races
south of the Zambezi pass by in picturesque lack of bodily adornment.It is an imposing array, too, for the majority of the throng is composed
of moderately wealthy persons, and even in the centre of Africa wealth
carries with it opportunities for display.John Chinaman will ride in a
'ricksha to his joss-house with as much conscious pride as the European
or American will sit in his brougham or automobile.Money is as easily
spent as made in Johannesburg, and it is a cosmopolitan habit to spend
it in a manner so that everybody will know it is being spent.To make a
display of some sort is necessary to the citizen's happiness.If he is
not of sufficient importance to have his name in the subsidized
newspapers daily he will seek notoriety by wearing a thousand pounds'
worth of diamonds on the street or making astonishing bets at the
race-track.In that little universe on the veldt every man tries to be
superior to his neighbour in some manner that may be patent to all the
city.When it is taken into consideration that almost all the
contestants were among the cleverest and shrewdest men in the countries
whence they came to Johannesburg, and not among the riffraff and
failures, then the intensity of the race for superiority can be
imagined.Johannesburg might be named the City of Surprises.Its youthful
existence has been fraught with astonishing works.It was born in a
day, and one day's revolution almost ended its existence.It grew from
the desert veldt into a garden of gold.Its granite residences, brick
buildings, and iron and steel mills sprang from blades of grass and
sprigs of weeds.It has transformed the beggar into a millionaire, and
it has seen starving men in its streets.It harbours men from every
nation and climate, but it is a home for few.It is far from the centre
of the earth's civilization, but it has often attracted the whole
world's attention.It supports its children, but by them it is cursed.Its god is in the earth upon which it rests, and its hope of future life
in that which it brings forth.And all this because a man upturned the
soil and called it gold.I say this because unless you had shown me this
confidence it would have been almost impossible for me to say to
you what I am going to say now.But you have allowed me to come here
frequently, and to see you and talk with you here in your study, and to
see even more of your daughter.Of course, sir, you did not suppose that
I came here only to see you.I came here because I found that if I did
not see Miss Ellen for a day, that that day was wasted, and that I spent
it uneasily and discontentedly, and the necessity of seeing her even
more frequently has grown so great that I cannot come here as often as
I seem to want to come unless I am engaged to her, unless I come as her
husband that is to be."The young man had been speaking very slowly and
picking his words, but now he raised his head and ran on quickly."I have spoken to her and told her how I love her, and she has told me
that she loves me, and that if you will not oppose us, will marry me.That is the news I have to tell you, sir.I don't know but that I might
have told it differently, but that is it.I need not urge on you my
position and all that, because I do not think that weighs with you; but
I do tell you that I love Ellen so dearly that, though I am not worthy
of her, of course, I have no other pleasure than to give her pleasure
and to try to make her happy.I have the power to do it; but what is
much more, I have the wish to do it; it is all I think of now, and all
that I can ever think of.What she thinks of me you must ask her; but
what she is to me neither she can tell you nor do I believe that I
myself could make you understand."The young man's face was flushed and
eager, and as he finished speaking he raised his head and watched the
bishop's countenance anxiously.But the older man's face was hidden by
his hand as he leaned with his elbow on his writing-table.His other
hand was playing with a pen, and when he began to speak, which he did
after a long pause, he still turned it between his fingers and looked
down at it."I suppose," he said, as softly as though he were speaking to himself,
"that I should have known this; I suppose that I should have been better
prepared to hear it.But it is one of those things which men put off--I
mean those men who have children, put off--as they do making their
wills, as something that is in the future and that may be shirked until
it comes.We seem to think that our daughters will live with us always,
just as we expect to live on ourselves until death comes one day and
startles us and finds us unprepared."He took down his hand and smiled
gravely at the younger man with an evident effort, and said, "I did
not mean to speak so gloomily, but you see my point of view must be
different from yours.And she says she loves you, does she?"Young Latimer bowed his head and murmured something inarticulately in
reply, and then held his head erect again and waited, still watching the
bishop's face."I think she might have told me," said the older man; "but then I
suppose this is the better way.I am young enough to understand that
the old order changes, that the customs of my father's time differ
from those of to-day.And there is no alternative, I suppose," he said,
shaking his head."I am stopped and told to deliver, and have no choice.I will get used to it in time," he went on, "but it seems very hard now.Fathers are selfish, I imagine, but she is all I have."Young Latimer looked gravely into the fire and wondered how long it
would last.He could just hear the piano from below, and he was anxious
to return to her.And at the same time he was drawn toward the older
man before him, and felt rather guilty, as though he really were robbing
him.But at the bishop's next words he gave up any thought of a speedy
release, and settled himself in his chair."We are still to have a long talk," said the bishop."There are many
things I must know, and of which I am sure you will inform me freely.I believe there are some who consider me hard, and even narrow on
different points, but I do not think you will find me so, at least let
us hope not.I must confess that for a moment I almost hoped that you
might not be able to answer the questions I must ask you, but it was
only for a moment.I am only too sure you will not be found wanting,
and that the conclusion of our talk will satisfy us both.Yes, I am
confident of that."His manner changed, nevertheless, and Latimer saw that he was now facing
a judge and not a plaintiff who had been robbed, and that he was in turn
the defendant."I like you," the bishop said, "I like you very much.As you say
yourself, I have seen a great deal of you, because I have enjoyed your
society, and your views and talk were good and young and fresh, and did
me good.You have served to keep me in touch with the outside world,
a world of which I used to know at one time a great deal.I know your
people and I know you, I think, and many people have spoken to me of
you.They, no doubt, understood what was coming better
than myself, and were meaning to reassure me concerning you.And they
said nothing but what was good of you.But there are certain things
of which no one can know but yourself, and concerning which no other
person, save myself, has a right to question you.You have promised very
fairly for my daughter's future; you have suggested more than you have
said, but I understood.You can give her many pleasures which I have not
been able to afford; she can get from you the means of seeing more of
this world in which she lives, of meeting more people, and of indulging
in her charities, or in her extravagances, for that matter, as she
wishes.I have no fear of her bodily comfort; her life, as far as that
is concerned, will be easier and broader, and with more power for good.Her future, as I say, as you say also, is assured; but I want to ask you
this," the bishop leaned forward and watched the young man anxiously,
"you can protect her in the future, but can you assure me that you can
protect her from the past?"Young Latimer raised his eyes calmly and said, "I don't think I quite
understand.""I have perfect confidence, I say," returned the bishop, "in you as far
as your treatment of Ellen is concerned in the future.You love her and
you would do everything to make the life of the woman you love a happy
one; but this is it, Can you assure me that there is nothing in the past
that may reach forward later and touch my daughter through you--no ugly
story, no oats that have been sowed, and no boomerang that you have
thrown wantonly and that has not returned--but which may return?""I think I understand you now, sir," said the young man, quietly."I
have lived," he began, "as other men of my sort have lived.You know
what that is, for you must have seen it about you at college, and after
that before you entered the Church.I judge so from your friends, who
were your friends then, I understand.I never
went in for dissipation, if you mean that, because it never attracted
me.I am afraid I kept out of it not so much out of respect for others
as for respect for myself.I found my self-respect was a very good thing
to keep, and I rather preferred keeping it and losing several pleasures
that other men managed to enjoy, apparently with free consciences.I
confess I used to rather envy them.It is no particular virtue on my
part; the thing struck me as rather more vulgar than wicked, and so I
have had no wild oats to speak of; and no woman, if that is what you
mean, can write an anonymous letter, and no man can tell you a story
about me that he could not tell in my presence."There was something in the way the young man spoke which would have
amply satisfied the outsider, had he been present; but the bishop's eyes
were still unrelaxed and anxious.He made an impatient motion with his
hand."I know you too well, I hope," he said, "to think of doubting your
attitude in that particular.I know you are a gentleman, that is enough
for that; but there is something beyond these more common evils.You
see, I am terribly in earnest over this--you may think unjustly so,
considering how well I know you, but this child is my only child.If her
mother had lived, my responsibility would have been less great; but, as
it is, God has left her here alone to me in my hands.I do not think He
intended my duty should end when I had fed and clothed her, and taught
her to read and write.I do not think He meant that I should only act as
her guardian until the first man she fancied fancied her.I must look to
her happiness not only now when she is with me, but I must assure myself
of it when she leaves my roof.These common sins of youth I acquit you
of.Such things are beneath you, I believe, and I did not even consider
them.But there are other toils in which men become involved, other
evils or misfortunes which exist, and which threaten all men who are
young and free and attractive in many ways to women, as well as men.You have lived the life of the young man of this day.You have reached
a place in your profession when you can afford to rest and marry and
assume the responsibilities of marriage.You look forward to a life of
content and peace and honorable ambition--a life, with your wife at your
side, which is to last forty or fifty years.You consider where you will
be twenty years from now, at what point of your career you may become a
judge or give up practice; your perspective is unlimited; you even
think of the college to which you may send your son.It is a long, quiet
future that you are looking forward to, and you choose my daughter as
the companion for that future, as the one woman with whom you could live
content for that length of time.And it is in that spirit that you come
to me to-night and that you ask me for my daughter.Now I am going to
ask you one question, and as you answer that I will tell you whether
or not you can have Ellen for your wife.You look forward, as I say, to
many years of life, and you have chosen her as best suited to live that
period with you; but I ask you this, and I demand that you answer me
truthfully, and that you remember that you are speaking to her father.Imagine that I had the power to tell you, or rather that some superhuman
agent could convince you, that you had but a month to live, and that for
what you did in that month you would not be held responsible either by
any moral law or any law made by man, and that your life hereafter would
not be influenced by your conduct in that month, would you spend it, I
ask you--and on your answer depends mine--would you spend those thirty
days, with death at the end, with my daughter, or with some other woman
of whom I know nothing?"Latimer sat for some time silent, until indeed, his silence assumed
such a significance that he raised his head impatiently and said with a
motion of the hand, "I mean to answer you in a minute; I want to be sure
that I understand."The bishop bowed his head in assent, and for a still longer period the
men sat motionless.The clock in the corner seemed to tick more loudly,
and the dead coals dropping in the grate had a sharp, aggressive sound.The notes of the piano that had risen from the room below had ceased."If I understand you," said Latimer, finally, and his voice and his
face as he raised it were hard and aggressive, "you are stating a purely
hypothetical case.You wish to try me by conditions which do not exist,
which cannot exist.What justice is there, what right is there,
in asking me to say how I would act under circumstances which are
impossible, which lie beyond the limit of human experience?You cannot
judge a man by what he would do if he were suddenly robbed of all his
mental and moral training and of the habit of years.I am not admitting,
understand me, that if the conditions which you suggest did exist that I
would do one whit differently from what I will do if they remain as they
are.I am merely denying your right to put such a question to me at all.You might just as well judge the shipwrecked sailors on a raft who eat
each other's flesh as you would judge a sane, healthy man who did such
a thing in his own home.Are you going to condemn men who are ice-locked
at the North Pole, or buried in the heart of Africa, and who have given
up all thought of return and are half mad and wholly without hope, as
you would judge ourselves?Are they to be weighed and balanced as you
and I are, sitting here within the sound of the cabs outside and with
a bake-shop around the corner?What you propose could not exist, could
never happen.I could never be placed where I should have to make such
a choice, and you have no right to ask me what I would do or how I
would act under conditions that are super-human--you used the word
yourself--where all that I have held to be good and just and true would
be obliterated.I would be unworthy of myself, I would be unworthy of
your daughter, if I considered such a state of things for a moment, or
if I placed my hopes of marrying her on the outcome of such a test, and
so, sir," said the young man, throwing back his head, "I must refuse to
answer you."The bishop lowered his hand from before his eyes and sank back wearily
into his chair."You have no right to say that," cried the young man, springing to his
feet."You have no right to suppose anything or to draw any conclusions.He stood with his head and shoulders thrown
back, and with his hands resting on his hips and with the fingers
working nervously at his waist."What you have said," replied the bishop, in a voice that had changed
strangely, and which was inexpressibly sad and gentle, "is merely a
curtain of words to cover up your true feeling.It would have been so
easy to have said, 'For thirty days or for life Ellen is the only woman
who has the power to make me happy.'You see that would have answered me
and satisfied me.But you did not say that," he added, quickly, as the
young man made a movement as if to speak."Well, and suppose this other woman did exist, what then?""The conditions you suggest are impossible; you must, you will
surely, sir, admit that.""I do not know," replied the bishop, sadly; "I do not know.It may
happen that whatever obstacle there has been which has kept you from her
may be removed.It may be that she has married, it may be that she has
fallen so low that you cannot marry her.But if you have loved her once,
you may love her again; whatever it was that separated you in the past,
that separates you now, that makes you prefer my daughter to her, may
come to an end when you are married, when it will be too late, and when
only trouble can come of it, and Ellen would bear that trouble."But I tell you it is impossible," cried the young man."The woman is
beyond the love of any man, at least such a man as I am, or try to be.""Do you mean," asked the bishop, gently, and with an eager look of hope,
"that she is dead?"Latimer faced the father for some seconds in silence."No," he said, "I do not mean she is dead.Again the bishop moved back wearily into his chair."You mean then," he
said, "perhaps, that she is a married woman?"Latimer pressed his lips
together at first as though he would not answer, and then raised his
eyes coldly.The older man had held up his hand as if to signify that what he was
about to say should be listened to without interruption, when a sharp
turning of the lock of the door caused both father and the suitor to
start.Then they turned and looked at each other with anxious inquiry
and with much concern, for they recognized for the first time that their
voices had been loud.The older man stepped quickly across the floor,
but before he reached the middle of the room the door opened from the
outside, and his daughter stood in the door-way, with her head held down
and her eyes looking at the floor.exclaimed the father, in a voice of pain and the deepest pity.The girl moved toward the place from where his voice came, without
raising her eyes, and when she reached him put her arms about him and
hid her face on his shoulder.She moved as though she were tired, as
though she were exhausted by some heavy work."My child," said the bishop, gently, "were you listening?"There was no
reproach in his voice; it was simply full of pity and concern."I thought," whispered the girl, brokenly, "that he would be frightened;
I wanted to hear what he would say.I thought I could laugh at him
for it afterward.I thought--" she stopped with a
little gasping sob that she tried to hide, and for a moment held herself
erect and then sank back again into her father's arms with her head upon
his breast.Latimer started forward, holding out his arms to her."Ellen," he said,
"surely, Ellen, you are not against me.You see how preposterous it is,
how unjust it is to me.You cannot mean--"

The girl raised her head and shrugged her shoulders slightly as though
she were cold."Father," she said, wearily, "ask him to go away, Why
does he stay?Latimer stopped and took a step back as though some one had struck him,
and then stood silent with his face flushed and his eyes flashing.It
was not in answer to anything that they said that he spoke, but to their
attitude and what it suggested."You stand there," he began, "you
two stand there as though I were something unclean, as though I had
committed some crime.You look at me as though I were on trial for
murder or worse.You loved me a half-hour ago, Ellen; you said
you did.I know you loved me; and you, sir," he added, more quietly,
"treated me like a friend.Has anything come since then to change me or
you?It is a silly,
needless, horrible mistake.You know I love you, Ellen; love you better
than all the world.I don't have to tell you that; you know it, you can
see and feel it.It does not need to be said; words can't make it any
truer.You have confused yourselves and stultified yourselves with this
trick, this test by hypothetical conditions, by considering what is not
real or possible.It is simple enough; it is plain enough.You know I
love you, Ellen, and you only, and that is all there is to it, and all
that there is of any consequence in the world to me.The matter stops
there; that is all there is for you to consider.Answer me, Ellen, speak
to me.He stopped and moved a step toward her, but as he did so, the girl,
still without looking up, drew herself nearer to her father and shrank
more closely into his arms; but the father's face was troubled and
doubtful, and he regarded the younger man with a look of the most
anxious scrutiny.Their hands were raised
against him as far as he could understand, and he broke forth again
proudly, and with a defiant indignation:

"What right have you to judge me?"he began; "what do you know of what
I have suffered, and endured, and overcome?How can you know what I have
had to give up and put away from me?It's easy enough for you to draw
your skirts around you, but what can a woman bred as you have been bred
know of what I've had to fight against and keep under and cut away?It
was an easy, beautiful idyl to you; your love came to you only when it
should have come, and for a man who was good and worthy, and distinctly
eligible--I don't mean that; forgive me, Ellen, but you drive me beside
myself.But he is good and he believes himself worthy, and I say that
myself before you both.But I am only worthy and only good because of
that other love that I put away when it became a crime, when it became
impossible.Do you know what it meant to
me, and what I went through, and how I suffered?Do you know who this
other woman is whom you are insulting with your doubts and guesses in
the dark?Perhaps it was easy
for her, too; perhaps her silence cost her nothing; perhaps she did not
suffer and has nothing but happiness and content to look forward to for
the rest of her life; and I tell you that it is because we did put
it away, and kill it, and not give way to it that I am whatever I am
to-day; whatever good there is in me is due to that temptation and
to the fact that I beat it and overcame it and kept myself honest and
clean.And when I met you and learned to know you I believed in my heart
that God had sent you to me that I might know what it was to love a
woman whom I could marry and who could be my wife; that you were the
reward for my having overcome temptation and the sign that I had done
well.And now you throw me over and put me aside as though I were
something low and unworthy, because of this temptation, because of this
very thing that has made me know myself and my own strength and that has
kept me up for you."As the young man had been speaking, the bishop's eyes had never left
his face, and as he finished, the face of the priest grew clearer and
decided, and calmly exultant.And as Latimer ceased he bent his head
above his daughter's, and said in a voice that seemed to speak with more
than human inspiration."My child," he said, "if God had given me a son
I should have been proud if he could have spoken as this young man has
done."But the woman only said, "Let him go to her."He drew back from the girl in his arms and looked anxiously and
feelingly at her lover."How could you, Ellen," he said, "how could
you?"He was watching the young man's face with eyes full of sympathy
and concern."How little you know him," he said, "how little you
understand.He will not do that," he added quickly, but looking
questioningly at Latimer and speaking in a tone almost of command."He
will not undo all that he has done; I know him better than that."But
Latimer made no answer, and for a moment the two men stood watching each
other and questioning each other with their eyes.Then Latimer turned,
and without again so much as glancing at the girl walked steadily to the
door and left the room.He passed on slowly down the stairs and out into
the night, and paused upon the top of the steps leading to the street.Below him lay the avenue with its double line of lights stretching off
in two long perspectives.The lamps of hundreds of cabs and carriages
flashed as they advanced toward him and shone for a moment at the
turnings of the cross-streets, and from either side came the ceaseless
rush and murmur, and over all hung the strange mystery that covers a
great city at night.Latimer's rooms lay to the south, but he stood
looking toward a spot to the north with a reckless, harassed look in his
face that had not been there for many months.He stood so for a minute,
and then gave a short shrug of disgust at his momentary doubt and ran
quickly down the steps."No," he said, "if it were for a month, yes; but
it is to be for many years, many more long years."And turning his back
resolutely to the north he went slowly home.8


The "trailer" for the green-goods men who rented room No.8 in Case's
tenement had had no work to do for the last few days, and was cursing
his luck in consequence.He was entirely too young to curse, but he had never been told so, and,
indeed, so imperfect had his training been that he had never been told
not to do anything as long as it pleased him to do it and made existence
any more bearable.He had been told when he was very young, before the man and woman who
had brought him into the world had separated, not to crawl out on the
fire-escape, because he might break his neck, and later, after his
father had walked off Hegelman's Slip into the East River while very
drunk, and his mother had been sent to the penitentiary for grand
larceny, he had been told not to let the police catch him sleeping under
the bridge.With these two exceptions he had been told to do as he pleased, which
was the very mockery of advice, as he was just about as well able to do
as he pleased as is any one who has to beg or steal what he eats and has
to sleep in hall-ways or over the iron gratings of warm cellars and has
the officers of the children's societies always after him to put him in
a "Home" and make him be "good.""Snipes," as the trailer was called, was determined no one should ever
force him to be good if he could possibly prevent it.And he certainly
did do a great deal to prevent it.Some of the boys who had escaped from the Home had told him all about
that.It meant wearing shoes and a blue and white checkered apron, and
making cane-bottomed chairs all day, and having to wash yourself in a
big iron tub twice a week, not to speak of having to move about like
machines whenever the lady teacher hit a bell.So when the green-goods
men, of whom the genial Mr.Alf Wolfe was the chief, asked Snipes to
act as "trailer" for them at a quarter of a dollar for every victim he
shadowed, he jumped at the offer and was proud of the position.If you should happen to keep a grocery store in the country, or to
run the village post-office, it is not unlikely that you know what a
green-goods man is; but in case you don't, and have only a vague idea
as to how he lives, a paragraph of explanation must be inserted here
for your particular benefit.Green goods is the technical name for
counterfeit bills, and the green-goods men send out circulars to
countrymen all over the United States, offering to sell them $5,000
worth of counterfeit money for $500, and ease their conscience by
explaining to them that by purchasing these green goods they are hurting
no one but the Government, which is quite able, with its big surplus, to
stand the loss.They enclose a letter which is to serve their victim as
a mark of identification or credential when he comes on to purchase.The address they give him is in one of the many drug-store and
cigar-store post-offices which are scattered all over New York, and
which contribute to make vice and crime so easy that the evil they do
cannot be reckoned in souls lost or dollars stolen.If the letter from
the countryman strikes the dealers in green goods as sincere, they
appoint an interview with him by mail in rooms they rent for the
purpose, and if they, on meeting him there, think he is still in earnest
and not a detective or officer in disguise, they appoint still another
interview, to be held later in the day in the back room of some saloon.Then the countryman is watched throughout the day from the moment
he leaves the first meeting-place until he arrives at the saloon.If
anything in his conduct during that time leads the man whose duty it is
to follow him, or the "trailer," as the profession call it, to believe
he is a detective, he finds when he arrives at the saloon that there
is no one to receive him.But if the trailer regards his conduct as
unsuspicious, he is taken to another saloon, not the one just appointed,
which is, perhaps, a most respectable place, but to the thieves' own
private little rendezvous, where he is robbed in any of the several
different ways best suited to their purpose.He was so little that no one ever
noticed him, and he could keep a man in sight no matter how big the
crowd was, or how rapidly it changed and shifted.And he was as patient
as he was quick, and would wait for hours if needful, with his eye on
a door, until his man reissued into the street again.And if the one he
shadowed looked behind him to see if he was followed, or dodged up and
down different streets, as if he were trying to throw off pursuit, or
despatched a note or telegram, or stopped to speak to a policeman or any
special officer, as a detective might, who thought he had his men safely
in hand, off Snipes would go on a run, to where Alf Wolfe was waiting,
and tell what he had seen.Then Wolfe would give him a quarter or more, and the trailer would go
back to his post opposite Case's tenement, and wait for another victim
to issue forth, and for the signal from No.It was not
much fun, and "customers," as Mr.Wolfe always called them, had been
scarce, and Mr.Wolfe, in consequence, had been cross and nasty in his
temper, and had batted Snipe out of the way on more than one occasion.So the trailer was feeling blue and disconsolate, and wondered how it
was that "Naseby" Raegen, "Rags" Raegen's younger brother, had had the
luck to get a two weeks' visit to the country with the Fresh Air Fund
children, while he had not.He supposed it was because Naseby had sold papers, and wore shoes, and
went to night school, and did many other things equally objectionable.Still, what Naseby had said about the country, and riding horseback,
and the fishing, and the shooting crows with no cops to stop you, and
watermelons for nothing, had sounded wonderfully attractive and quite
improbable, except that it was one of Naseby's peculiarly sneaking ways
to tell the truth.Anyway, Naseby had left Cherry Street for good, and
had gone back to the country to work there.This all helped to make
Snipes morose, and it was with a cynical smile of satisfaction that he
watched an old countryman coming slowly up the street, and asking his
way timidly of the Italians to Case's tenement.The countryman looked up and about him in evident bewilderment and
anxiety.He glanced hesitatingly across at the boy leaning against the
wall of a saloon, but the boy was watching two sparrows fighting in the
dirt of the street, and did not see him.At least, it did not look as if
he saw him.Then the old man knocked on the door of Case's tenement.No one came, for the people in the house had learned to leave inquiring
countrymen to the gentleman who rented room No.8, and as that gentleman
was occupied at that moment with a younger countryman, he allowed the
old man, whom he had first cautiously observed from the top of the
stairs, to remain where he was.The old man stood uncertainly on the stoop, and then removed his heavy
black felt hat and rubbed his bald head and the white shining locks of
hair around it with a red bandanna handkerchief.Then he walked very
slowly across the street toward Snipes, for the rest of the street was
empty, and there was no one else at hand.The old man was dressed in
heavy black broadcloth, quaintly cut, with boot legs showing up under
the trousers, and with faultlessly clean linen of home-made manufacture."I can't make the people in that house over there hear me," complained
the old man, with the simple confidence that old age has in very young
boys."Do you happen to know if they're at home?""I'm looking for a man named Perceval," said the stranger; "he lives in
that house, and I wanter see him on most particular business.It isn't
a very pleasing place he lives in, is it--at least," he hurriedly added,
as if fearful of giving offence, "it isn't much on the outside?Do you
happen to know him?"Perceval was Alf Wolfe's business name."Well, I'm not looking for him," explained the stranger, slowly, "as
much as I'm looking for a young man that I kind of suspect is been
to see him to-day: a young man that looks like me, only younger.Has
lightish hair and pretty tall and lanky, and carrying a shiny black bag
with him.Did you happen to hev noticed him going into that place across
the way?"The old man sighed and nodded his head thoughtfully at Snipes, and
puckered up the corners of his mouth, as though he were thinking deeply.He had wonderfully honest blue eyes, and with the white hair hanging
around his sun-burned face, he looked like an old saint.But the trailer
didn't know that: he did know, though, that this man was a different
sort from the rest."What is't you want to see him about?"he asked sullenly, while he
looked up and down the street and everywhere but at the old man, and
rubbed one bare foot slowly over the other.The old man looked pained, and much to Snipe's surprise, the question
brought the tears to his eyes, and his lips trembled.Then he swerved
slightly, so that he might have fallen if Snipes had not caught him and
helped him across the pavement to a seat on a stoop."Thankey, son,"
said the stranger; "I'm not as strong as I was, an' the sun's mighty
hot, an' these streets of yours smell mighty bad, and I've had a
powerful lot of trouble these last few days.But if I could see this
man Perceval before my boy does, I know I could fix it, and it would all
come out right.""What do you want to see him about?"repeated the trailer, suspiciously,
while he fanned the old man with his hat.Snipes could not have told you
why he did this or why this particular old countryman was any different
from the many others who came to buy counterfeit money and who were
thieves at heart as well as in deed."I want to see him about my son," said the old man to the little boy."He's a bad man whoever he is.This 'ere Perceval is a bad man.He sends
down his wickedness to the country and tempts weak folks to sin.He
teaches 'em ways of evil-doing they never heard of, and he's ruined my
son with the others--ruined him.I've had nothing to do with the city
and its ways; we're strict living, simple folks, and perhaps we've been
too strict, or Abraham wouldn't have run away to the city.But I thought
it was best, and I doubted nothing when the fresh-air children came to
the farm.I didn't like city children, but I let 'em come.I took
'em in, and did what I could to make it pleasant for 'em.Poor little
fellers, all as thin as corn-stalks and pale as ghosts, and as dirty as
you."I took 'em in and let 'em ride the horses, and swim in the river, and
shoot crows in the cornfield, and eat all the cherries they could
pull, and what did the city send me in return for that?It sent me this
thieving, rascally scheme of this man Perceval's, and it turned my boy's
head, and lost him to me.I saw him poring over the note and reading it
as if it were Gospel, and I suspected nothing.And when he asked me if
he could keep it, I said yes he could, for I thought he wanted it for a
curiosity, and then off he put with the black bag and the $200 he's been
saving up to start housekeeping with when the old Deacon says he can
marry his daughter Kate."The old man placed both hands on his knees and
went on excitedly."The old Deacon says he'll not let 'em marry till Abe has $2,000, and
that is what the boy's come after.He wants to buy $2,000 worth of bad
money with his $200 worth of good money, to show the Deacon, just as
though it were likely a marriage after such a crime as that would ever
be a happy one."Snipes had stopped fanning the old man, as he ran on, and was listening
intently, with an uncomfortable feeling of sympathy and sorrow,
uncomfortable because he was not used to it.He could not see why the old man should think the city should have
treated his boy better because he had taken care of the city's children,
and he was puzzled between his allegiance to the gang and his desire
to help the gang's innocent victim, and then because he was an innocent
victim and not a "customer," he let his sympathy get the better of his
discretion."Saay," he began, abruptly, "I'm not sayin' nothin' to nobody, and
nobody's sayin' nothin' to me--see?but I guess your son'll be around
here to-day, sure.He's got to come before one, for this office closes
sharp at one, and we goes home.Now, I've got the call whether he gets
his stuff taken off him or whether the boys leave him alone.If I say
the word, they'd no more come near him than if he had the cholera--see?An' I'll say it for this oncet, just for you.Hold on," he commanded, as
the old man raised his voice in surprised interrogation, "don't ask no
questions, 'cause you won't get no answers 'except lies.You find your
way back to the Grand Central Depot and wait there, and I'll steer your
son down to you, sure, as soon as I can find him--see?Now get along, or
you'll get me inter trouble.""You've been lying to me, then," cried the old man, "and you're as bad
as any of them, and my boy's over in that house now."He scrambled up from the stoop, and before the trailer could understand
what he proposed to do, had dashed across the street and up the stoop,
and up the stairs, and had burst into room No.come back out of that, you old fool!"Snipes was afraid to enter room
No.8, but he could hear from the outside the old man challenging Alf
Wolfe in a resonant angry voice that rang through the building.said Snipes, crouching on the stairs, "there's goin' to be a
muss this time, sure!"He ran across the room and pulled open a door that led into another
room, but it was empty.He had fully expected to see his boy murdered
and quartered, and with his pockets inside out.He turned on Wolfe,
shaking his white hair like a mane."Give me up my son, you rascal you!"he cried, "or I'll get the police, and I'll tell them how you decoy
honest boys to your den and murder them.""Are you drunk or crazy, or just a little of both?""For a cent I'd throw you out of that window.You're too old to get excited like that; it's not good for you."But this only exasperated the old man the more, and he made a lunge
at the confidence man's throat.Wolfe stepped aside and caught him
around the waist and twisted his leg around the old man's rheumatic one,
and held him."Now," said Wolfe, as quietly as though he were giving a
lesson in wrestling, "if I wanted to, I could break your back."The old man glared up at him, panting."Your son's not here," said
Wolfe, "and this is a private gentleman's private room.I could turn
you over to the police for assault if I wanted to; but," he added,
magnanimously, "I won't.Now get out of here and go home to your wife,
and when you come to see the sights again don't drink so much raw
whiskey."He half carried the old farmer to the top of the stairs and
dropped him, and went back and closed the door.Snipes came up and
helped him down and out, and the old man and the boy walked slowly and
in silence out to the Bowery.Snipes helped his companion into a car and
put him off at the Grand Central Depot.The heat and the excitement had
told heavily on the old man, and he seemed dazed and beaten.He was leaning on the trailer's shoulder and waiting for his turn in
the line in front of the ticket window, when a tall, gawky, good-looking
country lad sprang out of it and at him with an expression of surprise
and anxiety."Father," he said, "father, what's wrong?"Abraham," said the old man, simply, and dropped heavily on the younger
man's shoulder.Then he raised his head sternly and said: "I thought you
were murdered, but better that than a thief, Abraham.What did you do with that rascal's letter?The trailer drew cautiously away; the conversation was becoming
unpleasantly personal."I don't know what you're talking about," said Abraham, calmly."The
Deacon gave his consent the other night without the $2,000, and I took
the $200 I'd saved and came right on in the fust train to buy the ring.he said, flushing, as he pulled out a little
velvet box and opened it.The old man was so happy at this that he laughed and cried alternately,
and then he made a grab for the trailer and pulled him down beside him
on one of the benches."You've got to come with me," he said, with kind severity."You're a
good boy, but your folks have let you run wrong.You've been good to
me, and you said you would get me back my boy and save him from those
thieves, and I believe now that you meant it.Now you're just coming
back with us to the farm and the cows and the river, and you can eat
all you want and live with us, and never, never see this unclean, wicked
city again."Snipes looked up keenly from under the rim of his hat and rubbed one of
his muddy feet over the other as was his habit.The young countryman,
greatly puzzled, and the older man smiling kindly, waited expectantly in
silence.From outside came the sound of the car-bells jangling, and the
rattle of cabs, and the cries of drivers, and all the varying rush and
turmoil of a great metropolis.Green fields, and running rivers, and
fruit that did not grow in wooden boxes or brown paper cones, were myths
and idle words to Snipes, but this "unclean, wicked city" he knew."I guess you're too good for me," he said, with an uneasy laugh."I
guess little old New York's good enough for me."cried the old man, in the tones of greatest concern."You would
go back to that den of iniquity, surely not,--to that thief Perceval?""Well," said the trailer, slowly, "and he's not such a bad lot, neither.You see he could hev broke your neck that time when you was choking him,
but he didn't.There's your train," he added hurriedly and jumping away.I'm much 'bliged to you jus' for asking me."Two hours later the farmer and his son were making the family weep and
laugh over their adventures, as they all sat together on the porch with
the vines about it; and the trailer was leaning against the wall of a
saloon and apparently counting his ten toes, but in reality watching for
Mr.Wolfe to give the signal from the window of room No."THERE WERE NINETY AND NINE"


Young Harringford, or the "Goodwood Plunger," as he was perhaps better
known at that time, had come to Monte Carlo in a very different spirit
and in a very different state of mind from any in which he had ever
visited the place before.He had come there for the same reason that
a wounded lion, or a poisoned rat, for that matter, crawls away into a
corner, that it may be alone when it dies.He stood leaning against one
of the pillars of the Casino with his back to the moonlight, and with
his eyes blinking painfully at the flaming lamps above the green tables
inside.He knew they would be put out very soon; and as he had something
to do then, he regarded them fixedly with painful earnestness, as a man
who is condemned to die at sunrise watches through his barred windows
for the first gray light of the morning.That queer, numb feeling in his head and the sharp line of pain between
his eyebrows which had been growing worse for the last three weeks, was
troubling him more terribly than ever before, and his nerves had thrown
off all control and rioted at the base of his head and at his wrists,
and jerked and twitched as though, so it seemed to him, they were
striving to pull the tired body into pieces and to set themselves free.He was wondering whether if he should take his hand from his pocket and
touch his head he would find that it had grown longer, and had turned
into a soft, spongy mass which would give beneath his fingers.He
considered this for some time, and even went so far as to half withdraw
one hand, but thought better of it and shoved it back again as he
considered how much less terrible it was to remain in doubt than to find
that this phenomenon had actually taken place.The pity of the whole situation was, that the boy was only a boy with
all his man's miserable knowledge of the world, and the reason of it all
was, that he had entirely too much heart and not enough money to make
an unsuccessful gambler.If he had only been able to lose his conscience
instead of his money, or even if he had kept his conscience and won, it
is not likely that he would have been waiting for the lights to go
out at Monte Carlo.But he had not only lost all of his money and more
besides, which he could never make up, but he had lost other things
which meant much more to him now than money, and which could not be
made up or paid back at even usurious interest.He had not only lost the
right to sit at his father's table, but the right to think of the girl
whose place in Surrey ran next to that of his own people, and whose
lighted window in the north wing he had watched on those many dreary
nights when she had been ill, from his own terrace across the trees
in the park.And all he had gained was the notoriety that made him a
by-word with decent people, and the hero of the race-tracks and the
music-halls.He was no longer "Young Harringford, the eldest son of the
Harringfords of Surrey," but the "Goodwood Plunger," to whom Fortune had
made desperate love and had then jilted, and mocked, and overthrown.As he looked back at it now and remembered himself as he was then, it
seemed as though he was considering an entirely distinct and separate
personage--a boy of whom he liked to think, who had had strong, healthy
ambitions and gentle tastes.He reviewed it passionlessly as he stood
staring at the lights inside the Casino, as clearly as he was capable
of doing in his present state and with miserable interest.How he had
laughed when young Norton told him in boyish confidence that there was
a horse named Siren in his father's stables which would win the Goodwood
Cup; how, having gone down to see Norton's people when the long vacation
began, he had seen Siren daily, and had talked of her until two every
morning in the smoking-room, and had then staid up two hours later to
watch her take her trial spin over the downs.He remembered how they
used to stamp back over the long grass wet with dew, comparing watches
and talking of the time in whispers, and said good night as the sun
broke over the trees in the park.And then just at this time of all
others, when the horse was the only interest of those around him, from
Lord Norton and his whole household down to the youngest stable-boy and
oldest gaffer in the village, he had come into his money.And then began the then and still inexplicable plunge into gambling,
and the wagering of greater sums than the owner of Siren dared to risk
himself, the secret backing of the horse through commissioners all
over England, until the boy by his single fortune had brought the odds
against her from 60 to 0 down to 6 to 0.He recalled, with a thrill that
seemed to settle his nerves for the moment, the little black specks at
the starting-post and the larger specks as the horses turned the first
corner.The rest of the people on the coach were making a great deal of
noise, he remembered, but he, who had more to lose than any one or all
of them together, had stood quite still with his feet on the wheel and
his back against the box-seat, and with his hands sunk into his pockets
and the nails cutting through his gloves.The specks grew into horses
with bits of color on them, and then the deep muttering roar of the
crowd merged into one great shout, and swelled and grew into sharper,
quicker, impatient cries, as the horses turned into the stretch with
only their heads showing toward the goal.Some of the people were
shouting "Firefly!"and others were calling on "Vixen!"and others, who
had their glasses up, cried "Trouble leads!"but he only waited until
he could distinguish the Norton colors, with his lips pressed tightly
together.Then they came so close that their hoofs echoed as loudly as
when horses gallop over a bridge, and from among the leaders Siren's
beautiful head and shoulders showed like sealskin in the sun, and the
boy on her back leaned forward and touched her gently with his hand, as
they had so often seen him do on the downs, and Siren, as though he had
touched a spring, leaped forward with her head shooting back and out,
like a piston-rod that has broken loose from its fastening and beats the
air, while the jockey sat motionless, with his right arm hanging at
his side as limply as though it were broken, and with his left moving
forward and back in time with the desperate strokes of the horse's head.cried Lord Norton, with a grim smile, and "Siren!"the
mob shouted back with wonder and angry disappointment, and "Siren!"the
hills echoed from far across the course.Young Harringford felt as if
he had suddenly been lifted into heaven after three months of purgatory,
and smiled uncertainly at the excited people on the coach about him.It
made him smile even now when he recalled young Norton's flushed face
and the awe and reproach in his voice when he climbed up and whispered,
"Why, Cecil, they say in the ring you've won a fortune, and you never
told us."And how Griffith, the biggest of the book-makers, with
the rest of them at his back, came up to him and touched his hat
resentfully, and said, "You'll have to give us time, sir; I'm very hard
hit"; and how the crowd stood about him and looked at him curiously,
and the Certain Royal Personage turned and said, "Who--not that boy,
surely?"Then how, on the day following, the papers told of the young
gentleman who of all others had won a fortune, thousands and thousands
of pounds they said, getting back sixty for every one he had ventured;
and pictured him in baby clothes with the cup in his arms, or in an Eton
jacket; and how all of them spoke of him slightingly, or admiringly, as
the "Goodwood Plunger."He did not care to go on after that; to recall the mortification of his
father, whose pride was hurt and whose hopes were dashed by this sudden,
mad freak of fortune, nor how he railed at it and provoked him until the
boy rebelled and went back to the courses, where he was a celebrity and
a king.Fortune and greater fortune at first;
days in which he could not lose, days in which he drove back to the
crowded inns choked with dust, sunburnt and fagged with excitement, to
a riotous supper and baccarat, and afterward went to sleep only to see
cards and horses and moving crowds and clouds of dust; days spent in
a short covert coat, with a field-glass over his shoulder and with a
pasteboard ticket dangling from his buttonhole; and then came the change
that brought conscience up again, and the visits to the Jews, and the
slights of the men who had never been his friends, but whom he had
thought had at least liked him for himself, even if he did not like
them; and then debts, and more debts, and the borrowing of money to pay
here and there, and threats of executions; and, with it all, the longing
for the fields and trout springs of Surrey and the walk across the park
to where she lived.This grew so strong that he wrote to his father, and was told briefly
that he who was to have kept up the family name had dragged it into the
dust of the race-courses, and had changed it at his own wish to that of
the Boy Plunger--and that the breach was irreconcilable.Then this queer feeling came on, and he wondered why he could not eat,
and why he shivered even when the room was warm or the sun shining, and
the fear came upon him that with all this trouble and disgrace his head
might give way, and then that it had given way.This came to him at all
times, and lately more frequently and with a fresher, more cruel thrill
of terror, and he began to watch himself and note how he spoke, and to
repeat over what he had said to see if it were sensible, and to question
himself as to why he laughed, and at what.It was not a question of
whether it would or would not be cowardly; It was simply a necessity.He had to have rest and sleep and peace
again.He had boasted in those reckless, prosperous days that if by any
possible chance he should lose his money he would drive a hansom, or
emigrate to the colonies, or take the shilling.He had no patience in
those days with men who could not live on in adversity, and who were
found in the gun-room with a hole in their heads, and whose family asked
their polite friends to believe that a man used to firearms from his
school-days had tried to load a hair-trigger revolver with the muzzle
pointed at his forehead.He had expressed a fine contempt for those men
then, but now he had forgotten all that, and thought only of the
relief it would bring, and not how others might suffer by it.If he did
consider this, it was only to conclude that they would quite understand,
and be glad that his pain and fear were over.Then he planned a grand _coup_ which was to pay off all his debts and
give him a second chance to present himself a supplicant at his father's
house.If it failed, he would have to stop this queer feeling in his
head at once.The Grand Prix and the English horse was the final
_coup_.On this depended everything--the return of his fortunes, the
reconciliation with his father, and the possibility of meeting her
again.It was a very hot day he remembered, and very bright; but the
tall poplars on the road to the races seemed to stop growing just at
a level with his eyes.Below that it was clear enough, but all above
seemed black--as though a cloud had fallen and was hanging just over the
people's heads.He thought of speaking of this to his man Walters, who
had followed his fortunes from the first, but decided not to do so, for,
as it was, he had noticed that Walters had observed him closely of late,
and had seemed to spy upon him.The race began, and he looked through
his glass for the English horse in the front and could not find her,
and the Frenchman beside him cried, "Frou Frou!"as Frou Frou passed the
goal.He lowered his glasses slowly and unscrewed them very carefully
before dropping them back into the case; then he buckled the strap, and
turned and looked about him.Two Frenchmen who had won a hundred
francs between them were jumping and dancing at his side.He remembered
wondering why they did not speak in English.Then the sunlight changed
to a yellow, nasty glare, as though a calcium light had been turned
on the glass and colors, and he pushed his way back to his carriage,
leaning heavily on the servant's arm, and drove slowly back to Paris,
with the driver flecking his horses fretfully with his whip, for he had
wished to wait and see the end of the races.He had selected Monte Carlo as the place for it, because it was more
unlike his home than any other spot, and because one summer night, when
he had crossed the lawn from the Casino to the hotel with a gay party of
young men and women, they had come across something under a bush which
they took to be a dog or a man asleep, and one of the men had stepped
forward and touched it with his foot, and had then turned sharply and
said, "Take those girls away"; and while some hurried the women back,
frightened and curious, he and the others had picked up the body and
found it to be that of a young Russian whom they had just seen losing,
with a very bad grace, at the tables.There was no passion in his face
now, and his evening dress was quite unruffled, and only a black spot on
the shirt front showed where the powder had burnt the linen.It had
made a great impression on him then, for he was at the height of his
fortunes, with crowds of sycophantic friends and a retinue of dependents
at his heels.And now that he was quite alone and disinherited by even
these sorry companions there seemed no other escape from the pain in his
brain but to end it, and he sought this place of all others as the most
fitting place in which to die.So, after Walters had given the proper papers and checks to the
commissioner who handled his debts for him, he left Paris and took the
first train for Monte Carlo, sitting at the window of the carriage,
and beating a nervous tattoo on the pane with his ring until the old
gentleman at the other end of the compartment scowled at him.But
Harringford did not see him, nor the trees and fields as they swept by,
and it was not until Walters came and said, "You get out here, sir,"
that he recognized the yellow station and the great hotels on the hill
above.It was half-past eleven, and the lights in the Casino were still
burning brightly.He wondered whether he would have time to go over to
the hotel and write a letter to his father and to her.He decided, after
some difficult consideration, that he would not.There was nothing
to say that they did not know already, or that they would fail to
understand.But this suggested to him that what they had written to him
must be destroyed at once, before any stranger could claim the right
to read it.He took his letters from his pocket and looked them over
carefully.They all seemed to be
about money; some begged to remind him of this or that debt, of which he
had thought continuously for the last month, while others were abusive
and insolent.One was the last letter
he had received from his father just before leaving Paris, and though he
knew it by heart, he read it over again for the last time.That it came
too late, that it asked what he knew now to be impossible, made it none
the less grateful to him, but that it offered peace and a welcome home
made it all the more terrible."I came to take this step through young Hargraves, the new curate,"
his father wrote, "though he was but the instrument in the hands of
Providence.He showed me the error of my conduct toward you, and proved
to me that my duty and the inclination of my heart were toward the
same end.He read this morning for the second lesson the story of the
Prodigal Son, and I heard it without recognition and with no present
application until he came to the verse which tells how the father came
to his son 'when he was yet a great way off.'He saw him, it says, 'when
he was yet a great way off,' and ran to meet him.He did not wait for
the boy to knock at his gate and beg to be let in, but went out to meet
him, and took him in his arms and led him back to his home.Now, my boy,
my son, it seems to me as if you had never been so far off from me
as you are at this present time, as if you had never been so greatly
separated from me in every thought and interest; we are even worse than
strangers, for you think that my hand is against you, that I have closed
the door of your home to you and driven you away.But what I have done
I beg of you to forgive: to forget what I may have said in the past, and
only to think of what I say now.Your brothers are good boys and have
been good sons to me, and God knows I am thankful for such sons, and
thankful to them for bearing themselves as they have done."But, my boy, my first-born, my little Cecil, they can never be to me
what you have been.I can never feel for them as I feel for you; they
are the ninety and nine who have never wandered away upon the mountains,
and who have never been tempted, and have never left their home for
either good or evil.But you, Cecil, though you have made my heart ache
until I thought and even hoped it would stop beating, and though you
have given me many, many nights that I could not sleep, are still dearer
to me than anything else in the world.You are the flesh of my flesh and
the bone of my bone, and I cannot bear living on without you.I cannot
be at rest here, or look forward contentedly to a rest hereafter, unless
you are by me and hear me, unless I can see your face and touch you and
hear your laugh in the halls.Come back to me, Cecil; to Harringford and
the people that know you best, and know what is best in you and love you
for it.I can have only a few more years here now when you will take
my place and keep up my name.I will not be here to trouble you much
longer; but, my boy, while I am here, come to me and make me happy for
the rest of my life.I saw her only yesterday, and she asked me of you with such
splendid disregard for what the others standing by might think, and as
though she dared me or them to say or even imagine anything against you.You cannot keep away from us both much longer.Surely not; you will come
back and make us happy for the rest of our lives."The Goodwood Plunger turned his back to the lights so that the people
passing could not see his face, and tore the letter up slowly and
dropped it piece by piece over the balcony."If I could," he whispered;
"if I could."The pain was a little worse than usual just then, but it
was no longer a question of inclination.He felt only this desire to
stop these thoughts and doubts and the physical tremor that shook him.To rest and sleep, that was what he must have, and peace.There was no
peace at home or anywhere else while this thing lasted.He could not see
why they worried him in this way.He felt much
more sorry for them than for himself, but only because they could not
understand.He was quite sure that if they could feel what he suffered
they would help him, even to end it.He had been standing for some time with his back to the light, but now
he turned to face it and to take up his watch again.He felt quite
sure the lights would not burn much longer.As he turned, a woman came
forward from out the lighted hall, hovered uncertainly before him, and
then made a silent salutation, which was something between a courtesy
and a bow.That she was a woman and rather short and plainly dressed,
and that her bobbing up and down annoyed him, was all that he realized
of her presence, and he quite failed to connect her movements with
himself in any way."Sir," she said in French, "I beg your pardon,
but might I speak with you?"The Goodwood Plunger possessed a somewhat
various knowledge of Monte Carlo and its _habitues_.It was not the
first time that women who had lost at the tables had begged a napoleon
from him, or asked the distinguished child of fortune what color or
combination she should play.That, in his luckier days, had happened
often and had amused him, but now he moved back irritably and wished
that the figure in front of him would disappear as it had come."I am in great trouble, sir," the woman said."I have no friends here,
sir, to whom I may apply.I am very bold, but my anxiety is very great."The Goodwood Plunger raised his hat slightly and bowed.Then he
concentrated his eyes with what was a distinct effort on the queer
little figure hovering in front of him, and stared very hard.She wore
an odd piece of red coral for a brooch, and by looking steadily at
this he brought the rest of the figure into focus and saw, without
surprise,--for every commonplace seemed strange to him now, and
everything peculiar quite a matter of course,--that she was distinctly
not an _habituee_ of the place, and looked more like a lady's maid than
an adventuress.She was French and pretty,--such a girl as might wait in
a Duval restaurant or sit as a cashier behind a little counter near the
door."We should not be here," she said, as if in answer to his look and in
apology for her presence."But Louis, my husband, he would come.I told
him that this was not for such as we are, but Louis is so bold.He said
that upon his marriage tour he would live with the best, and so here
he must come to play as the others do.We have been married, sir, only
since Tuesday, and we must go back to Paris to-morrow; they would give
him only the three days.He is not a gambler; he plays dominos at the
cafes, it is true.He is young and with so much
spirit, and I know that you, sir, who are so fortunate and who
understand so well how to control these tables, I know that you will
persuade him.He will not listen to me; he is so greatly excited and so
little like himself.You will help me, sir, will you not?The Goodwood Plunger knit his eyebrows and closed the lids once or
twice, and forced the mistiness and pain out of his eyes.The woman seemed to be talking a great deal and to say
very much, but he could not make sense of it."I can't understand," he said wearily, turning away."It is my husband," the woman said anxiously: "Louis, he is playing at
the table inside, and he is only an apprentice to old Carbut the baker,
but he owns a third of the store.It was my _dot_ that paid for it," she
added proudly."Old Carbut says he may have it all for 20,000 francs,
and then old Carbut will retire, and we will be proprietors.We have
saved a little, and we had counted to buy the rest in five or six years
if we were very careful.""I see, I see," said the Plunger, with a little short laugh of relief;
"I understand."He was greatly comforted to think that it was not so bad
as it had threatened.He saw her distinctly now and followed what she
said quite easily, and even such a small matter as talking with this
woman seemed to help him."He is gambling," he said, "and losing the money, and you come to me to
advise him what to play.Well, tell him he will lose what
little he has left; tell him I advise him to go home; tell him--"

"No, no!"the girl said excitedly; "you do not understand; he has not
lost, he has won.He has won, oh, so many rolls of money, but he will
not stop.He has won as much as we could earn in many
months--in many years, sir, by saving and working, oh, so very hard!And
now he risks it again, and I cannot force him away.But if you, sir,
if you would tell him how great the chances are against him, if you who
know would tell him how foolish he is not to be content with what he
has, he would listen.you are a woman'; and he is
so red and fierce; he is imbecile with the sight of the money, but he
will listen to a grand gentleman like you.He thinks to win more and
more, and he thinks to buy another third from old Carbut."Oh, yes," said the Goodwood Plunger, nodding, "I see now.You want me
to take him away so that he can keep what he has.I see; but I don't
know him.He will not listen to me, you know; I have no right to
interfere."He turned away, rubbing his hand across his forehead.He wished so much
that this woman would leave him by himself."Ah, but, sir," cried the girl, desperately, and touching his coat, "you
who are so fortunate, and so rich, and of the great world, you cannot
feel what this is to me.To have my own little shop and to be free, and
not to slave, and sew, and sew until my back and fingers burn with the
pain.Speak to him, sir; ah, speak to him!It is so easy a thing to do,
and he will listen to you."The Goodwood Plunger turned again abruptly.The woman ran ahead, with a murmur of gratitude, to the open door and
pointed to where her husband was standing leaning over and placing
some money on one of the tables.He was a handsome young Frenchman,
as _bourgeois_ as his wife, and now terribly alive and excited.In the
self-contained air of the place and in contrast with the silence of the
great hall he seemed even more conspicuously out of place.The
Plunger touched him on the arm, and the Frenchman shoved the hand off
impatiently and without looking around.The Plunger touched him again
and forced him to turn toward him."Madame, your wife," said Cecil, with the grave politeness of an old
man, "has done me the honor to take me into her confidence.She tells me
that you have won a great deal of money; that you could put it to good
use at home, and so save yourselves much drudgery and debt, and all
that sort of trouble.You are quite right if you say it is no concern of
mine.But really, you know there is a great deal of sense in
what she wants, and you have apparently already won a large sum."He paused for
a second or two in some doubt, and even awe, for the disinherited
one carried the mark of a personage of consideration and of one whose
position is secure.Then he gave a short, unmirthful laugh."You are most kind, sir," he said with mock politeness and with an
impatient shrug."But madame, my wife, has not done well to interest a
stranger in this affair, which, as you say, concerns you not."He turned to the table again with a defiant swagger of independence and
placed two rolls of money upon the cloth, casting at the same moment a
childish look of displeasure at his wife."You see," said the Plunger,
with a deprecatory turning out of his hands.But there was so much grief
on the girl's face that he turned again to the gambler and touched his
arm.He could not tell why he was so interested in these two.He had
witnessed many such scenes before, and they had not affected him in any
way except to make him move out of hearing.But the same dumb numbness
in his head, which made so many things seem possible that should have
been terrible even to think upon, made him stubborn and unreasonable
over this.He felt intuitively--it could not be said that he
thought--that the woman was right and the man wrong, and so he grasped
him again by the arm, and said sharply this time:

"Come away!But even as he spoke the red won, and the Frenchman with a boyish gurgle
of pleasure raked in his winnings with his two hands, and then turned
with a happy, triumphant laugh to his wife.It is not easy to convince a
man that he is making a fool of himself when he is winning some hundred
francs every two minutes.His silent arguments to the contrary are
difficult to answer.But the Plunger did not regard this in the least.he said in the same stubborn tone and with much the
same manner with which he would have spoken to a groom.Again the Frenchman tossed off his hand, this time with an execration,
and again he placed the rolls of gold coin on the red; and again the red
won.cried the girl, running her fingers over the rolls on the
table, "he has won half of the 20,000 francs.Oh, sir, stop him, stop
him!"cried the Plunger, excited to a degree of utter
self-forgetfulness, and carried beyond himself; "you've got to come with
me.""Take away your hand," whispered the young Frenchman, fiercely."See,
I shall win it all; in one grand _coup_ I shall win it all.I shall win
five years' pay in one moment."He swept all of the money forward on the red and threw himself over the
table to see the wheel.whispered the Plunger, excitedly."If you will
risk it, risk it with some reason.You can't play all that money; they
won't take it.Six thousand francs is the limit, unless," he ran on
quickly, "you divide the 12,000 francs among the three of us.You
understand, 6,000 francs is all that any one person can play; but if you
give 4,000 to me, and 4,000 to your wife, and keep 4,000 yourself, we
can each chance it.You can back the red if you like, your wife shall
put her money on the numbers coming up below eighteen, and I will back
the odd.In that way you stand to win 24,000 francs if our combination
wins, and you lose less than if you simply back the color.cried the Frenchman, reaching for the piles of money which the
Plunger had divided rapidly into three parts, "on the red; all on the
red!""I may not know much,
but you should allow me to understand this dirty business."He caught
the Frenchman by the wrists, and the young man, more impressed with the
strange look in the boy's face than by his physical force, stood still,
while the ball rolled and rolled, and clicked merrily, and stopped, and
balanced, and then settled into the "seven.""Red, odd, and below," the croupier droned mechanically.said the Plunger, with sudden
calmness."You have won more than your 20,000 francs; you are
proprietors--I congratulate you!"cried the Frenchman, in a frenzy of delight, "I will
double it."He reached toward the fresh piles of coin as if he meant to sweep them
back again, but the Plunger put himself in his way and with a quick
movement caught up the rolls of money and dropped them into the skirt of
the woman, which she raised like an apron to receive her treasure."Now," said young Harringford, determinedly, "you come with me."The
Frenchman tried to argue and resist, but the Plunger pushed him on with
the silent stubbornness of a drunken man.He handed the woman into a
carriage at the door, shoved her husband in beside her, and while the
man drove to the address she gave him, he told the Frenchman, with an
air of a chief of police, that he must leave Monte Carlo at once, that
very night."Do you fancy I speak without
knowledge?I've seen them come here rich and go away paupers.But you
shall not; you shall keep what you have and spite them."He sent the
woman up to her room to pack while he expostulated with and browbeat
the excited bridegroom in the carriage.When she returned with the bag
packed, and so heavy with the gold that the servants could hardly lift
it up beside the driver, he ordered the coachman to go down the hill to
the station."The train for Paris leaves at midnight," he said, "and you will be
there by morning.Then you must close your bargain with this old Carbut,
and never return here again."The Frenchman had turned during the ride from an angry, indignant
prisoner to a joyful madman, and was now tearfully and effusively humble
in his petitions for pardon and in his thanks.Their benefactor, as they
were pleased to call him, hurried them into the waiting train and ran to
purchase their tickets for them."Now," he said, as the guard locked the door of the compartment, "you
are alone, and no one can get in, and you cannot get out.Go back to
your home, to your new home, and never come to this wretched place
again.Promise me--you understand?--never again!"They embraced each other like
children, and the man, pulling off his hat, called upon the good Lord to
thank the gentleman."You will be in Paris, will you not?"said the woman, in an ecstasy of
pleasure, "and you will come to see us in our own shop, will you not?we should be so greatly honored, sir, if you would visit us; if you
would come to the home you have given us.You have helped us so greatly,
sir," she said; "and may Heaven bless you!"She caught up his gloved hand as it rested on the door and kissed it
until he snatched it away in great embarrassment and flushing like a
girl.Her husband drew her toward him, and the young bride sat at
his side with her face close to his and wept tears of pleasure and of
excitement.said the young man, joyfully; "look how happy you have
made us.You have made us happy for the rest of our lives."The train moved out with a quick, heavy rush, and the car-wheels took
up the young stranger's last words and seemed to say, "You have made us
happy--made us happy for the rest of our lives."It had all come about so rapidly that the Plunger had had no time to
consider or to weigh his motives, and all that seemed real to him now,
as he stood alone on the platform of the dark, deserted station, were
the words of the man echoing and re-echoing like the refrain of the
song.And then there came to him suddenly, and with all the force of
a gambler's superstition, the thought that the words were the same as
those which his father had used in his letter, "you can make us happy
for the rest of our lives.""Ah," he said, with a quick gasp of doubt, "if I could!If I made those
poor fools happy, mayn't I live to be something to him, and to her?he cried, but so gently that one at his elbow could not have heard
him, "if I could, if I could!"He tossed up his hands, and drew them down again and clenched them in
front of him, and raised his tired, hot eyes to the calm purple sky with
its millions of moving stars.And as he lowered his head the queer numb feeling seemed to go, and
a calm came over his nerves and left him in peace.He did not know what
it might be, nor did he dare to question the change which had come to
him, but turned and slowly mounted the hill, with the awe and fear still
upon him of one who had passed beyond himself for one brief moment into
another world.When he reached his room he found his servant bending
with an anxious face over a letter which he tore up guiltily as his
master entered."You were writing to my father," said Cecil, gently,
"were you not?Well, you need not finish your letter; we are going home."I am going away from this place, Walters," he said as he pulled off his
coat and threw himself heavily on the bed."I will take the first train
that leaves here, and I will sleep a little while you put up my things.The first train, you understand--within an hour, if it leaves that
soon."His head sank back on the pillows heavily, as though he had come
in from a long, weary walk, and his eyes closed and his arms fell easily
at his side.The servant stood frightened and yet happy, with the tears
running down his cheeks, for he loved his master dearly."We are going home, Walters," the Plunger whispered drowsily."We are
going home; home to England and Harringford and the governor--and we are
going to be happy for all the rest of our lives."He paused a moment,
and Walters bent forward over the bed and held his breath to listen."For he came to me," murmured the boy, as though he was speaking in his
sleep, "when I was yet a great way off--while I was yet a great way off,
and ran to meet me--"

His voice sank until it died away into silence, and a few hours later,
when Walters came to wake him, he found his master sleeping like a child
and smiling in his sleep.THE CYNICAL MISS CATHERWAIGHT


Miss Catherwaight's collection of orders and decorations and medals was
her chief offence in the eyes of those of her dear friends who thought
her clever but cynical.All of them were willing to admit that she was clever, but some of them
said she was clever only to be unkind.Young Van Bibber had said that if Miss Catherwaight did not like dances
and days and teas, she had only to stop going to them instead of making
unpleasant remarks about those who did.So many people repeated this
that young Van Bibber believed finally that he had said something good,
and was somewhat pleased in consequence, as he was not much given to
that sort of thing.Catherwaight, while she was alive, lived solely for society, and,
so some people said, not only lived but died for it.She certainly did
go about a great deal, and she used to carry her husband away from
his library every night of every season and left him standing in
the doorways of drawing-rooms, outwardly courteous and distinguished
looking, but inwardly somnolent and unhappy.She was a born and trained
social leader, and her daughter's coming out was to have been the
greatest effort of her life.She regarded it as an event in the dear
child's lifetime second only in importance to her birth; equally
important with her probable marriage and of much more poignant interest
than her possible death.But the great effort proved too much for
the mother, and she died, fondly remembered by her peers and tenderly
referred to by a great many people who could not even show a card for
her Thursdays.Her husband and her daughter were not going out, of
necessity, for more than a year after her death, and then felt no
inclination to begin over again, but lived very much together and showed
themselves only occasionally.They entertained, though, a great deal, in the way of dinners, and
an invitation to one of these dinners soon became a diploma for
intellectual as well as social qualifications of a very high order.One was always sure of meeting some one of consideration there, which
was pleasant in itself, and also rendered it easy to let one's friends
know where one had been dining.It sounded so flat to boast abruptly, "I
dined at the Catherwaights' last night"; while it seemed only natural to
remark, "That reminds me of a story that novelist, what's his name, told
at Mr.Catherwaight's," or "That English chap, who's been in Africa, was
at the Catherwaights' the other night, and told me--"

After one of these dinners people always asked to be allowed to look
over Miss Catherwaight's collection, of which almost everybody had
heard.It consisted of over a hundred medals and decorations which Miss
Catherwaight had purchased while on the long tours she made with her
father in all parts of the world.Each of them had been given as a
reward for some public service, as a recognition of some virtue of the
highest order--for personal bravery, for statesmanship, for great genius
in the arts; and each had been pawned by the recipient or sold outright.Miss Catherwaight referred to them as her collection of dishonored
honors, and called them variously her Orders of the Knights of the
Almighty Dollar, pledges to patriotism and the pawnshops, and honors at
second-hand.It was her particular fad to get as many of these together as she could
and to know the story of each.The less creditable the story, the more
highly she valued the medal.People might think it was not a pretty
hobby for a young girl, but they could not help smiling at the stories
and at the scorn with which she told them."These," she would say, "are crosses of the Legion of Honor; they are of
the lowest degree, that of chevalier.I keep them in this cigar box to
show how cheaply I got them and how cheaply I hold them.I think you
can get them here in New York for ten dollars; they cost more than
that--about a hundred francs--in Paris.The
French government can imprison you, you know, for ten years, if you wear
one without the right to do so, but they have no punishment for those
who choose to part with them for a mess of pottage."All these," she would run on, "are English war medals.See, on this one
is 'Alma,' 'Balaclava,' and 'Sebastopol.'He was quite a veteran, was he
not?Well, he sold this to a dealer on Wardour Street, London, for five
and six.You can get any number of them on the Bowery for their weight
in silver.I tried very hard to get a Victoria Cross when I was in
England, and I only succeeded in getting this one after a great deal of
trouble.They value the cross so highly, you know, that it is the only
other decoration in the case which holds the Order of the Garter in the
Jewel Room at the Tower.It is made of copper, so that its intrinsic
value won't have any weight with the man who gets it, but I bought this
nevertheless for five pounds.The soldier to whom it belonged had loaded
and fired a cannon all alone when the rest of the men about the battery
had run away.He was captured by the enemy, but retaken immediately
afterward by re-enforcements from his own side, and the general in
command recommended him to the Queen for decoration.He sold his cross
to the proprietor of a curiosity shop and drank himself to death.I felt
rather meanly about keeping it and hunted up his widow to return it to
her, but she said I could have it for a consideration."This gold medal was given, as you see, to 'Hiram J. Stillman, of the
sloop _Annie Barker_, for saving the crew of the steamship _Olivia_,
June 18, 1888,' by the President of the United States and both houses of
Congress.I found it on Baxter Street in a pawnshop.The gallant Hiram
J. had pawned it for sixteen dollars and never came back to claim it.""But, Miss Catherwaight," some optimist would object, "these men
undoubtedly did do something brave and noble once.You can't get back
of that; and they didn't do it for a medal, either, but because it was
their duty.And so the medal meant nothing to them: their conscience
told them they had done the right thing; they didn't need a stamped coin
to remind them of it, or of their wounds, either, perhaps.""Quite right; that's quite true," Miss Catherwaight would say.Look at this gold medal with the diamonds: 'Presented to
Colonel James F. Placer by the men of his regiment, in camp before
Richmond.'Every soldier in the regiment gave something toward that, and
yet the brave gentleman put it up at a game of poker one night, and the
officer who won it sold it to the man who gave it to me.Miss Catherwaight was well known to the proprietors of the pawnshops and
loan offices on the Bowery and Park Row.They learned to look for her
once a month, and saved what medals they received for her and tried to
learn their stories from the people who pawned them, or else invented
some story which they hoped would answer just as well.Though her brougham produced a sensation in the unfashionable streets
into which she directed it, she was never annoyed.Her maid went with
her into the shops, and one of the grooms always stood at the door
within call, to the intense delight of the neighborhood.And one day she
found what, from her point of view, was a perfect gem.It was a poor,
cheap-looking, tarnished silver medal, a half-dollar once, undoubtedly,
beaten out roughly into the shape of a heart and engraved in script by
the jeweller of some country town.On one side were two clasped hands
with a wreath around them, and on the reverse was this inscription:
"From Henry Burgoyne to his beloved friend Lewis L. Lockwood"; and
below, "Through prosperity and adversity."And here it
was among razors and pistols and family Bibles in a pawnbroker's window.These two boy friends, and their boyish
friendship that was to withstand adversity and prosperity, and all that
remained of it was this inscription to its memory like the wording on a
tomb!"He couldn't have got so much on it any way," said the pawnbroker,
entering into her humor."I didn't lend him more'n a quarter of a dollar
at the most."Miss Catherwaight stood wondering if the Lewis L. Lockwood could be
Lewis Lockwood, the lawyer one read so much about.Then she remembered
his middle name was Lyman, and said quickly, "I'll take it, please."She stepped into the carriage, and told the man to go find a directory
and look for Lewis Lyman Lockwood.The groom returned in a few minutes
and said there was such a name down in the book as a lawyer, and that
his office was such a number on Broadway; it must be near Liberty."Go
there," said Miss Catherwaight.Her determination was made so quickly that they had stopped in front of
a huge pile of offices, sandwiched in, one above the other, until they
towered mountains high, before she had quite settled in her mind what
she wanted to know, or had appreciated how strange her errand might
appear.Lockwood was out, one of the young men in the outer office
said, but the junior partner, Mr.Latimer, was in and would see her.She had only time to remember that the junior partner was a dancing
acquaintance of hers, before young Mr.Latimer stood before her smiling,
and with her card in his hand.Lockwood is out just at present, Miss Catherwaight," he said, "but
he will be back in a moment.Won't you come into the other room and
wait?I'm sure he won't be away over five minutes.She saw that he was surprised to see her, and a little ill at ease as
to just how to take her visit.He tried to make it appear that he
considered it the most natural thing in the world, but he overdid it,
and she saw that her presence was something quite out of the common.This did not tend to set her any more at her ease.She already regretted
the step she had taken.What if it should prove to be the same Lockwood,
she thought, and what would they think of her?Lockwood," she said, as she
followed him into the inner office."I fear I have come upon a very
foolish errand, and one that has nothing at all to do with the law.""Not a breach of promise suit, then?""Perhaps it is only an innocent subscription to a most worthy charity.I
was afraid at first," he went on lightly, "that it was legal redress you
wanted, and I was hoping that the way I led the Courdert's cotillion
had made you think I could conduct you through the mazes of the law as
well.""No," returned Miss Catherwaight, with a nervous laugh; "it has to do
with my unfortunate collection.This is what brought me here," she said,
holding out the silver medal."I came across it just now in the Bowery.The name was the same, and I thought it just possible Mr.Lockwood would
like to have it; or, to tell you the truth, that he might tell me what
had become of the Henry Burgoyne who gave it to him."Young Latimer had the medal in his hand before she had finished
speaking, and was examining it carefully.He looked up with just a touch
of color in his cheeks and straightened himself visibly."Please don't be offended," said the fair collector.You've heard of my stupid collection, and I know you think
I meant to add this to it.But, indeed, now that I have had time to
think--you see I came here immediately from the pawnshop, and I was
so interested, like all collectors, you know, that I didn't stop to
consider.That's the worst of a hobby; it carries one rough-shod over
other people's feelings, and runs away with one.I beg of you, if you do
know anything about the coin, just to keep it and don't tell me, and I
assure you what little I know I will keep quite to myself."Young Latimer bowed, and stood looking at her curiously, with the medal
in his hand."I hardly know what to say," he began slowly.You say you found this on the Bowery, in a pawnshop.Well, of
course, you know Mr.Miss Catherwaight shook her head vehemently and smiled in deprecation."This medal was in his safe when he lived on Thirty-fifth Street at
the time he was robbed, and the burglars took this with the rest of the
silver and pawned it, I suppose.Lockwood would have given more for
it than any one else could have afforded to pay."He paused a moment,
and then continued more rapidly: "Henry Burgoyne is Judge Burgoyne.Lockwood and he were friends when they
were boys.They were Damon
and Pythias and that sort of thing.They roomed together at the State
college and started to practise law in Tuckahoe as a firm, but they made
nothing of it, and came on to New York and began reading law again with
Fuller & Mowbray.It was while they were at school that they had these
medals made.There was a mate to this, you know; Judge Burgoyne had it.Well, they continued to live and work together.They were both orphans
and dependent on themselves.I suppose that was one of the strongest
bonds between them; and they knew no one in New York, and always spent
their spare time together.They were pretty poor, I fancy, from all
Mr.Lockwood has told me, but they were very ambitious.They were--I'm
telling you this, you understand, because it concerns you somewhat:
well, more or less.They were great sportsmen, and whenever they could
get away from the law office they would go off shooting.I think they
were fonder of each other than brothers even.Lockwood
tell of the days they lay in the rushes along the Chesapeake Bay waiting
for duck.He has said often that they were the happiest hours of his
life.That was their greatest pleasure, going off together after duck or
snipe along the Maryland waters.Well, they grew rich and began to know
people; and then they met a girl.It seems they both thought a great
deal of her, as half the New York men did, I am told; and she was the
reigning belle and toast, and had other admirers, and neither met with
that favor she showed--well, the man she married, for instance.But for
a while each thought, for some reason or other, that he was especially
favored.Lockwood never spoke of it
to me.But they both fell very deeply in love with her, and each thought
the other disloyal, and so they quarrelled; and--and then, though the
woman married, the two men kept apart.It was the one great passion
of their lives, and both were proud, and each thought the other in the
wrong, and so they have kept apart ever since.And--well, I believe that
is all."Miss Catherwaight had listened in silence and with one little gloved
hand tightly clasping the other.Latimer, indeed," she began, tremulously, "I am terribly
ashamed of myself.I seemed to have rushed in where angels fear to
tread.Of course I might
have known there was a woman in the case, it adds so much to the story.But I suppose I must give up my medal.I never could tell that story,
could I?""No," said young Latimer, dryly; "I wouldn't if I were you."Something in his tone, and something in the fact that he seemed to avoid
her eyes, made her drop the lighter vein in which she had been speaking,
and rise to go.There was much that he had not told her, she suspected,
and when she bade him good-by it was with a reserve which she had not
shown at any other time during their interview.she murmured, as young Latimer turned
from the brougham door and said "Home," to the groom.She thought about
it a great deal that afternoon; at times she repented that she had given
up the medal, and at times she blushed that she should have been carried
in her zeal into such an unwarranted intimacy with another's story.She determined finally to ask her father about it.He would be sure to
know, she thought, as he and Mr.Then
she decided finally not to say anything about it at all, for Mr.Catherwaight did not approve of the collection of dishonored honors
as it was, and she had no desire to prejudice him still further by a
recital of her afternoon's adventure, of which she had no doubt but he
would also disapprove.So she was more than usually silent during
the dinner, which was a tete-a-tete family dinner that night, and she
allowed her father to doze after it in the library in his great chair
without disturbing him with either questions or confessions.{Illustration with caption: "What can Mr.Lockwood be calling upon me
about?"}They had been sitting there some time, he with his hands folded on the
evening paper and with his eyes closed, when the servant brought in a
card and offered it to Mr.Catherwaight fumbled
over his glasses, and read the name on the card aloud: "'Mr.Miss Catherwaight sat upright, and reached out for the card with a
nervous, gasping little laugh."Oh, I think it must be for me," she said; "I'm quite sure it is
intended for me.I was at his office to-day, you see, to return him some
keepsake of his that I found in an old curiosity shop.Something with
his name on it that had been stolen from him and pawned.You needn't go down, dear; I'll see him.It was I he asked for,
I'm sure; was it not, Morris?"Morris was not quite sure; being such an old gentleman, he thought it
must be for Mr.He did not like to disturb
his after-dinner nap, and he settled back in his chair again and
refolded his hands."I hardly thought he could have come to see me," he murmured, drowsily;
"though I used to see enough and more than enough of Lewis Lockwood
once, my dear," he added with a smile, as he opened his eyes and nodded
before he shut them again."That was before your mother and I were
engaged, and people did say that young Lockwood's chances at that time
were as good as mine.He was very attentive,
though; _very_ attentive."Miss Catherwaight stood startled and motionless at the door from which
she had turned.she asked quickly, and in a very low voice.Catherwaight did not deign to open his eyes this time, but moved his
head uneasily as if he wished to be let alone."To your mother, of course, my child," he answered; "of whom else was I
speaking?"Miss Catherwaight went down the stairs to the drawing-room slowly, and
paused half-way to allow this new suggestion to settle in her mind.There was something distasteful to her, something that seemed not
altogether unblamable, in a woman's having two men quarrel about her,
neither of whom was the woman's husband.And yet this girl of whom
Latimer had spoken must be her mother, and she, of course, could do no
wrong.It was very disquieting, and she went on down the rest of the way
with one hand resting heavily on the railing and with the other pressed
against her cheeks.It now seemed to her very
sad indeed that these two one-time friends should live in the same city
and meet, as they must meet, and not recognize each other.She argued
that her mother must have been very young when it happened, or she would
have brought two such men together again.Her mother could not have
known, she told herself; she was not to blame.For she felt sure that
had she herself known of such an accident she would have done something,
said something, to make it right.And she was not half the woman her
mother had been, she was sure of that.There was something very likable in the old gentleman who came forward
to greet her as she entered the drawing-room; something courtly and of
the old school, of which she was so tired of hearing, but of which she
wished she could have seen more in the men she met.Latimer
had accompanied his guardian, exactly why she did not see, but she
recognized his presence slightly.He seemed quite content to remain in
the background.Lockwood, as she had expected, explained that he had
called to thank her for the return of the medal.He had it in his hand
as he spoke, and touched it gently with the tips of his fingers as
though caressing it."I knew your father very well," said the lawyer, "and I at one time had
the honor of being one of your mother's younger friends.That was before
she was married, many years ago."He stopped and regarded the girl
gravely and with a touch of tenderness."You will pardon an old man, old
enough to be your father, if he says," he went on, "that you are greatly
like your mother, my dear young lady--greatly like.Your mother was
very kind to me, and I fear I abused her kindness; abused it by
misunderstanding it.There was a great deal of misunderstanding; and
I was proud, and my friend was proud, and so the misunderstanding
continued, until now it has become irretrievable."He had forgotten her presence apparently, and was speaking more to
himself than to her as he stood looking down at the medal in his hand."You were very thoughtful to give me this," he continued; "it was very
good of you.I don't know why I should keep it though, now, although I
was distressed enough when I lost it.But now it is only a reminder of
a time that is past and put away, but which was very, very dear to me.Perhaps I should tell you that I had a misunderstanding with the friend
who gave it to me, and since then we have never met; have ceased to
know each other.But I have always followed his life as a judge and as a
lawyer, and respected him for his own sake as a man.I cannot tell--I do
not know how he feels toward me."The old lawyer turned the medal over in his hand and stood looking down
at it wistfully.The cynical Miss Catherwaight could not stand it any longer.Lockwood," she said, impulsively, "Mr.Latimer has told me why
you and your friend separated, and I cannot bear to think that it
was she--my mother--should have been the cause.She could not have
understood; she must have been innocent of any knowledge of the trouble
she had brought to men who were such good friends of hers and to each
other.It seems to me as though my finding that coin is more than a
coincidence.I somehow think that the daughter is to help undo the harm
that her mother has caused--unwittingly caused.Keep the medal and don't
give it back to me, for I am sure your friend has kept his, and I am
sure he is still your friend at heart.Don't think I am speaking hastily
or that I am thoughtless in what I am saying, but it seems to me as if
friends--good, true friends--were so few that one cannot let them go
without a word to bring them back.But though I am only a girl, and a
very light and unfeeling girl, some people think, I feel this very
much, and I do wish I could bring your old friend back to you again as I
brought back his pledge.""It has been many years since Henry Burgoyne and I have met," said the
old man, slowly, "and it would be quite absurd to think that he still
holds any trace of that foolish, boyish feeling of loyalty that we once
had for each other.Yet I will keep this, if you will let me, and I
thank you, my dear young lady, for what you have said.I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.You are as good and as kind as your mother was,
and--I can say nothing, believe me, in higher praise."He rose slowly and made a movement as if to leave the room, and then,
as if the excitement of this sudden return into the past could not
be shaken off so readily, he started forward with a move of sudden
determination."I think," he said, "I will go to Henry Burgoyne's house at once,
to-night.I will see if this has
or has not been one long, unprofitable mistake.If my visit should
be fruitless, I will send you this coin to add to your collection of
dishonored honors, but if it should result as I hope it may, it will be
your doing, Miss Catherwaight, and two old men will have much to thank
you for.Good-night," he said as he bowed above her hand, "and--God
bless you!"Miss Catherwaight flushed slightly at what he had said, and sat looking
down at the floor for a moment after the door had closed behind him.Latimer moved uneasily in his chair.The routine of the office
had been strangely disturbed that day, and he now failed to recognize
in the girl before him with reddened cheeks and trembling eyelashes the
cold, self-possessed young woman of society whom he had formerly known."You have done very well, if you will let me say so," he began, gently."I hope you are right in what you said, and that Mr.Lockwood will not
meet with a rebuff or an ungracious answer.Why," he went on quickly, "I
have seen him take out his gun now every spring and every fall for the
last ten years and clean and polish it and tell what great shots he and
Henry, as he calls him, used to be.And then he would say he would take
a holiday and get off for a little shooting.He would
put the gun back into its case again and mope in his library for days
afterward.You see, he never married, and though he adopted me, in a
manner, and is fond of me in a certain way, no one ever took the place
in his heart his old friend had held.""You will let me know, will you not, at once,--to-night, even,--whether
he succeeds or not?""You can
understand why I am so deeply interested.I see now why you said I
would not tell the story of that medal.But, after all, it may be the
prettiest story, the only pretty story I have to tell."Lockwood had not returned, the man said, when young Latimer reached
the home the lawyer had made for them both.He did not know what to
argue from this, but determined to sit up and wait, and so sat smoking
before the fire and listening with his sense of hearing on a strain for
the first movement at the door.The front door shut with a clash, and he heard
Mr.Lockwood crossing the hall quickly to the library, in which he
waited.Then the inner door was swung back, and Mr.Lockwood came in
with his head high and his eyes smiling brightly.There was something in his step that had not been there before,
something light and vigorous, and he looked ten years younger.He
crossed the room to his writing-table without speaking and began tossing
the papers about on his desk.Then he closed the rolling-top lid with a
snap and looked up smiling."I shall have to ask you to look after things at the office for a little
while," he said."Judge Burgoyne and I are going to Maryland for a few
weeks' shooting."VAN BIBBER AND THE SWAN-BOATS


It was very hot in the Park, and young Van Bibber, who has a good heart
and a great deal more money than good-hearted people generally get, was
cross and somnolent.He had told his groom to bring a horse he wanted to
try to the Fifty-ninth Street entrance at ten o'clock, and the groom had
not appeared.He waited as long as his dignity would allow, and then turned off into
a by-lane end dropped on a bench and looked gloomily at the Lohengrin
swans with the paddle-wheel attachment that circle around the lake.They struck him as the most idiotic inventions he had ever seen, and he
pitied, with the pity of a man who contemplates crossing the ocean to
be measured for his fall clothes, the people who could find delight in
having some one paddle them around an artificial lake.Two little girls from the East Side, with a lunch basket, and an older
girl with her hair down her back, sat down on a bench beside him and
gazed at the swans.The place was becoming too popular, and Van Bibber decided to move on.But the bench on which he sat was in the shade, and the asphalt walk
leading to the street was in the sun, and his cigarette was soothing,
so he ignored the near presence of the three little girls, and remained
where he was."I s'pose," said one of the two little girls, in a high, public school
voice, "there's lots to see from those swan-boats that youse can't see
from the banks.""Oh, lots," assented the girl with long hair."If you walked all round the lake, clear all the way round, you could
see all there is to see," said the third, "except what there's in the
middle where the island is.""I guess it's mighty wild on that island," suggested the youngest."Eddie Case he took a trip around the lake on a swan-boat the other day.He said youse could see fishes and ducks, and
that it looked just as if there were snakes and things on the island."asked the other one, in a hushed voice."Well, wild things," explained the elder, vaguely; "bears and animals
like that, that grow in wild places."Van Bibber lit a fresh cigarette, and settled himself comfortably and
unreservedly to listen."My, but I'd like to take a trip just once," said the youngest,
under her breath.Then she clasped her fingers together and looked up
anxiously at the elder girl, who glanced at her with severe reproach.Ain't you having a good time
'nuff without wishing for everything you set your eyes on?"Van Bibber wondered at this--why humans should want to ride around on
the swans in the first place, and why, if they had such a wild desire,
they should not gratify it."Why, it costs more'n it costs to come all the way up town in an open
car," added the elder girl, as if in answer to his unspoken question.The younger girl sighed at this, and nodded her head in submission, but
blinked longingly at the big swans and the parti- awning and the
red seats."I beg your pardon," said Van Bibber, addressing himself uneasily to
the eldest girl with long hair, "but if the little girl would like to go
around in one of those things, and--and hasn't brought the change with
her, you know, I'm sure I should be very glad if she'd allow me to send
her around."exclaimed the little girl, with a jump, and so sharply
and in such a shrill voice that Van Bibber shuddered."I'm afraid maw wouldn't like our taking money from any one we didn't
know," she said with dignity; "but if you're going anyway and want
company--"

"Oh!my, no," said Van Bibber, hurriedly.He tried to picture himself
riding around the lake behind a tin swan with three little girls from
the East Side, and a lunch basket."Then," said the head of the trio, "we can't go."There was such a look of uncomplaining acceptance of this verdict on
the part of the two little girls, that Van Bibber felt uncomfortable.He
looked to the right and to the left, and then said desperately,
"Well, come along."The young man in a blue flannel shirt, who did the
paddling, smiled at Van Bibber's riding-breeches, which were so very
loose at one end and so very tight at the other, and at his gloves
and crop.The three little girls
placed the awful lunch basket on the front seat and sat on the middle
one, and Van Bibber cowered in the back.They were hushed in silent
ecstasy when it started, and gave little gasps of pleasure when it
careened slightly in turning.It was shady under the awning, and the
motion was pleasant enough, but Van Bibber was so afraid some one would
see him that he failed to enjoy it.But as soon as they passed into the narrow straits and were shut in by
the bushes and were out of sight of the people, he relaxed, and began to
play the host.He pointed out the fishes among the rocks at the edges
of the pool, and the sparrows and robins bathing and ruffling
their feathers in the shallow water, and agreed with them about the
possibility of bears, and even tigers, in the wild part of the island,
although the glimpse of the gray helmet of a Park policeman made such a
supposition doubtful.And it really seemed as though they were enjoying it more than he
ever enjoyed a trip up the Sound on a yacht or across the ocean on a
record-breaking steamship.It seemed long enough before they got back to
Van Bibber, but his guests were evidently but barely satisfied.Still,
all the goodness in his nature would not allow him to go through that
ordeal again.He stepped out of the boat eagerly and helped out the girl with long
hair as though she had been a princess and tipped the rude young man
who had laughed at him, but who was perspiring now with the work he had
done; and then as he turned to leave the dock he came face to face with
A Girl He Knew and Her brother.Her brother said, "How're you, Van Bibber?Been taking a trip around
the world in eighty minutes?"And added in a low voice, "Introduce me to
your young lady friends from Hester Street.""Ah, how're you--quite a surprise!"gasped Van Bibber, while his late
guests stared admiringly at the pretty young lady in the riding-habit,
and utterly refused to move on."Been taking ride on the lake,"
stammered Van Bibber; "most exhilarating.Young friends of mine--these
young ladies never rode on lake, so I took 'em."Oh, yes, we saw you," said Her brother, dryly, while she only smiled at
him, but so kindly and with such perfect understanding that Van Bibber
grew red with pleasure and bought three long strings of tickets for the
swans at some absurd discount, and gave each little girl a string."There," said Her brother to the little ladies from Hester Street, "now
you can take trips for a week without stopping.Don't try to smuggle in
any laces, and don't forget to fee the smoking-room steward."The Girl He Knew said they were walking over to the stables, and that
he had better go get his other horse and join her, which was to be his
reward for taking care of the young ladies.And the three little girls
proceeded to use up the yards of tickets so industriously that they were
sunburned when they reached the tenement, and went to bed dreaming of
a big white swan, and a beautiful young gentleman in patent-leather
riding-boots and baggy breeches.VAN BIBBER'S BURGLAR


There had been a dance up town, but as Van Bibber could not find Her
there, he accepted young Travers's suggestion to go over to Jersey City
and see a "go" between "Dutchy" Mack and a <DW52> person professionally
known as the Black Diamond.They covered up all signs of their evening
dress with their great-coats, and filled their pockets with cigars, for
the smoke which surrounds a "go" is trying to sensitive nostrils, and
they also fastened their watches to both key-chains.Alf Alpin, who was
acting as master of ceremonies, was greatly pleased and flattered
at their coming, and boisterously insisted on their sitting on the
platform.The fact was generally circulated among the spectators that
the "two gents in high hats" had come in a carriage, and this and their
patent-leather boots made them objects of keen interest.It was even
whispered that they were the "parties" who were putting up the money
to back the Black Diamond against the "Hester Street Jackson."This in
itself entitled them to respect.Van Bibber was asked to hold the watch,
but he wisely declined the honor, which was given to Andy Spielman, the
sporting reporter of the _Track and Ring_, whose watch-case was covered
with diamonds, and was just the sort of a watch a timekeeper should
hold.It was two o'clock before "Dutchy" Mack's backer threw the sponge
into the air, and three before they reached the city.They had another
reporter in the cab with them besides the gentleman who had bravely
held the watch in the face of several offers to "do for" him; and as
Van Bibber was ravenously hungry, and as he doubted that he could get
anything at that hour at the club, they accepted Spielman's invitation
and went for a porterhouse steak and onions at the Owl's Nest, Gus
McGowan's all-night restaurant on Third Avenue.It was a very dingy, dirty place, but it was as warm as the engine-room
of a steamboat, and the steak was perfectly done and tender.It was
too late to go to bed, so they sat around the table, with their chairs
tipped back and their knees against its edge.The two club men had
thrown off their great-coats, and their wide shirt fronts and silk
facings shone grandly in the smoky light of the oil lamps and the
red glow from the grill in the corner.They talked about the life the
reporters led, and the Philistines asked foolish questions, which the
gentleman of the press answered without showing them how foolish they
were."And I suppose you have all sorts of curious adventures," said Van
Bibber, tentatively."Well, no, not what I would call adventures," said one of the reporters."I have never seen anything that could not be explained or attributed
directly to some known cause, such as crime or poverty or drink.You may
think at first that you have stumbled on something strange and romantic,
but it comes to nothing.You would suppose that in a great city like
this one would come across something that could not be explained away
something mysterious or out of the common, like Stevenson's Suicide
Club.Dickens once told James Payn that the
most curious thing he ever saw In his rambles around London was a ragged
man who stood crouching under the window of a great house where the
owner was giving a ball.While the man hid beneath a window on the
ground floor, a woman wonderfully dressed and very beautiful raised the
sash from the inside and dropped her bouquet down into the man's hand,
and he nodded and stuck it under his coat and ran off with it."I call that, now, a really curious thing to see.But I have never come
across anything like it, and I have been in every part of this big city,
and at every hour of the night and morning, and I am not lacking in
imagination either, but no captured maidens have ever beckoned to me
from barred windows nor 'white hands waved from a passing hansom.'Balzac and De Musset and Stevenson suggest that they have had such
adventures, but they never come to me.It is all commonplace and vulgar,
and always ends in a police court or with a 'found drowned' in the North
River."McGowan, who had fallen into a doze behind the bar, woke suddenly and
shivered and rubbed his shirt-sleeves briskly.A woman knocked at the
side door and begged for a drink "for the love of heaven," and the man
who tended the grill told her to be off.They could hear her feeling
her way against the wall and cursing as she staggered out of the alley.Three men came in with a hack driver and wanted everybody to drink
with them, and became insolent when the gentlemen declined, and were
in consequence hustled out one at a time by McGowan, who went to sleep
again immediately, with his head resting among the cigar boxes and
pyramids of glasses at the back of the bar, and snored."You see," said the reporter, "it is all like this.Night in a great
city is not picturesque and it is not theatrical.It is sodden,
sometimes brutal, exciting enough until you get used to it, but it runs
in a groove.It is dramatic, but the plot is old and the motives and
characters always the same."The rumble of heavy market wagons and the rattle of milk carts told
them that it was morning, and as they opened the door the cold fresh
air swept into the place and made them wrap their collars around
their throats and stamp their feet.The morning wind swept down the
cross-street from the East River and the lights of the street lamps and
of the saloon looked old and tawdry.Travers and the reporter went off
to a Turkish bath, and the gentleman who held the watch, and who had
been asleep for the last hour, dropped into a nighthawk and told the
man to drive home.It was almost clear now and very cold, and Van Bibber
determined to walk.He had the strange feeling one gets when one stays
up until the sun rises, of having lost a day somewhere, and the dance
he had attended a few hours before seemed to have come off long ago, and
the fight in Jersey City was far back in the past.The houses along the cross-street through which he walked were as dead
as so many blank walls, and only here and there a lace curtain waved out
of the open window where some honest citizen was sleeping.The street
was quite deserted; not even a cat or a policeman moved on it and Van
Bibber's footsteps sounded brisk on the sidewalk.There was a great
house at the corner of the avenue and the cross-street on which he was
walking.The house faced the avenue and a stone wall ran back to the
brown stone stable which opened on the side street.There was a door
in this wall, and as Van Bibber approached it on his solitary walk it
opened cautiously, and a man's head appeared in it for an instant and
was withdrawn again like a flash, and the door snapped to.Van Bibber
stopped and looked at the door and at the house and up and down the
street.The house was tightly closed, as though some one was lying
inside dead, and the streets were still empty.Van Bibber could think of nothing in his appearance so dreadful as to
frighten an honest man, so he decided the face he had had a glimpse of
must belong to a dishonest one.It was none of his business, he assured
himself, but it was curious, and he liked adventure, and he would
have liked to prove his friend the reporter, who did not believe in
adventure, in the wrong.So he approached the door silently, and jumped
and caught at the top of the wall and stuck one foot on the handle of
the door, and, with the other on the knocker, drew himself up and looked
cautiously down on the other side.He had done this so lightly that the
only noise he made was the rattle of the door-knob on which his foot had
rested, and the man inside thought that the one outside was trying to
open the door, and placed his shoulder to it and pressed against it
heavily.Van Bibber, from his perch on the top of the wall, looked down
directly on the other's head and shoulders.He could see the top of the
man's head only two feet below, and he also saw that in one hand he
held a revolver and that two bags filled with projecting articles of
different sizes lay at his feet.It did not need explanatory notes to tell Van Bibber that the man below
had robbed the big house on the corner, and that if it had not been for
his having passed when he did the burglar would have escaped with his
treasure.His first thought was that he was not a policeman, and that a
fight with a burglar was not in his line of life; and this was followed
by the thought that though the gentleman who owned the property in the
two bags was of no interest to him, he was, as a respectable member of
society, more entitled to consideration than the man with the revolver.The fact that he was now, whether he liked it or not, perched on the top
of the wall like Humpty Dumpty, and that the burglar might see him
and shoot him the next minute, had also an immediate influence on his
movements.So he balanced himself cautiously and noiselessly and dropped
upon the man's head and shoulders, bringing him down to the flagged walk
with him and under him.The revolver went off once in the struggle, but
before the burglar could know how or from where his assailant had come,
Van Bibber was standing up over him and had driven his heel down on his
hand and kicked the pistol out of his fingers.Then he stepped quickly
to where it lay and picked it up and said, "Now, if you try to get up
I'll shoot at you."He felt an unwarranted and ill-timedly humorous
inclination to add, "and I'll probably miss you," but subdued it.The
burglar, much to Van Bibber's astonishment, did not attempt to rise, but
sat up with his hands locked across his knees and said: "Shoot ahead.His teeth were set and his face desperate and bitter, and hopeless to a
degree of utter hopelessness that Van Bibber had never imagined."Go ahead," reiterated the man, doggedly, "I won't move.Van Bibber felt the pistol loosening
in his hand, and he was conscious of a strong inclination to lay it down
and ask the burglar to tell him all about it."You haven't got much heart," said Van Bibber, finally."You're a pretty
poor sort of a burglar, I should say.""I won't go back--I won't go
back there alive.I've served my time forever in that hole.If I have to
go back again--s'help me if I don't do for a keeper and die for it.But
I won't serve there no more."asked Van Bibber, gently, and greatly interested; "to
prison?"cried the man, hoarsely: "to a grave.Look at my face," he said, "and look at my hair.That ought to tell you
where I've been.With all the color gone out of my skin, and all the
life out of my legs.I couldn't hurt you if
I wanted to.I'm a skeleton and a baby, I am.And
now you're going to send me back again for another lifetime.For twenty
years, this time, into that cold, forsaken hole, and after I done my
time so well and worked so hard."Van Bibber shifted the pistol from one
hand to the other and eyed his prisoner doubtfully.he asked, seating himself on the steps
of the kitchen and holding the revolver between his knees.The sun was
driving the morning mist away, and he had forgotten the cold."I got out yesterday," said the man.Van Bibber glanced at the bags and lifted the revolver."You didn't
waste much time," he said."No," answered the man, sullenly, "no, I didn't.I knew this place and
I wanted money to get West to my folks, and the Society said I'd have to
wait until I earned it, and I couldn't wait.I haven't seen my wife
for seven years, nor my daughter.Seven years, young man; think of
that--seven years.Seven years without
seeing your wife or your child!And they're straight people, they are,"
he added, hastily."My wife moved West after I was put away and took
another name, and my girl never knew nothing about me.I was to join 'em,
and I thought I could lift enough here to get the fare, and now," he
added, dropping his face in his hands, "I've got to go back.And I had
meant to live straight after I got West,--God help me, but I did!An' I don't care whether you believe
it or not neither," he added, fiercely."I didn't say whether I believed it or not," answered Van Bibber, with
grave consideration.He eyed the man for a brief space without speaking, and the burglar
looked back at him, doggedly and defiantly, and with not the faintest
suggestion of hope in his eyes, or of appeal for mercy.Perhaps it was
because of this fact, or perhaps it was the wife and child that moved
Van Bibber, but whatever his motives were, he acted on them promptly."I
suppose, though," he said, as though speaking to himself, "that I ought
to give you up.""I'll never go back alive," said the burglar, quietly."Well, that's bad, too," said Van Bibber."Of course I don't know
whether you're lying or not, and as to your meaning to live honestly, I
very much doubt it; but I'll give you a ticket to wherever your wife is,
and I'll see you on the train.And you can get off at the next station
and rob my house to-morrow night, if you feel that way about it.Throw
those bags inside that door where the servant will see them before the
milkman does, and walk on out ahead of me, and keep your hands in your
pockets, and don't try to run.The man placed the bags inside the kitchen door; and, with a doubtful
look at his custodian, stepped out into the street, and walked, as he
was directed to do, toward the Grand Central station.Van Bibber kept
just behind him, and kept turning the question over in his mind as to
what he ought to do.He felt very guilty as he passed each policeman,
but he recovered himself when he thought of the wife and child who lived
in the West, and who were "straight."asked Van Bibber, as he stood at the ticket-office window."Helena, Montana," answered the man with, for the first time, a look of
relief.Van Bibber bought the ticket and handed it to the burglar."I
suppose you know," he said, "that you can sell that at a place down town
for half the money.""Yes, I know that," said the burglar.There was a
half-hour before the train left, and Van Bibber took his charge into the
restaurant and watched him eat everything placed before him, with his
eyes glancing all the while to the right or left.Then Van Bibber gave
him some money and told him to write to him, and shook hands with him.The man nodded eagerly and pulled off his hat as the car drew out of
the station; and Van Bibber came down town again with the shop girls and
clerks going to work, still wondering if he had done the right thing.He went to his rooms and changed his clothes, took a cold bath, and
crossed over to Delmonico's for his breakfast, and, while the waiter
laid the cloth in the cafe, glanced at the headings in one of the
papers.He scanned first with polite interest the account of the dance
on the night previous and noticed his name among those present.With
greater interest he read of the fight between "Dutchy" Mack and the
"Black Diamond," and then he read carefully how "Abe" Hubbard, alias
"Jimmie the Gent," a burglar, had broken jail in New Jersey, and had
been traced to New York.There was a description of the man, and Van
Bibber breathed quickly as he read it."The detectives have a clew of
his whereabouts," the account said; "if he is still in the city they are
confident of recapturing him.But they fear that the same friends who
helped him to break jail will probably assist him from the country or to
get out West.""They may do that," murmured Van Bibber to himself, with a smile of grim
contentment; "they probably will."Then he said to the waiter, "Oh, I don't know.Some bacon and eggs and
green things and coffee."VAN BIBBER AS BEST MAN


Young Van Bibber came up to town in June from Newport to see his lawyer
about the preparation of some papers that needed his signature.He found
the city very hot and close, and as dreary and as empty as a house that
has been shut up for some time while its usual occupants are away in the
country.As he had to wait over for an afternoon train, and as he was down town,
he decided to lunch at a French restaurant near Washington Square, where
some one had told him you could get particular things particularly well
cooked.The tables were set on a terrace with plants and flowers about
them, and covered with a tricolored awning.There were no jangling
horse-car bells nor dust to disturb him, and almost all the other tables
were unoccupied.The waiters leaned against these tables and chatted in
a French argot; and a cool breeze blew through the plants and billowed
the awning, so that, on the whole, Van Bibber was glad he had come.There was, beside himself, an old Frenchman scolding over his late
breakfast; two young artists with Van <DW18> beards, who ordered the most
remarkable things in the same French argot that the waiters spoke; and a
young lady and a young gentleman at the table next to his own.The young
man's back was toward him, and he could only see the girl when the youth
moved to one side.She was very young and very pretty, and she seemed in
a most excited state of mind from the tip of her wide-brimmed, pointed
French hat to the points of her patent-leather ties.She was strikingly
well-bred in appearance, and Van Bibber wondered why she should be
dining alone with so young a man."It wasn't my fault," he heard the youth say earnestly."How could I
know he would be out of town?Your
cousin is not the only clergyman in the city.""Of course not," said the girl, almost tearfully, "but they're not my
cousins and he is, and that would have made it so much, oh, so very much
different."Runaway couple," commented Van Bibber.Read about
'em often; never seen 'em.He bent his head over an entree, but he could not help hearing what
followed, for the young runaways were indifferent to all around them,
and though he rattled his knife and fork in a most vulgar manner, they
did not heed him nor lower their voices."Well, what are you going to do?"said the girl, severely but not
unkindly."It doesn't seem to me that you are exactly rising to the
occasion.""Well, I don't know," answered the youth, easily.Nobody we know ever comes here, and if they did they are out of
town now.You go on and eat something, and I'll get a directory and look
up a lot of clergymen's addresses, and then we can make out a list and
drive around in a cab until we find one who has not gone off on his
vacation.We ought to be able to catch the Fall River boat back at
five this afternoon; then we can go right on to Boston from Fall River
to-morrow morning and run down to Narragansett during the day.""They'll never forgive us," said the girl."Oh, well, that's all right," exclaimed the young man, cheerfully."Really, you're the most uncomfortable young person I ever ran away
with.One might think you were going to a funeral.You were willing
enough two days ago, and now you don't help me at all.he asked, and then added, "but please don't say so, even if you are.""No, not sorry, exactly," said the girl; "but, indeed, Ted, it is going
to make so much talk.If we only had a girl with us, or if you had a
best man, or if we had witnesses, as they do in England, and a parish
registry, or something of that sort; or if Cousin Harold had only been
at home to do the marrying."The young gentleman called Ted did not look, judging from the expression
of his shoulders, as if he were having a very good time.He picked at the food on his plate gloomily, and the girl took out her
handkerchief and then put it resolutely back again and smiled at him.The youth called the waiter and told him to bring a directory, and as he
turned to give the order Van Bibber recognized him and he recognized Van
Bibber.Van Bibber knew him for a very nice boy, of a very good Boston
family named Standish, and the younger of two sons.It was the elder who
was Van Bibber's particular friend.The girl saw nothing of this mutual
recognition, for she was looking with startled eyes at a hansom that had
dashed up the side street and was turning the corner."Standish," said Van Bibber, jumping up and reaching for his hat, "pay
this chap for these things, will you, and I'll get rid of your brother."Van Bibber descended the steps lighting a cigar as the elder Standish
came up them on a jump."Wait a minute; where are you
going?Why, it seems to rain Standishes to-day!First see your brother;
then I see you.Van Bibber answered these different questions to the effect that he had
seen young Standish and Mrs.Standish not a half an hour before, and
that they were just then taking a cab for Jersey City, whence they were
to depart for Chicago."The driver who brought them here, and who told me where they were, said
they could not have left this place by the time I would reach it," said
the elder brother, doubtfully."That's so," said the driver of the cab, who had listened curiously."I
brought 'em here not more'n half an hour ago.Just had time to get back
to the depot."Yes, but they have," said Van Bibber."However, if you get over to
Jersey City in time for the 2.30, you can reach Chicago almost as soon
as they do.They are going to the Palmer House, they said.""Thank you, old fellow," shouted Standish, jumping back into his hansom.Nobody objected to the
marriage, only too young, you know."Don't mention it," said Van Bibber, politely."Now, then," said that young man, as he approached the frightened couple
trembling on the terrace, "I've sent your brother off to Chicago.I
do not know why I selected Chicago as a place where one would go on a
honeymoon.But I'm not used to lying and I'm not very good at it.Now,
if you will introduce me, I'll see what can be done toward getting you
two babes out of the woods."Standish said, "Miss Cambridge, this is Mr.Cortlandt Van Bibber, of
whom you have heard my brother speak," and Miss Cambridge said she
was very glad to meet Mr.Van Bibber even under such peculiarly trying
circumstances."Now what you two want to do," said Van Bibber, addressing them as
though they were just about fifteen years old and he were at least
forty, "is to give this thing all the publicity you can."chorused the two runaways, in violent protest."You were about to make a fatal mistake.You were about to go to some unknown clergyman of an unknown parish,
who would have married you in a back room, without a certificate or
a witness, just like any eloping farmer's daughter and lightning-rod
agent.Why you were not married
respectably in church I don't know, and I do not intend to ask, but
a kind Providence has sent me to you to see that there is no talk nor
scandal, which is such bad form, and which would have got your names
into all the papers.I am going to arrange this wedding properly, and
you will kindly remain here until I send a carriage for you.Now just
rely on me entirely and eat your luncheon in peace.It's all going to
come out right--and allow me to recommend the salad, which is especially
good."Van Bibber first drove madly to the Little Church Around the Corner,
where he told the kind old rector all about it, and arranged to have
the church open and the assistant organist in her place, and a
district-messenger boy to blow the bellows, punctually at three o'clock."And now," he soliloquized, "I must get some names.It doesn't matter
much whether they happen to know the high contracting parties or not,
but they must be names that everybody knows.Whoever is in town will be
lunching at Delmonico's, and the men will be at the clubs."So he first
went to the big restaurant, where, as good luck would have it, he found
Mrs."Regy" Van Arnt and Mrs."Jack" Peabody, and the Misses Brookline,
who had run up the Sound for the day on the yacht _Minerva_ of the
Boston Yacht Club, and he told them how things were and swore them to
secrecy, and told them to bring what men they could pick up.At the club he pressed four men into service who knew everybody and whom
everybody knew, and when they protested that they had not been properly
invited and that they only knew the bride and groom by sight, he told
them that made no difference, as it was only their names he wanted.Then
he sent a messenger boy to get the biggest suit of rooms on the Fall
River boat and another one for flowers, and then he put Mrs."Regy" Van
Arnt into a cab and sent her after the bride, and, as best man, he got
into another cab and carried off the groom."I have acted either as best man or usher forty-two times now," said Van
Bibber, as they drove to the church, "and this is the first time I ever
appeared in either capacity in russia-leather shoes and a blue serge
yachting suit.But then," he added, contentedly, "you ought to see the
other fellows.One of them is in a striped flannel.""Regy" and Miss Cambridge wept a great deal on the way up town, but
the bride was smiling and happy when she walked up the aisle to meet her
prospective husband, who looked exceedingly conscious before the eyes of
the men, all of whom he knew by sight or by name, and not one of whom he
had ever met before.But they all shook hands after it was over, and
the assistant organist played the Wedding March, and one of the club men
insisted in pulling a cheerful and jerky peal on the church bell in the
absence of the janitor, and then Van Bibber hurled an old shoe and a
handful of rice--which he had thoughtfully collected from the chef at
the club--after them as they drove off to the boat."Now," said Van Bibber, with a proud sigh of relief and satisfaction, "I
will send that to the papers, and when it is printed to-morrow it will
read like one of the most orthodox and one of the smartest weddings of
the season.And yet I can't help thinking--"

"Well?""Regy," as he paused doubtfully."Well, I can't help thinking," continued Van Bibber, "of Standish's
older brother racing around Chicago with the thermometer at 102 in the
shade.I wish I had only sent him to Jersey City.It just shows," he
added, mournfully, "that when a man is not practised in lying, he should
leave it alone."Days, when in after leisure, content to rest we lay,
   Nights, when her lips' soft pressure drained all my life away.And while we sat together, beneath the Babul trees,
   The fragrant, sultry weather cooled by the river breeze,
   If passion faltered ever, and left the senses free,
   We heard the tireless river decending to the sea.I know not where she wandered, or went in after days,
   Or if her youth she squandered in Love's more doubtful ways.Perhaps, beside the river, she died, still young and fair;
   Perchance the grasses quiver above her slumber there.At Kotri, by the river, maybe I too shall sleep
   The sleep that lasts for ever, too deep for dreams; too deep.Maybe among the shingle and sand of floods to be
   Her dust and mine may mingle and float away to sea.Ah Kotri, by the river, when evening's sun is low,
   Your faint reflections quiver, your golden ripples glow.You knew, oh Kotri river, that love which could not last.For me your palms still shiver with passions of the past.Farewell

   Farewell, Aziz, it was not mine to fold you
     Against my heart for any length of days.I had no loveliness, alas, to hold you,
     No siren voice, no charm that lovers praise.Yet, in the midst of grief and desolation,
     Solace I my despairing soul with this:
   Once, for my life's eternal consolation,
     You lent my lips your loveliness to kiss.I think Love's very essence
     Distilled itself from out my joy and pain,
   Like tropical trees, whose fervid inflorescence
     Glows, gleams, and dies, never to bloom again.Often I marvel how I met the morning
     With living eyes after that night with you,
   Ah, how I cursed the wan, white light for dawning,
     And mourned the paling stars, as each withdrew!Yet I, even I, who am less than dust before you,
     Less than the lowest lintel of your door,
   Was given one breathless midnight, to adore you.Fate, having granted this, can give no more!Afridi Love

   Since, Oh, Beloved, you are not even faithful
     To me, who loved you so, for one short night,
   For one brief space of darkness, though my absence
     Did but endure until the dawning light;

   Since all your beauty--which was _mine_--you squandered
     On _that_ which now lies dead across your door;
   See here this knife, made keen and bright to kill you.You shall not see the sun rise any more.In all the empty village
     Who is there left to hear or heed your cry?All are gone to labour in the valley,
     Who will return before your time to die?No use to struggle; when I found you sleeping,
     I took your hands and bound them to your side,
   And both these slender feet, too apt at straying,
     Down to the cot on which you lie are tied.Lie still, Beloved; that dead thing lying yonder,
     I hated and I killed, but love is sweet,
   And you are more than sweet to me, who love you,
     Who decked my eyes with dust from off your feet.Give me your lips; Ah, lovely and disloyal
     Give me yourself again; before you go
   Down through the darkness of the Great, Blind Portal,
     All of life's best and basest you must know.Erstwhile Beloved, you were so young and fragile
     I held you gently, as one holds a flower:
   But now, God knows, what use to still be tender
     To one whose life is done within an hour?Death will not hurt you, dearest,
     As you hurt me, for just a single night,
   You call me cruel, who laid my life in ruins
     To gain one little moment of delight.Look up, look out, across the open doorway
     The sunlight streams.Look at the pale, pink peach trees in our garden,
     Sweet fruit will come of them;--but not for you.The fair, far snow, upon those jagged mountains
     That gnaw against the hard blue Afghan sky
   Will soon descend, set free by summer sunshine.You will not see those torrents sweeping by.From this day forward,
     You must lie still alone; who would not lie
   Alone for one night only, though returning
     I was, when earliest dawn should break the sky.There lies my lute, and many strings are broken,
     Some one was playing it, and some one tore
   The silken tassels round my Hookah woven;
     Some one who plays, and smokes, and loves, no more!Some one who took last night his fill of pleasure,
     As I took mine at dawn!The knife went home
   Straight through his heart!God only knows my rapture
     Bathing my chill hands in the warm red foam.This is only loving,
     Wait till I kill you!Surely the fault was mine, to love and leave you
     Even a single night, you are so fair.Cold steel is very cooling to the fervour
     Of over passionate ones, Beloved, like you.Not quite unlovely
     They are as yet, as yet, though quite untrue.What will your brother say, to-night returning
     With laden camels homewards to the hills,
   Finding you dead, and me asleep beside you,
     Will he awake me first before he kills?Here on the cot beside you
     When you, my Heart's Delight, are cold in death.When your young heart and restless lips are silent,
     Grown chilly, even beneath my burning breath.When I have slowly drawn my knife across you,
     Taking my pleasure as I see you swoon,
   I shall sleep sound, worn out by love's last fervour,
     And then, God grant your kinsmen kill me soon!Yasmini

   At night, when Passion's ebbing tide
     Left bare the Sands of Truth,
   Yasmini, resting by my side,
     Spoke softly of her youth."And one" she said "was tall and slim,
     Two crimson rose leaves made his mouth,
   And I was fain to follow him
     Down to his village in the South."He was to build a hut hard by
     The stream where palms were growing,
   We were to live, and love, and lie,
     And watch the water flowing."Ah, dear, delusive, distant shore,
     By dreams of futile fancy gilt!The riverside we never saw,
     The palm leaf hut was never built!"One had a Tope of Mangoe trees,
     Where early morning, noon and late,
   The Persian wheels, with patient ease,
     Brought up their liquid, silver freight."And he was fain to rise and reach
     That garden sloping to the sea,
   Whose groves along the wave-swept beach
     Should shelter him and love and me."Doubtless, upon that western shore
     With ripe fruit falling to the ground,
   There dwells the Peace he hungered for,
     The lovely Peace we never found."Then there came one with eager eyes
     And keen sword, ready for the fray.He missed the storms of Northern skies,
     The reckless raid and skirmish gay!"He rose from dreams of war's alarms,
     To make his daggers keen and bright,
   Desiring, in my very arms,
     The fiercer rapture of the fight!"He left me soon; too soon, and sought
     The stronger, earlier love again.News reached me from the Cabul Court,
     Afterwards nothing; doubtless slain."Doubtless his brilliant, haggard eyes,
     Long since took leave of life and light,
   And those lithe limbs I used to prize
     Feasted the jackal and the kite.his sixteen years
     Shone in his cheeks' transparent red.My kisses were his first: my tears
     Fell on his face when he was dead."He died, he died, I speak the truth,
     Though light love leave his memory dim,
   He was the Lover of my Youth
     And all my youth went down with him."For passion ebbs and passion flows,
     But under every new caress
   The riven heart more keenly knows
     Its own inviolate faithfulness."Our Gods are kind and still deem fit
     As in old days, with those to lie,
   Whose silent hearths are yet unlit
     By the soft light of infancy."Therefore, one strange, mysterious night
     Alone within the Temple shade,
   Recipient of a God's delight
     I lay enraptured, unafraid."Also to me the boon was given,
     But mourning quickly followed mirth,
   My son, whose father stooped from Heaven,
     Died in the moment of his birth."When from the war beyond the seas
     The reckless Lancers home returned,
   Their spoils were laid across my knees
     About my lips their kisses burned."Back from the Comradeship of Death,
     Free from the Friendship of the Sword,
   With brilliant eyes and famished breath
     They came to me for their reward."Why do I tell you all these things,
     Baring my life to you, unsought?When Passion folds his wearied wings
     Sleep should be follower, never Thought.The window pane
     Grows pale against the purple sky.The dawn is with us once again,
     The dawn; which always means good-bye."Within her little trellised room, beside the palm-fringed sea,
   She wakeful in the scented gloom, spoke of her youth to me.Ojira, to Her Lover

   I am waiting in the desert, looking out towards the sunset,
   And counting every moment till we meet.I am waiting by the marshes and I tremble and I listen
   Till the soft sands thrill beneath your coming feet.Till I see you, tall and slender, standing clear against the skyline
   A graceful shade across the lingering red,
   While your hair the breezes ruffle, turns to silver in the twilight,
   And makes a fair faint aureole round your head.Far away towards the sunset I can see a narrow river,
   That unwinds itself in red tranquillity;
   I can hear its rippled meeting, and the gurgle of its greeting,
   As it mingles with the loved and long sought sea.In the purple sky above me showing dark against the starlight,
   Long wavering flights of homeward birds fly low,
   They cry each one to the other, and their weird and wistful calling,
   Makes most melancholy music as they go.Oh, my dearest hasten, hasten!Already
   Have I heard the jackals' first assembling cry,
   And among the purple shadows of the mangroves and the marshes
   Fitful echoes of their footfalls passing by.my arms are empty, and so weary for your beauty,
   I am thirsty for the music of your voice.Come to make the marshes joyous with the sweetness of your presence,
   Let your nearing feet bid all the sands rejoice!My hands, my lips are feverish with the longing and the waiting
   And no softness of the twilight soothes their heat,
   Till I see your radiant eyes, shining stars beneath the starlight,
   Till I kiss the slender coolness of your feet.Ah, loveliest, most reluctant, when you lay yourself beside me
   All the planets reel around me--fade away,
   And the sands grow dim, uncertain,--I stretch out my hands towards you
   While I try to speak but know not what I say!I am faint with love and longing, and my burning eyes are gazing
   Where the furtive Jackals wage their famished strife,
   Oh, your shadow on the mangroves!and your step upon the sandhills,--
   This is the loveliest evening of my Life!Thoughts: Mahomed Akram

   If some day this body of mine were burned
   (It found no favour alas!with you)
   And the ashes scattered abroad, unurned,
   Would Love die also, would Thought die too?But who can answer, or who can trust,
       No dreams would harry the windblown dust?Were I laid away in the furrows deep
   Secure from jackal and passing plough,
   Would your eyes not follow me still through sleep
   Torment me then as they torture now?Would you ever have loved me, Golden Eyes,
       Had I done aught better or otherwise?Was I overspeechful, or did you yearn
   When I sat silent, for songs or speech?Ah, Beloved, I had been so apt to learn,
   So apt, had you only cared to teach.But time for silence and song is done,
       You wanted nothing, my Golden Sun!That drifts in its lonely orbit far
   Away from your soft, effulgent light
   In outer planes of Eternal night?Prayer

   You are all that is lovely and light,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   And, waking, after the night,
     I am weary with dreams of you.Every nerve in my heart is tense and sore
     As I rise to another morning apart from you.I dream of your luminous eyes,
     Aziza whom I adore!Of the ruffled silk of your hair,
   I dream, and the dreams are lies.But I love them, knowing no more
     Will ever be mine of you
   Aziza, my life's despair.I would burn for a thousand days,
   Aziza whom I adore,
   Be tortured, slain, in unheard of ways
     If you pitied the pain I bore.Your bright eyes, fastened on other things,
   Are keener to sting my soul, than scorpion stings!You are all that is lovely to me,
     All that is light,
   One white rose in a Desert of weariness.I only live in the night,
   The night, with its fair false dreams of you,
     You and your loveliness.Give me your love for a day,
             A night, an hour:
           If the wages of sin are Death
             I am willing to pay.What is my life but a breath
       Of passion burning away?O Aziza whom I adore,
     Aziza my one delight,
       Only one night, I will die before day,
     And trouble your life no more.The Aloe

   My life was like an Aloe flower, beneath an orient sky,
   Your sunshine touched it for an hour; it blossomed but to die.Torn up, cast out, on rubbish heaps where red flames work their will
   Each atom of the Aloe keeps the flower-time fragrance still.Memory

   How I loved you in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!The touch of your lips was sweet,
     Aziza whom I adore,
   I lay at your slender feet,
     And against their soft palms pressed,
   I fitted my face to rest.As winds blow over the sea
     From Citron gardens ashore,
   Came, through your scented hair,
     The breeze of the night to me.My lips grew arid and dry,
     My nerves were tense,
   Though your beauty soothe the eye
     It maddens the sense.Every curve of that beauty is known to me,
   Every tint of that delicate roseleaf skin,
     And these are printed on every atom of me,
   Burnt in on every fibre until I die.And for this, my sin,
   I doubt if ever, though dust I be,
   The dust will lose the desire,
   The torment and hidden fire,
   Of my passionate love for you.Aziza whom I adore,
   My dust will be full of your beauty, as is the blue
   And infinite ocean full of the azure sky.In the light that waxed and waned
   Playing about your slumber in silver bars,
   As the palm trees swung their feathery fronds athwart the stars,
   How quiet and young you were,
   Pale as the Champa flowers, violet veined,
   That, sweet and fading, lay in your loosened hair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight on your hair!Your throat thrown backwards, bare,
   And touched with circling moonbeams, silver white
     On the couch's sombre shade.O Aziza my one delight,
   When Youth's passionate pulses fade,
   And his golden heart beats slow,
   When across the infinite sky
   I see the roseate glow
   Of my last, last sunset flare,
   I shall send my thoughts to this night
   And remember you as I die,
   The one thing, among all the things of this earth, found fair.How sweet you were in your sleep,
   With the starlight, silver and sable, across your hair!The First Lover

   As o'er the vessel's side she leant,
     She saw the swimmer in the sea
   With eager eyes on her intent,
     "Come down, come down and swim with me."So weary was she of her lot,
     Tired of the ship's monotony,
   She straightway all the world forgot
     Save the young swimmer in the sea

   So when the dusky, dying light
     Left all the water dark and dim,
   She softly, in the friendly night,
     Slipped down the vessel's side to him.Intent and brilliant, brightly dark,
     She saw his burning, eager eyes,
   And many a phosphorescent spark
     About his shoulders fall and rise.As through the hushed and Eastern night
     They swam together, hand in hand,
   Or lay and laughed in sheer delight
     Full length upon the level sand."Ah, soft, delusive, purple night
     Whose darkness knew no vexing moon!Ah, cruel, needless, dawning light
     That trembled in the sky too soon!"Khan Zada's Song on the Hillside

   The fires that burn on all the hills
     Light up the landscape grey,
   The arid desert land distills
     The fervours of the day.The clear white moon sails through the skies
     And silvers all the night,
   I see the brilliance of your eyes
     And need no other light.The death sighs of a thousand flowers
     The fervent day has slain
   Are wafted through the twilight hours,
     And perfume all the plain.My senses strain, and try to clasp
     Their sweetness in the air,
   In vain, in vain; they only grasp
     The fragrance of your hair.The plain is endless space expressed;
     Vast is the sky above,
   I only feel, against your breast,
     Infinities of love.Deserted Gipsy's Song: Hillside Camp

   She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,
         Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!I, to have given you everything:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine."She is proud to have held aloof her charms,
         Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!But I, of the night you lay in my arms:
         Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!"She triumphs to think that your heart is won,
         Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!I had not a thought of myself, not one:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,
         Dear, deluded Lover of mine!I would lose both body and soul for you:
         Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!"While the ways are fair she will love you well,
         Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!But I would have followed you down to Hell:
         Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!"Though you lay at her feet the days to be,
         Now no longer Lover of mine!You can give her naught that you gave not me:
         Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!"When the years have shown what is false or true:
         Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!You will understand how I cared for you,
         First and only Lover of mine!"The Plains

               How one loves them
   These wide horizons; whether Desert or Sea,--
          Vague and vast and infinite; faintly clear--
   Surely, hid in the far away, unknown "There,"
          Lie the things so longed for and found not, found not, Here.Only where some passionate, level land
          Stretches itself in reaches of golden sand,
   Only where the sea line is joined to the sky-line, clear,
          Beyond the curve of ripple or white foamed crest,--
                         Shall the weary eyes
             Distressed by the broken skies,--
             Broken by Minaret, mountain, or towering tree,--
          Shall the weary eyes be assuaged,--be assuaged,--and rest."Lost Delight"

   After the Hazara War

   I lie alone beneath the Almond blossoms,
        Where we two lay together in the spring,
   And now, as then, the mountain snows are melting,
        This year, as last, the water-courses sing.That was another spring, and other flowers,
        Hung, pink and fragile, on the leafless tree,
   The land rejoiced in other running water,
        And I rejoiced, because you were with me.You, with your soft eyes, darkly lashed and shaded,
        Your red lips like a living, laughing rose,
   Your restless, amber limbs so lithe and slender
        Now lost to me.You lay beside me singing in the sunshine;
        The rough, white fur, unloosened at the neck,
   Showed the smooth skin, fair as the Almond blossoms,
        On which the sun could find no flaw or fleck.I lie alone, beneath the Almond flowers,
        I hated them to touch you as they fell.worse, Ah, worse, who loves you?(My soul is burning as men burn in Hell.)How I have sought you in the crowded cities!I have been mad, they say, for many days.I know not how I came here, to the valley,
        What fate has led me, through what doubtful ways.Somewhere I see my sword has done good service,
        Some one I killed, who, smiling, used your name,
   But in what country?Nay, I have forgotten,
        All thought is shrivelled in my heart's hot flame.Where are you now, Delight, and where your beauty,
        Your subtle curls, and laughing, changeful face?Bound, bruised and naked (dear God, grant me patience),
        And sold in Cabul in the market-place.Among so many captured, sold, or slain,
   What fate was yours?(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My heart is burnt, is burnt, with fire and pain.)my heart is almost breaking,
        My sword is broken and my feet are sore,
   The people look at me and say in passing,
        "He will not leave the village any more."For as the evening falls, the fever rises,
        With frantic thoughts careering through the brain,
   Wild thoughts of you.(Ah, dear God, grant me patience,
        My soul is hurt beyond all men call pain.)I lie alone, beneath the Almond blossoms,
        And see the white snow melting on the hills
   Till Khorassan is gay with water-courses,
        Glad with the tinkling sound of running rills,

   And well I know that when the fragile petals
        Fall softly, ere the first green leaves appear,
   (Ah, for these last few days, God, grant me patience,)
        Since Delight is not, I shall not be, here!Unforgotten

   Do you ever think of me?you who died
       Ere our Youth's first fervour chilled,
   With your soft eyes and your pulses stilled
       Lying alone, aside,
   Do you ever think of me, left in the light,
   From the endless calm of your dawnless night?I am faithful always: I do not say
       That the lips which thrilled to your lips of old
   To lesser kisses are always cold;
       Had you wished for this in its narrow sense
       Our love perhaps had been less intense;
   But as we held faithfulness, you and I,
       I am faithful always, as you who lie,
       Asleep for ever, beneath the grass,
       While the days and nights and the seasons pass,--
           Pass away.I keep your memory near my heart,
       My brilliant, beautiful guiding Star,
   Till long live over, I too depart
       To the infinite night where perhaps you are.I would rather know you alive in Hell
   Than think your beauty is nothing now,
   With its deep dark eyes and tranquil brow
   Where the hair fell softly.Can this be true
   That nothing, nowhere, exists of you?Nothing, nowhere, oh, loved so well
       I have _never_ forgotten.Do you still keep
   Thoughts of me through your dreamless sleep?lost in Eternal Night,
       Lost Star of light,
   Risen splendidly, set so soon,
       Through the weariness of life's afternoon
             I dream of your memory yet.My loved and lost, whom I could not save,
   My youth went down with you to the grave,
   Though other planets and stars may rise,
   I dream of your soft and sorrowful eyes
           And I cannot forget.Song of Faiz Ulla

   Just at the time when Jasmins bloom, most sweetly in the summer weather,
   Lost in the scented Jungle gloom, one sultry night we spent together
   We, Love and Night, together blent, a Trinity of tranced content.Yet, while your lips were wholly mine, to kiss, to drink from, to caress,
   We heard some far-off faint distress; harsh drop of poison in sweet wine
   Lessening the fulness of delight,--
            Some quivering note of human pain,
   Which rose and fell and rose again, in plaintive sobs throughout the night,

   Spoiling the perfumed, moonless hours
   We spent among the Jasmin flowers.Story of Lilavanti

   They lay the slender body down
     With all its wealth of wetted hair,
   Only a daughter of the town,
     But very young and slight and fair.The eyes, whose light one cannot see,
     Are sombre doubtless, like the tresses,
   The mouth's soft curvings seem to be
     A roseate series of caresses.And where the skin has all but dried
     (The air is sultry in the room)
   Upon her breast and either side,
     It shows a soft and amber bloom.By women here, who knew her life,
     A leper husband, I am told,
   Took all this loveliness to wife
     When it was barely ten years old.And when the child in shocked dismay
     Fled from the hated husband's care
   He caught and tied her, so they say,
     Down to his bedside by her hair.To some low quarter of the town,
     Escaped a second time, she flew;
   Her beauty brought her great renown
     And many lovers here she knew,

   When, as the mystic Eastern night
     With purple shadow filled the air,
   Behind her window framed in light,
     She sat with jasmin in her hair.At last she loved a youth, who chose
     To keep this wild flower for his own,
   He in his garden set his rose
     Where it might bloom for him alone.Cholera came; her lover died,
     Want drove her to the streets again,
   And women found her there, who tried
     To turn her beauty into gain.But she who in those garden ways
     Had learnt of Love, would now no more
   Be bartered in the market place
     For silver, as in days before.That former life she strove to change;
     She sold the silver off her arms,
   While all the world grew cold and strange
     To broken health and fading charms.Till, finding lovers, but no friend,
     Nor any place to rest or hide,
   She grew despairing at the end,
     Slipped softly down a well and died.And yet, how short, when all is said,
     This little life of love and tears!Her age, they say, beside her bed,
     To-day is only fifteen years.The Garden by the Bridge

   The Desert sands are heated, parched and dreary,
     The tigers rend alive their quivering prey
   In the near Jungle; here the kites rise, weary,
     Too gorged with living food to fly away.All night the hungry jackals howl together
     Over the carrion in the river bed,
   Or seize some small soft thing of fur or feather
     Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed.I hear from yonder Temple in the distance
     Whose roof with obscene carven Gods is piled,
   Reiterated with a sad insistence
     Sobs of, perhaps, some immolated child.Strange rites here, where the archway's shade is deeper,
     Are consummated in the river bed;
   Parias steal the rotten railway sleeper
     To burn the bodies of their cholera dead.But yet, their lust, their hunger, cannot shame them
     Goaded by fierce desire, that flays and stings;
   Poor beasts, and poorer men.Blame the Inherent Cruelty of Things.The world is horrible and I am lonely,
     Let me rest here where yellow roses bloom
   And find forgetfulness, remembering only
     Your face beside me in the scented gloom.I am not here for passion,
     I crave no love, only a little rest,
   Although I would my face lay, lover's fashion,
     Against the tender coolness of your breast.I am so weary of the Curse of Living
     The endless, aimless torture, tumult, fears.Surely, if life were any God's free giving,
     He, seeing His gift, long since went blind with tears.Seeing us; our fruitless strife, our futile praying,
     Our luckless Present and our bloodstained Past.Poor players, who make a trick or two in playing,
     But know that death _must_ win the game at last.As round the Fowler, red with feathered slaughter,
     The little joyous lark, unconscious, sings,--
   As the pink Lotus floats on azure water,
     Innocent of the mud from whence it springs.You walk through life, unheeding all the sorrow,
     The fear and pain set close around your way,
   Meeting with hopeful eyes each gay to-morrow,
     Living with joy each hour of glad to-day.I love to have you thus (nay, dear, lie quiet,
     How should these reverent fingers wrong your hair?)So calmly careless of the rush and riot
     That rages round is seething everywhere.You think your beauty
     Does but inflame my senses to desire,
   Till all you hold as loyalty and duty,
     Is shrunk and shrivelled in the ardent fire.You wrong me, wearied out with thought and grieving
     As though the whole world's sorrow eat my heart,
   I come to gaze upon your face believing
     Its beauty is as ointment to the smart.Lie still and let me in my desolation
     Caress the soft loose hair a moment's span.Since Loveliness is Life's one Consolation,
     And love the only Lethe left to man.Ah, give me here beneath the trees in flower,
     Beside the river where the fireflies pass,
   One little dusky, all consoling hour
     Lost in the shadow of the long grown grass

   Give me, oh you whose arms are soft and slender,
     Whose eyes are nothing but one long caress,
   Against your heart, so innocent and tender,
     A little Love and some Forgetfulness.Fate Knows no Tears

   Just as the dawn of Love was breaking
          Across the weary world of grey,
   Just as my life once more was waking
          As roses waken late in May,
   Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,
          Stepped in and carried you away.Memories have I none in keeping
          Of times I held you near my heart,
   Of dreams when we were near to weeping
          That dawn should bid us rise and part;
   Never, alas, I saw you sleeping
          With soft closed eyes and lips apart,

   Breathing my name still through your dreaming.--
          Ah!But Fate, unheeding human scheming,
          Serenely reckless came between--
   Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming
          Unseared by all the sorrow seen.well-beloved, I never told you,
          I did not show in speech or song,
   How at the end I longed to fold you
          Close in my arms; so fierce and strong
   The longing grew to have and hold you,
          You, and you only, all life long.They who know nothing call me fickle,
          Keen to pursue and loth to keep.Ah, could they see these tears that trickle
          From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,
          While pain and sorrow stand and reap!Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie
          The hopes that rose-like round me grew,
   The lights are low, and more than lonely
          This life I lead apart from you.I want you only,
          And you who loved me never knew.You loved me, pleaded for compassion
          On all the pain I would not share;
   And I in weary, halting fashion
          Was loth to listen, long to care;
   But now, dear God!I faint with passion
          For your far eyes and distant hair.Yes, I am faint with love, and broken
          With sleepless nights and empty days;
   I want your soft words fiercely spoken,
          Your tender looks and wayward ways--
   Want that strange smile that gave me token
          Of many things that no man says.Cold was I, weary, slow to waken
          Till, startled by your ardent eyes,
   I felt the soul within me shaken
          And long-forgotten senses rise;
   But in that moment you were taken,
          And thus we lost our Paradise!Farewell, we may not now recover
          That golden "Then" misspent, passed by,
   We shall not meet as loved and lover
          Here, or hereafter, you and I.
   My time for loving you is over,
          Love has no future, but to die.And thus we part, with no believing
          In any chance of future years.We have no idle self-deceiving,
          No half-consoling hopes and fears;
   We know the Gods grant no retrieving
          A wasted chance.Verses: Faiz Ulla

   Just in the hush before dawn
   A little wistful wind is born.A little chilly errant breeze,
   That thrills the grasses, stirs the trees.And, as it wanders on its way,
   While yet the night is cool and dark,
   The first carol of the lark,--
   Its plaintive murmurs seem to say
   "I wait the sorrows of the day."Two Songs by Sitara, of Kashmir

   Beloved!your hair was golden
   As tender tints of sunrise,
   As corn beside the River
         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,
   Your melancholy sweetness,
   Your changeful eyes, that promised
         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,
   Were mine upon the River,
   The azure water saw us
         And the blue transparent sky;
   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,
   Wandered away from the sea,--
     For the fresh touch of your kiss,
   For the young warmth of your heart,
     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,
     Softer than silk to the hand,
   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,
   Seen as you lay on the sand,
     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--
     Secretly, tenderly sweet,
   All through the tropical day,
     Till, when the sunset was red,
   I, who lay still at your feet,
     Felt my life ebbing away,

   Weary and worn with desire,
     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.Bill shook his 'ead, but when Ginger called 'im disobligin' agin he gave
way and he broke the pledge that very evening with a pint o' six 'arf.Ginger was surprised to see the way 'e took his liquor.Arter three or
four pints he'd expected to see 'im turn a bit silly, or sing, or do
something o' the kind, but Bill kept on as if 'e was drinking water."Think of the 'armless pleasure you've been losing all these months,
Bill," ses Ginger, smiling at him.Bill said it wouldn't bear thinking of, and, the next place they came to
he said some rather 'ard things of the man who'd persuaded 'im to take
the pledge.He 'ad two or three more there, and then they began to see
that it was beginning to have an effect on 'im.The first one that
noticed it was Ginger Dick.Bill 'ad just lit 'is pipe, and as he threw
the match down he ses: "I don't like these 'ere safety matches," he ses.ses Bill, turning on 'im like lightning; "well,
take that for contradictin'," he ses, an' he gave Ginger a smack that
nearly knocked his 'ead off.It was so sudden that old Sam and Peter put their beer down and stared at
each other as if they couldn't believe their eyes.Then they stooped
down and helped pore Ginger on to 'is legs agin and began to brush 'im
down."Never mind about 'im, mates," ses Bill, looking at Ginger very wicked."P'r'aps he won't be so ready to give me 'is lip next time.Let's come
to another pub and enjoy ourselves."Sam and Peter followed 'im out like lambs, 'ardly daring to look over
their shoulder at Ginger, who was staggering arter them some distance
behind a 'olding a handerchief to 'is face."It's your turn to pay, Sam," ses Bill, when they'd got inside the next
place."Three 'arf pints o' four ale, miss," ses Sam, not because 'e was mean,
but because it wasn't 'is turn."Three pots o' six ale, miss," ses Sam, in a hurry."That wasn't wot you said afore," ses Bill."Take that," he ses, giving
pore old Sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking 'im over a stool; "take
that for your sauce."Peter Russet stood staring at Sam and wondering wot Bill ud be like when
he'd 'ad a little more.Sam picked hisself up arter a time and went
outside to talk to Ginger about it, and then Bill put 'is arm round
Peter's neck and began to cry a bit and say 'e was the only pal he'd got
left in the world.It was very awkward for Peter, and more awkward still
when the barman came up and told 'im to take Bill outside."Go on," he ses, "out with 'im.""He's all right," ses Peter, trembling; "we's the truest-'arted gentleman
in London.Bill said he was, and 'e asked the barman to go and hide 'is face because
it reminded 'im of a little dog 'e had 'ad once wot 'ad died."You get outside afore you're hurt," ses the bar-man.Bill punched at 'im over the bar, and not being able to reach 'im threw
Peter's pot o' beer at 'im.There was a fearful to-do then, and the
landlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway, whistling for the
police.Bill struck out right and left, and the men in the bar went down
like skittles, Peter among them.Then they got outside, and Bill, arter
giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the
whistle, jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter 'im.[Illustration: "Bill jumped into a cab and pulled Peter Russet in arter
'im."]"I'll talk to you by-and-by," he ses, as the cab drove off at a gallop;
"there ain't room in this cab.You wait, my lad, that's all.You just
wait till we get out, and I'll knock you silly.""Don't you talk to me," roars Bill."If I choose to knock you about
that's my business, ain't it?He wouldn't let Peter say another word, but coming to a quiet place near
the docks he stopped the cab and pulling 'im out gave 'im such a dressing
down that Peter thought 'is last hour 'ad arrived.He let 'im go at
last, and after first making him pay the cab-man took 'im along till they
came to a public-'ouse and made 'im pay for drinks.They stayed there till nearly eleven o'clock, and then Bill set off home
'olding the unfortunit Peter by the scruff o' the neck, and wondering out
loud whether 'e ought to pay 'im a bit more or not.Afore 'e could make
up 'is mind, however, he turned sleepy, and, throwing 'imself down on the
bed which was meant for the two of 'em, fell into a peaceful sleep.Sam and Ginger Dick came in a little while arterward, both badly marked
where Bill 'ad hit them, and sat talking to Peter in whispers as to wot
was to be done.Ginger, who 'ad plenty of pluck, was for them all to set
on to 'im, but Sam wouldn't 'ear of it, and as for Peter he was so sore
he could 'ardly move.They all turned in to the other bed at last, 'arf afraid to move for fear
of disturbing Bill, and when they woke up in the morning and see 'im
sitting up in 'is bed they lay as still as mice."Why, Ginger, old chap," ses Bill, with a 'earty smile, "wot are you all
three in one bed for?""We was a bit cold," ses Ginger.We 'ad a bit of a spree last
night, old man, didn't we?My throat's as dry as a cinder.""It ain't my idea of a spree," ses Ginger, sitting up and looking at 'im.ses Bill, starting back, "wotever 'ave you been
a-doing to your face?Have you been tumbling off of a 'bus?"Ginger couldn't answer; and Sam Small and Peter sat up in bed alongside
of 'im, and Bill, getting as far back on 'is bed as he could, sat staring
at their pore faces as if 'e was having a 'orrible dream."And there's Sam," he ses."Where ever did you get that mouth, Sam?""Same place as Ginger got 'is eye and pore Peter got 'is face," ses Sam,
grinding his teeth."You don't mean to tell me," ses Bill, in a sad voice--"you don't mean to
tell me that I did it?""You know well enough," ses Ginger.Bill looked at 'em, and 'is face got as long as a yard measure."I'd 'oped I'd growed out of it, mates," he ses, at last, "but drink
always takes me like that."You surprise me," ses Ginger, sarcastic-like."Don't talk like that,
Ginger," ses Bill, 'arf crying."It ain't my fault; it's my weakness."I don't know," ses Ginger, "but you won't get the chance of doing it
agin, I'll tell you that much.""I daresay I shall be better to-night, Ginger," ses Bill, very humble;
"it don't always take me that way."Well, we don't want you with us any more," ses old Sam, 'olding his 'ead
very high."You'll 'ave to go and get your beer by yourself, Bill," ses Peter
Russet, feeling 'is bruises with the tips of 'is fingers."But then I should be worse," ses Bill."I want cheerful company when
I'm like that.I should very likely come 'ome and 'arf kill you all in
your beds.You don't 'arf know what I'm like.Last night was nothing,
else I should 'ave remembered it."'Ow do you think company's going to be
cheerful when you're carrying on like that, Bill?Why don't you go away
and leave us alone?""Because I've got a 'art," ses Bill."I can't chuck up pals in that
free-and-easy way.Once I take a liking to anybody I'd do anything for
'em, and I've never met three chaps I like better than wot I do you.Three nicer, straight-forrad, free-'anded mates I've never met afore.""Why not take the pledge agin, Bill?""No, mate," ses Bill, with a kind smile; "it's just a weakness, and I
must try and grow out of it.I'll tie a bit o' string round my little
finger to-night as a re-minder."He got out of bed and began to wash 'is face, and Ginger Dick, who was
doing a bit o' thinking, gave a whisper to Sam and Peter Russet."All right, Bill, old man," he ses, getting out of bed and beginning to
put his clothes on; "but first of all we'll try and find out 'ow the
landlord is."ses Bill, puffing and blowing in the basin."Why, the one you bashed," ses Ginger, with a wink at the other two."He
'adn't got 'is senses back when me and Sam came away."Bill gave a groan and sat on the bed while 'e dried himself, and Ginger
told 'im 'ow he 'ad bent a quart pot on the landlord's 'ead, and 'ow the
landlord 'ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for.He began to
tremble all over, and when Ginger said he'd go out and see 'ow the land
lay 'e could 'ardly thank 'im enough.He stayed in the bedroom all day, with the blinds down, and wouldn't eat
anything, and when Ginger looked in about eight o'clock to find out
whether he 'ad gone, he found 'im sitting on the bed clean shaved, and
'is face cut about all over where the razor 'ad slipped.Ginger was gone about two hours, and when 'e came back he looked so
solemn that old Sam asked 'im whether he 'ad seen a ghost.Ginger didn't
answer 'im; he set down on the side o' the bed and sat thinking."I s'pose--I s'pose it's nice and fresh in the streets this morning?"ses Bill, at last, in a trembling voice."I didn't notice, mate," he ses.Then
'e got up and patted Bill on the back, very gentle, and sat down again.[Illustration: "Patted Bill on the back, very gentle."]asks Peter Russet, staring at 'im."It's that landlord," ses Ginger; "there's straw down in the road
outside, and they say that he's dying.Pore old Bill don't know 'is own
strength.The best thing you can do, old pal, is to go as far away as
you can, at once.""I shouldn't wait a minnit if it was me," ses old Sam.Bill groaned and hid 'is face in his 'ands, and then Peter Russet went
and spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to 'ide
in was London.Bill gave a dreadful groan when 'e said murderer, but 'e
up and agreed with Peter, and all Sam and Ginger Dick could do wouldn't
make 'im alter his mind.He said that he would shave off 'is beard and
moustache, and when night came 'e would creep out and take a lodging
somewhere right the other end of London."It'll soon be dark," ses Ginger, "and your own brother wouldn't know you
now, Bill."Nobody must know that, mate," he ses."I must go
into hiding for as long as I can--as long as my money lasts; I've only
got six pounds left.""That'll last a long time if you're careful," ses Ginger."I want a lot more," ses Bill."I want you to take this silver ring as a
keepsake, Ginger.If I 'ad another six pounds or so I should feel much
safer.'Ow much 'ave you got, Ginger?""Not much," ses Ginger, shaking his 'ead."Lend it to me, mate," ses Bill, stretching out his 'and.Ah, I wish I was you; I'd be as 'appy as 'appy if I
hadn't got a penny.""I'm very sorry, Bill," ses Ginger, trying to smile, "but I've already
promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening.A promise is a
promise, else I'd lend it to you with pleasure.""Would you let me be 'ung for the sake of a few pounds, Ginger?"ses
Bill, looking at 'im reproach-fully."I'm a desprit man, Ginger, and I
must 'ave that money."Afore pore Ginger could move he suddenly clapped 'is hand over 'is mouth
and flung 'im on the bed.Ginger was like a child in 'is hands, although
he struggled like a madman, and in five minutes 'e was laying there with
a towel tied round his mouth and 'is arms and legs tied up with the cord
off of Sam's chest."I'm very sorry, Ginger," ses Bill, as 'e took a little over eight pounds
out of Ginger's pocket."I'll pay you back one o' these days, if I can.If you'd got a rope round your neck same as I 'ave you'd do the same as
I've done."He lifted up the bedclothes and put Ginger inside and tucked 'im up.Ginger's face was red with passion and 'is eyes starting out of his 'ead."Eight and six is fifteen," ses Bill, and just then he 'eard somebody
coming up the stairs.Ginger 'eard it, too, and as Peter Russet came
into the room 'e tried all 'e could to attract 'is attention by rolling
'is 'ead from side to side."Why, 'as Ginger gone to bed?""He's all right," ses Bill; "just a bit of a 'eadache."Peter stood staring at the bed, and then 'e pulled the clothes off and
saw pore Ginger all tied up, and making awful eyes at 'im to undo him."I 'ad to do it, Peter," ses Bill."I wanted some more money to escape
with, and 'e wouldn't lend it to me.I 'aven't got as much as I want
now.You just came in in the nick of time.Another minute and you'd ha'
missed me."Ah, I wish I could lend you some, Bill," ses Peter Russet, turning pale,
"but I've 'ad my pocket picked; that's wot I came back for, to get some
from Ginger.""You see 'ow it is, Bill," ses Peter, edging back toward the door; "three
men laid 'old of me and took every farthing I'd got.""Well, I can't rob you, then," ses Bill, catching 'old of 'im."Whoever's money this is," he ses, pulling a handful out o' Peter's
pocket, "it can't be yours.Now, if you make another sound I'll knock
your 'ead off afore I tie you up.""Don't tie me up, Bill," ses Peter, struggling."I can't trust you," ses Bill, dragging 'im over to the washstand and
taking up the other towel; "turn round."Peter was a much easier job than Ginger Dick, and arter Bill 'ad done 'im
'e put 'im in alongside o' Ginger and covered 'em up, arter first tying
both the gags round with some string to prevent 'em slipping."Mind, I've only borrowed it," he ses, standing by the side o' the bed;
"but I must say, mates, I'm disappointed in both of you.If either of
you 'ad 'ad the misfortune wot I've 'ad, I'd have sold the clothes off my
back to 'elp you.And I wouldn't 'ave waited to be asked neither."He stood there for a minute very sorrowful, and then 'e patted both their
'eads and went downstairs.Ginger and Peter lay listening for a bit, and
then they turned their pore bound-up faces to each other and tried to
talk with their eyes.Then Ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off, but 'e
might as well 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin.The worst of it was
they couldn't make known their intentions to each other, and when Peter
Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up
agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper.He banged
Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till
they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair
and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.And all this time Sam was sitting in the Red Lion, waiting for them.He
sat there quite patient till twelve o'clock and then walked slowly 'ome,
wondering wot 'ad happened and whether Bill had gone.Ginger was the fust to 'ear 'is foot on the stairs, and as he came into
the room, in the darkness, him an' Peter Russet started shaking their bed
in a way that scared old Sam nearly to death.He thought it was Bill
carrying on agin, and 'e was out o' that door and 'arf-way downstairs
afore he stopped to take breath.He stood there trembling for about ten
minutes, and then, as nothing 'appened, he walked slowly upstairs agin on
tiptoe, and as soon as they heard the door creak Peter and Ginger made
that bed do everything but speak.ses old Sam, in a shaky voice, and standing ready
to dash downstairs agin.There was no answer except for the bed, and Sam didn't know whether Bill
was dying or whether 'e 'ad got delirium trimmings.All 'e did know was
that 'e wasn't going to sleep in that room.He shut the door gently and
went downstairs agin, feeling in 'is pocket for a match, and, not finding
one, 'e picked out the softest stair 'e could find and, leaning his 'ead
agin the banisters, went to sleep.[Illustration: "Picked out the softest stair 'e could find."]It was about six o'clock when 'e woke up, and broad daylight.He was
stiff and sore all over, and feeling braver in the light 'e stepped
softly upstairs and opened the door.Peter and Ginger was waiting for
'im, and as he peeped in 'e saw two things sitting up in bed with their
'air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with
bandages.He was that startled 'e nearly screamed, and then 'e stepped
into the room and stared at 'em as if he couldn't believe 'is eyes."Wot d'ye mean by making sights of

at the foot o' the bed on Ginger's feet and looked at 'em.It wasn't the

was past it, and when 'e'd finished old Sam said 'ow surprised he was
at them for letting Bill do it, and told 'em how they ought to 'ave

such an extent as enables us to restore their form almost as certainly
as we can those of the temples of Greece or Rome, or of any of the great
nations of antiquity.Assyrian Temple, North Palace, Koyunjik.Bas-relief, representing façade of Assyrian Palace.It is by no means improbable that at some future period we may be able
to restore much that is now unintelligible, from the representations of
buildings on the sculptures, and to complete our account of their style
of architecture from illustrations drawn by the Assyrians themselves.One or two of these have already been published.The annexed woodcut,
for instance (No.72), of a bas-relief representing a little
fishing-pavilion on the water’s edge, exhibits in a rude manner all the
parts of an Assyrian order with its entablature, and the capital only
requires to be slightly elongated to make it similar to those found at
Persepolis.Another from the North Palace, Koyunjik, repeats the same arrangement,
with pillars which must be considered as early examples of the
Corinthian order, and, if we may trust the drawing, it likewise
represents an aqueduct with horizontally constructed arches of pointed
form.74) from the same palace seems intended to
portray a complete palace façade, with its winged bulls in the entrance
and its colossal lions on the front.Above these animals, but not
apparently meant to be represented as resting on them, are pillars in
antis, as in the two previous illustrations.[86] Unfortunately the
cornice is broken away, and the whole is more carelessly executed than
is usual in these sculptures.Exterior of a Palace, from a Bas-relief at Koyunjik.]75) is that of a palace of
two storeys, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik, showing a range of openings
under the roof in both storeys, each opening being divided into three
parts by two Ionic columns between square piers, and are probably meant
to represent such an arrangement as that shown in Woodcuts Nos.On the right the upper storey is a correct representation of the
panelled style of ornamentation above alluded to as recently discovered
at Khorsabad and elsewhere, and which we know from recent discoveries to
have been so favourite a mode of decorating walls in that age.The most remarkable fact, however, that we gather from all these
illustrations is, that the favourite arrangement was a group of pillars
“distyle in antis,” as it is technically termed, viz., two circular
pillars between two square piers.It is frequently found elsewhere in
the façade of tombs, but here it seems to have been repeated over and
over again to make up a complete design.For a temple such an
arrangement would have been inadmissible: for a palace it seems
singularly appropriate and elegant.(From Bas-relief, British Museum.)]Further comparisons will no doubt do much to complete the subject; and
when the names written over these bas-reliefs are definitively
deciphered, we may find that we really possess contemporary
representations, if not of Jerusalem, at least of Lachish, of Susa, and
other cities familiar to us both from ancient and from modern history.Horse-Tent (Nimroud).]We have no representation of the dwellings of private individuals so
complete as to enable us to understand them, but there are several of
royal camps which are interesting.Among the most curious of these are
the representations of the tents of the king and his nobles.One of
these is shown in Woodcut No.76, though how it was constructed is by no
means clear.It seems to have been open in the centre to the air, but
covered at either end by a sort of hood so arranged as to catch the
passing breeze, and afford protection from rain at the same time.The
annexed woodcut (No.77), representing the front and one side of the
royal horse-tent, gives a good idea of the luxury and elegance that was
carried into the detail even of subordinate structures.Except the Chaldean-formed temples, which have been described in the
previous chapter, there are no religious edifices sufficiently complete
to enable us to form a distinct idea of what the architectural
arrangements of these temples were.As belonging to a Semitic people we
should expect them to be few and insignificant.So little remains of the temple at Khorsabad, that it is difficult to
say what its original form may have been; the terrace, however, which
supported it is interesting, as it shows almost the only instance of a
perfect Assyrian moulding or cornice betraying a similarity to the forms
of Egyptian architecture which we do not find elsewhere.The curve,
however, is not exactly that of an Egyptian cornice, being continued
beyond the vertical tangent; but this may have arisen from the terrace
being only six feet in height, which placed the curve below the line of
sight, and so required a different treatment from one placed so high
above it as is usually the case in Egypt.Elevation of Stylobate of temple.]The bas-relief on the next page is perhaps the best sculptured
representation that exists of what we might fancy an Assyrian temple to
have been.The emblem so enshrined is probably the Asheerah, or grove,
to the worship of which the Israelites at all times showed such a
tendency to relapse, and is one of the most frequent objects of
adoration among the Assyrians.As a Semitic people we should hardly expect to find any tombs among
them, and indeed, unless the pyramid at the north-west angle of the
Nimroud mound is the tomb of Sardanapalus, mentioned by the Greeks,[87]
it is not clear that a single Assyrian sepulchre has yet been
discovered.Those that crowd and choke the ruins of Wurka and Mugheyr
and other cities of Babylonia are the remains of a Turanian people who
always respected their dead, and paid especial attention to the
preservation of their bodies.The pyramid at Nimroud seems to have been
explored with sufficient care to enable us to affirm that no stairs or
inclined plane led to its summit, and without these it certainly was not
one of those observatory temples before alluded to.Still, it is so
singular to have one monument, and one only, of its class, that it is
difficult to form a satisfactory opinion on the subject.It stands at the north-west angle of the mound, and measures 167 ft.in height, is composed of beautiful stone
masonry, ornamented by buttresses and offsets, above which the wall was
continued perpendicularly in brickwork.In the centre of the building,
and on the level of the base or terrace, a long vaulted gallery or
tunnel was discovered, but it contained no clue to the destination of
the building.Sacred Symbolic Tree of the Assyrians.(From Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone.)](From Layard’s ‘Nineveh.’)]

The whole now rises to a height of about 120 ft.from the plain, and is
composed of sun-dried bricks, with courses of kiln-burnt bricks between
them, at certain intervals towards the summit, which render it probable
that it originally was not a pyramid in the usual sense of the term, but
a square tower, rising in three or four storeys, each less than the
lower one, as in the traditional temple of Belus at Babylon, or like the
summit of the obelisk represented in the woodcut (No.81), which most
probably is a monolithic reproduction of such a sepulchral tower as
this, rather than an obelisk like those of Egypt.Other obelisks have since been discovered, some of which look even more
like miniature models of structural buildings than this one does.Till further information is obtained, it will hardly be possible to say
much that is satisfactory with regard to either the tombs, temples, or
minor antiquities of the Assyrian people.Their architecture was
essentially Palatial—as that of the Greeks was Templar—and to that alone
our remarks might almost be confined.Fortunately, however, sculpture
was another art to which they were specially addicted, and to their
passion for this we owe most of our knowledge of their manners and
customs.To this art also we are indebted for our ability to restore
many details of their palaces and buildings, which without its aid would
have been altogether unintelligible.Judged by the same rules of criticism which we apply to Classic or
Mediæval art, the architecture of the Assyrians must, it is feared, rank
very low.But for gorgeous Barbaric splendour of effect it seems
difficult to imagine anything that could well have been grander or more
imposing than the palaces of Nineveh must have been when entire and
filled with the state and magnificence of the monarchs of the Assyrian
empire.Cyrus founds Pasargadæ                                     B.C.560

There still remains a third chapter to write before the survey of the
architecture of the central region of Asia is complete—before indeed a
great deal which has just been assumed can become capable of proof.By a
fortunate accident the Persians used stone where the Assyrians used only
wood, and consequently many details of their architecture have come down
to our day which would otherwise have passed away had the more
perishable materials of their predecessors been made use of.Whatever else the ancient world may owe to the learning of the
Egyptians, it seems certain that they were the first to make use of
stone as a constructive building material.As before mentioned, the
Egyptians used a stone Proto-Doric pillar at least 1000 years before the
Greeks or the Etruscans, or any other ancient people we know of, dreamt
of such a thing.The Babylonians and Assyrians never seem to have used
stone constructively, except as the revêtement of a terrace wall; and it
was not till after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses that we find any
Asiatic nations using a pillar of stone in architecture, or doing more
than building a wall, or heaping mass on mass of this material without
any constructive contrivance.The Indians first learned this art from
the Bactrian Greeks, and many civilised Asiatic nations still prefer
wood for their palaces and temples, as the Assyrians did, and only use
stone as “a heap.” It must have been difficult, however, for any
intelligent people to visit the wonderful stone temples of Thebes and
Memphis without being struck by their superior magnificence and
durability; and we consequently find the Persians on their return,
though reproducing their old forms, adopting the new material, which,
fortunately for them and for our history, was found in abundance in the
neighbourhood of their capitals.Even, however, on the most cursory inspection, it is easy to see how
little the arts of the Assyrians were changed by their successors.The
winged lions and bulls that adorn the portals at Persepolis are
practically identical with those of Nineveh.The representations of the
king on his throne with his attendants are so similar, that but for the
locality it would require considerable knowledge to discriminate between
Sennacherib and Xerxes.The long procession of tribute bearers—the
symbolical animals slain by the king; the whole ornamentation, in fact,
is so slightly altered from what existed in Assyria, that we are
startled to find how little change in these sculptures the new dynasty
had introduced; and if this is the case with them, and their position
and arrangement are nearly identical, we may feel very certain that the
architecture was also the same.It appears at first sight to have been otherwise; but on closer
examination it appears quite certain that this even is due more to the
material employed than to any alteration in form.Something may be due
to the fact that the buildings we now find on the platform at Persepolis
may have been dedicated to somewhat different purposes than were those
of Nineveh; but even this is not quite clear.If the great square courts
of the Ninevite palaces were roofed over, as Layard suggested—and as
probably was the case—they would exactly represent the square halls of
Persepolis.But as all the intermediate buildings of sun-dried brick
have been washed off the bare rock by the winter rains of Persia, we can
only speculate on what they might have been, without daring to lay too
much stress on our convictions.In their present state the remains at Pasargadæ are, perhaps, more
interesting to the antiquary than to the architect, the palaces on the
plain being so ruined that their architectural arrangements cannot be
understood or restored.Elevation of Platform at Pasargadæ.]On the side of a hill overlooking the plain is a platform of masonry
(Woodcut No.82) which originally supported either a temple or
fire-altar, but this has now entirely disappeared, and the structure is
only remarkable for the beauty of its masonry and the large dimensions
of the stones with which it is built.83), not only at their joints but often on their faces, with the same
flat sinking as is found in all the Jewish works at Jerusalem, and
sometimes in Greek buildings of the best age.Thus an ornament of great
beauty and elegance is formed out of what would otherwise be merely a
plain mass of masonry.The tomb of Cyrus has already been referred to (p.164) as a copy in
stone of one of the ziggurats or terrace-temples.But it must be borne
in mind that the most celebrated example of this form is as often called
the tomb, as the temple of Belus;[88] and among a Turanian people the
tomb and the temple may be considered as one and the same thing.The
tomb is surrounded on three sides[89] by a portico of columns standing
14 feet apart: no stone capitals have been found, but it is probable
that the columns carried wooden bracket-capitals to diminish the bearing
of the wooden architrave or beam which supported the roof.Beyond the
portico there are the traces of a second enclosure 25 feet wide, which,
from its width, was probably an open court.(From Texier’s ‘Arménie et la
Perse.’)]

On the plain are the remains of buildings, three of which were palaces,
and one the ruin of a tomb.The plan of one of them, called the palace
of Cyrus, has been measured and published by M. Texier, MM.Flandin &
Coste, and M. Dieulafoy, and although the restoration given by the
latter goes somewhat farther than the remains will account for, there
are certain features in which they all agree, and which show that it
contained at least two porches or porticoes and a great hall of columns
not dissimilar from the examples found at Persepolis.The angle piers or
responds of two porticoes still exist in situ; on one of them in the
upper stone is cut the socket in which the architrave of the portico
rested, the form of this socket having a peculiar value, as it shows
more clearly than the socket in the respond of the portico of the palace
of Darius, that the Persian architrave was composed of two or more beams
placed one over the other, and overhanging, as in the tomb of Darius.A
second pier has an inscription which enables us to ascribe its erection
to Cyrus.A column, 34 feet high, of the great hall still remains, which
shows that at all events in this case the central hall rose above the
porticoes, deriving its light therefore through clerestory windows.No
capitals have been found,[90] and it is possible therefore they were in
wood, as we have suggested may have been the case in the portico of the
tomb of Cyrus.Plan of Tomb of Cyrus, Pasargadæ.To the east of this palace, and distant about 170 yards, are the remains
of a second palace with a hall of columns, and measuring 124 by 49 ft.,
and on the west side of it is the stone jamb of a doorway similar to
those at Persepolis, and carved with the well-known bas-relief of Cyrus.The third palace has been excavated by Mr.Weld Blundell, and the
foundations of its walls traced, measuring 187 by 131 ft., with a hall
of 24 columns.At Nineveh, as we have seen, all the pillars, the roofs, and the
constructive parts of the building, which were of wood,[91] have
disappeared, and left nothing but the massive walls, which, falling and
being heaped the one on the other, have buried themselves and their
ornaments till the present day.At Persepolis, on the contrary, the
brick walls, being thinner and exposed on the bare surface of the naked
rock, have been washed away by the storms and rains of 2000 years,
leaving only the skeletons of the buildings.In the rocky country of
Persia, however, the architect fortunately used stone; and we have thus
at Persepolis, if the expression may be used, all the bones of the
building, but without the flesh; and at Nineveh, the flesh, but without
the bones that gave it form and substance.View from top of Great Stairs at Persepolis.]The general appearance of the ruins, as they at present stand, will be
seen from the woodcut (No.[92] The principal mass in the foreground
on the left is the Propylæa of Xerxes, and behind that and to the right
stand the pillars of the Chehil Minar, or Great Hall of Xerxes.Between
these are seen in the distance the remains of the smaller halls of
Darius and Xerxes.The most striking features in this view are the staircases that led from
the plain to the platform, and from the lower level to that on which the
great hall stood.Indeed, among these ruins, nothing is more remarkable
than these great flights of steps.The builders of those days were, so
far as we know, the only people who really understood the value of this
feature.The Egyptians seem wholly to have neglected it, and the Greeks
to have cared little about it; but it was not so at Nineveh, where, so
far as we can understand from the indistinct traces left, the stairs
must have been one of the most important parts of the design.But they
were so situated that they were not buried when the buildings were
ruined, and consequently have been removed.At Jerusalem, too, we read
that when the Queen of Sheba saw “the ascent by which Solomon went up to
the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.” Indeed, in all
the ancient temples and palaces of this district, more attention is paid
to this feature than to almost any other; and from their favourable
situation on artificial terraces, the builders were enabled to apply
their stairs with far more effect than any others in ancient or in
modern times.The lower or great staircase at Persepolis is plain, and without any
sculpture, but is built of the most massive Cyclopean masonry, and of
great width and very easy acclivity.That in front of the great hall is
ornamented with sculpture, in three tiers, representing the people of
the land bringing presents and the subject nations tribute, to lay at
the feet of the monarch, combined with mythological representations; the
whole bearing a very considerable resemblance to the sculptures on the
walls of the Assyrian palaces, though the position is different.The
arrangement of these stairs, too, is peculiar, none of them being at
right angles to the buildings they approach, but all being double,
apparently to permit of processions passing the throne, situated in the
porches at their summit, without interruption, and without altering the
line of march.One of these flights, leading to the platform of Xerxes’ palace, is
shown in the woodcut (No.In arrangement it is like the stairs
leading to the great terrace, but very much smaller, and is profusely
adorned with sculpture.The principal apartment in all the buildings situated on the platform is
a central square hall, the floor of which is studded with pillars placed
equidistant the one from the other.The smallest have 4 pillars, the
next 16, then 36, and one has 100 pillars on its floor; but to avoid
inventing new names, we may call these respectively, distyle,
tetrastyle, hexastyle, and decastyle halls, from their having 2, 4, 6,
or 10 pillars on each face of the phalanx, and because that is the
number of the pillars in their porticoes when they have any.The building at the head of the great stairs is a distyle hall, having 4
pillars supporting its roof.On each side of the first public entrance
stands a human-headed winged bull, so nearly identical with those found
in Assyrian palaces as to leave no doubt of their having the same
origin.At the opposite entrance are two bulls without wings, but drawn
with the same bold, massive proportions which distinguish all the
sculptured animals in the palaces of Assyria and Persia.The other, or
palace entrance, is destroyed, the foundation only remaining; but this,
with the foundations of the walls, leaves no room to doubt that the
annexed woodcut (No.89) is a true representation of its
ground-plan.[93] Nor can it be doubted that this is one of those
buildings so frequently mentioned in the Bible as a “gate,” not the door
of a city or buildings, but a gate of justice, such as that where
Mordecai sat at Susa—where Abraham bought his field—where Ruth’s
marriage was judged of—and, indeed, where public business was generally
transacted.There are three other distyle halls or gates on the platform: one to the
westward of this, very much ruined; one in the centre of the whole
group, which seems to have had external porticoes; and a third on the
platform in front of the palace of Xerxes.There are two tetrastyle halls, one of which, erected by Darius (woodcut
No.90), is the most interesting of the smaller buildings on the
terrace.It is the only building that faces the south, and is approached
by a flight of steps, represented with the whole façade of the palace as
it now stands in the woodcut (No.These steps led to a tetrastyle
porch, two ranges in depth, which opened into the central hall with its
16 columns, around which were arranged smaller rooms or cells, either
for the occupation of the king, if it was a palace, or of the priests if
a temple.In the western side a staircase and doorway were added,
somewhat unsymmetrically, by Artaxerxes.These remains would hardly suffice to enable us to restore the external
appearance of the palace; but fortunately the same king who built the
palace for his use on this mound, repeated it in the rock as an “eternal
dwelling” for himself after death.The tomb known as that of Darius at
Naksh-i-Rustam (woodcut No.92), is an exact reproduction, not only of
the architectural features of the palace, but to the same scale, and in
every respect so similar, that it seems impossible to doubt but that the
one was intended as a literal copy of the other.Assuming it to be so,
we learn what kind of cornice rested on the double bull capitals.And
what is still more interesting, we obtain a representation of a prayer
platform, which we have described elsewhere as a Talar,[94] but the
meaning of which we should hardly know but for this representation.The other tetrastyle hall is similar to this, but plainer and somewhat
smaller.Façade of Palace of Darius at Persepolis.Turning from these to the hexastyle halls, the smallest but most perfect
(Woodcut No.91) is that standing on the southern edge of the upper
platform, the inscriptions on which certainly prove it to have been
built by Xerxes.Tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustam, representing the
façade of his Palace surmounted by a Talar.]The platform on which it stands is approached by two flights of steps,
that on the east being the one represented in the woodcut No.84,—there
are also indications of a tetrastyle hall or gate having existed on its
summit,—while that to the west is much simpler.The hall itself had a
portico of 12 columns, and on each side a range of smaller apartments,
the two principal of which had their roof supported by 4 pillars each.The building is one of great beauty in itself, but its greatest value is
that it enables us to understand the arrangement of the great hall of
Xerxes—the Chehil Minar—the most splendid building of which any remains
exist in this part of the world.94)
it will be seen that the arrangement of the whole central part is
identical with that of the building just described.There can be no
possible doubt about this, as the bases of all the 72 columns still
exist in situ, as well as the jambs of the two principal doorways, which
are shaded darker in the plan.The side and rear walls only are restored
from the preceding illustration.The only difference is, that instead of
the two distyle halls on either side, this had hexastyle porticoes of 12
pillars each, similar to that in front; the angles between which were in
all probability filled up with rooms or buildings, as suggested in the
plan.[95]

[Illustration: 94.Restored Plan of Great Hall of Xerxes at Persepolis.Two orders of pillars were employed to support the roof of this splendid
building; one, represented in Woodcut No.91, with double bull capitals,
like those of the porch of Darius’s palace.in
height from the floor to the back of the bull’s neck, or 64 ft.to the
under side of the beam that lay between the bulls.The other order, with
the Ionic volutes (woodcut No.96), was also that employed in the
northern portico, and generally in the interior throughout this
building, and is nearly identical, as far as the base and shaft are
concerned, except in the height of the latter.The capital, however,
differs widely, and is 16 ft.in height, making an order
altogether 9 ft.less than that used externally, the difference
being made up by brackets of wood, which supported the beams of the
roof, internally at least, though externally the double bull capital
probably surmounted these Ionic-like scrolls.There is no reason to doubt that these halls also had platforms or
talars like the smaller halls, which would also serve to shelter any
opening in the roof, though in the present instance it seems very
doubtful if any such openings or skylights existed or were indeed
required.Thus arranged, the section of the buildings would be as shown in the
woodcut (No.97); and presuming this structure to have been sculptured
and painted as richly as others of its age and class, which it no doubt
was, it must have been not only one of the largest, but one of the most
splendid buildings of antiquity.In plan it was a rectangle of about 300
ft.by 350, and consequently covered 105,000 square ft.; it was thus
larger than the hypostyle hall at Karnac, or any of the largest temples
of Greece or Rome.It is larger, too, than any mediæval cathedral except
that of Milan; and although it has neither the stone roof of a
cathedral, nor the massiveness of an Egyptian building, still its size
and proportions, combined with the lightness of its architecture and the
beauty of its decorations, must have made it one of the most beautiful
buildings ever erected.Both in design and proportion it far surpassed
those of Assyria, and though possessing much of detail or ornament that
was almost identical, its arrangement and proportions were so superior
in every respect that no similar building in Nineveh can be compared
with this, the great architectural creation of the Persian Empire.There is no octastyle hall at Persepolis, and only one decastyle.In
this instance the hall itself measured about 225 ft.each way, and had
100 pillars on its floor; still, it was low in proportion, devoid of
lateral porticoes, and consequently by no means so magnificent a
building as the great hall of Xerxes.The portico in front was two
ranges in depth, and flanked by gigantic bulls; but as the whole height
was barely 25 ft., it could not have been a remarkable or pleasing
object.The sculptures on the jambs of the doorways are the most
interesting part of this building; these represent the king on his
throne, and various mythological subjects, on a more extensive scale
than those similarly situated in the other buildings of the platform.Indeed, it is probable that in the other palaces these subjects were
painted on the internal walls, as was done in those Assyrian halls which
were not revêted with slabs.With an appropriateness that cannot be too
much praised, sculpture seems always to have been used in parts of the
building exposed to atmospheric injury, and, because of the exposure, to
have been employed there in preference to painting.Besides these buildings on the platform there are the remains of several
others on the plain, and within the precincts of the town of Istakr is a
building still called the Hareem of Jemsheed, and which may in reality
have been the residence of the Achæmenian kings.It certainly belongs to
their age, and from the irregularity of its form, and its general
proportions, looks very much more like a residence, properly so called,
than any of the monumental erections on the neighbouring platform of
Persepolis.Looked at from an architectural point of view the principal defect of
the interior arrangement, especially of the smaller Persepolitan halls,
is that their floor is unnecessarily crowded with pillars.As these had
to support only a wooden roof, some might have been dispensed with, or a
more artistic arrangement have been adopted.This would no doubt have
been done but for the influence of the Assyrian style, in which frequent
pillars were indispensable to support the heavy flat roofs, and as they
were of timber a greater number were required than would have been the
case if of stone.Those of wood also looked less cumbersome and less in
the way than those made of more durable materials.It is also a defect that the capitals of the pillars retain at
Persepolis so much of the form of their wooden prototypes.In wood such
capitals as those depicted (Woodcuts No.In stone they are clumsy; and the Greeks showed their usual
discrimination when they cut away all the volutes but one pair and
adopted a stone construction for the entablature.Notwithstanding these defects, there is a grandeur of conception about
the Persepolitan halls which entitles them to our admiration.Their
greatest point of interest to the architectural student consists
probably in their being examples of a transition from a wooden to a
stone style of art, and in their enabling us to complete and understand
that art which had been elaborated in the valley of the Euphrates during
previous centuries; but which, owing to the perishable nature of the
materials employed, has almost wholly passed away, without leaving
sufficient traces to enable all its characteristics to be understood or
restored.Loftus at Susa in 1850 laid bare the foundations
of a palace almost identical both in plan and dimensions with the Chehil
Minar at Persepolis.It was, however, much more completely ruined, the
place having long been used as a quarry by the inhabitants of the
neighbouring plains, so that now only the bases of the pillars remain in
situ, with fragments of the shafts and capitals strewed everywhere
about, but no walls or doorways, or other architectural members to
enable us to supply what is wanting at Persepolis.Restored Elevation of Capital at Susa.The bases seem to be of the same form and style as those at Persepolis,
but rather more richly carved.The capitals are also more elaborate, but
more essentially wooden in their form, and betray their origin not only
in the exuberance of their carving but also in the disproportion of the
capital to the shaft.In wood so large a capital does not look
disproportioned to so slender a shaft; in stone the effect is most
disagreeable, and was to a certain extent remedied at Persepolis so soon
as the result was perceived.Whether the Persians would ever have been
able to shake off entirely the wooden original is not quite clear, but
the Greeks, being bound by no such association, cut the knot at once,
and saved them the trouble.In 1885, M. Marcel Dieulafoy turned his attention to the excavations as
left by Loftus, and conceiving the idea that the principal entrance
should be sought for on the south side of the palace, he cut his
trenches in a north-east direction and discovered the traces of the
walls enclosing the court in front of the palace.These walls were faced
with enamelled beton blocks.Portions of these enamels had disappeared,
but sufficient remained, as the walls had fallen on their faces, to
allow of their being placed in their relative positions.From these
fragments M. Dieulafoy was able to put together a frieze of lions not
dissimilar to those found in the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad, with
decorative borders above and below, the whole crowned by a battlement,
also in enamelled colours.The lower portion of the wall was covered
with unglazed bricks of two colours, red and white, arranged in diaper
patterns.Continuing the trench, M. Dieulafoy discovered the great
staircase placed at the south side of the tumulus, a staircase of even
greater dimensions than the well-known example of Persepolis.Loftus’s researches had already proved that the palace consisted of a
central hall of thirty-six columns, with three porticoes of twelve
columns, similar, therefore, to the great hall of Xerxes.M. Dieulafoy’s
discoveries have shown that the central hall was enclosed with a wall,
thus confirming the late Mr.Fergusson’s theory as to the restoration of
the palace of Xerxes (see p.On the east side leading to the royal
entrance of the great hall, M. Dieulafoy discovered the remains of the
great frieze of archers (Woodcut No.99), now in the Louvre; these were
executed in bright enamelled colours on beton bricks.The figures, which
are about 5 ft.in height, are modelled in low relief, arrayed in
processional order, each man grasping a lance in his hand and carrying,
slung on his shoulder, a bow and quiver full of arrows.The shape of
each man’s dress is the same, but the colours and patterns alternate; in
one case the dress is studded with rosettes, in the other with squares
containing the earliest heraldic device known, a representation of three
towers on a hill.These enamels, as also those of the lions and of fragments of the
crenelated staircase, are now all in the Louvre, and retain sufficient
of their pristine effect to suggest a scheme of colour and of decorative
treatment of the greatest beauty.[96] The inscriptions round the bases
of the pillars had already informed us that the hall was erected by
Darius and Xerxes, but repaired and restored by Artaxerxes Mnemon, who
added the inscriptions.This has been confirmed by another inscription
under the lions on the pylons; these M. Dieulafoy attributes to Xerxes,
as fragments of enamelled bricks of burnt clay, and not beton, and
therefore of an earlier building, have been utilised as a filling-in.In
all probability the hall of this palace is the identical hall in which
the scenes described in the Book of Esther took place.The foundations
of other parts of this palace might be no doubt laid bare by further
excavations; but the ruin of the place has been so complete, that little
of interest in an architectural point of view can be looked for.Below
these Persian ruins are probably buried the remains of long-preceding
dynasties, which deeper excavations would lay bare, and which would in
all probability afford a rich harvest to the historical explorer.Near the town of Istakr, and opposite the tombs of Naksh-i-Rustam,
stands a small tower-like building, represented in Woodcut No.The
lower part is solid; the upper contains a small square apartment, roofed
by two great flat slabs of stone.Access to this chamber is obtained by
a doorway situated at some distance from the ground.Both the traditions of the place and the knowledge we have of their
religious practices point to this as one of the fire temples of the
ancient Persians.Its roof is internally still black, probably with the
smoke of ancient fires, and though simple and insignificant as an
architectural monument, it is interesting as the only form of a temple
apart from regal state which the ancient Persians possessed.Another, almost identical in form, is found at Pasargadæ,[97] and a
third exists (according to Stolze) near Maubandajan, at the foot of the
Kuh Pir-i-mard, eleven miles to east of Fasa.Perrot suggests it may
have been the tomb of Hytaspes, father of Darius.The celebrated Kaabah
at Mecca, to which all the Moslem world now bow in prayer, is probably a
fourth, while the temple represented in Woodcut No.81, from Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone, may be a representation of such a structure as
these, with its curtains and paraphernalia complete.It is too evident,
however, that the Persians were not a temple-building people,[98] and
the examples that have come down to our time are too few and too
insignificant on which to found any theory.Little requires to be said of the tombs of the Persians; that of Darius
is represented in plan and elevation in Woodcut No.92, and, as before
remarked, it is a literal copy on the rock of the façade of his palace.Internally, three small cells contained the remains of the king, with
those of the persons, probably his favourite wife or wives for whom he
had destined that honour.Close by this, at Naksh-i-Rustam, are four
others, and in the rock behind Persepolis are three more tombs of the
Achæmenian kings, identical with these in all essential respects; but
still with such a difference in workmanship and detail as would enable a
careful architectural student easily to detect a sequence, and so affix
to each, approximately at least, the name of the king whose sepulchre it
is.Unfortunately, that of Darius only is inscribed; but his position in
the dynasty is so well known, that, starting from that point, it would
be easy to assign each of these tombs to the king who excavated it for
his own resting-place.Although these tombs of the Achæmenians are not remarkable for their
magnificence, they are interesting in an architectural point of view,
inasmuch as—as pointed out above—they enable us to restore their
structural buildings in a manner we would hardly be able to do without
their assistance.They are also interesting ethnographically as
indicating that these kings of Persia were far from being the pure
Aryans the language of their inscriptions would lead us to suspect they
might be.There are not, so far as is yet known, any series of rock-cut
sepulchres belonging to any dynasty of pure Aryan blood.Nor would any
king of Semitic race attempt anything of the sort.Their evidence,
therefore, as far as it goes—and it is tolerably distinct—seems to prove
that the Achæmenian kings were of Turanian race.They only, and not any
of their subjects in Persia, seem to have adopted this style of
grandeur, which, as we shall presently see, was common in Asia Minor,
and other countries subject to their sway, but who were of a different
race altogether.CHAPTER V.

                         INVENTION OF THE ARCH.Before leaving this early section of architecture, it may be as well
briefly to refer to the invention of the true arch, regarding which
considerable misconception still exists.It is generally supposed that the Egyptians were ignorant of the true
principles of the arch, and only employed two stones meeting one another
at a certain angle in the centre when they wished to cover a larger
space than could conveniently be done by a single block.This, however,
seems to be a mistake, as many of the tombs and chambers around the
pyramids and the temples at Thebes are roofed by stone and brick arches
of a semicircular form, and perfect in every respect as far as the
principles of the arch are concerned.Several of these have been drawn by Lepsius, and are engraved in his
work; but, as no text accompanies them, and the drawings are not on a
sufficient scale to make out the hieroglyphics, where any exist, their
date cannot now be ascertained.Consequently, these examples cannot yet
be used as the foundation of any argument on the subject, though the
curved form of the roofs in the Third Pyramid would alone be sufficient
to render it more than probable that during the period of the 4th
dynasty the Egyptians were familiar with this expedient.[99]

At Beni-Hasan, during the time of the 12th dynasty, curvilinear forms
reappear in the roofs (Woodcut No.16), used in such a manner as to
render it almost certain that they are copied from roofs of arcuate
construction.Behind the Rameseum at Thebes there are a series of arches
in brick, which seem undoubtedly to belong to the same age as the
building itself; and Sir G. Wilkinson mentions a tomb at Thebes, the
roof of which is vaulted with bricks, and still bears the name of
Amenoph I., of the 18th dynasty.[100]

The temple at Abydus, erected by Rameses II., shows the same peculiarity
as the tombs at Beni-Hasan, of a flat segmental arch thrown across
between the stone architraves.In this instance it is also a copy in
stone, but such as must have been originally copied from one of brick
construction.There is also every reason to believe that the apartments
of the little pavilion at Medeenet Habû (Woodcuts Nos.32 and 33) were
covered with semicircular vaults, though these have now
disappeared.Hoskins found stone arches vaulting the roofs of the
porches to the pyramids, perfect in construction, and, what is still
more singular, showing both circular and pointed forms (Woodcut No.These, as before remarked, are probably of the time of Tirhakah,
or at all events not earlier than the age of Solomon, nor later than
that of Cambyses.Section of Tomb near the Pyramids of Gizeh.]In the age of Psammeticus we have several stone arches in the
neighbourhood of the pyramids; one, in a tomb at Sakkara, has been
frequently drawn; but one of the most instructive is that in a tomb
discovered by Colonel Campbell (Woodcut No.101), showing a very
primitive form of an arch composed of 3 stones only, and above which is
another arch of regular construction of 4 courses.In his researches at
Nimroud, Layard discovered vaulted drains and chambers below the
north-west and south-east edifices, which were consequently as old as
the 8th or 9th century before our era, and contemporary with those in
the pyramids of Meroë.They were of both circular and pointed forms, and
built apparently with great care and attention to the principles of the
arch (Woodcut No.Vaulted Drain beneath the South-East Palace at
Nimroud.]The great discovery of this class is that of the city gates at
Khorsabad, which, as mentioned at p.181, were spanned by arches of
semicircular form, so perfect both in construction and in the mode in
which they were ornamented, as to prove that in the time of Sargon the
arch was a usual and well-understood building expedient, and one
consequently which we may fairly assume to have been long in use.Arch at Dêr-el-Bahree.On the other hand, we have in the temple at Dêr-el-Bahree in Thebes,
built by Thothmes III., a curious example of the retention of the old
form, when at first sight it would appear as though the true arch would
have been a more correct expedient.In this example, the lower arch is
composed of stones bracketing forward horizontally, though the form of
the arch is semicircular; and above this is a discharging arch of two
stones used as in the Pyramids.The upper arch is so arranged as to
relieve the crown of the lower—which is its weakest part—of all weight,
and at the same time to throw the whole pressure on the outer ends of
the arch stones, exactly where it is wanted.The whole thus becomes
constructively perfect, though it is a more expensive way of attaining
the end desired than by an arch.The truth seems to be, the Egyptians had not at this age invented
voussoirs deeper in the direction of the radii of the arch than in that
of its perimeter; and the arch with them was consequently not generally
an appropriate mode of roofing.It was the Romans with their tiles who
first really understood the true employment of the arch.So far as we can now understand from the discoveries that have been
made, it seems that the Assyrians used the pointed arch for tunnels,
aqueducts, and generally for underground work where they feared great
superincumbent pressure on the apex, and the round arch above-ground
where that was not to be dreaded; and in this they probably showed more
science and discrimination than we do in such works.Arch of the Cloaca Maxima, Rome.In Europe the oldest arch is probably that of Cloaca Maxima at Rome,
constructed under the early kings.It is of stone in 3 rims, and shows
as perfect a knowledge of the principle as any subsequent example.Its
lasting uninjured to the present day proves how well the art was then
understood, and, by inference, how long it must have been practised
before reaching that degree of perfection.From all this it becomes almost certain that the arch was used as early
as the times of the pyramid-builders of the 4th dynasty, and was copied
in the tombs of Beni-Hasan in the 12th; though it may be that the
earliest existing example cannot be dated further back than the first
kings of the 18th dynasty; from that time, however, there can be no
doubt that it was currently used, not only in Egypt, but also in
Ethiopia and Assyria.It would, indeed, be more difficult to account for the fact of such
perfect builders as the Egyptians being ignorant of the arch if such
were the case; though, at the same time, it is easy to understand why
they should use it so sparingly, as they did in their monumental
erections.Even in the simplest arch, that formed of only two stones, such as is
frequently found in the pyramids, and over the highest chamber (Woodcut
No.8), it will be evident that any weight placed on the apex has a
tendency to lower the summit, and press the lower ends of the stones
outwards.Where there was the whole mass of the pyramid to abut against,
this was of no consequence, but in a slighter building it would have
thrust the walls apart, and brought on inevitable ruin.The introduction of a third stone, as in the arch (Woodcut No.101),
hardly remedied this at all, the central stone acting like a wedge to
thrust the two others apart; and even the introduction of 2 more stones,
making 5, as in Woodcut No.105, only distributed the pressure without
remedying the defect; and without the most perfect masonry every
additional joint was only an additional source of weakness.Arches in the Pyramids at Meroë.This has been felt by the architects of all ages and in all countries:
still, the advantage of being able to cover large spaces with small
stones or bricks is so great, that many have been willing to run the
risk; and all the ingenuity of the Gothic architects of the Middle Ages
was applied to overcoming the difficulty.But even the best of their
buildings are unstable from this cause, and require constant care and
attention to keep them from falling.The Indian architects have fallen into the other extreme, refusing to
use the arch under any circumstances, and preferring the smallest
dimensions and the most crowded interiors, to adopting what they
consider so destructive an expedient.As mentioned in the Introduction
(page 22), their theory is that “an arch never sleeps,” and is
constantly tending to tear a building to pieces: and, where aided by
earthquakes and the roots of trees, there is only too much truth in
their belief.The Egyptians seem to have followed a middle course, using arches either
in tombs, where the rock formed an immovable abutment; or in pyramids
and buildings, where the mass immensely overpowered the thrust; or
underground, where the superincumbent earth prevented movement.They seem also to have used flat segmental arches of brickwork between
the rows of massive architraves which they placed on their pillars; and
as all these abutted one another, like the arches of a bridge, except
the external ones, which were sufficiently supported by the massive
walls, the mode of construction was a sound one.This is exactly that
which we have re-introduced during the last 30 years, in consequence of
the application of cast-iron beams, between which flat segmental arches
of brick are thrown, when we desire to introduce a more solid and
fire-proof construction than is possible with wood only.In their use of the arch, as in everything else, the building science of
the Egyptians seems to have been governed by the soundest principles and
the most perfect knowledge of what was judicious and expedient, and what
should be avoided.Many of their smaller edifices have no doubt perished
from the scarcity of wood forcing the builders to employ brick arches,
but they wisely avoided the use of these in all their larger
monuments—in all, in fact, which they wished should endure to the latest
posterity.CHRONOLOGICAL MEMORANDA CONNECTED WITH ARCHITECTURE.Moses      B.C.1312

The Jews, like the other Semitic races, were not a building people, and
never aspired to monumental magnificence as a mode of perpetuating the
memory of their greatness.The palace of Solomon was wholly of cedar
wood, and must have perished of natural decay in a few centuries, if it
escaped fire and other accidents incident to such temporary structures.Their first temple was a tent, their second depended almost entirely on
its metallic ornaments for its splendour, and it was not till the Greeks
and Romans taught them how to apply stone and stone carving for this
purpose that we have anything that can be called architecture in the
true sense of the term.This deficiency of monuments is, however, by no means peculiar to the
Jewish people.As before observed, we should know hardly anything of the
architecture of Assyria but for the existence of the wainscot slabs of
their palaces, though they were nearly a purely Semitic people, but
their art rested on a Turanian basis.Neither Tyre nor Sidon have left
us a single monument; nor Utica nor Carthage one vestige that dates
anterior to the Roman period.What is found at Jerusalem, at Baalbec, at
Palmyra, or Petra, even in the countries beyond the Jordan, is all
Roman.What little traces of Phœnician art are picked up in the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean are copies, with Egyptian or
Grecian details, badly and unintelligently copied, and showing a want of
appreciation of the first principles of art that is remarkable in that
age.It is therefore an immense gain if by our knowledge of Assyrian art
we are enabled, even in a moderate degree, to realise the form of
buildings which have long ceased to exist, and are only known to us from
verbal descriptions.Diagram Plan of Solomon’s Palace.The most celebrated secular building of the Jews was the palace which
Solomon was occupied in building during the thirteen years which
followed his completion of the Temple.As not one vestige of this
celebrated building remains, and even its site is a matter of dispute,
the annexed plan must be taken only as an attempt to apply the knowledge
we have acquired in Assyria and Judea to the elucidation of the
descriptions of the Bible and Josephus,[102] and as such may be
considered of sufficient interest to deserve a place in the History of
Architecture.The principal apartment here, as in all Eastern palaces, was the great
audience hall, in this instance 150 feet in length by 75 in width; the
roof composed of cedar, and, like the Ninevite palaces, supported by
rows of cedar pillars on the floor.According to Josephus, who, however,
never saw it, and had evidently the Roman Stoa Basilica of the Temple in
his eye, the section would probably have been as shown in diagram A. But
the contemporary Bible narrative, which is the real authority, would
almost certainly point to something more like the Diagram B in the
annexed woodcut.Diagram Sections of the House of the Cedars of
Lebanon.]Next in importance to this was the Porch, which was the audience or
reception hall, attached to the private apartments; these two being the
Dewanni Aum and Dewanni Khas of Eastern palaces, at this day.The Hall
of Judgment we may venture to restore with confidence, from what we find
at Persepolis and Khorsabad; and the courts are arranged in the diagram
as they were found in Ninevite palaces.They are proportioned, so far as
we can now judge, to those parts of which the dimensions are given by
the authorities, and to the best estimate we can now make of what would
be most suitable to Solomon’s state, and to such a capital as Jerusalem
was at that time.From Josephus we learn that Solomon built the walls of this palace “with
stones 10 cubits in length, and wainscoted them with stones that were
sawed and were of great value, such as are dug out of the earth for the
ornaments of temples and the adornment of palaces.”[103] These were
ornamented with sculptures in three rows, but the fourth or upper row
was the most remarkable, being covered with foliage in relief, of the
most exquisite workmanship; above this the walls were plastered and
ornamented with paintings in colour: all of which is the exact
counterpart of what we find at Nineveh.From the knowledge we now possess of Assyrian palaces it might indeed be
possible to restore this building with fairly approximate correctness,
but it would hardly be worth while to attempt this except in a work
especially devoted to Jewish art.For the present it must suffice to
know that the affinities of the architecture of Solomon’s age were
certainly Assyrian; and from our knowledge of the one we may pretty
accurately realise the form of the other.TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM.Although not one stone remains upon another of the celebrated Temple of
Jerusalem, still, the descriptions in the Bible and Josephus are so
precise, that now that we are able to interpret them by the light of
other buildings, its history can be written with very tolerable
certainty.The earliest temple of the Jews was the Tabernacle, the plan of which
they always considered as divinely revealed to them through Moses in the
desert of Sinai, and from which they consequently never departed in any
subsequent erections.Its dimensions were for the cella, or Holy of
Holies, 10 cubits or 15 ft.cube; for the outer temple, two such cubes
or 15 ft.These were covered by the sloping roofs of the tent,
which extended 5 cubits in every direction beyond the temple itself,
making the whole 40 cubits or 60 ft.in length by 20 cubits or 30 ft.These stood within an enclosure 100 cubits long by 50 cubits
wide.[104]

[Illustration: 108.The Tabernacle, showing one half ground plan and one
half as covered by the curtains.]1015) built the Temple, he did not alter the
disposition in any manner, but adopted it literally, only doubling every
dimension.Thus the Holy of Holies became a cube of 20 cubits; the Holy
place, 20 by 40; the porch and the chambers which surrounded it 10
cubits each, making a total of 80 cubits or 120 ft.by 40 cubits or 60
ft., with a height of 30 as compared with 15, which was the height of
the ridge of the Tabernacle, and it was surrounded by a court the
dimensions of which were 200 cubits in length by 100 in width.Even with these increased dimensions the Temple was a very insignificant
building in size: the truth being that, like the temples of Semitic
nations, it was more in the character of a shrine or of a treasury
intended to contain certain precious works in metal.South-East View of the Tabernacle, as restored by
the Author.]The principal ornaments of its façade were two brazen pillars, Jachin
and Boaz, which seem to have been wonders of metal work, and regarding
which more has been written, and it may be added, more nonsense, than
regarding almost any other known architectural objects.The truth of the
matter appears to be that the translators of our Bibles in no instance
were architects, and none of the architects who have attempted the
restoration were learned as Hebrew scholars; and consequently the truth
has fallen to the ground between the two.A brazen pillar, however, 18
cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference—6 ft.in diameter—is an
absurdity that no brass-founder ever could have perpetrated.In the
Hebrew, the 15th verse reads: “He cast two pillars of brass, 18 cubits
was the height of the one pillar, and a line of 12 cubits encompassed
the other pillar.”[105] The truth of the matter seems to be that what
Solomon erected was a screen (chapiter) consisting of two parts, one 4
cubits, the other 5 cubits in height, and supported by two pillars of
metal, certainly not more than 1 cubit in diameter, and standing 12
cubits apart: nor does it seem difficult to perceive what purpose this
screen was designed to effect.As will be observed, in the restoration
of the Tabernacle (Woodcut No.109), the whole of the light to the
interior is admitted from the front.In the Temple the only light that
could penetrate to the Holy of Holies was from the front also; and
though the Holy place was partially lighted from the sides, its
principal source of light must have been through the eastern façade.In
consequence of this there must have been a large opening or window in
this front, and as a window was a thing that they had not yet learned to
make an ornamental feature in architectural design, they took this mode
of screening and partially, at least, hiding it.It becomes almost absolutely certain that this is the true solution of
the riddle, when we find that when Herod rebuilt the Temple in the first
century B.C., he erected a similar screen for the same purpose in front
of his Temple.Its dimensions, however, were one-third larger.It was 40
cubits high, and 20 cubits across, and it supported five beams instead
of two;[106] not to display the chequer-work and pomegranates of
Solomon’s screen, but to carry the Golden Vine, which was the principal
ornament of the façade of the Temple in its latest form.[107]

[Illustration: 110.Plan of Solomon’s Temple, showing the disposition of
the chambers in two storeys.]Although it is easy to understand how it was quite possible in metal
work to introduce all the ornaments enumerated in the Bible, and with
gilding and colour to make these objects of wonder, we have no examples
with which we can compare them, and any restoration must consequently be
somewhat fanciful.Still, we must recollect that this was the “bronze
age” of architecture.Homer tells us of the brazen house of Priam, and
the brazen palace of Alcinous; the Treasuries at Mycenæ were covered
internally with bronze plates; and in Etruscan tombs of this age metal
was far more essentially the material of decoration than carving in
stone, or any of the modes afterwards so frequently adopted.The altar
of the Temple was of brass.The molten sea, supported by twelve brazen
oxen; the bases, the lavers, and all the other objects in metal work,
were in reality what made the Temple so celebrated; and very little was
due to the mere masonry by which we should judge of a Christian church
or any modern building.No pillars are mentioned as supporting the roof, but every analogy
derived from Persian architecture, as well as the constructive
necessities of the case, would lead us to suppose they must have
existed, four in the sanctuary and eight in the pronaos.Plan of Temple at Jerusalem, as rebuilt by Herod.The temple which Ezekiel saw in a vision on the banks of the Chebar was
identical in dimensions with that of Solomon, in so far as naos and
pronaos were concerned.But a passage round the naos was introduced,
giving access to the chambers, which added 10 cubits to its dimensions
every way, making it 100 cubits by 60.The principal court, which
contained the Altar and the Temple properly so called, had the same
dimensions as in Solomon’s Temple; but he added, in imagination at
least, four courts, each 100 cubits or 150 ft.That on the east
certainly existed, and seems to have been the new court of Solomon’s
Temple,[108] and is what in that of Herod became the court of the
Gentiles.The north and south courts were never apparently carried out.They did not exist in Solomon’s Temple, and there is evidence to show
that they were not found in Zerubbabel’s.[109] That on the north-west
angle was the citadel of the Temple, where the treasures were kept, and
which was afterwards replaced by the Tower Antonia.View of the Temple from the East, as it appeared at
the time of the Crucifixion.When the Jews returned from the Captivity they rebuilt the Temple
exactly as it had been described by Ezekiel, in so far as dimensions are
concerned, except that, as just mentioned, they do not seem to have been
able to accomplish the northern and southern courts.The materials, however, were probably inferior to the original Temple;
and we hear nothing of brazen pillars in the porch, nor of the splendid
vessels and furniture which made the glory of Solomon’s Temple, so that
the Jews were probably justified in mourning over its comparative
insignificance.[110]

In the last Temple we have a perfect illustration of the mode in which
the architectural enterprises of that country were carried out.The
priests restored the Temple itself, not venturing to alter a single one
of its sacred dimensions, only adding wings to the façade so as to make
it 100 cubits wide, and it is said 100 cubits high, while the length
remained 100 cubits as before.[111] At this period, however, Judea was
under the sway of the Romans and under the influence of their ideas, and
the outer courts were added with a magnificence of which former builders
had no conception, but bore strongly the impress of the architectural
magnificence of the Romans.An area measuring 600 feet each way was enclosed by terraced walls of
the utmost lithic grandeur.On these were erected porticoes unsurpassed
by any we know of.One, the Stoa Basilica, had a section equal to that
of our largest cathedrals, and surpassed them all in length, and within
this colonnaded enclosure were ten great gateways, two of which were of
surpassing magnificence: the whole making up a rich and varied pile
worthy of the Roman love of architectural display, but in singular
contrast with the modest aspirations of a purely Semitic people.It is always extremely difficult to restore any building from mere
verbal description, and still more so when erected by a people of whose
architecture we know so little as we do of that of the Jews.Still, the
woodcut on the opposite page is probably not very far from representing
the Temple as it was after the last restoration by Herod, barring of
course the screen bearing the Vine mentioned above, which is omitted.Without attempting to justify every detail, it seems such a mixture of
Roman with Phœnician forms as might be expected and is warranted by
Josephus’s description.There is no feature for which authority could
not be quoted, but the difficulty is to know whether or not the example
adduced is the right one, or the one which bears most directly on the
subject.After all, perhaps, its principal defect is that it does not
(how can a modern restoration?)do justice to the grandeur and beauty of
the whole.As it has been necessary to anticipate the chronological sequence of
events in order not to separate the temples of the Jews from one
another, it may be as well before proceeding further to allude to
several temples similarly situated which apparently were originally
Semitic shrines but rebuilt in Roman times.That at Palmyra, for
instance, is a building very closely resembling that at Jerusalem, in so
far at least as the outer enclosure is concerned.[112] It consists of a
cloistered enclosure of somewhat larger dimensions, measuring externally
730 ft.by 715, with a small temple of an anomalous form in the centre.It wants, however, all the inner enclosures and curious substructures of
the Jewish fane; but this may have arisen from its having been rebuilt
in late Roman times, and consequently shorn of these peculiarities.It
is so similar, however, that it must be regarded as a cognate temple to
that at Jerusalem, though re-erected by a people of another race.A third temple, apparently very similar to these, is that of Kangovar in
Persia.[113] Only a portion now remains of the great court in which it
stood, and which was nearly of the same dimensions as those of Jerusalem
and Palmyra, being 660 ft.In the centre are the vestiges of a
small temple.At Aizaini in Asia Minor[114] is a fourth, with a similar
court; but here the temple is more important, and assumes more
distinctly the forms of a regular Roman peristylar temple of the usual
form, though still small and insignificant for so considerable an
enclosure.The mosque of Damascus was once one of these great square
temple-enclosures, with a small temple, properly so called, in the
centre.It may have been as magnificent, perhaps more so, than any of
these just enumerated, but it has been so altered by Christian and
Moslem rebuildings, that it is almost impossible now to make out what
its original form may have been.None of these are original buildings, but still, when put together and
compared the one with the other, and, above all, when examined by the
light which discoveries farther east have enabled us to throw on the
subject, they enable us to restore this style in something like its
pristine form.At present, it is true, they are but the scattered
fragments of an art of which it is feared no original specimens now
remain, and which can only therefore be recovered by induction from
similar cognate examples of other, though allied, styles of art.Historical notice—Tombs at Smyrna—Doganlu—Lycian tombs.It is now perhaps in vain to expect that any monuments of the most
ancient times, of great extent or of great architectural importance,
remain to be discovered in Asia Minor; still, it is a storehouse from
which much information may yet be gleaned, and whence we may expect the
solution of many dark historical problems, if ever they are to be solved
at all.Situated as that country is, in the very centre of the old world,
surrounded on three sides by navigable seas opening all the regions of
the world to her commerce, possessing splendid harbours, a rich soil,
and the finest climate of the whole earth, it must not only have been
inhabited at the earliest period of history, but must have risen to a
pitch of civilisation at a time preceding any written histories that we
possess.We may recollect that, in the time of Psammeticus, Phrygia
contended with Egypt for the palm of antiquity, and from the monuments
of the 18th dynasty we know what rich spoil, what beautiful vases of
gold, and other tributes of a rich and luxurious people, the Pout and
Roteno and other inhabitants of Asia Minor brought and laid at the feet
of Thothmes and other early kings eighteen centuries at least before the
Christian era.At a later period (716 to 547 B.C.)the Lydian empire was one of the
richest and most powerful in Asia; and contemporary with this and for a
long period subsequent to it, the Ionian colonies of Greece surpassed
the mother country in wealth and refinement, and almost rivalled her in
literature and art.Few cities of the ancient world surpassed Ephesus,
Sardis, or Halicarnassus in splendour; and Troy, Tarsus, and Trebisond
mark three great epochs in the history of Asia Minor which are
unsurpassed in interest and political importance by the retrospect of
any cities of the world.Excepting, however, the remains of the Greek
and Roman periods—the great temples of the first, and the great theatres
of the latter period—little that is architectural remains in this once
favoured land.It happens also unfortunately that there was no great
capital city—no central point—where we can look for monuments of
importance.The defect in the physical geography of the country is that
it has no great river running through it—no vast central plain capable
of supporting a population sufficiently great to overpower the rest and
to give unity to the whole.Elevation of Tumulus at Tantalais.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’) 100 ft.Plan and Section of Chamber in Tumulus at
Tantalais.]So far as our researches yet reach, it would seem that the oldest
remains still found in Asia Minor are the tumuli of Tantalais, on the
northern shore of the Gulf of Smyrna.They seem as if left there most
opportunely to authenticate the tradition of the Etruscans having sailed
from this port for Italy.One of these is represented in Woodcuts Nos.Though these tumuli are built wholly of stone, no one
familiar with architectural resemblances can fail to see in them a
common origin with those of Etruria.Sandra went back to the garden.The stylobate, the sloping sides,
the inner chamber, with its pointed roof, all the arrangements, indeed,
are the same, and the whole character of the necropolis at Tantalais
would be as appropriate at Tarquinii or Cæræ as at Smyrna.Another tumulus of equal interest historically is that of Alyattes, near
Sardis, described with such care by Herodotus,[115] and which was
explored 35 years ago by Spiegelthal, the Prussian consul at
Smyrna.[116] According to the measurements of Herodotus, it was either
3800 or 4100 ft.in circumference; at present it is found to be 1180 ft.in diameter, and consequently about 3700 ft.in circumference at the top
of the basement, though of course considerably more below.It is
situated on the edge of a rocky ridge, which is made level on one side
by a terrace-wall of large stones, 60 ft.in height; above this the
mound rises to the height of 142 ft.: the total height above the plain
being 228 ft.The upper part of the mound is composed of alternate
layers of clay, loam, and a kind of rubble concrete.These support a
mass of brickwork, surmounted by a platform of masonry; on this one of
the steles described by Herodotus still lies, and one of the smaller
ones was found close by.The funereal chamber was discovered resting on the rock at about 160 ft.high; the roof flat and composed of large stones, on which
rested a layer of charcoal and ashes, 2 ft.in thickness, evidently the
remains of the offerings which had been made after the chamber was
closed, but before the mound had been raised over it.There are in the same locality an immense number of tumuli of various
dimensions, among which Herr Spiegelthal fancies he can discriminate
three classes, belonging to three distinct ages; that of Alyattes
belonging to the most modern.This is extremely probable, as at this
time (B.C.561) the fashion of erecting tumuli as monuments was dying
out in this part of the world, though it continued in less civilised
parts of Europe till long after the Christian era.The tumuli that still adorn the Plain of Troy are probably contemporary
with the oldest of the three groups of those around the Gygean Lake.Indeed, there does not seem much reason for doubting that they were
really raised over the ashes of the heroes who took part in that
memorable struggle, and whose names they still bear.The recent explorations of these mounds do not seem to have thrown much
light on the subject, but if we can trust the account Chevalier gives of
his researches at the end of the last century, the case is clear enough,
and there can be very little doubt but that the Dios Tepe on the Sigæan
promontory is really the tomb of Achilles.[117] Intensely interesting
though they are in other respects, Schliemann’s discoveries on the site
of Troy have done very little to increase our knowledge of the
architecture of the period.This may partly be owing to his ignorance of
the art, and to his having no architect with him, but it does not appear
that any architectural mouldings were discovered earlier than those of
“Ilium Novum,” two or three centuries before Christ.The so-called
Temple of Minerva was without pillars or mouldings of any sort, and the
walls and gates of the old city were equally devoid of ornament.What
was found seems to confirm the idea that the Trojans were a
Turanian-Pelasgic people burying their dead in mounds, and revelling in
barbaric splendour, but not having reached that degree of civilisation
which would induce them to seek to perpetuate their forms of art in more
permanent materials than earth and metals.[118]


It is not clear whether any other great groups of tumuli exist in Asia
Minor, but it seems more than probable that in the earliest times the
whole of this country was inhabited by a Pelasgic race, who were the
first known occupants of Greece, and who built the so-called Treasuries
of Mycenæ and Orchomenos, and who sent forth the Etruscans to civilise
Italy.If this be so, it accounts for the absence of architectural
remains, for they would have left behind them no buildings but the
sepulchres of their departed great ones; and if their history is to be
recovered, it must be sought for in the bowels of the earth, and not in
anything existing above-ground.Next to these in point of age and style comes a curious group of
rock-cut monuments, found in the centre of the land at Doganlu.They are
placed on the rocky side of a narrow valley, and are unconnected
apparently with any great city or centre of population.Generally they
are called tombs, but there are no chambers nor anything about them to
indicate a funereal purpose, and the inscriptions which accompany them
are not on the monuments themselves, nor do they refer to such a
destination.Altogether they are certainly among the most mysterious
remains of antiquity, and, beyond a certain similarity to the rock-cut
tombs around Persepolis, present no features that afford even a remote
analogy to other monuments which might guide us in our conjectures as to
the purpose for which they were designed.They are of a style of art
clearly indicating a wooden origin, and consist of a square
frontispiece, either carved into certain geometric shapes, or apparently
prepared for painting; at each side is a flat pilaster, and above a
pediment terminating in two scrolls.Some—apparently the more
modern—have pillars of a rude Doric order, and all indeed are much more
singular than beautiful.When more of the same class are discovered,
they may help us to some historic data: all that we can now advance is,
that, judging from the inscriptions on them and the traditions in
Herodotus, they would appear to belong to some race from Thessaly, or
thereabouts, who at some remote period crossed the Hellespont and
settled in their neighbourhood; they may be dated as far back as 1000,
and most probably 700 years at least before the Christian Era.Rock-cut Frontispiece at Doganlu.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’)]

There are other rock-cut sculptures farther east, at Pterium and
elsewhere; but all these are figure sculptures, without architectural
form or details, and therefore hardly coming within the limits of this
work.The only remaining important architectural group in Asia Minor is that
of Lycia, made known in this country since the year 1838, by the
investigations of Sir Charles Fellows and others.Interesting though
they certainly are, they are extremely disheartening to any one looking
for earlier remains in this land,—inasmuch as all of them, and more
especially the older ones, indicate distinctly a wooden origin—more
strongly perhaps than any architectural remains in the Western world.The oldest of them cannot well be carried farther back than the Persian
conquest of Cyrus and Harpagus.In other words, it seems perfectly
evident that up to that period the Lycians used only wood for their
buildings, and that it was only at that time, and probably from the
Greeks or Egyptians, that they, like the Persians themselves, first
learnt to substitute for their frail and perishable structures others of
a more durable material.As already observed, the same process can be traced in Egypt in the
earliest ages.In Central Asia the change was effected by the Persians.In India between the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.In Greece—in what was
not borrowed from the Egyptians—the change took place a little earlier
than in Lycia, or say in the 7th century B.C.What is important to
observe here is that, wherever the process can be detected, it is in
vain to look for earlier buildings.It is only in the infancy of stone
architecture that men adhere to wooden forms; and as soon as habit gives
them familiarity with the new material they abandon the incongruities of
the style, and we lose all trace of the original form, which never
reappears at an after age.All the original buildings of Lycia are tombs or monumental erections of
some kind, and generally may be classed under two heads, those having
curvilinear and those having rectilinear roofs, of both which classes
examples are found structural—or standing alone—as well as rock-cut.It consists
first of a double podium, which may have been in all cases, or at least
generally, of stone.Above this is a rectangular chest or sarcophagus,
certainly copied from a wooden form; all the mortises and framing, even
to the pins that held them together, being literally rendered in the
stonework.Above this is a curvilinear roof of pointed form, which also
is in all its parts a copy of an original in wood.The staves or bearers of the lower portion of the chest or sarcophagus
would suggest that the original feature was a portable ark, the upper
portion of which was framed in bamboo or some pliable wood tied together
by cross timbers or purlins which are carved on the principal front.A
somewhat similar scheme of construction is shown in the Chaityas of the
Buddhist temples, which are supposed to have been copies of wooden
structures not dissimilar to the Toda Mant huts which are built by the
Hindus down to the present day.[119]

[Illustration: 118.(From Forbes and Spratt’s
‘Lycia.’)]

[Illustration: 119.(From Sir Charles Fellows’s
work.)](From Texier’s ‘Asie
Mineure.’)]

When these forms are repeated in the rock the stylobate is omitted, and
only the upper part represented, as shown in the annexed woodcut (No.When the curvilinear roof is omitted, a flat one is substituted, nearly
similar to those common in the country at the present day, consisting of
beams of unsquared timber, laid side by side as close as they can be
laid, and over this a mass of concrete or clay, sufficiently thick to
prevent the rain from penetrating through.Sometimes this is surmounted
by a low pediment, and sometimes the lower framing also stands out from
the rock, so as to give the entrance of the tomb something of a
porchlike form.Both these forms are illustrated in the two woodcuts
(Nos.119 and 120), and numerous varieties of them are shown in the
works of Sir Charles Fellows and others, all containing the same
elements, and betraying most distinctly the wooden origin from which
they were derived.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

The last form that these buildings took was in the substitution of an
Ionic façade for these carpentry forms: this was not done apparently at
once, for, though the Ionic form was evidently borrowed from the
neighbouring Greek cities, it was only adopted by degrees, and even then
betrayed more strongly the wooden forms from which its entablature was
derived than is usually found in other or more purely Grecian examples.As soon as it had fairly gained a footing, the wooden style was
abandoned, and a masonry one substituted in its stead.The whole change
took place in this country probably within a century; but this is not a
fair test of the time such a process usually takes, as here it was
evidently done under foreign influence and with the spur given by the
example of a stone-building people.We have no knowledge of how long it
took in Egypt to effect the transformation.In India, where the form and
construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these
examples in Lycia, the process can be traced through five or six
centuries; and in Persia it took perhaps nearly as long to convert the
wooden designs of the Assyrians into even the imperfect stone
architecture of the Achæmenians.Even in their best and most perfect
buildings, however, much remained to be done before the carpentry types
were fairly got rid of and the style became entitled to rank among the
masonic arts of the world.The remaining ancient buildings of Asia Minor were all built by the
Greeks and Romans, each in their own style, so that their classification
and description belong properly to the chapters treating of the
architectural history of those nations, from which they cannot properly
be separated, although it is at the same time undoubtedly true that the
purely European forms of the art were considerably modified by the
influence on them of local Asiatic forms and feelings.The Ionic order,
for instance, which arose in the Grecian colonies on the coast, is only
the native style of this country Doricised, if the expression may be
used.In other words, the local method of building had become so
modified and altered by the Greeks in adapting it to the Doric, which
had become the typical style with them, as to cause the loss of almost
all its original Asiatic forms.It thus became essentially a stone
architecture with external columns, instead of a style indulging only in
wooden pillars, and those used internally, as there is every reason to
suppose was the earlier form of the art.The Ionic style, thus composed
of two elements, took the arrangement of the temples from the Doric, and
their details from the Asiatic original.The Roman temples, on the
contrary, which have been erected in this part of the world, in their
columns and other details exactly follow the buildings at Rome itself:
while, as in the instances above quoted of Jerusalem, Palmyra, Kangovar,
and others, the essential forms and arrangements are all local and
Asiatic.The former are Greek temples with Asiatic details, the latter
Asiatic temples with only Roman masonic forms.The Greeks, in fact, were
colonists, the Romans only conquerors; and hence the striking difference
in the style of Asiatic art executed under their respective influence.We shall have frequent occasion in the sequel to refer to this
difference.Though not strictly within the geographical limits of this chapter,
there is a group of tombs at Amrith—the ancient Marathos, on the coast
of Syria—which are too interesting to be passed over; but so exceptional
in the present state of our knowledge, that it is difficult to assign
them their proper place anywhere.The principal monument, represented in woodcut No.in height, composed of very large blocks of stone and situated over a
sepulchral cavern.There is no inscription or indication to enable us to
fix its date with certainty.[120] The details of its architecture might
be called Assyrian; but we know of nothing in that country that at all
resembles it.On the other hand there is a moulding on its base, which,
if correctly drawn, would appear to be of Roman origin; and there is a
look about the lions that would lead us to suspect they were carved
under Greek influence—after the age of Alexander at least.Elevation of the Monument and Section of the Tomb at
Amrith.[121])]

The interest consists in its being almost the only perfect survivor of a
class of monuments at one time probably very common; but which we are
led to believe from the style of ornamentation were generally in brick.It is also suggestive, from its close resemblance to the Buddhist topes
in Afghanistan and India; the tall form of those, especially in the
first-named country, and their universally domical outline, point
unmistakably to some such original as this: and lastly, were I asked to
point out the building in the old world which most resembled the stele
which Herod erected over the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem, in
expiation of his desecration of their sanctity,[122] this is the
monument to which I should unhesitatingly refer.(From
Wordsworth’s ‘Athens.’[123])]

Till within a very recent period the histories of Greece and Rome have
been considered as the ancient histories of the world; and even now, in
our universities and public schools, it is scarcely acknowledged that a
more ancient record has been read on the monuments of Egypt and dug out
of the bowels of the earth in Assyria.It is nevertheless true that the decipherment of the hieroglyphics on
the one hand, and the reading of the arrow-headed characters on the
other, have disclosed to us two forms of civilisation anterior to that
which reappeared in Greece in the 8th century before Christ.Based on
those that preceded it, the Hellenic form developed itself there with a
degree of perfection never before seen, nor has it, in its own peculiar
department, ever been since surpassed.These discoveries have been of the utmost importance, not only in
correcting our hitherto narrow views of ancient history, but in
assisting to explain much that was obscure, or utterly unintelligible,
in those histories with which we were more immediately familiar.We now,
for the first time, comprehend whence the Greeks obtained many of their
arts and much of their civilisation, and to what extent the character of
these was affected by the sources from which they were derived.Having already described the artistic forms of Egypt and Assyria, it is
not difficult to discover the origin of almost every idea, and of every
architectural feature, that was afterwards found in Greece.But even
with this assistance we should not be able to understand the phenomena
which Greek art presents to us, were it not that the monuments reveal to
us the existence of two distinct and separate races existing
contemporaneously in Greece.If the Greeks were as purely Aryan as their
language would lead us to believe, all our ethnographic theories are at
fault.But this is precisely one of those cases where archæology steps
in to supplement what philology tells us and to elucidate what that
science fails to reveal.That the language of the Greeks, with the
smallest possible admixture from other sources, is pure Aryan, no one
will dispute: but their arts, their religion, and frequently their
institutions, tend to ascribe to them an altogether different origin.Fortunately the ruins at Mycenæ and Orchomenos are sufficient to afford
us a key to the mystery.From them we learn that at the time of the war
of Troy a people were supreme in Greece who were not Hellenes, but who
were closely allied to the Etruscans and other tomb-building, art-loving
races.Whether they were purely Turanian, or merely ultra-Celtic, may be
questioned; but one thing seems clear, that this people were then known
to the ancients under the name of Pelasgi, and it is their presence in
Greece, mixed up with the more purely Dorian races, which explains what
would otherwise be unintelligible in Grecian civilisation.Except from our knowledge of the existence of a strong infusion of
Turanian blood into the veins of the Grecian people, it would be
impossible to understand how a people so purely Aryan in appearance came
to adopt a religion so essentially Anthropic and Ancestral.Their belief
in oracles, their worship of trees,[124] and many minor peculiarities,
were altogether abhorrent to the Aryan mind.The existence of these two antagonistic elements satisfactorily explains
how it was that while art was unknown in the purely Dorian city of
Sparta, it flourished so exuberantly in the quasi-Pelasgic city of
Athens; why the Dorians borrowed their architectural order from Egypt,
and hardly changed its form during the long period they employed it; and
how it came to pass that the eastern art of the Persians was brought
into Greece, and how it was there modified so essentially that we hardly
recognise the original in its altered and more perfect form.It
explains, too, how the different States of Greece were artistic or
matter-of-fact in the exact proportion in which either of the two
elements predominated in the people.Thus the poetry of Arcadia was unknown in the neighbouring State of
Sparta; but the Doric race there remained true to their institutions and
spread their colonies and their power farther than any other of the
little principalities of Greece.The institutions of Lycurgus could
never have been maintained in Athens; but, on the other hand, the
Parthenon was as impossible in the Lacedemonian State.Even in Athens
art would not have been the wonder that it became without that happy
admixture of the two races which then prevailed, mingling the common
sense of the one with the artistic feeling of the other, which tended to
produce the most brilliant intellectual development which has yet
dazzled the world with its splendour.The contemporary presence of these two races perhaps also explains how
Greek civilisation, though so wonderfully brilliant, passed so quickly
away.Had either race been pure, the Dorian institutions might have
lasted as long as the village-systems of India or the arts of Egypt or
China; but where two dissimilar races mix, the tendency is inevitably to
revert to the type of one, and, though the intermixture may produce a
stock more brilliant than either parent, the type is less permanent and
soon passes away.So soon was it the case, in this instance, that the
whole of the great history of Greece may be said to be comprehended in
the period ranging between the battle of Marathon (B.C.490) and the
peace concluded with Philip of Macedon by the Athenians (B.C.346): so
that the son of a man who was born before the first event may have been
a party to the second.All those wonders of patriotism, of poetry, and
art, for which Greece was famous, crowded into the short space of a
century and a half, is a phenomenon the like of which the world has not
seen before, and is not likely to witness again.As might be expected, from the length of time that has elapsed since the
Pelasgic races ruled in Greece, and owing to the numerous changes that
have taken place in that country since their day, their architectural
remains are few, and comparatively insignificant.It has thus come to
pass that, were it not for their tombs, their city walls, and their
works of civil engineering, such as bridges and tunnels—in which they
were pre-eminent—we should hardly now possess any material remains to
prove their existence or mark the degree of civilisation to which they
had reached.Section and Plan of Tomb of Atreus at Mycenæ.The most remarkable of these remains are the tombs of the kings of
Mycenæ, a city which in Homeric times had a fair title to be considered
the capital of Greece, or at all events to be considered one of the most
important of her cities.The Dorians described these as treasuries, from
the number of precious objects found in them, as in the tombs of the
Etruscans, and because they looked upon such halls as far more than
sufficient for the narrow dwellings of the dead.The most perfect and
the largest of them now existing is known as the Treasury or Tomb of
Atreus at Mycenæ, shown in plan and section in the annexed woodcut.The
principal chamber is 48 ft.in diameter, and is, or was when
perfect, of the shape of a regular equilateral pointed arch, a form well
adapted to the mode of construction, which is that of horizontal layers
of stones, projecting the one beyond the other, till one small stone
closed the whole, and made the vault complete.As will be explained further on, this was the form of dome adopted by
the Jaina architects in India.It prevailed also in Italy and Asia Minor
wherever a Pelasgic race is traced, down to the time when the pointed
form again came into use in the Middle Ages, though it was not then used
as a horizontal, but as a radiating arch.On one side of this hall is a chamber cut in the rock, the true
sepulchre apparently, and externally is a long passage leading to a
doorway, which, judging from the fragments that remain (Woodcut No.125), must have been of a purely Asiatic form of art, and very unlike
anything found subsequent to this period in Greece.Fragment of Pillar in front of Tomb of Atreus at
Mycenæ.]To all appearance the dome was lined internally with plates of brass or
bronze, some nails of which metals are now found there; and the holes in
which the nails were inserted are still to be seen all over the place.A
second tomb or treasury of smaller dimensions was discovered by Dr.Another of these tombs, erected by Minyas at
Orchomenos, described by Pausanias as one of the wonders of Greece,[125]
seems from the remains still existing to have been at least 20 ft.wider
than this one, and proportionably larger in every respect.All these
were covered with earth, and some are probably still hidden which a
diligent search might reveal.Schliemann’s discoveries in
the Acropolis of Mycenæ and in the Troad prove that it is still possible
to discover an unrifled tomb even in Greece.As domes constructed on the horizontal principle, these three are the
largest of which we have any knowledge, though there does not appear to
be any reasonable limit to the extent to which such a form of building
might be carried.When backed by earth,[126] as these were, it is
evident, from the mode of construction, that they cannot be destroyed by
any equable pressure exerted from the exterior.The only danger to be feared is, what is technically called a rising of
the haunches; and to avoid this it might be necessary, where large domes
were attempted, to adopt a form more nearly conical than that used at
Mycenæ.This might be a less pleasing architectural feature, but it is
constructively a better one than the form of the radiating domes we
generally employ.It is certainly to be regretted that more of the decorative features of
this early style have not been discovered.They differ so entirely from
anything else in Greece, and are so purely Asiatic in form, that it
would be exceedingly interesting to be able to restore a complete
decoration of any sort.In all the parts hitherto brought to light, an
Ionic-like scroll is repeated in every part and over every detail,
rather rudely executed, but probably originally heightened by colour.Its counterparts are found in Assyria and at Persepolis, but nowhere
else in Greece.[127]

[Illustration: 126.(From Dodwell’s ‘Greece.’)]

The Pelasgic races soon learnt to adopt for their doorways the more
pleasing curvilinear form with which they were already familiar from
their interiors.126) from a
gateway at Thoricus, in Attica, serves to show its simplest and earliest
form; and the illustration (Woodcut No.129) from Assos, in Asia Minor,
of a far more modern date, shows the most complicated form it took in
ancient times.In this last instance it is merely a discharging arch,
and so little fitted for the purpose to which it is applied, that we can
only suppose that its adoption arose from a strong predilection for this
shape.Another illustration of Pelasgic masonry is found at Delos (Woodcut No.127), consisting of a roof formed by two arch stones, at a certain angle
to one another, similar to the plan adopted in Egypt, and is further
interesting as being associated with capitals of pillars formed of the
front part of bulls, as in Assyria, pointing again to the intimate
connection that existed between Greece and Asia at this early period of
the former’s history.(From Stuart’s ‘Athens.’)]

In all these instances it does not seem to have been so much want of
knowledge that led these early builders to adopt the horizontal in
preference to the radiating principle, as a conviction of its greater
durability, as well, perhaps, as a certain predilection for an ancient
mode.In the construction of their walls they adhered, as a mere matter of
taste, to forms which they must have known to be inferior to others.In
the example, for instance, of a wall in the Peloponnesus (woodcut No.128), we find the polygonal masonry of an earlier age actually placed
upon as perfect a specimen built in regular courses, or what is
technically called _ashlar_ work, as any to be found in Greece; and on
the other side of the gateway at Assos (Woodcut No.129) there exists a
semicircular arch, shown by the dotted lines, which is constructed
horizontally, and could only have been copied from a radiating arch.(From Blouet’s ‘Voyage en
Grèce.’)]

Their city walls are chiefly remarkable for the size of the blocks of
stone used and for the beauty with which their irregular joints and
courses are fitted into one another.Like most fortifications, they are
generally devoid of ornament, the only architectural features being the
openings.These are interesting, as showing the steps by which a
peculiar form of masonry was perfected, and which, in after ages, led to
important architectural results.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

One of the most primitive of these buildings is a nameless ruin existing
near Missolonghi (Woodcut No.In it the sides of the opening are
straight for the whole height, and, though making a very stable form of
opening, it is one to which it is extremely difficult to fit doors, or
to close by any known means.It was this difficulty that led to the next
expedient adopted of inserting a lintel at a certain height, and making
the jambs more perpendicular below, and more sloping above.This method
is already exemplified in the tomb of Atreus (Woodcut No.124), and in
the Gate of the Lions at Mycenæ (Woodcut No.131); but it is by no means
clear whether the pediments were always filled up with sculpture, as in
this instance, or left open.In the walls of a town they were probably
always closed, but left open in a chamber.In the gate at Mycenæ the two
lions stand against an altar[128] shaped like a pillar, of a form found
only in Lycia, in which the round ends of the timbers of the roof are
shown as if projecting into the frieze.These are slight remains, it must be confessed, from which to
reconstruct an art which had so much influence on the civilisation of
Greece; but they are sufficient for the archæologist, as the existence
of a few fossil fragments of the bones of an elephant or a tortoise
suffice to prove the pre-existence of those animals wherever they have
been found, and enable the palæontologist to reason upon them with
almost as much certainty as if he saw them in a menagerie.Nor is it
difficult to see why the remnants are so few.When Homer describes the
imaginary dwelling of Alcinous—which he meant to be typical of a perfect
palace in his day—he does not speak of its construction or solidity, nor
tell us how symmetrically it was arranged; but he is lavish of his
praise of its brazen walls, its golden doors with their silver posts and
lintels—just as the writers of the Books of Kings and Chronicles praise
the contemporary temple or palace of Solomon for similar metallic
splendour.The palace of Menelaus is described by the same author as full of brass
and gold, silver and ivory.It was resplendent as the sun and moon, and
appeared to the eye of Telemachus like the mansion of Jupiter himself.On the architecture of the early Greek palaces considerable light has
been thrown through the researches of the late Dr.Schliemann at Tiryns,
on his second visit in 1884, when he was accompanied by Dr.Dörpfield,
who measured and drew out the plan which is here reproduced (Woodcut No.The palace at Tiryns is assumed by Dr.Schliemann to have been
destroyed by fire in the 11th century B.C.It was built in the upper
citadel and faced the south.The citadel was entered through a propylæum
with outer and inner portico, both in antis.A second propylæum of
smaller dimensions on the south of the entrance court gave access to the
chief court of the palace; this court was surrounded by porticoes on
three sides, and on the fourth or south side, a vestibule consisting of
a portico-in-antis leading to an ante-chamber, and the megaron or men’s
hall.The ante-chamber was separated from the portico by three
folding-doors, hung on solid timber framing; a single door, probably
closed by a curtain only, led from the ante-chamber to the men’s hall,
measuring 48 ft.by 33 ft., the roof of which was supported on four
pillars or columns; a circle in the centre of these indicated probably
the hearth.There are various chambers on the west side, one of which,
the bath-room, measuring 13 ft.by 10 ft., had a floor consisting of a
gigantic block of limestone 2 ft.On
the east side of the men’s hall was a second court with vestibule or
south side leading to the women’s hall (thalamos), 24 ft.by 17 ft., and
various other rooms on the west side of it.To the south of the women’s
court was a third court which may be considered to be the court of
service, with a passage leading direct to the entrance propylon of the
citadel.The walls were built in rubble masonry and clay mortar (clay mixed with
straw or hay); the foundations were carried from 6 ft.The walls were protected externally; first by a layer of
clay of various thicknesses and then with a plaster of lime about half
an inch thick.The upper portions of the walls generally consisted of
sun-dried bricks, and in order to give greater strength to the walls,
beams laid on thin slabs of stone (to give a horizontal bed) were built
into the outer surface.Blocks of hard limestone or breccia were used
for all the steps and door cills.The exposed angles of the walls and
the responds or antæ[129] of the columns were built of stone in the
lower part and wood above (in Troy they were always in wood with a stone
base).Opinions differ as to the lighting of the halls; the smaller
chambers were probably lighted through the door, as in Pompeii; but the
men’s and women’s halls must either have received their light through
openings at the side under the roof, or by a raised lantern over the
hearth before referred to.No temples are mentioned by Homer, nor by any early writer; but the
funereal rites celebrated in honour of Patroclus, as described in the
XXIII.Book of the Iliad, and the mounds still existing on the Plains of
Troy, testify to the character of the people whose manners and customs
he was describing, and would alone be sufficient to convince us that,
except in their tombs, we should find little to commemorate their
previous existence.The subject is interesting, and deserves far more attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon it, and more space than can be devoted to it
here.Not only is this art the art of people who warred before Troy, but
our knowledge of it reveals to us a secret which otherwise might for
ever have remained a mystery.The religion of the Homeric poems is
essentially Anthropic and Ancestral—in other words, of Turanian origin,
with hardly a trace of Aryan feeling running through it.When we know
that the same was the case with the arts of those days, we feel that it
could not well be otherwise; but what most excites our wonder is the
power of the poet, whose song, describing the manners and feelings of an
extinct race, was so beautiful as to cause its adoption as a gospel by a
people of another race, tincturing their religion to the latest hour of
their existence.We have very little means of knowing how long this style of art lasted
in Greece.The treasury built by Myron king of Sicyon at Olympia about
650 B.C.seems to have been of this style, in so far as we can judge of
it by the description of Pausanias.[130] It consisted of two chambers,
one ornamented in the Doric, one in the Ionic style, not apparently with
pillars, but with that kind of decoration which appears at that period
to have been recognised as peculiar to each.But the entire decorations
seem to have been of brass, the weight of metal employed being recorded
in an inscription on the building.The earliest example of a Doric
temple that we know of—that of Corinth—would appear to belong to very
nearly the same age, so that the 7th century B.C.may probably be taken
as the period when the old Turanian form of Pelasgic art gave way before
the sterner and more perfect creations of a purer Hellenic design.Perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Hellenic history of
Greece commenced with the Olympiads (B.C.776), but before that kingdom
bloomed into perfection an older civilisation had passed away, leaving
little beyond a few tombs and works of public utility as records of its
prior existence.It left, however, an undying influence which can be
traced through every subsequent stage of Grecian history, which gave
form to that wonderful artistic development of art, the principal if not
the only cause of the unrivalled degree of perfection to which it
subsequently attained.B. Temple of Niké Apteros.E. Foundations of old Temple of Athena, sixth century B.C.
]The culminating period of the Pelasgic civilisation of Greece was at the
time of the war with Troy—the last great military event of that age, and
the one which seems to have closed the long and intimate connection of
the Greek Pelasgians with their cognate races in Asia.Sixty years later the irruption of the Thessalians, and twenty years
after that event the return of the Heracleidæ, closed, in a political
sense, that chapter in history, and gave rise to what may be styled the
Hellenic civilisation, which proved the great and true glory of Greece.Four centuries, however, elapsed, which may appropriately be called the
dark ages of Greece, before the new seed bore fruit, at least in so far
as art is concerned.These ages produced, it is true, the laws of
Lycurgus, a characteristic effort of a truly Aryan race, conferring as
they did on the people who made them that power of self-government, and
capacity for republican institutions, which gave them such stability at
home and so much power abroad, but which were as inimical to the softer
glories of the fine arts in Sparta as they have proved elsewhere.When, after this long night, architectural art reappeared, it was at
Corinth, under the Cypselidæ, a race of strongly-marked Asiatic
tendencies; but it had in the meantime undergone so great a
transformation as to well-nigh bewilder us.On its reappearance it was
no longer characterised by the elegant and ornate art of Mycenæ and the
cognate forms of Asiatic growth, but had assumed the rude, bold
proportions of Egyptian art, and with almost more than Egyptian
massiveness.DORIC TEMPLES IN GREECE.The age of the Doric temple at Corinth is not, it is true,
satisfactorily determined; but the balance of evidence would lead us to
believe that it belongs to the age of Cypselus, or about 650 B.C.The
pillars are less than four diameters in height, and the architrave—the
only part of the superstructure that now remains—is proportionately
heavy.It is, indeed, one of the most massive specimens of architecture
existing, more so than even the rock-cut prototype at Beni Hasan.As a
work of art, it fails from excess of strength, a fault common to most of
the efforts of a rude people, ignorant of the true resources of art, and
striving, by the expression of physical power alone, to attain its
objects.Next in age to this is the little temple at Ægina.[131] Its date, too,
is unknown, though, judging from the character of its sculpture, it
probably belongs to the middle of the sixth century before Christ.We know that Athens had a great temple on the Acropolis, contemporary
with these, and the frusta of its columns still remain, which, after its
destruction by the Persians, were built into the walls of the citadel.It is more than probable that all the principal cities of Greece had
temples commensurate with their dignity before the Persian War.Many of
these were destroyed during that struggle; but it also happened then, as
in France and England in the 12th and 13th centuries, that the old
temples were thought unworthy of the national greatness, and of that
feeling of exaltation arising from the successful result of the greatest
of their wars, so that almost all those which remained were pulled down
or rebuilt.The consequence is, that nearly all the great temples now
found in Greece were built in the forty or fifty years which succeeded
the defeat of the Persians at Salamis and Platæa.One of the oldest temples of this class is that best known as the
Theseion or Temple of Theseus at Athens, now recognised as the Temple of
Hephaistos mentioned in the “Attica” of Pausanias.By an analysis of the
architectural character of the Temple Dr.Dorpfield contends that it is
posterior to the Parthenon and not anterior, as is generally supposed.Of all the great temples, the best and most celebrated is the Parthenon,
the only octastyle Doric Temple in Greece, and in its own class
undoubtedly the most beautiful building in the world.It is true it has
neither the dimensions nor the wondrous expression of power and eternity
inherent in Egyptian temples, nor has it the variety and poetry of the
Gothic Cathedral; but for intellectual beauty, for perfection of
proportion, for beauty of detail, and for the exquisite perception of
the highest and most recondite principles of art ever applied to
architecture, it stands utterly and entirely alone and unrivalled—the
glory of Greece and a reproach to the rest of the world.Next in size and in beauty to this was the great hexastyle temple of
Jupiter at Olympia, finished two years later than the Parthenon.Its
dimensions were nearly the same, but having only six pillars in front
instead of eight, as in the Parthenon, the proportions were different,
this temple being 95 ft.by 230, the Parthenon 101 ft.The excavations at Olympia, undertaken at the cost of the German
Government in 1876, not only laid bare the site of the Temple of
Jupiter, of which the lower frusta of half the column, the lower
portions of the walls of cella and nearly the whole of the pavement was
found in situ; but led to the recovery of a great portion of the
sculptures which decorated the metopes and filled the pediments, so that
it is not only possible to restore the complete design of the temple
itself but to obtain a distinct idea of its sculptural decoration.The
foundations of other Doric temples were found; of the Temple of Hera,
which seems originally to have been a wooden structure, the wood being
gradually replaced by stone when from its decay it required
renewal.[132] This temple was coeval if not more ancient than that of
Zeus; the interior of the cella would seem to have been subdivided into
bays or niches inside, similar to those of the Temple at Bassæ; a third
hexastyle Doric temple, the Metroum, was also discovered, and many
buildings dating from the Roman occupation.To the same age belongs the exquisite little Temple of Apollo Epicurius
at Bassæ (47 ft.by 125), the Temple of Minerva at Sunium, the greater
temple at Rhamnus, the Propylæa at Athens, and indeed all that is
greatest and most beautiful in the architecture of Greece.The temple of
Ceres at Eleusis also was founded and designed at this period, but its
execution belongs to a later date.The temple at Assos, though not of any great size, is interesting on
account of its having had the outer face of the architrave sculptured in
relief, requiring therefore an architectural frame which was obtained by
leaving a raised fillet along the bottom.The temple was
hexastyle-peristyle with pronaos but no posticum.The date is assumed to
be about 470 B.C., or shortly after the battle of Mycale.[133]


                        DORIC TEMPLES IN SICILY.Owing probably to some local peculiarity, which we have not now the
means of explaining, the Dorian colonies of Sicily and Magna Græcia seem
to have possessed, in the days of their prosperity, a greater number of
temples, and certainly retain the traces of many more, than were or are
to be found in any of the great cities of the mother country.The one
city of Selinus alone possesses six, in two groups,—three in the citadel
and three in the city.Of these the oldest is the central one of the
first-named group.Angell
and Harris, indicate an age only slightly subsequent to the foundation
of the colony, B.C.636, and therefore probably nearly contemporary with
the example above mentioned at Corinth.The most modern is the great
octastyle temple, which seems to have been left unfinished at the time
of the destruction of the city by the Carthaginians, B.C.by 166, and was consequently very much larger than any
temple of its class in Greece.The remaining four range between these
dates, and therefore form a tolerably perfect chronometric series at
that time when the arts of Greece itself fail us.The inferiority,
however, of provincial art, as compared with that of Greece itself,
prevents us from applying such a test with too much confidence to the
real history of the art, though it is undoubtedly valuable as a
secondary illustration.At Agrigentum there are three Doric temples, two small hexastyles, whose
age may be about 500 to 480 B.C., and one great exceptional example,
differing in its arrangements from all the Grecian temples of the age.long by 173 broad, and consequently very
nearly the same as those of the great Temple of Selinus just alluded to.Its date is perfectly known, as it was commenced by Theron, B.C.480,
and left unfinished seventy-five years afterwards, when the city was
destroyed by the Carthaginians.At Syracuse there still exist the ruins of a very beautiful temple of
this age; and at Segesta are remains of another in a much more perfect
state.Pæstum, in Magna Græcia, boasts of the most magnificent group of temples
after that at Agrigentum.One is a very beautiful hexastyle, belonging
probably to the middle of the fifth century B.C., built in a bold and
very pure style of Doric architecture, and still retains the greater
part of its internal columnar arrangement.The other two are more modern, and are far less pure both in plan and in
detail, one having nine columns at each end, the central pillars of
which are meant to correspond with an internal range of pillars,
supporting the ridge of the roof.The other, though of a regular form,
is so modified by local peculiarities, so corrupt, in fact, as hardly to
deserve being ranked with the beautiful order which it most resembles.We have even fewer materials for the history of the Ionic order in
Greece than we have for that of the Doric.The recent discoveries in
Assyria have proved beyond a doubt that the Ionic was even more
essentially an introduction from Asia[134] than the Doric was from
Egypt: the only question is, when it was brought into Greece.My own
impression is, that it existed there in one form or another from the
earliest ages, but owing to its slenderer proportions, and the greater
quantity of wood used in its construction, the examples may have
perished, so that nothing is now known to exist which can lay claim to
even so great an antiquity as the Persian War.The oldest example, probably, was the temple on the Ilissus, now
destroyed, dating from about 484 B.C.; next to this is the little gem of
a temple dedicated to Niké Apteros, or the Wingless Victory, built about
fifteen years later, in front of the Propylæa at Athens.The last and
most perfect of all the examples of this order is the Erechtheium, on
the Acropolis; its date is apparently about 420 B.C., the great epoch of
Athenian art.Nowhere did the exquisite taste and skill of the Athenians
show themselves to greater advantage than here; for though every detail
of the order may be traced back to Nineveh or Persepolis, all are so
purified, so imbued with purely Grecian taste and feeling, that they
have become essential parts of a far more beautiful order than ever
existed in the land in which they had their origin.The largest, and perhaps the finest, of Grecian Ionic temples was that
built about a century afterwards at Tegea, in Arcadia—a regular
peripteral temple of considerable dimensions, but the existence of which
is now known only from the description of Pausanias.[135]

As in the case, however, of the Doric order, it is not in Greece itself
that we find either the greatest number of Ionic temples or those most
remarkable for size, but in the colonies in Asia Minor, and more
especially in Ionia, whence the order most properly takes its name.That an Ionic order existed in Asia Minor before the Persian War is
quite certain, but all examples perished in that memorable struggle; and
when it subsequently reappeared, the order had lost much of its purely
Asiatic character, and assumed certain forms and tendencies borrowed
from the simpler and purer Doric style.If any temple in the Asiatic Greek colonies escaped destruction in the
Persian wars, it was that of Juno at Samos.It is said to have been
built by Polycrates, and appears to have been of the Doric order.The
ruins now found there are of the Ionic order, 346 ft.by 190 ft., and
must have succeeded the first mentioned.The apparent archaisms in the
form of the bases, &c., which have misled antiquarians, are merely
Eastern forms retained in spite of Grecian influence.More remarkable even than this was the celebrated Temple of Diana at
Ephesus, said by Pliny to have been 425 ft.Recent
excavations on the site, however, carried out by Mr.T. Wood, prove that
these dimensions apply only to the platform on which it stood.The
temple itself, measured from the outside of the angle pillars, was only
348 ft.by 164, making the area 57,072 ft., or about the average
dimensions of our mediæval cathedrals.Besides these, there was a splendid decastyle temple, dedicated to
Apollo Didymæus, at Miletus, 156 ft.in length; an
octastyle at Sardis, 261 ft.; an exquisitely beautiful,
though small hexastyle, at Priene, 122 ft.; and another at
Teos, and smaller examples elsewhere, besides many others which have no
doubt perished.German explorations in Pergamon have brought to light the remains of the
Augustæum, a building consisting of two detached wings with columns of
the Ionic order resting on a lofty podium enriched with sculpture and
connected one with the other by a magnificent flight of steps, the whole
block measuring 125 ft.[136]


                          CORINTHIAN TEMPLES.The Corinthian order is as essentially borrowed from the bell-shaped
capitals of Egypt as the Doric is from their oldest pillars.Like
everything they touched, the Greeks soon rendered it their own by the
freedom and elegance with which they treated it.The acanthus-leaf with
which they adorned it is essentially Grecian, and we must suppose that
it had been used by them as an ornament, either in their metal or wood
work, long before they adopted it in stone as an architectural feature.As in everything else, however, the Greeks could not help betraying in
this also the Asiatic origin of their art, and the Egyptian order with
them was soon wedded to the Ionic, whose volutes became an essential
though subdued part of this order.It is in fact a composite order, made
up of the bell-shaped capitals of the Egyptians and the spiral of the
Assyrians, and adopted by the Greeks at a time when national
distinctions were rapidly disappearing, and when true and severer art
was giving place to love of variety.At that time also mere ornament and
carving were supplanting the purer class of forms and the higher
aspirations of sculpture with which the Greeks ornamented their temples
in their best days.In Greece the order does not appear to have been introduced, or at least
generally used, before the age of Alexander the Great; the oldest
authentic example, and also one of the most beautiful, being the
Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (B.C.335), which, notwithstanding the
smallness of its dimensions, is one of the most beautiful works of art
of the merely ornamental class to be found in any part of the world.A
simpler example, but by no means so beautiful, is that of the porticoes
of the small octagonal building commonly called the Tower of the Winds
at Athens.The largest example in Greece of the Corinthian order is the
Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.This, however, may almost be
called a Roman building, though on Grecian soil—having been commenced in
its present form under Antiochus Epiphanes, in the second century B.C.by the Roman architect Cossutius, and only finished by Hadrian, to whom
probably we may ascribe the greatest part of what now remains.by 354 ft., and from the number of its columns,
their size and their beauty, it must have been when complete the most
beautiful Corinthian temple of the ancient world.Judging, however, from some fragments found among the Ionic temples of
Asia Minor, it appears that the Corinthian order was introduced there
before we find any trace of it in Greece Proper.Indeed, _à priori_, we
might expect that its introduction into Greece was part of that reaction
which the elegant and luxurious Asiatics exercised on the severer and
more manly inhabitants of European Greece, and which was in fact the
main cause of their subjection, first to the Macedonians, and finally
beneath the iron yoke of Rome.As used by the Asiatics, it seems to have
arisen from the introduction of the bell-shaped capital of the
Egyptians, to which they applied the acanthus-leaf, sometimes in
conjunction with the honeysuckle ornament of the time, as in Woodcut No.135, and on other and later occasions together with the volutes of the
same order, the latter combination being the one which ultimately
prevailed and became the typical form of the Corinthian capital.DIMENSIONS OF GREEK TEMPLES.Although differing so essentially in plan, the general dimensions of the
larger temples of the Greeks were very similar to those of the mediæval
cathedrals, and although they never reached the altitude of their modern
rivals, their cubic dimensions were probably in about the same ratio of
proportion.The following table gives the approximate dimensions, rejecting
fractions, of the eight largest and best known examples:—

   Juno, at Samos         346 feet long 190 feet wide = 65,740 feet.Jupiter, at Agrigentum 360 feet long 173 feet wide = 62,280 feet.Apollo, at Branchidæ   362 feet long 168 feet wide = 60,816 feet.Diana, at Ephesus      348 feet long 164 feet wide = 57,072 feet.Jupiter, at Athens     354 feet long 135 feet wide = 47,790 feet.Didymæus, at Miletus   295 feet long 156 feet wide = 45,020 feet.Cybele, at Sardis      261 feet long 144 feet wide = 37,884 feet.Parthenon, at Athens   228 feet long 101 feet wide = 23,028 feet.There may be some slight discrepancies in this table from the figures
quoted elsewhere, and incorrectness arising from some of the temples
being measured on the lowest step and others, as the Parthenon, on the
highest; but it is sufficient for comparison, which is all that is
attempted in its compilation.The Doric was the order which the Greeks especially loved and cultivated
so as to make it most exclusively their own; and, as used in the
Parthenon, it certainly is as complete and as perfect an architectural
feature as any style can boast of.When first introduced from Egypt, it,
as before stated, partook of even more than Egyptian solidity, but by
degrees became attenuated to the weak and lean form of the Roman order
of the same name.136, 137, 138 illustrate the three stages
of progress from the oldest example at Corinth to the order as used in
the time of Philip at Delos, the intermediate being the culminating
point in the age of Pericles: the first is 4·47 diameters in height, the
next 6·025, the last 7·015; and if the table were filled up with all the
other examples, the gradual attenuation of the shaft would very nearly
give the relative date of the example.This fact is in itself sufficient
to refute the idea of the pillar being copied from a wooden post, as in
that case it would have been slenderer at first, and would gradually
have departed from the wooden form as the style advanced.[137] This is
the case in all carpentry styles.With the Doric order the contrary
takes place.The earlier the example the more unlike it is to any wooden
original.As the masons advanced in skill and power over their stone
material, it came more and more to resemble posts or pillars of wood.The fact appears to be that, either in Egypt or in early Greece, the
pillar was originally a pier of brickwork, or of rubble masonry,
supporting a wooden roof, of which the architraves, the triglyphs, and
the various parts of the cornice, all bore traces down to the latest
period.Even as ordinarily represented, or as copied in this country, there is a
degree of solidity combined with elegance in this order, and an
exquisite proportion of the parts to one another and to the work they
have to perform, that command the admiration of every person of taste;
but, as used in Greece, its beauty was very much enhanced by a number of
refinements whose existence was not suspected till lately, and even now
cannot be detected but by the most practised eye.The columns were at first assumed to be bounded by straight lines.It is
now found that they have an _entasis_, or convex profile, in the
Parthenon to the extent of 1/550 of the whole height, and are outlined
by a very delicate hyperbolic curve; it is true this can hardly be
detected by the eye in ordinary positions, but the want of it gives that
rigidity and poverty to the column which is observable in modern
examples.[138]

In like manner, the architrave in all temples was carried upwards so as
to form a very flat arch, just sufficient to correct the optical
delusion arising from the interference of the sloping lines of the
pediment.This, I believe, was common to all temples, but in the
Parthenon the curve was applied to the sides also, though from what
motive it is not so easy to detect.Another refinement was making all the columns <DW72> slightly inwards, so
as to give an idea of strength and support to the whole.Add to this,
that all the curved lines used were either hyperbolas or parabolas.With
one exception only, no circular line was employed, nor even an ellipse.Every part of the temple was also arranged with the most unbounded care
and accuracy, and every detail of the masonry was carried out with a
precision and beauty of execution which is almost unrivalled, and it may
be added that the material of the whole was the purest and best white
marble.All these delicate adjustments, this exquisite finish and
attention to even the smallest details, are well bestowed on a design in
itself simple, beautiful, and appropriate.They combine to render this
order, as found in the best Greek temples, as nearly faultless as any
work of art can possibly be, and such as we may dwell upon with the most
unmixed and unvarying satisfaction.The system of definite proportion which the Greeks employed in the
design of their temples, was another cause of the effect they produce
even on uneducated minds.It was not with them merely that the height
was equal to the width, or the length about twice the breadth; but every
part was proportioned to all those parts with which it was related, in
some such ratio as 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, 4 to 9, or 5 to 10, &c. As
the scheme advances these numbers become undesirably high.In this case
they reverted to some such simple ratios as 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and
so on.We do not yet quite understand the process of reasoning by which the
Greeks arrived at the laws which guided their practice in this respect;
but they evidently attached the utmost importance to it, and when the
ratio was determined upon, they set it out with such accuracy, that even
now the calculated and the measured dimensions seldom vary beyond such
minute fractions as can only be expressed in hundredths of an inch.Though the existence of such a system of ratios has long been suspected,
it is only recently that any measurements of Greek temples have been
made with sufficient accuracy to enable the matter to be properly
investigated and their existence proved.[139]

The ratios are in some instances so recondite, and the correlation of
the parts at first sight so apparently remote, that many would be
inclined to believe they were more fanciful than real.[140] It would,
however, be as reasonable in a person with no ear, or no musical
education, to object to the enjoyment of a complicated concerted piece
of music experienced by those differently situated, or to declare that
the pain musicians feel from a false note was mere affectation.The eyes
of the Greeks were as perfectly educated as our ears.They could
appreciate harmonies which are lost in us, and were offended at false
quantities which our duller senses fail to perceive.But in spite of
ourselves, we do feel the beauty of these harmonic relations, though we
hardly know why; and if educated to them, we might acquire what might
almost be considered a new sense.But be this as it may, there can be no
doubt but that a great deal of the beauty which all feel in
contemplating the architectural productions of the Greeks, arises from
causes such as these, which we are only now beginning to appreciate.To understand, however, the Doric order, we must not regard it as a
merely masonic form.Sculpture was always used, or intended to be used,
with it.The Metopes between the triglyphs, the pediments of the
porticoes, and the acroteria or pedestals on the roof, are all unmeaning
and useless unless filled or surmounted with sculptured figures.Sculpture is, indeed, as essential a part of this order as the
acanthus-leaves and ornaments of the cornice are to the capitals and
entablature of the Corinthian order; and without it, or without its
place being supplied by painting, we are merely looking at the dead
skeleton, the mere framework of the order, without the flesh and blood
that gave it life and purpose.It is when all these parts are combined together, as in the portico of
the Parthenon (Woodcut No.139), that we can understand this order in
all its perfection; for though each part was beautiful in itself, their
full value can be appreciated only as parts of a great whole.Another essential part of the order, too often overlooked, is the
colour, which was as integral a part of it as its form.Till very
lately, it was denied that Greek temples were, or could be, painted: the
unmistakable remains of colour, however, that have been discovered in
almost all temples, and the greater knowledge of the value and use of it
which now prevails, have altered public opinion very much on the matter,
and most people now admit that some colour was used, though few are
agreed as to the extent to which it was carried.It cannot now be questioned that colour was used everywhere internally,
and on every object.Externally too it is generally admitted that the
sculpture was painted and relieved by strongly <DW52> backgrounds; the
lacunaria, or recesses of the roof, were also certainly painted; and all
the architectural mouldings, which at a later period were carved in
relief, have been found to retain traces of their painted ornaments.It is disputed whether the echinus or carved moulding of the capital was
so ornamented.There seems little doubt but that it was; and that the
walls of the cells were also  throughout and covered with
paintings illustrative of the legends and attributes of the divinity to
whom the temple was dedicated or of the purposes for which it was
erected.The plane face of the architrave was probably left white, or
merely ornamented with metal shields or inscriptions, and the shafts of
the columns appear also to have been left plain, or merely slightly
stained to tone down the crudeness of the white marble.Generally
speaking, all those parts which from their form or position were in any
degree protected from the rain or atmospheric influences seem to have
been ; those particularly exposed, to have been left plain.To
whatever extent, however, painting may have been carried, these 
ornaments were as essential a part of the Doric order as the carved
ornaments were of the Corinthian, and made it, when perfect, a richer
and more ornamental, as it was a more solid and stable, order than the
latter.The colour nowhere interfered with the beauty of its forms, but
gave it that richness and amount of ornamentation which is indispensable
in all except the most colossal buildings, and a most valuable adjunct
even to them.The Ionic order, as we now find it, is not without some decided
advantages over the Doric.It is more complete in itself and less
dependent on sculpture.Its frieze was too small for much display of
human life and action, and was probably usually ornamented with lines of
animals,[141] like the friezes at Persepolis.But the frieze of the
little temple of Nikè Apteros is brilliantly ornamented in the same
style as those of the Doric order.It also happened that those details
and ornaments which were only painted in the Doric, were carved in the
Ionic order, and remain therefore visible to the present day, which
gives to this order a completeness in our eyes which the other cannot
boast of.Add to this a certain degree of Asiatic elegance and grace,
and the whole when put together makes up a singularly pleasing
architectural object.But notwithstanding these advantages, the Doric
order will probably always be admitted to be superior, as belonging to a
higher class of art, and because all its forms and details are better
and more adapted to their purpose than those of the Ionic.Ionic order of Erechtheium at Athens.]The principal characteristic of the Ionic order is the Pelasgic or
Asiatic spiral, here called a volute, which, notwithstanding its
elegance, forms at best but an awkward capital.The Assyrian honeysuckle
below this, carved as it is with the exquisite feeling and taste which a
Greek alone knew how to impart to such an object, forms as elegant an
architectural detail as is anywhere to be found; and whether used as the
necking of a column, or on the crowning member of a cornice, or on other
parts of the order, is everywhere the most beautiful ornament connected
with it.Comparing this order with that at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96),
the only truly Asiatic prototype we have of it, we see how much the
Doric feeling of the Greeks had done to sober it down, by abbreviating
the capital and omitting the greater part of the base.This process was
carried much farther when the order was used in conjunction with the
Doric, as in the Propylæa, than when used by itself, as in the
Erechtheium; still in every case all the parts found in the Asiatic
style are found in the Greek.The same form and feelings pervade both;
and, except in beauty of execution and detail, it is not quite clear how
far even the Greek order is an improvement on the Eastern one.The
Persepolitan base is certainly the more beautiful of the two; so are
many parts of the capital.The perfection of the whole, however, depends
on the mode in which it is employed; and it is perfectly evident that
the Persian order could not be combined with the Doric, nor applied with
much propriety as an external order, which was the essential use of all
the Grecian forms of pillars.Ionic order in Temple of Apollo at Bassæ.]Section of half of the Ionic Capital at Bassæ, taken
through the volute.]When used between antæ or square piers, as seems usually to have been
the case in Assyria, the two-fronted form of the Ionic capital was
appropriate and elegant; but when it was employed, as in the
Erechtheium, as an angle column, it presented a difficulty which even
Grecian skill and ingenuity could not quite conquer.When the Persians
wanted the capital to face four ways they turned the side outwards, as
at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96), and put the volutes in the angles—which
was at best but an awkward mode of getting over the difficulty.The instance in which these difficulties have been most successfully met
is in the internal order at Bassæ.There the three sides are equal, and
are equally seen—the fourth is attached to the wall—and the junction of
the faces is formed with an elegance that has never been surpassed.It
has not the richness of the order of the Erechtheium, but it excels it
in elegance.Its widely spreading base still retains traces of the
wooden origin of the order, and carries us back towards the times when a
shoe was necessary to support wooden posts on the floor of an Assyrian
hall.Notwithstanding the amount of carving which the Ionic order displays,
there can be little doubt of its having been also ornamented with colour
to a considerable extent, but probably in a different manner from the
Doric.My own impression is, that the carved parts were gilt, or picked
out with gold, relieved by  grounds, varied according to the
situation in which they were found.The existing remains prove that
colours were used in juxtaposition, to relieve and heighten the
architectural effect of the carved ornaments of this order.In the Ionic temples at Athens the same exquisite masonry was used as in
the Doric; the same mathematical precision and care is bestowed on the
entasis of the columns, the drawing of the volutes, and the execution of
even the minutest details; and much of its beauty and effect are no
doubt owing to this circumstance, which we miss so painfully in nearly
all modern examples.As before mentioned, the Corinthian order was only introduced into
Greece on the decline of art, and never rose during the purely Grecian
age to the dignity of a temple order.It most probably, however, was
used in the more ornate specimens of domestic architecture, and in
smaller works of art, long before any of those examples of it were
executed which we now find in Greece.Order of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.]The most typical specimen we now know is that of the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates (Woodcut No.143), which, notwithstanding all its elegance
of detail and execution, can hardly be pronounced to be perfect, the
Egyptian and Asiatic features being only very indifferently united to
one another.The foliaged part is rich and full, but is not carried up
into the upper or Ionic portion, which is, in comparison, lean and poor;
and though separately the two parts are irreproachable, it was left to
the Romans so to blend the two together as to make a perfectly
satisfactory whole out of them.In this example, as now existing, the junction of the column with the
capital is left a plain sinking, and so it is generally copied in modern
times; but there can be little doubt that this was originally filled by
a bronze wreath, which was probably gilt.Accordingly this is so
represented in the woodcut as being essential to the completion of the
order.The base and shaft have, like the upper part of the capital, more
Ionic feeling in them than the order was afterwards allowed to retain;
and altogether it is, as here practised, far more elegant, though less
complete, than the Roman form which superseded it.Order of the Tower of the Winds, Athens.]The other Athenian example, that of the Tower of the winds (Woodcut No.144), is remarkable as being almost purely Egyptian in its types, with
no Ionic admixture.The columns have no bases, the capitals no volutes,
and the water-leaf clings as closely to the bell as it does in the
Egyptian examples.The result altogether wants richness, and, though
appropriate on so small a scale, would hardly be pleasing on a larger.The great example of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius differs in no
essential part from the Roman order, except that the corners of the
abacus are not cut off; and that, being executed in Athens, there is a
degree of taste and art displayed in its execution which we do not find
in any Roman examples.Strictly speaking, however, it belongs to that
school, and should be enumerated as a Roman, and not as a Grecian,
example.Caryatide Figure in the British Museum.]It has been already explained that the Egyptians never used caryatide
figures, properly so called, to support the entablatures of their
architecture, their figures being always attached to the front of the
columns or piers, which were the real bearing mass.At Persepolis, and
elsewhere in the East, we find figures everywhere employed supporting
the throne or the platform of the palaces of the kings; not, indeed, on
their heads, as the Greeks used them, but rather in their uplifted
hands.The name, however, as well as their being only used in conjunction with
the Ionic order and with Ionic details, all point to an Asiatic origin
for this very questionable form of art.As employed in the little
Portico attached to the Erechtheium, these figures are used with so much
taste, and all the ornaments are so elegant, that it is difficult to
criticise or find fault; but it is nevertheless certain that it was a
mistake which even the art of the Greeks could hardly conceal.To use
human figures to support a cornice is unpardonable, unless it is done as
a mere secondary adjunct to a building.In the Erechtheium it is a
little too prominent for this, though used with as much discretion as
was perhaps possible under the circumstances.Another example of the
sort is shown in Woodcut No.146, which, by employing a taller cap,
avoids some of the objections to the other; but the figure itself, on
the other hand, is less architectural, and so errs on the other side.Caryatide Figure from the Erechtheium.]Another form of this class of support is that of the Giants or
_Telamones_, instances of which are found supporting the roof of the
great Temple at Agrigentum, and in the baths of the semi-Greek city of
Pompeii.As they do not actually bear the entablature, but only seem to
relieve the masonry behind them, their employment is less objectionable
than that of the female figures above described; but even they hardly
fulfil the conditions of true art, and their place might be better
filled by some more strictly architectural feature.The arrangements of Grecian Doric temples show almost less variety than
the forms of the pillars, and no materials exist for tracing their
gradual development in an historical point of view.The temples at
Corinth, and the oldest at Selinus, are both perfect examples of the
hexastyle arrangement to which the Greeks adhered in all ages; and
though there can be little doubt that the peripteral form, as well as
the order itself, was borrowed from Egypt, it still was so much modified
before it appeared in Greece, that it would be interesting, if it could
be done, to trace the several steps by which the change was effected.In an architectural point of view this is by no means difficult.The
simplest Greek temples were mere cells, or small square apartments
suited to contain an image—the front being what is technically called
_distyle in antis_, or with two pillars between _antæ_, or square
pilaster like piers terminating the side walls.Hence the interior
enclosure of Grecian temples is called the cell or cella, however large
and splendid it may be.The next change was to separate the interior into a cell and porch by a
wall with a large doorway in it, as in the small temple at Rhamnus
(Woodcut No.148), where the opening however can scarcely be called a
doorway, as it extends to the roof.A third change was to put a porch of
4 pillars in front of the last arrangement, or, as appears to have been
more usual, to bring forward the screen to the positions of the pillars
as in the last example, and to place the 4 pillars in front of this.None of these plans admitted of a peristyle, or pillars on the flanks.To obtain this it was necessary to increase the number of pillars of the
portico to 6, or, as it is termed, to make it hexastyle, the 2 outer
pillars being the first of a range of 13 or 15 columns, extended along
each side of the temple.The cell in this arrangement was a complete
temple in itself—distyle in antis, most frequently made so at both ends,
and the whole enclosed in its envelope of columns, as in Woodcut No.Sometimes the cell was tetrastyle or with four pillars in front.(From Hittorff,
‘Arch.Antique en Sicile.’) Scale 100 ft.In this form the Greek temple may be said to be complete, very few
exceptions occurring to the rule, though the Parthenon itself is one of
these few.It has an inner hexastyle portico at each end of the cell;
beyond these outwardly are octastyle porticoes, with 17 columns on each
flank.The great Temple at Selinus is also octastyle, but it is neither so
simple nor so beautiful in its arrangement; and, from the decline of
style in the art when it was built, is altogether an inferior example;
still, as one of the largest of Greek Doric temples, its plan is worthy
of being quoted as an illustration of the varying forms of these
temples.Another great exception is the great temple at Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.152 and 154), where the architect attempted an order on so gigantic a
scale that he was unable to construct the pillars with their architraves
standing free.The interstices of the columns are therefore built up
with walls pierced with windows, and altogether the architecture is so
bad, that even its colossal dimensions must have failed to render it at
any time a pleasing or satisfactory work of art.A fourth exception is the double temple at Pæstum, with 9 pillars in
front, a clumsy expedient, but which arose from its having a range of
columns down the centre to support the ridge of the roof by a simpler
mode than the triangular truss usually employed for carrying the roof
between two ranges of column.Plan of Great Temple at Agrigentum.With the exception of the temple at Agrigentum, all these were
peristylar, or had ranges of columns all around them, enclosing the cell
as it were in a case, an arrangement so apparently devoid of purpose,
that it is not at first sight easy to account for its universality.It
will not suffice to say that it was adopted merely because it was
beautiful, for the forms of Egyptian temples, which had no pillars
externally, were as perfect, and in the hands of the Greeks would have
become as beautiful, as the one they adopted.Besides, it is natural to
suppose they would rather have copied the larger than the smaller
temples, if no motive existed for their preference of the latter.The
peristyle, too, was ill suited for an ambulatory, or place for
processions to circulate round the temple; it was too narrow for this,
and too high to protect the procession from the rain.Indeed, I know of
no suggestion except that it may have been adopted to protect the
paintings on the walls of the cells from the inclemency of the weather.It hardly admits of a doubt that the walls were painted, and that
without protection of some sort this would very soon have been
obliterated.It seems also very evident that the peristyle was not only
practically, but artistically, most admirably adapted for this purpose.The paintings of the Greeks were, like those of the Egyptians, composed
of numerous detached groups, connected only by the story, and it almost
required the intervention of pillars, or some means of dividing into
compartments the surface to be so painted, to separate these groups from
one another, and to prevent the whole sequence from being seen at once;
while, on the other hand, nothing can have been more beautiful than the
white marble columns relieved against a richly  plane surface.The one appears so necessary to the other, that it seems hardly to be
doubted that this was the cause, or that the effect must have been most
surpassingly beautiful.MODE OF LIGHTING TEMPLES.The arrangement of the interior of Grecian temples necessarily depended
on the mode in which they were lighted.No one will, I believe, now
contend, as was once done, that it was by lamplight alone that the
beauty of their interiors could be seen; and as light certainly was not
introduced through the side walls, nor could be in sufficient quantities
through the doorways, it is only from the roof that it could be
admitted.At the same time it could not have been by a large horizontal
opening in the roof, as has been supposed, as that would have admitted
the rain and snow as well as the light; and the only alternative seems
to be one I suggested some years ago—of a clerestory,[142] similar
internally to that found in all the great Egyptian temples,[143] but
externally requiring such a change of arrangement as was necessary to
adapt it to a sloping instead of a flat roof.This could have been
effected by countersinking it into the roof, so as to make it in fact 3
ridges in those parts where the light was admitted, though the regular
<DW72> of the roof was retained between these openings, so that neither
the ridge nor the continuity of the lines of the roof was interfered
with.This would effect all that was required, and in the most beautiful
manner; it moreover agrees with all the remains of Greek temples that
now exist, as well as with all the descriptions that have been handed
down to us from antiquity.to 1 in]

[Illustration: 154.Part Section, part Elevation, of Great Temple at
Agrigentum.This arrangement will be understood from the section of the Parthenon
(Woodcut No.153), restored in accordance with the above explanation,
which agrees perfectly with all that remains on the spot, as well as
with all the accounts we have of that celebrated temple.The same system
applies even more easily to the great hexastyle at Pæstum and to the
beautiful little Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, in Phigaleia (Woodcut No.149), and in fact to all regular Greek temples.Indeed, it seems
impossible to account for the peculiarities of that temple except on
some such theory as this.Any one who studies the plan (Woodcut No.149)
will see at once what pains were taken to bring the internal columns
exactly into the spaces between those of the external peristyle.The
effect inside is clumsy, and never would have been attempted were it not
that practically their position was seen from the outside, and this
could hardly have been so on any other hypothesis than that now
proposed.An equally important point in the examination of this theory
is that it applies equally to the exceptional ones.The side aisles, for
instance, of the great temple at Agrigentum were, as before mentioned,
lighted by side windows; the central one could only be lighted from the
roof, and it is easy to see how this could be effected by introducing
openings between the telamones, as shown in Woodcut No.In the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius (Woodcut No.196), as described
by Vitruvius,[144] the nave had two storeys of columns all round, and
the middle was open to the sky.Dorpfield that the temple in Vitruvius’s time was incomplete, and that
subsequently when Hadrian erected the great chryselephantine statue in
it the nave may have lost its hypæthral source of light.(In that case
its light may have been introduced through the court or hypæthron in
front of the cell, such as is shown on the plan in Woodcut No.The Ionic temples of Asia are all too much ruined to enable us to say
exactly in what manner, and to what extent, this mode of lighting was
applied to them, though there seems no doubt that the method there
adopted was very similar in all its main features.Elevation of West End of Erechtheium.The little Temple of Nikè Apteros and the temple on the Ilissus, were
both too small to require any complicated arrangement of the sort, but
the Ionic temple of Pandrosus was lighted by windows which still remain
at the west end, so that it is possible the same expedient may have been
adopted to at least some extent in the Asiatic examples.The latter,
however, is, with one exception, the sole instance of windows in any
European-Greek temple, the only other example being in the very
exceptional temple at Agrigentum.It is valuable, besides, as showing
how little the Greeks were bound by rules or by any fancied laws of
symmetry.As is shown in the plan, elevation, and view (Woodcuts Nos.155, 156,
157), the Erechtheium consisted, properly speaking, of 3 temples grouped
together; and it is astonishing what pains the architect took to prevent
their being mistaken for one.The porticoes of two of them are on
different levels, and the third or caryatide porch is of a different
height and different style.Every one of these features is perfectly
symmetrical in itself, and the group is beautifully balanced and
arranged; and yet no Gothic architect in his wildest moments could have
conceived anything more picturesquely irregular than the whole becomes.Indeed, there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that Greek
architecture was fettered by any fixed laws of formal symmetry: each
detail, every feature, every object, such as a hall or temple, which
could be considered as one complete and separate whole, was perfectly
symmetrical and regular; but no two buildings—no two apartments—if for
different purposes, were made to look like one.On the contrary, it is
quite curious to observe what pains they took to arrange their buildings
so as to produce variety and contrast, instead of formality or
singleness of effect.Temples, when near one another, were never placed
parallel, nor were even their propylæa and adjuncts ever so arranged as
to be seen together or in one line.The Egyptians, as before remarked,
had the same feeling, but carried it into even the details of the same
building, which the Greeks did not.In this, indeed, as in almost every
other artistic mode of expression, they seem to have hit exactly the
happy medium, so as to produce the greatest harmony with the greatest
variety, and to satisfy the minutest scrutiny and the most refined
taste, while their buildings produced an immediate and striking effect
on even the most careless and casual beholders.Owing to the Erechtheium having been converted into a Byzantine church
during the Middle Ages, almost all traces of its original internal
arrangements have been obliterated, and this, with the peculiar
combination of three temples in one, makes it more than usually
difficult to restore.The annexed plan, however, meets all the
requirements of the case in so far as they are known.To the east was a
portico of 6 columns, between two of which stood an altar to Dione,
mentioned in the inscription enumerating the repairs in 409 B.C.;[145]
inside, according to Pausanias,[146] were three altars, the principal
dedicated to Poseidon, the others to Butes and Hephaistos.From its
form, it is evident the roof must have been supported by pillars, and
they probably also bore a clerestory, by which, I believe, with rare
exceptions, all Greek temples were lighted.Restored Plan of Erechtheium.The dark parts remain; the shaded are restorations.
]The Temple of Pandrosus was on a lower level, and was approached by a
flight of steps, corresponding with which was a chamber, containing the
well of salt water, and which apparently was the abode of the
serpent-god Erechthonios, mentioned by Herodotus.[147] The central cell
was lighted by the very exceptional expedient of 3 windows in the
western wall, which looked directly into it.Beyond this, on the south,
was the beautiful caryatide porch, where, if anywhere within the temple,
grew the olive sacred to Minerva.Unfortunately, our principal guide,
Pausanias, does not give us a hint where the olive-tree grew, and on the
whole I am inclined to believe it was in the enclosure outside the
western wall of the temple,[148] and to which a doorway leads directly
from the Temple of Pandrosus, as well as one under the north portico,
the use of which it is impossible to explain unless we assume that this
enclosure was really of exceptional importance.TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.A history of Grecian architecture can hardly be considered as complete
without some mention of the great Ephesian temple, which was one of the
largest and most gorgeous of all those erected by the Greeks, and
considered by them as one of the seven wonders of the world.Strange to
say, till very recently even its situation was utterly unknown; and even
now that it has been revealed to us by the energy and intelligence of
Mr.Wood, scarcely enough remains to enable him to restore the plan with
anything like certainty.This is the more remarkable, as it was found
buried under 17 to 20 feet of mud, which must have been the accumulation
of centuries, and might, one would have thought, have preserved
considerable portions of it from the hand of the spoiler.Plan of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, embodying
Mr.Wood’s researches embodies all the
information he has been able to obtain.The dimensions of the double
peristyle, and the number and position of its 96 columns, are quite
certain.So are the positions of the north, south, and west walls of the
cella; so that the only points of uncertainty are the positions of the
four columns necessary to make up the 100 mentioned by Pliny,[149] and
the internal arrangement of the cella itself and of the opisthodomus.With regard to the first there seems very little latitude for choice.The position of the other two must
be determined either by bringing forward the wall enclosing the stairs,
so as to admit of the intercolumniation east and west being the same as
that of the other columns, or of spacing them so as to divide the inner
roof of the pronaos into equal squares.I have preferred the latter as
that which appears to me the most probable.[150]

The west wall of the cella and the position of the statue having been
found, the arrangement of the pillars surrounding this apartment does
not admit of much latitude.Fragments of these pillars were found, but
not _in situ_, showing that they were in two heights and supported a
gallery.I have spaced them intermediately between the external pillars,
as in the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ (Woodcut No.149), because I do not
know of any other mode by which this temple could be lighted, except by
an opaion, as suggested for that temple; and if this is so they must
have been so spaced.Carrying out this system it leaves an opisthodomus
which is an exact square, which is so likely a form for that apartment
that it affords considerable confirmation to the correctness of this
restoration that it should be so.The four pillars it probably contained
are so spaced as to divide it into nine equal squares.Restored in this manner the temple appears considerably less in
dimensions than might have been supposed from Pliny’s text.His
measurements apply only to the lower step of the platform, which is
found to be 421 ft.But the temple itself, from angle to angle
of the peristyles, is only 342 ft.Assuming this restoration to be correct there can be very little doubt
as to the position of the thirty-six columnæ cælatæ, of which several
specimens have been recovered by Mr.Wood, and are now in the British
Museum.They must have been the sixteen at either end and the four in
the pronaos, shown darker in the woodcut.From the temple standing on a platform so much larger than appears
necessary, it is probable that pedestals with statues stood in front of
each column, and if this were so, the sculptures, with the columnæ
cælatæ and the noble architecture of the temple itself, must have made
up a combination of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic art such as hardly
existed anywhere else, and which consequently the ancients were quite
justified in considering as one of the wonders of the world.MUNICIPAL ARCHITECTURE.Very little now remains of all the various classes of municipal and
domestic buildings which must once have covered the land of Greece, and
from what we know of the exquisite feelings for art that pervaded that
people, they were certainly not less beautiful, though more ephemeral,
than the sacred buildings whose ruins still remain to us.There are, however, two buildings in Athens which, though small, give us
most exalted ideas of their taste in such matters.The first, already
alluded to, usually known as the Tower of the Winds, is a plain
octagonal building about 45 ft.in height by 24 in width, ornamented by
2 small porches of 2 pillars each, of the Corinthian order, the capitals
of which are represented in Woodcut No.Its roof, like the rest of
the building, is of white marble, and of simple but very elegant design,
and below this is a frieze of 8 large figures, symbolical of the 8
winds, from which the tower takes its name, they in fact being the
principal objects and ornaments of the building, the most important use
of which appears to have been to contain a clepsydra or water-clock.The other building, though smaller, is still more beautiful.It is known
as the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, and consists of a square base 12
ft.wide, on which stands a circular temple adorned by 6
Corinthian columns, which, with their entablature and the roof and
pedestal they support, make up 22 ft.more, so that the whole height of
the monument is only 34 ft.Notwithstanding these insignificant
dimensions, the beauty of its columns (Woodcut No.143) and of their
entablature—above all, the beauty of the roof and of the finial
ornament, which crowns the whole and is unrivalled for elegance even in
Greek art—make up a composition so perfect that nothing in any other
style or age can be said to surpass it.[151] If this is a fair index of
the art that was lavished on the smaller objects, the temples hardly
give a just idea of all that have perished.In extreme contrast with the buildings last described, which were among
the smallest, came the theatres, which were the largest, of the
monuments the Greeks seem ever to have attempted.The annexed plan of one at Dramyssus, the ancient Dodona, will give an
idea of their forms and arrangements.Its dimensions may be said to be
gigantic, being 443 ft.across; but even this, though perhaps the
largest in Greece, is far surpassed by many in Asia Minor.What remains
of it, however, is merely the auditorium, and consists only of ranges of
seats arranged in a semicircle, but without architectural ornament.In
all the examples in Europe, the proscenium,[152] which was the only part
architecturally ornamented, has perished, so that, till we can restore
this with something like certainty, the theatres hardly come within the
class of Architecture as a fine art.The theatre of Dionysus at Athens, which was excavated and laid bare in
1862-63, measures only 165 ft.Built on the south
side of the Acropolis, the natural <DW72> forming the rising ground was
utilised for the foundations of the tiers of seats which, in some cases,
and particularly at the back, were hewn in the rock; so that they were
carried back 294 ft.In the theatre of
Epidaurus, which, according to Pausanias, was the most beautiful theatre
in the world, the lines of the seats are continued on each side of the
orchestra so as to form a horse-shoe on plan; the foundations of the
stage, the projecting side wings with staircases on each side, and other
buildings belonging to the stage are still preserved.In Asia Minor some of the theatres have their proscenia adorned with
niches and columns, and friezes of great richness; but all these belong
to the Roman period, and, though probably copies of the mode in which
the Greeks ornamented theirs, are so corrupt in style as to prevent
their being used with safety in attempting to restore the earlier
examples.Many circumstances would indeed induce us to believe that the proscenia
of the earlier theatres may have been of wood or bronze, or both
combined, and heightened by painting and carving to a great degree of
richness.This, though appropriate and consonant with the origin and
history of the drama, would be fatal to the expectation of anything
being found to illustrate its earliest forms.Like the other Aryan races, the Greeks never were tomb-builders, and
nothing of any importance of this class is found in Greece, except the
tombs of the early Pelasgic races, which were either tumuli, or
treasuries, as they are popularly called.There are, it is true, some
headstones and small pillars of great beauty, but they are monolithic,
and belong rather to the department of Sculpture than of Architecture.In Asia Minor there are some important tombs, some built and others cut
in the rock.Some of the latter have been described before in speaking
of the tombs of the Lycians.The built examples which remain almost all
belong to the Roman period, though the typical and by far the most
splendid example of Greek tombs was that erected by Artemisia to the
memory of her husband Mausolus at Halicarnassus.We scarcely know enough
of the ethnic relations of the Carians to be able to understand what
induced them to adopt so exceptional a mode of doing honour to their
dead.With pure Greeks it must have been impossible, but the inhabitants
of these coasts were of a different race, and had a different mode of
expressing their feelings.View of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, as restored
by the Author.]Till Sir Charles Newton’s visit to Halicarnassus in 1856 the very site
of this seventh wonder of the world was a matter of dispute.We now know
enough to be able to restore the principal parts with absolute
certainty, and to ascertain its dimensions and general appearance within
very insignificant limits of error.[153]

The dimensions quoted by Pliny[154] are evidently extracted from a
larger work, said to have been written by the architect who erected it,
and which existed at his time.Every one of them has been confirmed in
the most satisfactory manner by recent discoveries, and enable us to put
the whole together without much hesitation.Plan of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, from a
Drawing by the Author.Sufficient remains of the quadriga, which crowned the monument, have
been brought home to give its dimensions absolutely.All the parts of
the Ionic order are complete.The steps of the pyramid have been found
and portions of the three friezes, and these, with Pliny’s dimensions
and description, are all that are required to assure us that its aspect
must have been very similar to the form represented in Woodcut No.There can be little doubt with regard to the upper storey, but in order
to work out to the dimensions given by Pliny (411 ft.in circumference)
and those found cut out in the rock (462 ft.), the lower storey must be
spread out beyond the upper to that extent, and most probably something
after the manner shown in the woodcut.The building consisted internally of two chambers superimposed the one
on the other, each 52 ft.by 42 ft.—the lower one being the
vestibule to the tomb beyond—the upper was surrounded by a peristyle of
36 columns.Externally the height was divided into three equal portions
of 37 ft.each (25 cubits), one of which was allotted to the
base—one to the pyramid with its meta—and one to the order between them.These with 14 ft., the height of the quadriga, and the same dimension
belonging to the lower entablature, made up the height of 140 Greek
feet[155] given it by Pliny.Though its height was unusually great for a Greek building, its other
dimensions were small.The admiration
therefore which the Greeks expressed regarding it must have arisen,
first, from the unusual nature of its design and of the purpose to which
it was applied, or perhaps more still from the extent and richness of
its sculptured decorations, of the beauty of which we are now enabled to
judge, and can fully share with them in admiring.Another, but very much smaller, tomb of about the same age was found by
Mr.Newton at Cnidus, and known as the Lion Tomb, from the figure of
that animal, now in the British Museum, which crowned its summit.Like
many other tombs found in Asia and in Africa, it follows the type of the
Mausoleum in its more important features.It possesses a base—a
peristyle—a pyramid of steps—and, lastly, an acroterion or pedestal
meant to support a quadriga or statue, or some other crowning object,
which appropriately terminated the design upwards.Several examples erected during the Roman period will be illustrated
when speaking of the architecture of that people, all bearing the
impress of the influence the Mausoleum had on the tomb architecture of
that age; but unfortunately we cannot yet go backwards and point out the
type from which the design of the Mausoleum itself was elaborated.The
tombs of Babylon and Passargadæ are remote both geographically and
artistically, though not without certain essential resemblances.Perhaps
the missing links may some day reward the industry of some scientific
explorer.At Cyrene there is a large group of tombs of Grecian date and with
Grecian details, but all cut in the rock, and consequently differing
widely in their form from those just described.It is not clear whether
the circumstance of this city possessing such a necropolis arose from
its proximity to Egypt, and consequently from a mere desire to imitate
that people, or from some ethnic peculiarity.Most probably the latter,
though we know so little about them that it is difficult to speak with
precision on such a subject.[156]

These tombs are chiefly interesting from many of the details of the
architecture still retaining the colour with which they were originally
adorned.The triglyphs of the Doric order are still painted blue,[157]
as appears to have been the universal practice, and the pillars are
outlined by red lines.The metopes are darker, and are adorned with
painted groups of figures, the whole making up one of the most perfect
examples of Grecian  decoration which still remain.Rock-cut and structural Tombs at Cyrene.(From
Hamilton’s ‘Wanderings in North Africa.’)]

There is another tomb at the same place—this time structural—which is
interesting not so much for any architectural beauty it possesses as
from its belonging to an exceptional type.It consists now only of a
circular basement—the upper part is gone—and is erected over an
excavated rock-cut tomb.There seem to be several others of the same
class in the necropolis, and they are the only examples known except
those at Marathos, one of which is illustrated above (Woodcut No.As before hinted, the Syrian example does not appear to be very ancient,
but we want further information before speaking positively on this
subject.No one on the spot has attempted to fix with precision the age
of the Cyrenean examples; nor have they been drawn in such detail as is
requisite for others to ascertain the fact.They may be as late as the
time of the Romans, but can hardly be dated as prior to the age of
Alexander the Great.(From Hamilton’s ‘North Africa.’)]


                         DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.We have nothing left but imperfect verbal descriptions of the domestic,
and even of the palatial architecture of Greece, and, consequently, can
only judge imperfectly of its forms.Unfortunately, too, Pompeii, though
but half a Greek city, belongs to too late and too corrupt an age to
enable us to use it even as an illustration; but we may rest assured
that in this, as in everything else, the Greeks displayed the same
exquisite taste which pervades not only their monumental architecture,
but all their works in metal or clay, down to the meanest object, which
have been preserved to our times.It is probable that the forms of their houses were much more irregular
and picturesque than we are in the habit of supposing them to have been.They seem to have taken such pains in their temples—in the Erechtheium,
for instance, and at Eleusis—to make every part tell its own tale, that
anything like forced regularity must have been offensive to them, and
they would probably make every apartment exactly of the dimensions
required, and group them so that no one should under any circumstances
be confounded with another.This, however, with all the details of their domestic arts, must now
remain to us as mere speculation, and the architectural history of
Greece must be confined to her temples and monumental erections.These
suffice to explain the nature and forms of the art, and to assign to it
the rank of the purest and most intellectual of all the styles which
have yet been invented or practised in any part of the world.ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

The ethnographical history of art in Italy is in all its essential
features similar to that of Greece, though arriving at widely different
results from causes the influence of which it is easy to trace.Both are
examples of an Aryan development based on a Turanian civilisation which
it has superseded.In Greece—as already remarked—the traces of the
earlier people are indistinct and difficult to seize.In Italy their
features are drawn with a coarser hand, and extend down into a more
essentially historic age.It thus happens that we have no doubt as to
the existence of the Etruscan people—we know very nearly who they were,
and cannot be mistaken as to the amount and kind of influence they
exercised on the institutions and arts of the Romans.The more striking differences appear to have arisen from the fact, that
Greece had some four or five centuries of comparative repose during
which to form herself and her institutions after the Pelasgic
civilisation was struck down at the time of the Dorian occupation of the
Peloponnesus.During that period she was undisturbed by foreign
invasion, and was not tempted by successful conquests to forsake the
gentler social arts for the more vulgar objects of national ambition.Rome’s history, on the other hand, from the earliest aggregation of a
robber horde on the banks of the Tiber till she became the arbiter of
the destinies of the ancient world, is little beyond the record of
continuous wars.From the possession of the seven hills, Rome gradually
carried her sway at the edge of the sword to the dominion of the whole
of Italy and of all the then known world, destroying everything that
stood in the way of her ambition, and seeking only the acquisition of
wealth and power.Greece, in the midst of her successful cultivation of the arts of
commerce and of peace, stimulated by the wholesome rivalry of the
different States of which she was composed, was awakened by the Persian
invasion to a struggle for existence.The result was one of the most
brilliant passages in the world’s history, and no nation was ever more
justified in the jubilant outburst of enthusiastic patriotism that
followed the repulse of the invader, than was Greece in that with which
she commenced her short but brilliant career.A triumph so gained by a
people so constituted led to results at which we still wonder, though
they cause us no surprise.If Greece attained her manhood on the
battle-fields of Marathon and Salamis, Rome equally reached the maturity
of her career when she cruelly and criminally destroyed Corinth and
Carthage, and the sequel was such as might be expected from such a
difference of education.Rome had no time for the cultivation of the
arts of peace, and as little sympathy for their gentler influences.Conquest, wealth, and consequent power, were the objects of her
ambition—for these she sacrificed everything, and by their means she
attained a pinnacle of greatness that no nation had reached before or
has since.Her arts have all the impress of this greatness, and are
characterised by the same vulgar grandeur which marks everything she
did.Very different they are from the intellectual beauty found in the
works of the Greeks, but in some respects they are as interesting to
those who can read the character of nations in their artistic
productions.In the earlier part of her career Rome was an Etruscan city under
Etruscan kings and institutions.After she had emancipated herself from
their yoke, Etruria long remained her equal and her rival in political
power, and her instructress in religion and the arts of peace.This
continued so long, and the architectural remains of that people are so
numerous, and have been so thoroughly investigated, that we have no
difficulty in ascertaining the extent of influence the older nation had
on the nascent empire.It is more difficult to ascertain exactly who the
Etruscans themselves were, or whence they came.But on the whole there
seems every reason to believe they migrated from Asia Minor some twelve
or thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and fixed themselves in
Italy, most probably among the Umbrians, or some people of cognate race,
who had settled there before—so long before, perhaps, as to entitle them
to be considered among the aboriginal inhabitants.It would have been only natural that the expatriated Trojans should have
sought refuge among such a kindred people, though we have nothing but
the vaguest tradition to warrant a belief that this was the case.They
may too from time to time have received other accessions to their
strength; but they were a foreign people in a strange land, and scarcely
seem ever to have become naturalised in the country of their adoption.But what stood still more in their way was the fact that they were an
old Turanian people in presence of a young and ambitious community of
Aryan origin, and, as has always been the case when this has happened,
they were destined to disappear.Before doing so, however, they left
their impress on the institutions and the arts of their conquerors to
such an extent as to be still traceable in every form.It may have been
that there was as much Pelasgic blood in the veins of the Greeks as
there was Etruscan in those of the Romans; but the civilisation of the
former had passed away before Greece had developed herself.Etruria, on
the other hand, was long contemporary with Rome: in early times her
equal, and sometimes her mistress, and consequently in a position to
force her arts upon her to an extent that was never effected on the
opposite shore of the Adriatic.Nothing can prove more clearly the Turanian origin of the Etruscans than
the fact that all we know of them is derived from their tombs.These
exist in hundreds—it may almost be said in thousands—at the gates of
every city; but no vestige of a temple has come down to our days.Had
any Semitic blood flowed in their veins, as has been sometimes
suspected, they could not have been so essentially sepulchral as they
were, or so fond of contemplating death, as is proved by the fact that a
purely Semitic tomb is still a desideratum among antiquaries, not one
having as yet been discovered.What we should like to find in Etruria
would be a square pyramidal mound with external steps leading to a cella
on its summit; but no trace of any such has yet been detected.Their
other temples—using the word in the sense in which we usually understand
it—were, as might be expected, insignificant and ephemeral.So much so,
indeed, that except from one passage in Vitruvius,[158] and our being
able to detect the influence of the Etruscan style in the buildings of
Imperial Rome, we should hardly be aware of their existence.The truth
seems to be that the religion of the Etruscans, like that of most of
their congeners, was essentially ancestral, and their worship took the
form of respect for the remains of the dead and reverence for their
memory.Tombs consequently, and not temples, were the objects on which
they lavished their architectural resources.They certainly were not
idolaters, in the sense in which we usually understand the term.They
had no distinct or privileged priesthood, and consequently had no motive
for erecting temples which by their magnificence should be pleasing to
their gods or tend to the glorification of their kings or priests.Still
less were they required for congregational purposes by the people at
large.The only individual temple of Etruscan origin of which we have any
knowledge, is that of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome.[159] Originally small,
it was repaired and rebuilt till it became under the Empire a splendid
fane.But not one vestige of it now remains, nor any description from
which we could restore its appearance with anything like certainty.From the chapter of the work of Vitruvius just alluded to, we learn that
the Etruscans had two classes of temples: one circular, like their
structural tombs, and dedicated to one deity; the other class
rectangular, but these, always possessing three cells, were devoted to
the worship of three gods.Plan and Elevation of an Etruscan Temple.]The general arrangement of the plan, as described by Vitruvius, was that
shown on the plan above (Fig.1), and is generally assented to by all
those who have attempted the restoration.In larger temples in Roman
times the number of pillars in front may have been doubled, and they
would thus be arranged like those of the portico of the Pantheon, which
is essentially an Etruscan arrangement.The restoration of the elevation
is more difficult, and the argument too long to be entered upon
here;[160] but its construction and proportions seem to have been very
much like those drawn in the above diagram (Fig.Of course, as
wooden structures, they were richly and elaborately carved, and the
effect heightened by colours, but it is in vain to attempt to restore
them.Without a single example to guide us, and with very little
collateral evidence which can at all be depended upon, it is hardly
possible that any satisfactory restoration could now be made.Moreover,
their importance in the history of art is so insignificant, that the
labour such an attempt must involve would hardly be repaid by the
result.The original Etruscan circular temple seems to have been a mere circular
cell with a porch.The Romans surrounded it with a peristyle, which
probably did not exist in the original style.They magnified it
afterwards into the most characteristic and splendid of all their
temples, the Pantheon, whose portico is Etruscan in arrangement and
design, and whose cell still more distinctly belongs to that order; nor
can there be any doubt that the simpler Roman temples of circular form
are derived from Etruscan originals.[161] It would therefore be of great
importance if we could illustrate the later buildings from existing
remains of the older: but the fact is that such deductions as we may
draw from the copies are our only source of information respecting the
originals.We know little of any of the civil buildings with which the cities of
Etruria were adorned, beyond the knowledge obtained from the remains of
their theatres and amphitheatres.The form of the latter was essentially
Etruscan, and was adopted by the Romans, with whom it became their most
characteristic and grandest architectural object.Of the amphitheatres
of ancient Etruria only one now remains in so perfect a state as to
enable us to judge of their forms.It is that at Sutrium, which,
however, being entirely cut in the rock, neither affords information as
to the mode of construction nor enables us to determine its age.in its greatest length by 265 in breadth,
and it is consequently much nearer a circular form than the Romans
generally adopted: but in other respects the arrangements are such as
appear to have usually prevailed in after times.Besides these, we have numerous works of utility, but these belong more
strictly to engineering than to architectural science.The city walls of
the Etruscans surpass those of any other ancient nation in extent and
beauty of workmanship.Their drainage works and their bridges, as well
as those of the kindred Pelasgians in Greece, still remain monuments of
their industrial science and skill, which their successors never
surpassed.On the whole, perhaps we are justified in asserting that the Etruscans
were not an architectural people, and had no temples or palaces worthy
of attention.It at least seems certain that nothing of the sort is now
to be found, even in ruins, and were it not that the study of Etruscan
art is a necessary introduction to that of Roman, it would hardly be
worth while trying to gather together and illustrate the few fragments
and notices of it that remain.The tombs of the Etruscans now found may be divided into two
classes—first, those cut in the rock, and resembling dwelling-houses;
secondly, the circular tumuli, which latter are by far the most numerous
and important class.Each of these may be again subdivided into two kinds.The rock-cut tombs
include, firstly, those with only a façade on the face of the rock and a
sepulchral chamber within; secondly, those cut quite out of the rock and
standing free all round.To this class probably once belonged an immense
number of tombs built in the ordinary way; but all these have totally
disappeared, and consequently the class, as now under consideration,
consists entirely of excavated examples.The second class may be divided into those tumuli erected over chambers
cut in the tufaceous rock which is found all over Etruria, and those
which have chambers built above-ground.In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say which of
these classes is the older.We know that the Egyptians buried in caves
long before the Etruscans landed in Italy, and at the same time raised
pyramids over rock-cut and built chambers.We know too that Abraham was
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Syria.On the other hand, the tombs
at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113), the treasuries of Mycenæ (Woodcut No.124),
the sepulchre of Alyattes (Woodcut No.115), and many others, are proofs
of the antiquity of the tumuli, which are found all over Europe and
Asia, and appear to have existed from the earliest ages.The comparative antiquity of the different kinds of tombs being thus
doubtful, it will be sufficient for the purposes of the present work to
classify them architecturally.It may probably be assumed, with safety,
that all the modes which have been enumerated were practised by the
Etruscans at a period very slightly subsequent to their migration into
Italy.Of the first class of the rock-cut tombs—those with merely a façade
externally—the most remarkable group is that at Castel d’Asso.At this
place there is a perpendicular cliff with hundreds of these tombs ranged
along its face, like houses in a street.A similar arrangement is found
in Egypt at Benihasan, at Petra, and Cyrene, and around all the more
ancient cities of Asia Minor.In Etruria they generally consist of one chamber lighted by the doorway
only.Their internal arrangement appears to be an imitation of a
dwelling chamber, with furniture, like the apartment itself, cut out of
the rock.Externally they have little or no pretension to architectural
decoration.It is true that some tombs are found adorned with
frontispieces of a debased Doric or Ionic order; but these were executed
at a much later period and under Roman domination, and cannot therefore
be taken as specimens of Etruscan art, but rather of that corruption of
style sure to arise from a conquered people trying to imitate the arts
of their rulers.Tombs at Castel d’Asso.(From the ‘Annale del
Instituto.’)]

The general appearance of the second class of rock-cut tombs will be
understood from the woodcut (No.168), representing two monuments at
Castel d’Asso.Unfortunately neither is complete, nor is there any
complete example known to exist of this class.Perhaps the apex was
added structurally and that these, like all such things in Etruria, have
perished.Possibly, if cut in the rock, the terminals were slender
carved ornaments, and therefore liable to injury.They are usually
restored by antiquaries in the shape of rectilinear pyramids, but so far
as I know, there is no authority for this.On the contrary, it is more
in accordance with what we know of the style and its affinities to
suppose that the termination of these monuments, even if added in
masonry, was curvilinear.Mouldings from Tombs at Castel d’Asso.]One remarkable thing about the rock-cut tombs is the form of their
mouldings, which differ from any found elsewhere in Europe.Two of these
are shown in the annexed woodcut (No.They are very numerous and
in great variety, but do not in any instance show the slightest trace of
a cornice, nor of any tendency towards one.On the contrary, in place of
this, we find nothing but a reverse moulding.It is probable that
similar forms may be found in Asia Minor, while something resembling
them actually occurs at Persepolis and elsewhere.It is remarkable that
this feature did not penetrate to Rome, and that no trace of its
influence is found there, as might have been expected.[162]


                                TUMULI.The simplest, and therefore perhaps the earliest, monument which can be
erected over the graves of the dead, by a people who reverence their
departed relatives, is a mound of earth or a cairn of stones, and such
seems to have been the form adopted by the Turanian or Tartar races of
mankind from the earliest days to the present hour.It is scarcely
necessary to remark how universal such monuments were among the ruder
tribes of Northern Europe.The Etruscans improved upon this by
surrounding the base with a _podium_, or supporting wall of masonry.This not only defined its limits and gave it dignity, but enabled
entrances to be made in it, and otherwise converted it from a mere
hillock into a monumental structure.It is usually supposed that this
basement was an invariable part of all Etruscan tumuli, and when it is
not found, it is assumed that it has been removed, or that it is buried
in the rubbish of the mound.No doubt such a stone basement may easily
have been removed by the peasantry, or buried, but it is by no means
clear that this was invariably the case.It seems that the enclosure was
frequently a circle of stones or monumental steles, in the centre of
which the tumulus stood.The monuments have hitherto been so carelessly
examined and restored, that it is difficult to arrive at anything like
certainty with regard to the details of their structure.Nor can we draw
any certain conclusion from a comparison with other tumuli of cognate
races.The description by Herodotus of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis
(Woodcut No.115), those described by Pausanias as existing in the
Peloponnesus, and the appearances of those at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
might be interpreted either way; but those at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113),
and a great number at least of those in Etruria, have a structural
circle of stone as a supporting base to the mound.Plan of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.These tumuli are found existing in immense numbers in every necropolis
of the Etruscans.A large space was generally set apart for the purpose
outside the walls of all their great cities.In these cemeteries the
tumuli are arranged in rows, like houses in streets.Even now we can
count them by hundreds, and in the neighbourhood of the largest
cities—at Vulci, for instance—almost by thousands.Most of them are now worn down by the effect of time to nearly the level
of the ground, though some of the larger ones still retain an imposing
appearance.Nearly all have been rifled at some early period, though the
treasures still discovered almost daily in some places show how vast
their extent was, and how much even now remains to be done before this
vast mine of antiquity can be said to be exhausted.One of the most remarkable among those that have been opened in modern
times is at Cervetri, the ancient Cære, known as the Regulini Galeassi
tomb, from the names of its discoverers.Sections of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.(From
Canina’s ‘Etruria Antica.’) Scale for large section, 50 ft.Like a Nubian pyramid or Buddhist tope, it consists of an inner and
older tumulus, around and over which another has been added.In the
outer mound are five tombs either of dependent or inferior personages.These were rifled long ago; but the outer pyramid having effectually
concealed the entrance to the principal tomb, it remained untouched till
very lately, when it yielded to its discoverers a richer collection of
ornaments and utensils in gold and bronze than has ever been found in
one place before.The dimensions and arrangements of this tumulus will be understood from
Woodcuts Nos.170, 171, and from the two sections of the principal tomb
which are annexed to them.These last display an irregularity of
construction very unusual in such cases, for which no cause can be
assigned.The usual section is perfectly regular, as in the annexed
woodcut (No.172), taken from another tomb at the same place.These chambers, like all those of the early Etruscans, are vaulted on
the horizontal principle, like the tombs at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
though none are found in Italy at all equal to those of Greece in
dimensions or beauty of construction.173 is a perspective view of the principal chamber in the
Regulini Galeassi tomb, showing the position of the furniture found in
it when first opened, consisting of biers or bedsteads, shields, arrows,
and vessels of various sorts.A number of vases are hung in a curious
recess in the roof, the form of which would be inexplicable but for the
utensils found in it.With this clue to its meaning we can scarcely
doubt that it represents a place for hanging such vessels in the houses
of the living.All the treasures found in this tomb are in the oldest style of Etruscan
art, and are so similar to the bronzes and ornaments brought by Layard
from Assyria as to lead to the belief that they had a common origin.The
tomb, with its contents, probably dates from the 9th or 10th century
before the Christian era.The largest tomb hitherto discovered in Etruria is now known as the

diameter, and originally could not have been less than 115 or 120 ft.in
height, though now it only rises to 50 ft.View of principal Chamber in the Regulini Galeassi
Tomb.]Near its centre are the remains of two solid towers, one circular, the
other square, neither of them actually central, nor are they placed in
such a way that we can understand how they can have formed a part of any
symmetrical design.A plan and a view of the present appearance of this
monument are given in Woodcuts 174 and 175.This tumulus, with its principal remaining features thus standing on one
side of the centre, may possibly assist us to understand the curious
description found in Pliny[163] of the tomb of Porsenna.This
description is quoted from Varro, being evidently regarded by Pliny
himself as not a little apocryphal.According to this account it
consisted of a square basement 300 ft.each way, from which arose five
pyramids, united at the summit by a bronze circle or cupola.This was
again surmounted by four other pyramids, the summits of which were again
united at a height of 300 ft.From this point rose
still five more pyramids, whose height Varro (from modesty, as Pliny
surmises) omits to state, but which was estimated in Etruscan traditions
at the same height as the rest of the monument.This last statement,
which does not rest on any real authority, may well be regarded as
exaggerated; but if we take the total height as about 400 ft., it is
easy to understand that in the age of Pliny, when all the buildings were
low, such a structure, as high as the steeple at Salisbury, would appear
fabulous; but the vast piles that have been erected by tomb-building
races in other parts of the earth render it by no means improbable that
Varro was justified in what he asserted.[164]

Near the gate of Albano is found a small tomb of five pyramidal pillars
rising from a square base, exactly corresponding with Varro’s
description of the lower part of the tomb of Porsenna.It is called by
tradition the tomb of Aruns, the son of Porsenna, though the character
of the mouldings with which it is adorned would lead us to assign to it
a more modern date.It consists of a lofty podium, on which are placed
five pyramids, a large one in the centre and four smaller ones at the
angles.Its present appearance is shown in the annexed woodcut (No.There are not in Etruria any features sufficiently marked to
characterise a style of architecture, nor any pillars with their
accessories which can be considered to constitute an order.It is true
that in some of the rock-cut tombs square piers support the roof; and in
one or two instances rounded pillars are found, but these are either
without mouldings or ornamented only with Roman details, betraying the
lateness of their execution.The absence of built examples of the class
of tombs found in the rock prevents us from recognising any of those
peculiarities of construction which sometimes are as characteristic of
the style and as worthy of attention as the more purely ornamental
parts.From their city gates, their aqueducts and bridges, we know that the
Etruscans used the radiating arch at an early age, with deep voussoirs
and elegant mouldings, giving it that character of strength which the
Romans afterwards imparted to their works of the same class.The Cloaca
Maxima of Rome (Woodcut No.104) must be considered as a work executed
under Etruscan superintendence, and a very perfect specimen of the
class.At the same time the Etruscans used the pointed arch, constructed
horizontally, and seem to have had the same predilection for it which
characterised the cognate Pelasgian race in Greece.A gateway at Arpino
(Woodcut No.177) is almost identical with that at Thoricus (Woodcut No.126), but larger and more elegant; and there are many specimens of the
same class found in Italy.The portion of an aqueduct at Tusculum, shown
in Woodcut No.178, is a curious transition specimen, where the two
stones meeting at the apex (usually called the Egyptian form, being the
first step towards the true arch) are combined with a substructure of
horizontal converging masonry.In either of these instances the horizontal arch is a legitimate mode of
construction, and may have been used long after the principle of the
radiating arch was known.The great convenience of the latter, as
enabling large spaces to be spanned even with brick or the smallest
stones, and thus dispensing with the necessity for stones of very large
dimensions, led ultimately to its universal adoption.Subsequently, when
the pointed form of the radiating arch was introduced, no motive
remained for the retention of the horizontal method, and it was entirely
abandoned.We now approach the last revolution that completed and closed the great
cycle of the arts and civilisation of the ancient world.We have seen
Art spring Minerva-like, perfect from the head of her great parent, in
Egypt.We have admired it in Assyria, rich, varied, but unstable; aiming
at everything, but never attaining maturity or perfection.We have tried
to trace the threads of early Pelasgic art in Asia, Greece, and Etruria,
spreading their influence over the world, and laying the foundation of
other arts which the Pelasgi were incapable of developing.We have seen
all these elements gathered together in Greece, the essence extracted
from each, and the whole forming the most perfect and beautiful
combinations of intellectual power that the world has yet witnessed.We
have now only to contemplate the last act in the great drama, the
gorgeous but melancholy catastrophe by which all these styles of
architecture were collected in wild confusion in Rome, and there
perished beneath the luxury and crimes of that mighty people, who for a
while made Rome the capital of Europe.View them as we will, the arts of Rome were never an indigenous or
natural production of the soil or people, but an aggregation of foreign
styles in a state of transition from the old and time-honoured forms of
Pagan antiquity to the new development introduced by Christianity.We
cannot of course suppose that the Romans foresaw the result to which
their amalgamation of previous styles was tending; still they advanced
as steadily towards that result as if a prophetic spirit had guided them
to a well-defined conception of what was to be.It was not however
permitted to the Romans to complete this task.Long before the ancient
methods and ideas had been completely moulded into the new, the power of
Rome sank beneath her corruption, and a long pause took place, during
which the Christian arts did not advance in Western Europe beyond the
point they had reached in the age of Constantine.Indeed, in many
respects, they receded from it during the dark ages.When they
reappeared in the 10th and 11th centuries it was in an entirely new garb
and with scarcely a trace of their origin—so distinct indeed that it
appears more like a reinvention than a reproduction of forms long since
familiar to the Roman world.Had Rome retained her power and
pre-eminence a century or two longer, a style might have been elaborated
as distinct from that of the ancient world, and as complete in itself,
as our pointed Gothic, and perhaps more beautiful.Such was not the
destiny of the world; and what we have now to do is to examine this
transition style as we find it in ancient Rome, and familiarise
ourselves with the forms it took during the three centuries of its
existence, as without this knowledge all the arts of the Gothic era
would for ever remain an inexplicable mystery.The chief value of the
Roman style consists in the fact that it contains the germs of all that
is found in the Middle Ages, and affords the key by which its mysteries
may be unlocked, and its treasures rendered available.Had the
transition been carried through in the hands of an art-loving and
artistic people, the architectural beauties of Rome must have surpassed
those of any other city in the world, for its buildings surpass in scale
those of Egypt and in variety those of Greece, while they affect to
combine the beauties of both.In constructive ingenuity they far surpass
anything the world had seen up to that time, but this cannot redeem
offences against good taste, nor enable any Roman productions to command
our admiration as works of art, or entitle them to rank as models to be
followed either literally or in spirit.During the first two centuries and a half of her existence, Rome was
virtually an Etruscan city, wholly under Etruscan influence; and during
that period we read of temples and palaces being built and of works of
immense magnitude being undertaken for the embellishment of the city;
and we have even now more remains of kingly than we have of consular
Rome.After expelling her kings and shaking off Etruscan influence, Rome
existed as a republic for five centuries, and during this long age of
barbarism she did nothing to advance science or art.Literature was
almost wholly unknown within her walls, and not one monument has come
down to our time, even by tradition, worthy of a city of a tenth part of
her power and magnitude.There is probably no instance in the history of
the world of a capital city existing so long, populous and peaceful at
home, prosperous and powerful abroad, and at the same time so utterly
devoid of any monuments or any magnificence to dignify her existence.When, however, Carthage was conquered and destroyed, when Greece was
overrun and plundered, and Egypt, with her long-treasured art, had
become a dependent province, Rome was no longer the city of the Aryan
Romans, but the sole capital of the civilised world.Into her lap were
poured all the artistic riches of the universe; to Rome flocked all who
sought a higher distinction or a more extended field for their ambition
than their own provincial capitals could then afford.She thus became
the centre of all the arts and of all the science then known; and, so
far at least as quantity is concerned, she amply redeemed her previous
neglect of them.It seems an almost indisputable fact that, during the
three centuries of the Empire, more and larger buildings were erected in
Rome and her dependent cities than ever were erected in a like period in
any part of the world.For centuries before the establishment of the Roman Empire, progressive
development and increasing population, joined to comparative peace and
security, had accumulated around the shores of the Mediterranean a mass
of people enjoying material prosperity greater than had ever been known
before.All this culminated in the first centuries of the Christian era.The greatness of the ancient world was then full, and a more
overwhelming and gorgeous spectacle than the Roman Empire then displayed
never dazzled the eyes of mankind.From the banks of the Euphrates to
those of the Tagus, every city vied with its neighbour in the erection
of temples, baths, theatres, and edifices for public use or private
luxury.In all cases these display far more evidence of wealth and power
than of taste and refinement, and all exhibit traces of that haste to
enjoy, which seems incompatible with the correct elaboration of anything
that is to be truly great.Notwithstanding all this, there is a
greatness in the mass, a grandeur in the conception, and a certain
expression of power in all these Roman remains which never fail to
strike the beholder with awe and force admiration from him despite his
better judgment.These qualities, coupled with the associations that
attach themselves to every brick and every stone, render the study of
them irresistibly attractive.It was with Imperial Rome that the ancient
world perished; it was in her dominions that the new and Christian world
was born.All that was great in Heathendom was gathered within her
walls, tied, it is true, into an inextricable knot, which was cut by the
sword of those barbarians who moulded for themselves out of the
fragments that polity and those arts which will next occupy our
attention.To Rome all previous history tends; from Rome all modern
history springs: to her, therefore, and to her arts, we inevitably turn,
if not to admire, at least to learn, and if not to imitate, at any rate
to wonder at and to contemplate a phase of art as unknown to previous as
to subsequent history, and, if properly understood, more replete with
instruction than any other form hitherto known.Though the lesson we
learn from it is far oftener what to avoid than what to follow, still
there is such wisdom to be gathered from it as should guide us in the
onward path, which may lead us to a far higher grade than it was given
to Rome herself ever to attain.Origin of style—The arch—Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be
called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country
previously occupied by Pelasgians.Their principal neighbour on one side
was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation.On the other hand was Magna Græcia,
which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of
kindred origin.It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the
Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two
people.As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of
both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries
afterwards.Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,
and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in
Roman architecture to its origin.From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with
its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used
it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being
sufficiently large for their purposes.The principal Etruscan temples,
as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half
occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the
portico never extended.The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of
these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its
breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the
building.Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,
but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though
frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns
attached to its walls.Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a
circular form of temple.As applied by the Romans it was generally
encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the
Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from
the Greeks on an Etruscan form.In early times these circular temples
were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown
or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this
distinction was lost sight of.A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the
Etruscans was the circular arch.It was known, it is true, to the
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps
excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their
ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and
introduced it into almost all their buildings.It was not at first used
in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones.In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was
generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders.In the
Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless
network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their
entablatures, is spread over the whole.This is a curious instance of
the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of
Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns
would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some
expedient more correctly constructive.After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the
arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in
advance by applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular
forms of buildings.The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of
the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple
of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so
distant in date.In these buildings the Roman architects so completely
emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to
entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture.It
would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to
the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for
boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the
new method ought to be applied.This is almost universally acknowledged
so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned.In simple grandeur
it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail.It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in
its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet
remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been
quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more
familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately
as the simpler dome of the Pantheon.These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to
which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of
architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors.It
may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman
architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the
semi-Oriental nation seized on its own circular form, and, modifying and
moulding it to its purpose, wrought out the Byzantine style; in which
the dome is the great feature, almost to the total exclusion of the
rectangular form with its intersecting vaults.On the other hand, the
rectangular form was appropriated by the nations of the West with an
equally distinct rejection of the circular and domical forms, except in
those cases in which we find an Eastern people still incorporated with
them.Thus in Italy both styles continued long in use, the one in
baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in
Rome.In France they were so completely fused into each other that it
requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate
them again into their component parts.In England we rejected the
circular form altogether, and so they did eventually in Germany, except
when under French influence.Each race reclaimed its own among the
spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during
its employment in the Imperial city.The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the
numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of
purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles.In
Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs.In
Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in
Etruria to tombs.It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to
deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who
for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture
subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster.It thus
happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find
basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of
triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all
equally objects of architectural skill.The best of these, in fact, are
those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped
with originality.These would have been noble works indeed had it not
been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and
details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to
temples by other nations.In the time of Constantine these orders had
nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative
purposes.In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the
Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before
remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore
still remain an essential part of Roman art.We find the old orders
predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as
we approach that of Constantine.Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the
Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about
half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly simple order of
the Greeks.It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for
monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter.It was, however,
more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter
column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek
style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,
but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman.This fact was apparently
recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple
throughout the Roman world.It would in consequence be most unfair to
institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in
civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world
spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was
devoted to the highest religious purposes.The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally
useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the
other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal
object of its introduction.The keynote of Roman architecture was the
Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,
many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders
together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three
should be reduced to something like harmony.This was accordingly done,
but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in
combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our
admiration.The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the
Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric.They
never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed
it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two.In its own native
East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers
or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no
angles to be turned.When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples
of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at
each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to
one another.In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut
No.142) they used a capital with four faces.The Romans, impatient of
control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over
the extreme difficulty of its employment.With them the angular volutes
became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants
harmony and meaning.When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,
and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this
state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually
deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord
in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to
be found in Roman remains.The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from
that of the other two.The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme
of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have
become incapable of further improvement.The Corinthian, on the
contrary, was a recent conception; and although nothing can surpass the
elegance and grace with which the Greeks adorned it, the new capital
never acquired with them that fulness and strength so requisite to
render it an appropriate architectural ornament.These were added to it
by the Romans, or rather perhaps by Grecian artists acting under their
direction, who thus, as shown in Woodcut No.181, produced an order
which for richness combined with proportion and architectural fitness
has hardly been surpassed.The base is elegant and appropriate; the
shaft is of the most pleasing proportion, and the fluting gives it just
the requisite degree of richness and no more; while the capital, though
bordering on over-ornamentation, is so well arranged as to appear just
suited to the work it has to do.The acanthus-leaves, it is true,
approach the very verge of that degree of direct imitation of nature
which, though allowable in architectural ornaments, is seldom advisable;
they are, however, disposed so formally, and there still remains so much
that is conventional in them, that, though perhaps not justly open to
criticism on this account, they are nevertheless a very extreme example.The entablature is not so admirable as the column.The architrave is too
richly carved.It is evident, however, that this arose from the artist
having copied in carving what the Greeks had only painted, and thereby
produced a complexity far from pleasing.The frieze, as we now find it, is perfectly plain; but this undoubtedly
was not the case when originally erected.It either must have been
painted (in which case the whole order of course was also painted), or
ornamented with scrolls or figures in bronze, which may probably have
been gilt.The cornice is perhaps open to the same criticism as the architrave, of
being over-rich, though this evidently arose from the same cause, viz.,
reproducing in carving what was originally only painted; which to our
Northern eyes at least appears more appropriate for internal than for
external decoration, though, under the purer skies where it was
introduced and used, this remark may be hardly applicable.The order of the portico of the Pantheon is, according to our notions, a
nobler specimen of what an external pillar should be than that of the
Temple of Jupiter Stator.The shafts are of one block, unfluted; the
capital plainer; and the whole entablature, though as correctly
proportional, is far less ornamented and more suited to the greater
simplicity of the whole.The order of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina is another example
intermediate between these two.The columns are in this instance very
similar to those of the Pantheon, and the architrave is plain.The
frieze, however, is ornamented with more taste than any other in Rome,
and is a very pleasing example of those conventional representations of
plants and animals which are so well suited to architectural
purposes—more like Nature than those of the Greeks, but still avoiding
direct imitation sufficiently to escape the affectation of pretending to
appear what it is not and cannot be.The Maison Carrée at Nîmes presents an example of a frieze ornamented
with exquisite taste, while at Baalbec, and in some other examples, we
have them so over-ornamented that the effect is far more offensive, from
utter want of repose, than the frieze in the Temple of Jupiter Stator
ever could be from its baldness.Besides these there are at least fifty varieties of Corinthian capitals
to be found, either in Rome or in various parts of the Roman Empire, all
executed within the three centuries during which Rome continued to be
the imperial city.Some of them are remarkable for that elegant
simplicity which so evidently betrays the hand of a Grecian artist,
while others again show a lavish exuberance of ornament which is but too
characteristic of Roman art in general.Many, however, contain the germs
of something better than was accomplished in that age; and a collection
of them would afford more useful suggestions for designing capitals than
have yet been available to modern artists.Among their various attempts to improve the order which has just been
described, the Romans hit upon one which is extremely characteristic of
their whole style of art.This is known by the distinguishing name of
the Composite order, though virtually more like the typical examples of
the Corinthian order than many of those classed under the latter
denomination.The greatest defect of the Corinthian capital is the weakness of the
small volutes supporting the angles of the abacus.A true artist would
have remedied this by adding to their strength and carrying up the
fulness of the capital to the top.The Romans removed the whole of the
upper part and substituted an Ionic capital instead.Their only original
idea, if it may be so called, in art was that of putting two dissimilar
things together to make one which should combine the beauties of both,
though as a rule the one generally serves to destroy the other.In the
Composite capital they never could hide the junction; and consequently,
though rich, and in some respects an improvement on the order out of
which it grew, this capital never came into general use, and has seldom
found favour except amongst the blindest admirers of all that the Romans
did.Corinthian Base, found in Church of St.In the latter days of the Empire the Romans attempted another innovation
which promised far better success, and with very little more elaboration
would have been a great gain to the principles of architectural design.This was the introduction of the Persian or Assyrian base, modified to
suit the details of the Corinthian or Composite orders.If they had
always used this instead of the square pedestals on which they mounted
their columns, and had attenuated the pillars slightly when used with
arcades, they would have avoided many of the errors they fell into.This
application, however, came too late to be generally used; and the forms
already introduced continued to prevail.At the same time it is evident
that a Persepolitan base for an Ionic and even for a Corinthian column
would be amongst the greatest improvements that could now be introduced,
especially for internal architecture.The true Roman order, however, was not any of these columnar ordinances
we have been enumerating, but an arrangement of two pillars placed at a
distance from one another nearly equal to their own height, and having a
very long entablature, which in consequence required to be supported in
the centre by an arch springing from piers.This, as will be seen from
the annexed woodcut, was in fact merely a screen of Grecian architecture
placed in front of a construction of Etruscan design.Though not without
a certain richness of effect, still, as used by the Romans, these two
systems remain too distinctly dissimilar for the result to be pleasing,
and their use necessitated certain supplemental arrangements by no means
agreeable.In the first place, the columns had to be mounted on
pedestals, or otherwise an entablature proportional to their size would
have been too heavy and too important for a thing so useless and so
avowedly a mere ornament.A projecting keystone was also introduced into
the arch.This was unobjectionable in itself, but when projecting so far
as to do the duty of an intermediate capital, it overpowered the arch
without being equal to the work required of it.The Romans used these arcades with all the 3 orders, frequently one over
the other, and tried various expedients to harmonise the construction
with the ornamentation, but without much effect.They seem always to
have felt the discordance as a blemish, and at last got rid of it, but
whether they did so in the best way is not quite clear.The most obvious
mode of effecting this would no doubt have been by omitting the pillars
altogether, bending the architrave, as is usually done, round the arch,
and then inserting the frieze and cornices into the wall, using them as
a string-course.A slight degree of practice would soon have enabled
them—by panelling the pier, cutting off its angles, or some such
expedient—to have obtained the degree of lightness or of ornament they
required, and so really to have invented a new order.This, however, was not the course that the Romans pursued.What they did
was to remove the pier altogether, and to substitute for it the pillar
taken down from its pedestal.This of course was not effected at once,
but was the result of many trials and expedients.One of the earliest of
these is observed in the Ionic Temple of Concord before alluded to, in
which a concealed arch is thrown from the head of each pillar, but above
the entablature, so as to take the whole weight of the superstructure
from off the cornice between the pillars.When once this was done it was
perceived that so deep an entablature was no longer required, and that
it might be either wholly omitted, as was sometimes done in the centre
intercolumniation, or very much reduced.There is an old temple at
Talavera in Spain, which is a good example of the former expedient; and
the Roman gateway at Damascus is a remarkable instance of the latter.There the architrave, frieze and cornice are carried across in the form
of an arch from pier to pier, thus constituting a new feature in
architectural design.View in Courtyard of Palace at Spalato]

In Diocletian’s reign we find all these changes already introduced into
domestic architecture, as shown in Woodcut No.185, representing the
great court of his palace at Spalato, where, at one end, the entablature
is bent into the form of an arch over the central intercolumniation,
while on each side of the court the arches spring directly from the
capitals of the columns.Had the Romans at this period been more desirous to improve their
external architecture, there is little doubt that they would have
adopted the expedient of omitting the entire entablature: but at this
time almost all their efforts were devoted to internal improvement, and
not unfrequently at the expense of the exterior.Indeed the whole
history of Roman art, from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine,
is a transition from the external architecture of the Greeks to the
internal embellishment of the Christians.At first we see the cells of
the temple gradually enlarged at the expense of the peristyle, and
finally, in some instances, entirely overpowering them.Their basilicas
and halls become more important than their porticoes, and the exterior
is in almost every instance sacrificed to internal arrangements.For an
interior, an arch resting on a circular column is obviously far more
appropriate than one resting on a pier.Externally, on the contrary, the
square pier is most suitable, because a pillar cannot support a wall of
sufficient thickness.This defect was not remedied until the Gothic
architects devised the plan of coupling two or more pillars together;
but this point had not been reached at the time when with the fall of
Rome all progress in art was effectually checked for a time.There is perhaps nothing that strikes the inquirer into the
architectural history of Rome more than the extreme insignificance of
her temples, as compared with the other buildings of the imperial city
and with some contemporary temples found in the provinces.The only
temple which remains at all worthy of such a capital is the Pantheon.All others are now mere fragments, from which we can with difficulty
restore even the plans of the buildings, far less judge of their effect.We have now no means of forming an opinion of the great national temple
of the Capitoline Jove, no trace of it, nor any intelligible
description, having been preserved to the present time.Its having been
of Etruscan origin, and retaining its original form to the latest day,
would lead us to suppose that the temple itself was small, and that its
magnificence, if any, was confined to the enclosure and to the
substructure, which may have been immense.Of the Augustan age we have nothing but the remains of three temples,
each consisting of only three columns; and the excavations that have
been made around them have not sufficed to make even their plans
tolerably clear.The most remarkable was that of Jupiter Stator in the Forum, the
beautiful details of which have been already alluded to and described.It was raised on a stylobate 22 ft.in height, the extreme width of which was 98 ft., and this corresponds
as closely as possible with 100 Roman ft.The height of the pillars was 48 ft., and
that of the entablature 12 ft.[165] It is probable that the whole
height to the apex of the pediment was nearly equal to the extreme
width, and that it was designed to be so.The pillars certainly extended on both flanks, and the temple is
generally restored as peristylar, but apparently without any authority.From the analogy of the other temples it seems more probable that there
were not more than eight or ten pillars on each side, and that the apse
of the cella formed the termination opposite the portico.The temple nearest to this in situation and style is that of Jupiter
Tonans.[166] The order in this instance is of slightly inferior
dimensions to that of the temple just described, and of very inferior
execution.The temple, too, was very much smaller, having only six
columns in front, and from its situation it could not well have had more
than that number on the flanks, so that its extreme dimensions were
probably about 70 ft.The third is the Temple of Mars Ultor, of which a plan is annexed; for
though now as completely decayed as the other two, in the time of Ant.Sabacco and Palladio there seem to have been sufficient remains to
justify an attempt at restoration.As will be seen, it is nearly square
in plan (112 ft.The cella is here a much more important part
than is usual in Greek temples, and terminates in an apse, which
afterwards became characteristic of all places of worship.Behind the
cella, and on each side, was a lofty screen of walls and arches, part of
which still remain, and form quite a new adjunct, unlike anything
hitherto met with attached to any temple now known.(From Cresy’s ‘Rome.’) Scale
100 ft.The next class of temples, called pseudo-peripteral (or those in which
the cella occupies the whole of the after part), are generally more
modern, certainly more completely Roman, than these last.One of the
best specimens at Rome is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, a small
building measuring 72 ft.There is also a very elegant little
Ionic temple of this class called that of Fortuna Virilis; while the
Ionic Temple of Concord, built by Vespasian, and above alluded to,
appears also to have been of this class.So was the temple in the forum
at Pompeii; but the finest specimen now remaining to us is the so-called
Maison Carrée at Nîmes, which is indeed one of the most elegant temples
of the Roman world, owing probably a great deal of its beauty to the
taste of the Grecian colonists long settled in its neighbourhood.It is
hexastyle, with 11 columns in the flanks, 3 of which stand free, and
belong to the portico; the remaining 8 are attached to the walls of the
cella.by 85; but such is the beauty of
its proportions and the elegance of its details that it strikes every
beholder with admiration.Plan of Maison Carrée at Nîmes.The date of this temple has not been satisfactorily ascertained.From
the nail-holes of the inscription on the frieze it has been attempted to
make out the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and there is nothing in
the style of its architecture to contradict this hypothesis.Even if the
buildings in the capital were such as to render this date ambiguous, it
would scarcely be safe to apply any argument derived from them to a
provincial example erected in the midst of a Grecian colony.But for
their evidence we might almost be inclined to fancy its style
represented the age of Trajan.The temple of Diana in the same city is another edifice of singular
beauty of detail, and interesting from the peculiarity of its plan.Exclusive of the portico it is nearly square, 70 ft.by 65, and consists
of a cella which is covered with a stone ribbed vault, the thrust of
which is counteracted by smaller vaults thrown across two side passages
or aisles which are, however, not thrown open to the cella.The columns
in the cella are detached from the wall, which is singularly interesting
as the origin of much which we find afterwards in Gothic work.(A
somewhat similar arrangement is found in the small temple at Baalbec
(Woodcut No.197) where, however, the peristyle occupies the position
and serves the same purpose as the aisles at Nîmes, viz., to resist the
thrust of the vault over the cella.)Plan of Temple of Diana at Nîmes.Throughout this building the details of the architecture are unsurpassed
for variety and elegance by anything found in the metropolis, and are
applied here with a freedom and elegance bespeaking the presence of a
Grecian mind even in this remote corner of the Empire.This was supported by four slender
columns of singularly elegant design, but placed so widely apart that
they could not have carried a stone entablature.It is difficult to
guess what could have been the form of the wooden ones; but a mortice
which still exists in the walls of the temple shows that it must have
been eight or ten feet deep, and therefore probably of Etruscan form
(Woodcut No.167); though it may have assumed a circular arched form
between the pillars.[167]

[Illustration: 189.View of the Interior of the Temple of Diana at
Nîmes.Another peculiarity is, that the light was introduced over the portico
by a great semicircular window, as is done in the Buddhist caves in
India; which, so far as I know, is the most perfect mode of lighting the
interior of a temple which has yet been discovered.Not far from the Colosseum, in the direction of the Forum, are still to
be seen the remains of a great double temple built by the Emperor
Hadrian, and dedicated to Venus and Rome, and consisting of the ruins of
its two cells, each about 70 ft.square, covered with tunnel-vaults, and
placed back to back, so that their apses touch one another.long by 330 wide; and it is generally supposed
that on the edge of this once stood 56 great columns, 65 ft.in height,
thus moulding the whole into one great peripteral temple.Some fragments
of such pillars are said to be found in the neighbourhood, but not one
is now erect,—not even a base is in its place,—nor can any of its
columns be traced to any other buildings.This part, therefore, of the
arrangement is very problematical, and I should be rather inclined to
restore it, as Palladio and the older architects have done, with a
corridor of ten small columns in front of each of the cells.If we could
assume the plan of this temple to have been really peripteral, as
supposed, it must have been a building worthy of the imperial city and
of the magnificence of the emperor to whom its erection is ascribed.More perfect and more interesting than any of these is the Pantheon,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest temples of the ancient world.Externally its effect is very much destroyed by its two parts, the
circular and the rectangular, being so dissimilar in style and so
incongruously joined together.The portico especially, in itself the
finest which Rome exhibits, is very much injured by being prefixed to a
mass which overpowers it and does not harmonise with any of its lines.The pitch, too, of its pediment is perhaps somewhat too high, but,
notwithstanding all this, its sixteen columns, the shaft of each
composed of a single block, and the simple grandeur of the details,
render it perhaps the most satisfactory example of its class.The pillars are arranged in the Etruscan fashion, as they were
originally disposed in front of three-celled temples.As they now stand,
however, they are added unsymmetrically to a rotunda, and in so clumsy a
fashion that the two are certainly not part of the same design and do
not belong to the same age.Either it was that the portico was added to
the pre-existing rotunda, or that the rotunda is long subsequent to the
portico.Unfortunately the two inscriptions on the portico hardly help
to a solution of the difficulty.The principal one states that it was
built by M. Agrippa, but the “it” may refer to the rotunda only, and may
have been put there by those who in the time of Aurelius[168] repaired
the temple which had “fallen into decay from age.” This hardly could,
under any circumstances, be predicated of the rotunda, which shows no
sign of decay during the last seventeen centuries of ill-treatment and
neglect, and may last for as many more without injury to its stability,
but might be said of a portico which, if of wood, as Etruscan porticoes
usually were, may easily in 200 years have required repairs and
rebuilding.From a more careful examination on the spot, I am convinced
that the portico was added at some subsequent period to the rotunda.If
by Agrippa, then the dome must belong to Republican times; if by Severus
it may have been, as is generally supposed, the hall of the Baths of
Agrippa.[169] Altogether I know of no building whose date and
arrangements are so singular and so exceptional as this.Though it is,
and always must have been, one of the most prominent buildings in Rome,
and most important from its size and design, I know of no other building
in Rome whose date or original destination it is so difficult to
determine.Half Elevation, half Section, of the Pantheon at
Rome.Internally perhaps the greatest defect of the building is a want of
height in the perpendicular part, which the dome appears to overpower
and crush.This mistake is aggravated by the lower part being cut up
into two storeys, an attic being placed over the lower order.The former
defect may have arisen from the architect wishing to keep the walls in
some proportion to the portico.The latter is a peculiarity of the age
in which I suppose this temple to have been remodelled, when two or more
storeys seem to have become indispensable requisites of architectural
design.We must ascribe also to the practice of the age the method of
cutting through the entablature by the arches of the great niches, as
shown in the sectional part of the last woodcut.It has already been
pointed out that this was becoming a characteristic of the style at the
time when the circular part of this temple was arranged as it at present
appears.Notwithstanding these defects and many others of detail that might be
mentioned, there is a grandeur and a simplicity in the proportions of
this great temple that render it still one of the very finest and most
sublime interiors in the world, and the dimensions of its dome, 145 ft.span by 147 in height, have not yet been surpassed by any
subsequent erection.Though it is deprived of its bronze covering[170]
and of the greater part of those ornaments on which it mainly depended
for effect, and though these have been replaced by tawdry and
incongruous modernisms, still nothing can destroy the effect of a design
so vast and of a form so simply grand.It possesses moreover one other
element of architectural sublimity in having a single window, and that
placed high up in the building.I know of no other temples which possess
this feature except the great rock-cut Buddhist basilicas of India.In
them the light is introduced even more artistically than here; but,
nevertheless, that one great eye opening upon heaven is by far the
noblest conception for lighting a building to be found in Europe.Besides this great rotunda there are two other circular temples in or
near Rome.The one at Tivoli, shown in plan and elevation in the annexed
woodcuts (Nos.192 and 193), has long been known and admired; the other,
near the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima, has a cell surrounded by twenty
Corinthian columns of singularly slender proportions.Both these
probably stand on Etruscan sites; they certainly are Etruscan in form,
and are very likely sacred to Pelasgic deities, either Vesta or Cybele.Restored Elevation of Temple at Tivoli.Both in dimensions and design they form a perfect contrast to the
Pantheon, as might be expected from their both belonging to the Augustan
age of art: consequently the cella is small, its interior is
unornamented, and all the art and expense is lavished on the external
features, especially on the peristyle; showing more strongly than even
the rectangular temple the still remaining predominance of Grecian
taste, which was gradually dying out during the whole period of the
Empire.It is to be regretted that the exact dates of both these temples are
unknown, for, as that at Tivoli shows the stoutest example of a
Corinthian column known and that in Rome the slenderest, it might lead
to some important deductions if we could be certain which was the older
of the two.It may be, however, that this difference of style has no
connection with the relative age of the two buildings, but that it is
merely an instance of the good taste of the age to which they belong.The Roman example, being placed in a low and flat situation, required
all the height that could be given it; that at Tivoli, being placed on
the edge of a rock, required as much solidity as the order would admit
of to prevent its looking poor and insecure.A Gothic or a Greek
architect would certainly have made this distinction.One more step towards the modern style of round temples was taken before
the fall of the Western Empire, in the temple which Diocletian built in
his palace at Spalato.Internally the temple is circular, 28 ft.in
diameter, and the height of the perpendicular part to the springing of
the dome is about equal to its width.This is a much more pleasing
proportion than we find in the Pantheon; perhaps the very best that has
yet been employed.Externally the building is an octagon, surrounded by
a low dwarf peristyle, very unlike that employed in the older examples.This angularity is certainly a great improvement, giving expression and
character to the building, and affording flat faces for the entrances or
porches; but the peristyle is too low, and mars the dignity of the
whole.[171]

[Illustration: 194.Plan and Elevation of Temple in Diocletian’s Palace
at Spalato.To us its principal interest consists in its being so extremely similar
to the Christian baptisteries which were erected in the following
centuries, and which were copies, but very slightly altered, from
buildings of this class.Even assuming that Hadrian completed the great Temple of Venus at Rome
in the manner generally supposed, it must have been very far surpassed
by the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, which, though
probably not entirely erected, was certainly finished, by that Emperor.It was octastyle in front,[172] with a double range of 20 columns on
each flank so that it could not well have had less than 106 columns, all
about 58 ft.in height, and of the most elegant Corinthian order,
presenting altogether a group of far greater magnificence than any other
temple we are acquainted with of its class in the ancient world.Its
lineal dimensions also, as may be seen from the plan (Woodcut No.195),
were only rivalled by the two great Sicilian temples at Selinus and
Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.wide by 354 in
length, or nearly the same dimensions as the great Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac, from which, however, it differs most materially, that being a
beautiful example of an interior, this depending for all its
magnificence on the external arrangement of its columns.Penrose’s
discoveries in 1884 show that there was an opisthodomus at the rear and
a vestibule or court in front of the cella which may have been hypæthral
so as to admit light into the interior.This arrangement became so
common in the early Christian world that there must have been some
precedent for it; which, in addition to other reasons,[173] strongly
inclines me to believe that the arrangement shown in the plan is
correct.Ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]Plan of Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]The temples of Palmyra and Kangovar have been already mentioned in
speaking of that of Jerusalem, to which class they seem to belong in
their general arrangements, though their details are borrowed from Roman
architecture.This, however, is not the case with the temples at
Baalbec, which taken together and with their accompaniments, form the
most magnificent temple group now left to us of their class and age.The
great temple, if completed (which, however, probably it never was),
would have been about 160 ft.by 290, and therefore, as a Corinthian
temple, only inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.Only nine
of its colossal columns are now standing, but the bases of most of the
others are _in situ_.Scarcely less magnificent than the temple itself
was the court in which it stood, above 380 ft.square, and surrounded on
three sides by recessed porticoes of most exuberant richness, though in
perhaps rather questionable taste.In front of this was a hexagonal
court of very great beauty, with a noble portico of 12 Corinthian
columns, with two square blocks of masonry at each end.The whole extent
of the portico is 260 ft., and of its kind it is perhaps unrivalled,
certainly among the buildings of so late a date as the period to which
it belongs.Elevation of Small Temple at Baalbec.The other, or smaller temple, stands close to the larger.Its
dimensions, to the usual scale, are shown in the plan (Woodcut No.It is larger than any of the Roman peripteral temples, being 117 ft.by
227 ft., or rather exceeding the dimensions of the Parthenon at Athens,
and its portico is both wider and higher than that of the Pantheon at
Rome.Had this portico been applied to that building, the <DW72> of its
pediment would have coincided exactly with that of the upper sloping
cornice, and would have been the greatest possible improvement to that
edifice.As it is, it certainly is the best proportioned and the most
graceful Roman portico of the first class that remains to us in a state
of sufficient completeness to allow us to judge of its effect.The interior of the cella was richly ornamented with niches and
pilasters, and covered with a ribbed and coffered vault, remarkable,
like every part of this edifice, rather for the profusion than for the
good taste of its ornaments.One of the principal peculiarities of this group of buildings is the
immense size of some of the stones used in the substructure of the great
temple: three of these average about 63 ft.A fourth, of similar dimensions, is lying
in the quarry, which it is calculated must weigh alone more than 1100
tons in its rough state, or nearly as much as one of the tubes of the
Britannia Bridge.It is not easy to see why such masses were employed.If they had been used as foundation stones their use would have been
apparent, but they are placed over several courses of smaller stones,
about half-way up the terrace wall, as mere binding stones, apparently
for show.It is true that in many places in the Bible and in Josephus
nothing is so much insisted upon as the immense size of the stones used
in the building of the Temple and the walls of Jerusalem, the bulk of
the materials used appearing to have been thought a matter of far more
importance than the architecture.It probably was some such feeling as
this which led to their employment here, though, had these huge stones
been set upright, as the Egyptians would have placed them, we might more
easily have understood why so great an expense should have been incurred
on their account.As it is, there seems no reason for doubting their
being of the same age as the temples they support, though their use is
certainly exceptional in Roman temples of this class.BASILICAS, THEATRES, AND BATHS.Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius—Provincial basilicas—Theatre at
  Orange—Colosseum—Provincial amphitheatres—Baths of Diocletian.We have already seen that in size and magnificence the temples of Rome
were among the least remarkable of her public buildings.It may be
doubted whether in any respect, in the eyes of the Romans themselves,
the temples were as important and venerable as the basilicas.The people
cared for government and justice more than for religion, and
consequently paid more attention to the affairs of the basilicas than to
those of the temples.Our means for the restoration of this class of
buildings are now but small, owing to their slight construction in the
first instance, and to their materials having been so suitable for the
building of Christian basilicas as to have been extensively used for
that purpose.It happens, however, that the remains which we do possess
comprise what we know to be the ruins of the two most splendid buildings
of this class in Rome, and these are sufficiently complete to enable us
to restore their plans with considerable confidence.It is also
fortunate that one of these, the Ulpian or Trajan’s basilica, is the
typical specimen of those with wooden roofs; the other, that of
Maxentius, commonly called the Temple of Peace, is the noblest of the
vaulted class.Plan of Trajan’s Basilica at Rome.The part shaded darker is all that is uncovered.
]Restored Section of Trajan’s Basilica.The rectangular part of Trajan’s basilica was 180 ft.in width and a
little more than twice that in length, but, neither end having yet been
excavated, its exact longitudinal measurement has not been ascertained.It was divided into five aisles by four rows of columns, each about 35
ft.wide, and the side-aisles 23 ft.The centre was covered by a wooden roof of semicircular
form,[174] covered apparently with bronze plates richly ornamented and
gilt.Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was
supported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang
the arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was
thus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,
though not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was
raised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre
of this platform was the raised seat of the quæstor or other magistrate
who presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the
assessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front
of the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before
commencing any important public business.[175]

Externally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It
was entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and
section) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on
either side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height
as those used internally.These supported statues, or rather, to judge
from the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set
off, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as
this was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to
have prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have
been very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the
structure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the
exception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class
of buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took
the place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always
suggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a
mere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the façade.The interior
of the basilica was, however, the important element to which the
exterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design
which we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,
which were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose
conformation had become sacred from the traditions of past ages.Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.Transverse Section of Basilica of Maxentius.The basilica of Maxentius, which was probably not entirely finished till
the reign of Constantine, was rather broader than that of Trajan, being
195 ft.between the walls, but it was 100 ft.The
central aisle was very nearly of the same width, being 83 ft.There was, however, a vast difference
in the construction of the two; so much so, that we are startled to see
how rapid the progress had been during the interval, of less than two
centuries, that had elapsed between the construction of the two
basilicas.Pillar of Maxentian Basilica.(From an old print
quoted by Letarouilly.)]In this building no pillars were used with the exception of eight great
columns in front of the piers, employed merely as ornaments, or as
vaulting shafts were in Gothic cathedrals, to support in appearance,
though not in construction, the springing of the vaults.[176] The
side-aisles were roofed by three great arches, each 74 ft.in span, and
the centre by an immense intersecting vault in three compartments.The
form of these will be understood from the annexed sections (Woodcuts
Nos.202 and 203), one taken longitudinally, the other across the
building.As will be seen from them, all the thrusts are collected to a
point and a buttress placed there to receive them: indeed almost all the
peculiarities afterwards found in Gothic vaults are here employed on a
far grander and more gigantic scale than the Gothic architects ever
attempted; but at the same time it must be allowed that the latter, with
smaller dimensions, often contrived by a more artistic treatment of
their materials to obtain as grand an effect and far more actual beauty
than ever were attained in the great transitional halls of the Romans.The largeness of the parts of the Roman buildings was indeed their
principal defect, as in consequence of this they must all have appeared
smaller than they really were, whereas in all Gothic cathedrals the
repetition and smallness of the component parts has the effect of
magnifying their real dimensions.The roofs of these halls had one peculiarity which it would have been
well if the mediæval architects had copied, inasmuch as they were all,
or at least might have been, honestly used as roofs without any
necessity for their being covered with others of wood, as all Gothic
vaults unfortunately were.It is true this is perhaps one of the causes
of their destruction, for, being only overlaid with cement, the rain
wore away the surface, as must inevitably be the case with any
composition of the sort exposed horizontally to the weather, and that
being gone, the moisture soon penetrated through the crevices of the
masonry, destroying the stability of the vault.Still, some of these in
Rome have resisted for fifteen centuries, after the removal of any
covering they ever might have had, all the accidents of climate and
decay, while there is not a Gothic vault of half their dimensions that
would stand for a century after the removal of its wooden protection.The construction of a vault capable of resisting the destructive effects
of exposure to the atmosphere still remains a problem for modern
architects to solve.Until this is accomplished we must regard roofs
entirely of honest wood as preferable to the deceptive stone ceilings
which were such favourites in the Middle Ages.Plan of the Basilica at Trèves.Internal View of the Basilica at Trèves.]The provincial basilicas of the Roman Empire have nearly all perished,
probably from their having been converted, first into churches, for
which they were so admirably adapted, and then rebuilt to suit the
exigencies and taste of subsequent ages.One example, however, still
exists in Trèves of sufficient completeness to give a good idea of what
such structures were.As will be seen by the annexed plan, it consists
of a great hall, 85 ft.in width internally, and rather more than twice
that dimension in length.in height and
pierced with two rows of windows; but whether they were originally
separated by a gallery or not is now by no means clear.At one end was
the apse, rather more than a semicircle of 60 ft.The floor
of the apse was raised considerably above that of the body of the
building, and was no doubt adorned by a hemicycle of seats raised on
steps, with a throne in the centre for the judge.The building has been
used for so many purposes since the time of the Romans, and has been so
much altered, that it is not easy now to speak with certainty of any of
its minor arrangements.Its internal and external appearance, as it
stood before the recent restoration, are well expressed in the annexed
woodcuts; and though ruined, it was the most complete example of a Roman
basilica to be found anywhere out of the capital.A building of this
description has been found at Pompeii, which may be considered a fair
example of a provincial basilica of the second class.Its plan is
perfectly preserved, as shown in Woodcut No.The most striking
difference existing between it and those previously described is the
square termination instead of the circular apse.It must, however, be
observed that Pompeii was situated nearer to Magna Græcia than to Rome,
and was indeed far more a Greek than a Roman city.Very slight traces of
any Etruscan designs have been discovered there, and scarcely any
buildings of the circular form so much in vogue in the capital.Though
the ground-plan of this basilica remains perfect, the upper parts are
entirely destroyed, and we do not even know for certain whether the
central portion was roofed or not.[177]

[Illustration: 207.External View of the Basilica at Trèves.]There is a small square building at Otricoli, which is generally
supposed to be a basilica, but its object as well as its age is so
uncertain that nothing need be said of it here.In the works of
Vitruvius, too, there is a description of one built by him at Fano, the
restoration of which has afforded employment for the ingenuity of the
admirers of that worst of architects.Even taking it as restored by
those most desirous of making the best of it, it is difficult to
understand how anything so bad could have been erected in such an age.It is extremely difficult to trace the origin of these basilicas, owing
principally to the loss of all the earlier examples.Their name is
Greek, and they may probably be considered as derived from the Grecian
Lesche, or perhaps as amplifications of the cellæ of Greek temples,
appropriated to the purposes of justice rather than of religion; but
till we know more of their earlier form and origin, it is useless
speculating on this point.The greatest interest to us, arises rather
from the use to which their plan was afterwards applied, than from the
source from which they themselves sprang.All the larger Christian
churches in the early times were copies, more or less exact, of the
basilicas of which that of Trajan is an example.The abundance of
pillars, suitable to such an erection, that were found everywhere in
Rome, rendered their construction easy and cheap; and the wooden roof
with which they were covered was also as simple and as inexpensive a
covering as could well be designed.The very uses of the Christian
basilicas at first were by no means dissimilar to those of their heathen
originals, as they were in reality the assembly halls of the early
Christian republic, before they became liturgical churches of the
Catholic hierarchy.The more expensive construction of the bold vaults of the Maxentian
basilica went far beyond the means of the early Church, established in a
declining and abandoned capital, and this form therefore remained
dormant for seven or eight centuries before it was revived by the
mediæval architects on an infinitely smaller scale, but adorned with a
degree of appropriateness and taste to which the Romans were strangers.It was then used with a completeness and unity which entitle it to be
considered as an entirely new style of architecture.The theatre was by no means so essential a part of the economy of a
Roman city as it was of a Grecian one.With the latter it was quite as
indispensable as the temple; and in the semi-Greek city of Herculaneum
there was one, and in Pompeii two, on a scale quite equal to those of
Greece when compared with the importance of the town itself.In the
capital there appears only to have been one, that of Marcellus,[178]
built during the reign of Augustus.It it is very questionable whether
what we now see—especially the outer arcades—belong to that age, or
whether the theatre may not have been rebuilt and these arcades added at
some later period.It is so completely built over by modern houses, and
so ruined, that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any satisfactory
opinion regarding it.Its dimensions were worthy of the capital, the
audience part being a semicircle of 410 ft.in diameter, and the scena
being of great extent in proportion to the other part, which is a
characteristic of all Roman theatres, as compared with Grecian edifices
of this class.One of the most striking Roman provincial theatres is that of Orange, in
the south of France.Perhaps it owes its existence, or at all events its
splendour, to the substratum of Grecian colonists that preceded the
Romans in that country.in diameter, but much
ruined, in consequence of the Princes of Orange having used this part as
a bastion in some fortification they were constructing.It shows well the increased
extent and complication of arrangements required for the theatrical
representations of the age in which it was constructed, being a
considerable advance towards the more modern idea of a play, as
distinguished from the stately semi-religious spectacle in which the
Greeks delighted.The noblest part of the building is the great wall at
the back, an immense mass of masonry 340 ft.in
height, without a single opening above the basement, and no ornament
except a range of blank arches, about midway between the basement and
the top, and a few projecting corbels to receive the footings of the
masts that supported the velarium.Nowhere does the architecture of the
Romans shine so much as when their gigantic buildings are left to tell
their own tale by the imposing grandeur of their masses.Whenever
ornament is attempted, their bad taste comes out.The size of their
edifices, and the solidity of their construction, were only surpassed by
the Egyptians, and not always by them; and when, as here, the mass of
material heaped up stands unadorned in all its native grandeur,
criticism is disarmed, and the spectator stands awe-struck at its
majesty, and turns away convinced that truly “there were giants in those
days.” This is not, it is true, the most intellectual way of obtaining
architectural effect, but it has the advantage of being the easiest, the
most certain to secure the desired result, and at the same time the most
permanent.The deficiency of theatres erected by the Romans is far more than
compensated by the number and splendour of their amphitheatres, which,
with their baths, may be considered as the true types of Roman art,
although it is possible that they derived this class of public buildings
from the Etruscans.At Sutrium there is a very noble one cut out of the
tufa rock,[179] which was no doubt used by that people for festal
representations long before Rome attempted anything of the kind.It is
uncertain whether gladiatorial fights or combats of wild beasts formed
any part of the amusements of the arena in those days, though boxing,
wrestling, and contests of that description certainly did; but whether
the Etruscans actually proceeded to the shedding of blood and to
slaughter is more than doubtful.Even in the remotest parts of Britain, in Germany and Gaul, wherever we
find a Roman settlement, we find the traces of their amphitheatres.Their soldiery, it seems, could not exist without the enjoyment of
seeing men engaged in doubtful and mortal combats—either killing one
another, or torn to pieces by wild beasts.It is not to be wondered at
that a people who delighted so much in the bloody scenes of the arena
should feel but very little pleasure in the mimic sorrows and tame
humour of the stage.The brutal exhibition of the amphitheatre fitted
them, it is true, to be a nation of conquerors, and gave them the empire
of the world, but it brought with it feelings singularly inimical to all
the softer arts, and was perhaps the great cause of their ultimate
debasement.Elevation and Section of part of the Flavian
Amphitheatre at Rome.Quarter-plan of the Seats and quarter-plan of the
Basement of the Flavian Amphitheatre.As might be expected, the largest and most splendid of these buildings
is that which adorns the capital; and of all the ruins which Rome
contains, none have excited such universal admiration as the Flavian
Amphitheatre.Poets, painters, rhapsodists, have exhausted all the
resources of their arts in the attempt to convey to others the
overpowering impression this building produces on their own minds.With
the single exception, perhaps, of the Hall at Karnac, no ruin has met
with such universal admiration as this.Its association with the ancient
mistress of the world, its destruction, and the half-prophetic destiny
ascribed to it, all contribute to this.In spite of our better judgment
we are forced to confess that

                 “The gladiators’ bloody circus stands
                 A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,”

and worthy of all or nearly all the admiration of which it has been the
object.Its interior is almost wholly devoid of ornament, or anything
that can be called architecture—a vast inverted pyramid.The exterior
does not possess one detail which is not open to criticism, and indeed
to positive blame.Notwithstanding all this, its magnitude, its form,
and its associations, all combine to produce an effect against which the
critic struggles in vain.Still, all must admit that the pillars and
their entablature are useless and are added incongruously, and that the
upper storey, not being arched like the lower, but solid, and with ugly
pilasters, is a painful blemish.This last defect is so striking that,
in spite of the somewhat dubious evidence of medals, I should feel
inclined to suspect that it was a subsequent addition, and meant wholly
for the purpose of supporting and working the great velarium or awning
that covered the arena during the representation, which may not have
been attempted when the amphitheatre was first erected.Be this as it may, it certainly now very much mars the effect of the
building.The lower storeys are of bad design, but this is worse.But
notwithstanding these defects, there is no building of Rome where the
principle of reduplication of parts, of which the Gothic architects
afterwards made so much use, is carried to so great an extent as in
this.The Colosseum is principally indebted to this feature for the
effect which it produces.Had it, for instance, been designed with only
one storey of the height of the four now existing, and every arch had
consequently been as wide as the present four, the building would have
scarcely appeared half the size it is now seen to be.For all this,
however, when close under it, and comparing it with moving figures and
other objects, we could scarcely eventually fail to realise its
wonderful dimensions.In that case, a true sense of the vast size of the
building would have had to be acquired, as is the case with the façade
of St.Now it forces itself on the mind at the first glance.It
is the repetition of arch beyond arch and storey over storey that leads
the mind on, and gives to this amphitheatre its imposing grandeur, which
all acknowledge, though few give themselves the trouble to inquire how
this effect is produced.Fortunately, too, though the face of the building is much cut up by the
order, the entablatures are unbroken throughout, and cross the building
in long vanishing lines of the most graceful curvatures.The oval, also,
is certainly more favourable for effect than a circular form would be.A
building of this shape may perhaps look smaller than it really is to a
person standing exactly opposite either end; but in all other positions
the flatter side gives a variety and an appearance of size, which the
monotonous equality of a circle would never produce.The length of the building, measured over all along its greatest
diameter, is 620 ft., its breadth 513, or nearly in the ratio of 6 to 5,
which may be taken as the general proportion of these buildings, the
variations from it being slight, and apparently either mistakes in
setting out the work in ancient times, or in measuring it in modern
days, rather than an intentional deviation.The height of the three
lower storeys, or of what I believe to have been the original building,
is 120 ft.; the total height as it now stands is 157 ft.The whole area of
the building has been calculated to contain 250,000 square feet, of
which the arena contains 40,000; then deducting 10,000 for the external
wall, 200,000 square feet will remain available for the audience.If we
divide this by 5,[180] which is the number of square feet it has been
found necessary to allow for each spectator in modern places of
amusement, room will be afforded for 40,000 spectators; at 4 feet, which
is a possible quantity, with continuous seats and the scant drapery of
the Romans, the amphitheatre might contain 50,000 spectators at one
time.The area of the supports has also been calculated at about 40,000 square
feet, or about one-sixth of the whole area; which for an unroofed
edifice of this sort[181] is more than sufficient, though the excess
accounts for the stability of the building.Next in extent to this great metropolitan amphitheatre was that of
Capua; its dimensions were 558 ft.It had three storeys, designed similarly to those of the Colosseum, but
all of the Doric order, and used with more purity than in the Roman
example.Next in age, though not in size, is that at Nîmes, 430 ft.by 378, and
72 in height, in two storeys.Both these storeys are more profusely and
more elegantly ornamented with pillars than those of either of the
amphitheatres mentioned above.The entablature is however broken over
each column, and pediments are introduced on each front.All these
arrangements, though showing more care in design and sufficient elegance
in detail, make this building very inferior in grandeur to the two
earlier edifices, whose simplicity of outline makes up, to a great
extent, for their faults of detail.A more beautiful example than this is that at Verona.high, in three storeys beautifully
proportioned.Here the order almost entirely disappears to make way for
rustication, showing that it must be considerably more modern than
either of the three examples above quoted, though hardly so late as the
time of Maximianus, to whom it is frequently ascribed.[182] The arena of
this amphitheatre is very nearly perfect, owing to the care taken of it
during the Middle Ages, when it was often used for tournaments and other
spectacles; but of its outer architectural enclosure only four bays
remain, sufficient to enable an architect to restore the whole, but not
to allow of its effect being compared with that of more entire examples.The amphitheatre at Pola, which is of about the same age as that of
Verona, and certainly belonging to the last days of the Western Empire,
presents in its ruin a curious contrast to the other.That at Verona has
a perfect arena and only a fragment of its exterior decoration, while
the exterior of Pola is perfect, but not a trace remains of its arena,
or of the seats that surrounded it.This is probably owing to their
having been of wood, and consequently having either decayed or been
burnt.Like that at Verona, it presents all the features of the last
stage of transition; the order is still seen, or rather is everywhere
suggested, but so concealed and kept subordinate that it does not at all
interfere with the general effect.But for these faint traces we should
possess in this amphitheatre one specimen entirely emancipated from
incongruous Grecian forms, but, as before remarked, Rome perished when
just on the threshold of the new style.Elevation of the Amphitheatre at Verona.The dimensions of the amphitheatre at Pola are very nearly the same as
of that at Nîmes, being 436 ft.It has, however, three storeys,
and thus its height is considerably greater, being 97 ft.Owing to the
inequality of the ground on which it is built, the lower storey shows
the peculiarity of a sub-basement, which is very pleasingly managed, and
appears to emancipate it more from conventional forms than is the case
with its contemporary at Verona.The third storey, or attic, is also
more pleasing than elsewhere, as it is avowedly designed for the support
of the masts of the velarium.The pilasters and all Greek forms are
omitted, and there is only a groove over every column of the middle
storey to receive the masts.There is also a curious sort of open
battlement on the top, evidently designed to facilitate the working of
the awning, though in what manner is not quite clear.There is still one
other peculiarity about the building, the curvature of its lines is
broken by four projecting wings, intended apparently to contain
staircases; in a building so light and open as this one is in its
present state there can be no doubt but that the projections give
expression and character to the outline, though such additions would go
far to spoil any of the greater examples above quoted.At Otricoli there is a small amphitheatre, 312 ft.by 230, in two
storeys, from which the order has entirely disappeared; it is therefore
possibly the most modern of its class, but the great flat pilasters that
replace the pillars are ungraceful and somewhat clumsy.Perhaps its
peculiarities ought rather to be looked on as provincialisms than as
genuine specimens of an advanced style.Still there is a pleasing
simplicity about it that on a larger scale would enable it to stand
comparison with some of its greater rivals.Besides these, which are the typical examples of the style, there are
the “Castrense” at Rome, nearly circular, and possessing all the faults
and none of the beauties of the Colosseum; one at Arles, very much
ruined; and a great number of provincial ones, not only in Italy and
Gaul, but in Germany and Britain.Almost all these were principally if
not wholly excavated from the earth, the part above-ground being the
mound formed by the excavation.If they ever possessed any external
decoration to justify their being treated as architectural objects, it
has disappeared, so that in the state at least in which we now find them
they do not belong to the ornamental class of works of which we are at
present treating.Next in splendour to the amphitheatres of the Romans were their great
thermal establishments: in size they were perhaps even more remarkable,
and their erection must certainly have been more costly.The
amphitheatre, however, has the great advantage in an architectural point
of view of being one object, one hall in short, whereas the baths were
composed of a great number of smaller parts, not perhaps very
successfully grouped together.They were wholly built of brick covered
with stucco (except perhaps the pillars), and have, therefore, now so
completely lost their architectural features that it is with difficulty
that even the most practised architect can restore them to anything like
their original appearance.In speaking of the great Thermæ of Imperial Rome, they must not be
confounded with such establishments as that of Pompeii for instance.The
latter was very similar to the baths now found in Cairo or
Constantinople, and indeed in most Eastern cities.These are mere
establishments for the convenience of bathers, consisting generally of
one or two small circular or octagonal halls, covered by domes, and one
or two others of an oblong shape, covered with vaults or wooden roofs,
used as reception-rooms, or places of repose after the bath.These have
never any external magnificence beyond an entrance-porch; and although
those at Pompeii are decorated internally with taste, and are well
worthy of study, their smallness of size and inferiority of design do
not admit of their being placed in the same category as those of the
capital, which are as characteristic of Rome as her amphitheatres, and
are such as could only exist in a capital where the bulk of the people
were able to live on the spoils of the conquered world rather than by
the honest gains of their own industry.Agrippa is said to have built baths immediately behind the Pantheon, and
Palladio and others have attempted restorations of them, assuming that
building to have been the entrance-hall.Nothing, however, can be more
unlikely than that, if he had first built the rotunda as a hall of his
baths, he should afterwards have added the portico, and converted it
from its secular use into a temple dedicated to all the gods.As before remarked, the two parts are certainly not of the same age.If
Agrippa built the rotunda as a part of his baths, the portico was added
a century and a half or two centuries afterwards, and it was then
converted into a temple.If Agrippa built the portico, he added it to a
building belonging to Republican times, which may always have been
dedicated to sacred purposes.As the evidence at present stands, I am
rather inclined to believe the first hypothesis most correctly
represents the facts of the case.[183]

Nero’s baths, too, are a mere heap of shapeless ruins, and those of
Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan in like manner are too much ruined for
their form, or even their dimensions, to be ascertained with anything
like correctness.Those of Titus are more perfect, but the very
discrepancies that exist between the different systems upon which their
restoration has been attempted show that enough does not remain to
enable the task to be accomplished in a satisfactory manner.They owe
their interest more to the beautiful fresco paintings that adorn their
vaults than to their architectural character.These paintings are
invaluable, as being the most extensive and perfect relics of the
painted decoration of the most flourishing period of the Empire, and
give a higher idea of Roman art than other indications would lead us to
expect.The baths of Constantine are also nearly wholly destroyed, so that out
of the great Thermæ two only, those of Diocletian and of Caracalla, now
remain sufficiently perfect to enable a restoration to be made of them
with anything like certainty.Baths of Caracalla, as restored by A.The great hall belonging to the baths of Diocletian is now the Church of
Sta.Maria degli Angeli, and has been considerably altered to suit the
changed circumstances of its use; while the modern buildings attached to
the church have so overlaid the older remains that it is not easy to
follow out the complete plan.This is of less consequence, as both in
dimensions and plan they are extremely similar to those of Caracalla,
which seem to have been among the most magnificent, as they certainly
are the best preserved, of these establishments.[184]

The general plan of the whole enclosure of the baths of Caracalla was a
square of about 1150 ft.each way, with a bold but graceful curvilinear
projection on two sides, containing porticoes, gymnasia, lecture-rooms,
and other halls for exercise of mind or body.In the rear were the
reservoirs to contain the requisite supply of water and below them the
hypocaust or furnace, by which it was warmed with a degree of scientific
skill we hardly give the Romans of that age credit for.Opposite to this
and facing the street was one great portico extending the whole length
of the building, into which opened a range of apartments, meant
apparently to be used as private baths, which extend also some way up
each side.In front of the hypocaust, facing the north-east, was a
semicircus or _theatridium_, 530 ft.long, where youths performed their
exercises or contended for prizes.These parts were, however, merely the accessories of the establishment
surrounding the garden, in which the principal building was placed.by 380, with a projection covered by a dome on
the south-western side, which was 167 ft.There were two small courts (A A) included in the
block, but nearly the whole of the rest appears to have been roofed
over.The modern building which approaches nearest in extent to this is
probably our Parliament Houses.in length, with
an average breadth of about 300, and, with Westminster Hall, cover as
nearly as may be the same area as the central block of these baths.But
there the comparison stops; there is no building of modern times on
anything like the same scale arranged wholly for architectural effect as
this one is, irrespective of any utilitarian purpose.On the other hand,
the whole of the walls being covered with stucco, and almost all the
architecture being expressed in that material, must have detracted
considerably from the monumental grandeur of the effect.Judging,
however, from what remains of the stucco ornament of the roof of the
Maxentian basilica (Woodcut No.202), it is wonderful to observe what
effects may be obtained with even this material in the hands of a people
who understand its employment.While stone and marble have perished, the
stucco of these vaults still remains, and is as impressive as any other
relic of ancient Rome.In the centre was a great hall (B), almost identical in dimensions with
the central aisle of the basilica of Maxentius already described, being
82 ft.wide by 170 in length, and roofed in the same manner by an
intersecting vault in three compartments, springing from eight great
pillars.This opened into a smaller apartment at each end, of
rectangular form, and then again into two other semicircular halls
forming a splendid suite 460 ft.This central room is
generally considered as the _tepidarium_, or warmed apartment, having
four warm baths opening out of it.On the north-east side was the
frigidarium, or cold water bath, a hall[185] of nearly the same
dimensions as the central Hall.Between this and the circular hall (D)
was the sudatorium or sweating-bath, with a hypocaust underneath, and
flue-tiles lining its walls.The laconicum or caldarium (D) is an
immense circular hall, 116 ft.in diameter, also heated by a hypocaust
underneath, and by flue tiles in the walls.This rotunda is said to be
of later date than Caracalla.There are four other rooms on this side,
which seem also to have been cold baths.None of these points have,
however, yet been satisfactorily settled, nor the uses of the smaller
subordinate rooms; every restorer giving them names according to his own
ideas.For our purpose it suffices to know that no groups of state
apartments in such dimensions, and wholly devoted to purposes of display
and recreation, were ever before or since grouped together under one
roof.The taste of many of the decorations would no doubt be faulty, and
the architecture shows those incongruities inseparable from its state of
transition; but such a collection of stately halls must have made up a
whole of greater splendour than we can easily realise from their bare
and weather-beaten ruins, or from anything else to which we can compare
them.Even allowing for their being almost wholly built of brick, and
for their being disfigured by the bad taste inseparable from everything
Roman, there is nothing in the world which for size and grandeur can
compare with these imperial places of recreation.[186]




                               CHAPTER V.

             TRIUMPHAL ARCHES, TOMBS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS.Arches at Rome; in France—Arch at Trèves—Columns of
  Victory—Tombs—Minerva Medica—Provincial tombs—Eastern tombs—Domestic
  architecture—Spalato—Pompeii—Bridges—Aqueducts.Triumphal Arches were among the most peculiar of the various forms of
art which the Romans borrowed from those around them, and used with that
strange mixture of splendour and bad taste which characterises all their
works.(From a plate in
Gailhabaud’s ‘Architecture.’)]

These were in the first instance no doubt borrowed from the Etruscans,
as was also the ceremony of the triumph with which they were ultimately
associated.At first they seem rather to have been used as festal
entrances to the great public roads, the construction of which was
considered one of the most important benefits a ruler could confer upon
his country.There was one erected at Rimini in honour of an important
restoration of the Flaminian way by Augustus; another at Susa in
Piedmont, to commemorate a similar act of the same Emperor.Trajan built
one on the pier at Ancona, when he restored that harbour, and another at
Beneventum, when he repaired the Via Appia, represented in the preceding
woodcut (No.It is one of the best preserved as well as most
graceful of its class in Italy.The Arch of the Sergii at Pola in Istria
seems also to have been erected for a like purpose.That of Hadrian at
Athens, and another built by him at Antinoë in Egypt, were monuments
merely commemorative of the benefits which he had conferred on those
cities by the architectural works he had erected within their walls.By
far the most important application of these gateways, in Rome at least,
was to commemorate a triumph which may have passed along the road over
which the arch was erected, and perhaps in some instances they may have
been erected beforehand, for the triumphal procession to pass through,
and of which they would remain memorials.The Arch of Titus at Rome is well known for the beauty of its detail, as
well as from the extraordinary interest which it derives from having
been erected to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem, and consequently
representing in its bassi-rilievi the spoils of the Temple.From the
annexed elevation, drawn to the usual scale, it will be seen that the
building is not large, and it is not so well proportioned as that at
Beneventum, represented in the preceding woodcut, the attic being
overpoweringly high.The absence of sculpture on each side of the arch
is also a defect, for the real merit of these buildings is their being
used as frameworks for the exhibition of sculptural representations of
the deeds they were erected to commemorate.In the later days of the Empire two side arches were added for
foot-passengers, in addition to the carriage-way in the centre.This
added much to the splendour of the edifice, and gave a greater
opportunity for sculptural decoration than the single arch afforded.The
Arch of Septimius Severus, represented to the same scale in Woodcut No.217, is perhaps the best specimen of the class.That of Constantine is
very similar and in most respects equal to this—a merit which it owes to
most of its sculptures being borrowed from earlier monuments.More splendid than either of these is the Arch at Orange.It is not
known by whom it was erected, or even in what age: it is, however,
certainly very late in the Roman period, and shows a strong tendency to
treat the order as entirely subordinate, and to exalt the plain masses
into that importance which characterises the late transitional period.Unfortunately its sculptures are so much destroyed by time and violence
that it is not easy to speak with certainty as to their age; but more
might be done than has hitherto been effected to illustrate this
important monument.At Rheims there is an arch which was probably much more magnificent than
this.When in a perfect state it was 110 ft.in width, and had three
openings, the central one 17 ft.high, and those on each
side 10 ft.in width, each separated by two Corinthian columns.From the
style of the sculpture it certainly was of the last age of the Roman
Empire, but having been built into the walls of the city, it has been so
much injured that it is difficult to say what its original form may have
been.Besides these there is in France a very elegant single-arched gateway at
St.Rémi, similar to and probably of the same age as that at Beneventum;
another at Cavallon, and one at Carpentras, each with one arch.There is
also one with two similar arches at Langres; and one, the Porta Nigra,
at Besançon, which shows so complete a transition from the Roman style
that it is difficult to believe that it does not belong to the
Renaissance.[187] (From Laborde’s
‘Monumens de la France.’)]

There still remains in France another class of arches, certainly not
triumphal, but so similar to those just mentioned that it is difficult
to separate the one from the other.The most important of these are two
at Autun, called respectively the Porte Arroux and the Porte St.André,
a view of which is given in Woodcut No.Each of these has two
central large archways for carriages, and one on each side for
foot-passengers.Their most remarkable peculiarity is the light arcade
or gallery that runs across the top of them, replacing the attic of the
Roman arch, and giving a degree of lightness combined with height that
those never possessed.These gates were certainly not meant for defence,
and the apartment over them could scarcely be applied to utilitarian
purposes; so that we may, I believe, consider it as a mere ornamental
appendage, or as a balcony for display on festal occasions.It appears,
however, to offer a better hint for modern arch-builders than any other
example of its class.Plan of Porta Nigra at Trèves.View of the Porta Nigra at Trèves.]Even more interesting than these gates at Autun is that called the Porta
Nigra at Trèves; for though far ruder in style and coarser in detail, as
might be expected from the remoteness of the province where it is found,
it is far more complete.Indeed it is the only example of its class
which we possess in anything like its original state.Its front consists
of a double archway surmounted by an arcaded gallery, like the French
examples.Within this is a rectangular court which seems never to have
been roofed, and beyond this a second double archway similar to the
first.At the ends of the court, projecting each way beyond the face of
the gateway and the gallery surmounting it, are two wings four storeys
in height, containing a series of apartments in the form of small
basilicas, all similar to one another, and measuring about 55 ft.It is not easy to understand how these were approached, as there is no
stair and no place for one.Of course there must have been some mode of
access, and perhaps it may have been on the site of the apse, shown in
the plan (Woodcut No.219), which was added when the building was
converted into a church in the Middle Ages.These apartments were
probably originally used as courts or chambers of justice, thus
realising, more nearly than any other European example I am acquainted
with, the idea of a gate of justice.Notwithstanding its defects of detail, there is a variety in the outline
of this building and a boldness of profile that render it an extremely
pleasing example of the style adopted; and though exhibiting many of the
faults incidental to the design of the Colosseum, it possesses all that
repetition of parts and Gothic feeling of design which give such value
to its dimensions, though these are far from being contemptible, the
building being 115 ft.wide by 95 in height to the top of the wings.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There probably were many similar gates of justice in the province, but
all have perished, unless we except those at Autun just described.I am
convinced that at that place there were originally such wings as these
at Trèves, and that the small church, the apse of which is seen on the
right hand (woodcut No.220), stands upon the foundations of one of
these.A slight excavation on the opposite side would settle this point
at once.If it could be proved that these gateways at Autun had such
lateral adjuncts, it would at once explain the use of the gallery over
the arch, which otherwise looks so unmeaning, but would be intelligible
as a passage connecting the two wings together.Another form also is that of an arch at the entrance of a bridge,
generally bearing an inscription commemorative of its building.Its
purpose is thus closely connected with that of the arches before
mentioned, which commemorate the execution of roads.Most of the great
bridges of Italy and Spain were so adorned; but unfortunately they have
either been used as fortifications in the Middle Ages, or removed in
modern times to make room for the increased circulation of traffic.That
built by Trajan on his noble bridge at Alcantara in Spain is well known;
and there exists a double-arched bridge at Saintes, in the south of
France.The most elegant and most perfect specimen, however, of this
class is that of St.Chamas in Provence, represented in woodcut No.It consists of two arches, one at each end of the bridge, of singular
elegance of form and detail.Although it bears a still legible
inscription, it is uncertain to what age it belongs, probably that of
the Antonines: and I would account for the purity of its details by
referring to the Greek element that pervades the south of France.Whether this is so or not, it is impossible not to admire not only the
design of the whole bridge with its two arches, but the elegance with
which the details have been executed.Used in this mode as commencements of roads, or entrances to bridges, or
as festal entrances to unfortified towns, there are perhaps no monuments
of the second class more appropriate or more capable of architectural
expression than these arches, though all of them have been more or less
spoiled by an incongruous order being applied to them.Used, however, as
they were in Rome, as monuments of victory, without offering even an
excuse for a passage through them, the taste displayed in them is more
than questionable: the manner, too, in which they were cut up by broken
cornices and useless columns placed on tall pedestals, with other
trivial details highly objectionable, deprive them of that largeness of
design which is the only true merit and peculiar characteristic of Roman
art, while that exquisite elegance with which the Greeks knew so well
how to dignify even the most trivial objects was in them almost entirely
lost.Columns of Victory are a class of monuments which seem to have been used
in the East in very early times, though their history it must be
confessed is somewhat fragmentary and uncertain, and they seem to have
been adopted by the Romans in those provinces where they had been
employed by the earlier inhabitants.Whatever the original may have
been, the Romans were singularly unsuccessful in their application of
the form.They never, in fact, rose above the idea of taking a column of
construction, magnifying it, and placing it on a pedestal, without any
attempt to modify its details or hide the original utilitarian purpose
for which the column was designed.When they attempted more than this,
they failed entirely in elaborating any new form at all worthy of
admiration.The Columna Rostrata, or that erected to celebrate naval
victories, was, so far as we can judge from representations (for no
perfect specimen exists), one of the ugliest and clumsiest forms of
column it is possible to conceive.Of those of Victory, one of the most celebrated is that erected by
Diocletian at Alexandria.A somewhat similar one exists at Arsinoë,
erected by Alexander Severus; and a third at Mylassa in Caria.All these
are mere Corinthian columns of the usual form, and with the details of
those used to support entablatures in porticoes.However beautiful these
may be in their proper place, they are singularly inappropriate and
ungraceful when used as minarets or single columns.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There are two in Rome not quite so bad as these, both being of the Doric
order.Had the square abacus in these been cut to a round form, and
ornamented with an appropriate railing, we might almost have forgotten
their original, and have fancied that they really were round towers with
balconies at the top.The great object of their erection was to serve as
vehicles for sculpture, though, as we now see them, or as they are
caricatured at Paris and elsewhere, they are little more than instances
of immense labour bestowed to very little purpose.As originally used,
these columns were placed in small courts surrounded by open porticoes,
whence the spectator could at two or perhaps at three different levels
examine the sculpture at his leisure and at a convenient distance, while
the absurdity of the column supporting nothing was not apparent, from
its not being seen from the outside.This arrangement is explained in
woodcut No.200, which is a section through the basilica of Trajan,
showing the position of his column, not only with reference to that
building, but to the surrounding colonnade.The same was almost
certainly the case with the column of Marcus Aurelius, which, with
slight modifications, seems to have been copied from that of Trajan; but
even in the most favourable situations no monuments can be less worthy
of admiration or of being copied than these.A far better specimen of this class is that at Cussi, near Beaune, in
France.It probably belongs to the time of Aurelian, but it is not known
either by whom it was erected or what victory it was designed to
celebrate; still that it is a column of victory seems undoubted; and its
resemblance to columns raised with the same object in India is quite
striking.The arrangement of the base serving as a pedestal for eight statues is
not only elegant but appropriate.The ornament which covers the shaft
takes off from the idea of its being a mere pillar, and at the same time
is so subdued as not to break the outline or interfere with constructive
propriety.Supposed Capital of Column at Cussi.]The capital, of the Corinthian order, is found in the neighbourhood used
as the mouth of a well.In its original position it no doubt had a hole
through it, which being enlarged suggested its application to its
present ignoble purpose, the hole being no doubt intended either to
receive or support the statue or emblem that originally crowned the
monument, but of that no trace now remains.John went to the bedroom.There cannot be a more natural mode of monumental expression than that
of a simple upright stone set up by the victors to commemorate their
prowess and success.Accordingly steles or pillars erected for this
purpose are found everywhere, and take shapes as various as the
countries where they stand or the people who erected them.In Northern
Europe they are known as Cath or battle-stones, and as rude unhewn
monoliths are found everywhere.In India they are as elegant and as
elaborately adorned as the Kutub Minar at Delhi, but nowhere was their
true architectural expression so mistaken as in Rome.There, by
perverting a feature designed for one purpose to a totally different
use, an example of bad taste was given till then unknown, though in our
days it has become not uncommon.In that strange collection of the styles of all nations which mingled
together makes up the sum of Roman art, nothing strikes the
architectural student with more astonishment than the number and
importance of their tombs.If the Romans are of Aryan origin, as is
generally assumed, they are the only people of that race among whom
tomb-building was not utterly neglected.The importance of the tombs
among the Roman remains proves one of two things.Either a considerable
proportion of Etruscan blood was mixed up with that of the dominant race
in Rome, or that the fierce and inartistic Romans, having no art of
their own, were led blindly to copy that of the people among whom they
were located.Of the tombs of Consular Rome nothing remains except perhaps the
sarcophagus of Scipio; and it is only on the eve of the Empire that we
meet with the well-known one of Cæcilia Metella, the wife of Crassus,
which is not only the best specimen of a Roman tomb now remaining to us,
but the oldest architectural building of the imperial city of which we
have an authentic date.It consists of a bold square basement about 100
ft.square, which was originally ornamented in some manner not now
intelligible.From this rose a circular tower about 94 ft.in diameter,
of very bold masonry, surmounted by a frieze of ox-skulls with wreaths
joining them, and a well-profiled cornice: two or three courses of
masonry above this seem to have belonged to the original work; and above
this, almost certainly, in the original design rose a conical roof,
which has perished.The tower having been used as a fortress in the
Middle Ages, battlements have been added to supply the place of the
roof, and it has been otherwise disfigured, so as to detract much from
its beauty as now seen.Still we have no tomb of the same importance so
perfect, nor one which enables us to connect the Roman tombs so nearly
with the Etruscan.The only addition in this instance is that of the
square basement or podium, though even this was not unknown at a much
earlier period, as for instance in the tomb of Aruns (Woodcut No.The exaggerated height of the circular base is also remarkable.Here it
rises to be a tower instead of a mere circular base of stones for the
earthen cone of the original sepulchre.The stone roof which probably
surmounted the tower was a mere reproduction of the original earthen
cone.Tomb of Cæcilia Metella.]Next in age and importance was the tomb of Augustus in the Campus
Martius.It is now so completely ruined that it is extremely difficult
to make out its plan, and those who drew and restored it in former days
were so careless in their measurements that even its dimensions cannot
be ascertained; it appears, however, to have consisted of a circular
basement about 300 ft.in height, adorned
with 12 large niches.Above this rose a cone of earth as in the Etruscan
tombs, not smooth like those, but divided into terraces, which were
planted with trees.We also learn from Suetonius that Augustus laid out
the grounds around his tomb and planted them with gardens for public use
during his lifetime.More like the practice of a true Mogul in the East
than the ruler of an Indo-Germanic people in Europe.This tomb, however, was far surpassed, not only in solidity but in
splendour, by that which Hadrian erected for himself on the banks of the
Tiber, now known as the Mole of Hadrian, or more frequently the Castle
of St.The basement of this great tomb was a square, about 340
ft.Above this rose a circular tower 235
ft.The whole was crowned either by a
dome or by a conical roof in steps, which, with its central ornament,
must have risen to a height of not less than 300 ft.The circular or
tower-like part of this splendid building was ornamented with columns,
but in what manner restorers have not been quite able to agree; some
making two storeys, both with pillars, some, one of pillars and the
upper one of pilasters.It would require more correct measurements than
we have to enable us to settle this point, but it seems probable that
there was only one range of columns on a circular basement of some
height surmounted by an attic of at least equal dimensions.The order
might have been 70 ft., the base and attic 35 ft.Internally the mass was nearly solid, there being only one sepulchral
apartment, as nearly as may be in the centre of the mass, approached by
an inclined plane, winding round the whole building, from the entrance
in the centre of the river face.Besides these there was another class of tombs in Rome, called
columbaria, generally oblong or square rooms below the level of the
ground, the walls of which were pierced with a great number of little
pigeon-holes or cells just of sufficient size to receive an urn
containing the ashes of the body, which had been burnt according to the
usual Roman mode of disposing of the dead.Externally of course they had
no architecture, though some of the more important family sepulchres of
this class were adorned internally with pilasters and painted ornaments
of considerable beauty.In the earlier ages of the Roman Empire these two forms of tombs
characterised with sufficient clearness the two races, each with their
distinctive customs, which made up the population of Rome.Long before
its expiration the two were fused together so thoroughly that we lose
all trace of the distinction, and a new form of tomb arose compounded of
the two older, which became the typical form with the early Christians,
and from them passed to the Saracens and other Eastern nations.The new form of tomb retained externally the circular form of the
Pelasgic sepulchre, though constructive necessities afterwards caused it
to become polygonal.Instead however of being solid, or nearly so, the
walls were only so thick as was necessary to support the dome, which
became the universal form of roof of these buildings.The sepulchres of Rome have as yet been far too carelessly examined to
enable us to trace all the steps by which the transformation took place,
but as a general rule it may be stated that the gradual enlargement of
the central circular apartment is almost a certain test of the age of a
tomb; till at last, before the age of Constantine, they became in fact
representations of the Pantheon on a small scale, almost always with a
crypt or circular vault below the principal apartment.Section of Sepulchre at San Vito.One of the most curious transitional specimens is that found near San
Vito, represented in Woodcut No.Here, as in all the earlier
specimens, the principal apartment is the lower, in the square basement.The upper, which has lost its decoration, has the appearance of having
been hollowed out of the frustum of a gigantic Doric column, or rather
out of a solid tower like the central one of the Tomb of Aruns (Woodcut
No.Shortly after the age of this sepulchre the lower apartment
became a mere crypt, and in such examples as those of the sepulchres of
the Cornelia and Tossia families we have merely miniature Pantheons
somewhat taller in proportion, and with a crypt.This is still more
remarkable in a building called the Torre dei Schiavi, which has had a
portico attached to one side, and in other respects looks very like a
direct imitation of that celebrated temple.It seems certainly, however,
to have been built for a tomb.Another tomb, very similar to that of the Tossia family, is called that
of Sta.If it is not hers, it belongs
at any rate to the last days of the Empire, and may be taken as a fair
specimen of the tombs of that age and class.It is a vast transition
from the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, though, like all the changes
introduced by the Romans, it shows the never-failing tendency to
transfer all architectural embellishments from the exterior to the
interior of every style of building.On
this stands a circular tower in two storeys.In the lower storey is a
circular apartment about 66 ft.in diameter, surrounded by eight niches;
in the upper the niches are external, and each is pierced with a window.The dimensions of the tomb are nearly the same as those of Cæcilia
Metella, and it thus affords an excellent opportunity of comparing the
two extremes of the series, and of contrasting the early Roman with the
early Christian tomb.The typical example of a sepulchre of this age is the tomb or baptistery
of Sta.Costanza, the daughter of Constantine (Woodcut No.In this
building the pillars that adorned the exterior of such a mausoleum, for
instance, as that of Hadrian, are introduced internally.Externally the
building never can have had much ornament.But the breaks between the
lower aisle and the central compartment, pierced with the clerestory,
must have had a very pleasing effect.In this example there is still
shown a certain degree of timidity, which does not afterwards reappear.The columns are coupled and are far more numerous than they need have
been, and are united by a fragment of an entablature, as if the
architect had been afraid to place his vault directly on the capitals.Notwithstanding these defects, it is a pleasing and singularly
instructive example of a completed transformation, and is just what we
miss in those secular buildings for which the Christians had no use.Another building, which is now known as the Lateran Baptistery (Woodcut
No.422), was also undoubtedly a place of sepulture.Its erection is
generally ascribed to Constantine, and it is said was intended by him to
be the place of his own sepulture.Whether this is correct or not, it
certainly belongs to his age, and exhibits all the characteristics of
the architecture of his time.Here the central apartment, never having
been designed to support a dome, is of a far lighter construction, an
upper order of pillars being placed on the lower, with merely a slight
architrave and frieze running between the two orders, the external walls
being slight in construction and octagonal in plan.[188] We must not in
this place pursue any further the subject of the transition of style, as
we have already trespassed within the pale of Christian architecture and
passed beyond the limits of Heathen art.So gradual, however, was the
change, and so long in preparation, that it is impossible to draw the
line exactly where the separation actually took place between the two.TEMPLE OF MINERVA MEDICA.One important building remains to be mentioned before leaving this part
of the subject.It commonly goes by the name of the Temple of Minerva
Medica, though this is certainly a misnomer.[189] Recently it has become
the fashion to assume that it was the hall of some bath; no building of
that class, however, was known to exist in the neighbourhood, and it is
extremely improbable that any should be found outside the Servian walls
in this direction; moreover, it is wanting in all the necessary
accompaniments of such an establishment.It is here placed with the tombs, because its site is one that would
justify its being so classed, and its form being just such as would be
applicable to that purpose and to no other.It is not by any means
certain, however, that it is a tomb, though there does not seem to be
any more probable supposition.It certainly belongs to the last days of
the Roman Empire, if indeed it be not a Christian building, which I am
very much inclined to believe it is, for, on comparing it with the
Baptistery of Constantine and the tomb of Sta.Costanza, it shows a
considerable advance in construction on both these buildings, and a
greater similarity to San Vitale at Ravenna, and other buildings of
Justinian’s time, than to anything else now found in Rome.As will be seen from the plan and section (Woodcuts Nos.228 and 229),
it has a dome, 80 ft.in diameter, resting on a decagon of singularly
light and elegant construction.Nine of the compartments contain niches
which give great room on the floor, as well as great variety and
lightness to the general design.Above this is a clerestory of ten
well-proportioned windows, which give light to the building, perhaps not
in so effective a manner as the one eye of the Pantheon, though by a far
more convenient arrangement, to protect from the elements a people who
did not possess glass.So far as I know, all the domed buildings erected
by the Romans up to the time of Constantine, and indeed long afterwards,
were circular in the interior, though, like the temple built by
Diocletian at Spalato, they were sometimes octagonal externally.This,
however, is a Polygon both internally and on the outside, and the mode
in which the dome is placed on the polygon shows the first rudiments of
the pendentive system, which was afterwards carried to such perfection
by the Byzantine architects, but is nowhere else to be found in Rome.It
probably was for the purpose of somewhat diminishing the difficulties of
this construction that the architect adopted a figure with ten instead
of eight sides.Plan of Minerva Medica at Rome, as restored in
Isabelle’s ‘Édifices Circulaires,’ on the theory of its being a Bath.Section of Minerva Medica (from Isabelle.)Rib of the Roof of the Minerva Medica at Rome.]This, too, is, I believe, the first building in which buttresses are
applied so as to give strength to the walls exactly at the point where
it is most wanted.By this arrangement the architect was enabled to
dispense with nearly one-half the quantity of material that was thought
necessary when the dome of the Pantheon was constructed, and which he
must have employed had he copied that building.Besides this, the dome
was ribbed with tiles, as shown in Woodcut No.230, and the space
between the ribs filled in with inferior, perhaps lighter masonry,
bonded together at certain heights by horizontal courses of tiles where
necessary.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

Besides the lightness and variety which the base of this building
derives from the niches, it is 10 ft.higher than its diameter, which
gives to it that proportion of height to width, the want of which is the
principal defect of the Pantheon.It is not known what the side
erections are which are usually shown in the ground-plans, nor even
whether they are coeval with the main central edifice.I suspect they
have never been very correctly laid down.Taking it altogether, the building is certainly, both as concerns
construction and proportion, by far the most scientific of all those in
ancient Rome, and in these respects as far superior to the Pantheon as
it is inferior to that temple in size.Indeed there are few inventions
of the Middle Ages that are not attempted here or in the Temple of
Peace—but more in this than in the latter; so much so, indeed, that I
cannot help believing that it is much more modern than is generally
supposed.As might be expected from our knowledge of the race that inhabited the
European provinces of the Roman Empire, there are very few specimens of
tombs of any importance to be found in them.One very beautiful example
exists at St.Rémi, represented in the annexed woodcut (No.It can
hardly, however, be correctly called a tomb, but is rather a cenotaph or
a monument, erected as the inscription on it tells us, by Sextus and
Marcus, of the family of the Julii, to their parents, whose statues
appear under the dome of the upper storey.There is nothing funereal
either in the inscription or the form, nor anything to lead us to
suppose that the bodies of the parents repose beneath its foundation.The lower portion of this monument is the square basement which the
Romans always added to the Etruscan form of tomb.Upon this stands a
storey pierced with an archway in each face, with a three-quarter pillar
of the Corinthian order at every angle.The highest part is a circular
colonnade, a miniature copy of that which we know to have once encircled
Hadrian’s Mole.The open arrangement of the arches and colonnade, while it takes off
considerably from the tomb-like simplicity appropriate to such
buildings, adds very much to the lightness and elegance of the whole.Altogether the building has much more of the aspiring character of
Christian art than of the more solid and horizontal forms which were
characteristic of the style then dying out.Another monument of very singular and exceptional form is found at Igel,
near Trèves, in Germany.It is so unlike anything found in Italy, or
indeed anything of the Roman age, that were its date not perfectly known
from the inscription upon it, one might rather be inclined to ascribe it
to the age of Francis I. than to the latter days of the Roman Empire.The form is graceful, though the pilasters and architectural ornaments
seem somewhat misplaced.It is covered with sculptures from top to
bottom.These, however, as is generally the case with Roman funereal
monuments, have no reference to death, nor to the life or actions of the
person to whom the monument is sacred, but are more like the scenes
painted on a wall or ornamental stele anywhere.The principal object on
the face represented in the woodcut is the sun, but the subjects are
varied on each face, and, though much time-worn, they still give a very
perfect idea of the rich ornamentation of the monuments of the last age
of the Empire.Monument at Igel, near Trèves.(From Schmidt’s
‘Antiquities of Trèves.’)]

The Tour Magne at Nîmes is too important a monument to be passed over,
though in its present ruined state it is almost more difficult to
explain than any other Roman remains that have reached our times.It
consists of an octagonal tower 50 ft.The basement is extended beyond this tower on every side by a
series of arches supporting a terrace to which access was obtained by an
external flight of steps, or rather an inclined plane.From the marks in
the walls it seems evident that this terrace originally supported a
peristyle, or, possibly, a range of chambers.Within the basement is a
great chamber covered by a dome of rubble masonry, to which no access
could be obtained from without, but the interior may have been reached
through the eye of the dome.From the terrace an important flight of
steps led upwards to—what?It is almost impossible to refrain from
answering, to a cella, like those which crowned the tomb temples of
Assyria.That the main object of the building was sepulchral seems
hardly doubtful, but we have no other instance in Europe of a tomb with
such a staircase leading to a chamber above it.That Marseilles was a Phœnician and then a Phocian colony long before
Roman times seems generally to be admitted, and that in the Temple of
Diana (Woodcuts Nos.188 and 189) and in this building there is an
Etruscan or Eastern element which can hardly be mistaken, and may lead
to very important ethnographical indications when more fully
investigated and better understood.This scarcity of tombs in the western part of the Roman Empire is to a
great extent made up for in the East; but the history of those erected
under the Roman rule in that part of the world is as yet so little known
that it is not easy either to classify or to describe them; and as
nearly all those which have been preserved are cut in the rock, it is
sometimes difficult—as with other rock-cut objects all over the world—to
understand the form of building from which they were copied.The three principal groups of tombs of the Roman epoch are those of
Petra, Cyrene, and Jerusalem.Though many other important tombs exist in
those countries, they are so little known that they must be passed over
for the present.From the time when Abraham was laid in the cave of Machpelah until after
the Christian era, we know that burying in the rock was not the
exception but the general practice among the nations of this part of the
East.So far as can be known, the example was set by Egypt, which was
the parent of much of their civilisation.In Egypt the façades of their
rock-cut tombs were—with the solitary exception of those of Beni
Hasan[190]—ornamented so simply and unobtrusively as rather to belie
than to announce their internal magnificence.All the oldest Asiatic
tombs seem to have been mere holes in the rock, wholly without
architectural decorations.(From Laborde’s ‘Petra and Mount Sinai.’)]

We have seen, however, how the Persian kings copied their palace façades
to adorn their last resting-places, and how about the same time in Lycia
the tomb-builders copied, first their own wooden structures, and
afterwards the architectural façades which they had learned from the
Greeks how to construct.But it was not till the Roman period that this
species of magnificence extended to the places enumerated above; when to
such an extent did it prevail at Petra as to give to that now deserted
valley the appearance of a petrified city of the dead.The typical and most beautiful tomb of this place is that called the
Khasné or Treasury of Pharaoh—represented in elevation and section in
the annexed woodcuts, Nos.As will be seen, it consists of
a square basement, adorned with a portico of four very beautiful
Corinthian pillars, surmounted by a pediment of low Grecian pitch.Above
this are three very singular turrets, the use and application of which
it is extremely difficult to understand.The central one is circular,
and is of a well-understood sepulchral form, the use of which, had it
been more important, or had it stood alone, would have been intelligible
enough; but what are the side turrets?If one might hazard so bold a
conjecture, I would suggest that the original from which this is derived
was a five-turreted tomb, like that of Aruns (Woodcut No.176), or that
of Alyattes at Sardis, which in course of time became translated into so
foreign a shape as this; but where are the intermediate forms?and by
whom and when was this change effected?Before forming any theories on
this subject, it will be well to consider whether all these buildings
really are tombs.Most of them undoubtedly are so; but may not the name
_el Deir_, or the Convent, applied by the Arabs to one of the principal
rock-cut monuments of Petra, be after all the true designation?Are none
of them, in short, cells for priests, like the _viharas_ found in India?All who have hitherto visited these spots have assumed at once that
everything cut in the rock must be a tomb, but I am much mistaken if
this is really the case with all.(From Laborde’s ‘Mount
Sinai,’ p.To return, however, to the Khasné.Though all the forms of the
architecture are Roman, the details are so elegant and generally so well
designed as almost to lead to the suspicion that there must have been
some Grecian influence brought to bear upon the work.The masses of rock
left above the wings show how early a specimen of its class it is, and
how little practice its designers could have had in copying in the rock
the forms of their regular buildings.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’ p.A little further within the city is found another very similar in design
to this, but far inferior to it in detail and execution, and showing at
least a century of degradation, though at the same time presenting an
adaptation to rock-cut forms not found in the earlier examples.A third is that above alluded to, called _el Deir_.This is the same in
general outline as the two former—of an order neither Greek nor Roman,
but with something like a Doric frieze over a very plain Corinthian
capital.In other respects it presents no new feature except the
apparent absence of a door, and on the whole it seems, if finished, to
deserve its name less than either of the other two.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’
p.Perhaps the most singular object among these tombs, if tombs they are,
is the flat façade with three storeys of pillars one over the
other—slightly indicated on the left of the Corinthian tomb in Woodcut
No.It is like the proscenium of some of the more recent Greek
theatres.If it was really the frontispiece to a tomb, it was totally
unsuitable to the purpose, and is certainly one of the most complete
misapplications of Greek architecture ever made.Generally speaking, the interiors of these buildings are so plain that
travellers have not cared either to draw or measure them; one, however,
represented in the annexed woodcut (No.236), is richly ornamented, and,
as far as can be judged from what is published, is as unlike a tomb as
it is like a _vihara_.But, as before remarked, they all require
re-examination before the purpose for which they were cut can be
pronounced upon with any certainty.Façade of Herod’s Tombs, from a Photograph.]The next group of tombs is that at Jerusalem.These are undoubtedly all
sepulchres.By far the greater number of them are wholly devoid of
architectural ornament.To the north of the city is a group known as the
Tombs of the Kings, with a façade of a corrupt Doric order, similar to
some of the latest Etruscan tombs.[191] These are now very much ruined,
but still retain sufficient traces of the original design to fix their
date within or subsequently to the Herodian period without much
possibility of doubt.A somewhat similar façade, but of a form more like
the Greek Doric, found in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, bears the name of
the Sepulchre of St.So-called “Tomb of Zechariah.”]

Close to this is a square tomb, known as that of Zechariah, cut in the
rock, but standing free.Each face is adorned with Ionic pillars and
square piers at the angles, the whole being crowned with a pyramidal
roof.Perhaps this building should properly be called a cenotaph, as it
is perfectly solid, and no cave or sepulchral vault has been found
beneath it, though judging from analogies one might yet be found if
properly looked for.A tomb with an architectural façade, similar to
that of the so-called Tomb of the Judges, does exist behind it cut in
rock, and is consequently of more modern construction.It may be to mark
this that the architectural monolith was left.Close to this is another identical with it in as far as the basement is
concerned, and which is now popularly known as the Tomb of Absalom; but
in this instance the pyramid has been replaced with a structural spire,
and it is probable when this was done that the chamber which now exists
in its interior was excavated.The so-called Tomb of Absalom.]One of the remarkable points in these tombs is the curious jumble of the
Roman orders which they present.The pillars and pilasters are Ionic,
the architraves and frieze Doric, and the cornice Egyptian.The capitals
and frieze are so distinctly late Roman, that we can feel no hesitation
as to their date being either of the age of Herod or subsequent to that
time.In an architectural point of view the cornice is too plain to be
pleasing if not painted; it probably therefore was so treated.Another class of these tombs is represented by the so-called Tomb of the
Judges (Woodcut No.These are ornamented by a tympanum of a Greek
or Roman temple filled with a scroll-work of rich but debased pattern,
and is evidently derived from something similar, though Grecian in
design.In age it is certainly more recent than the so-called Tomb of
Zechariah, as one of precisely similar design is found cut into the face
of the rock out of which that monument was excavated.Façade of the Tomb of the Judges.]The third group is that of Cyrene, on the African coast.Sandra moved to the bathroom.Notwithstanding
the researches of Admiral Beechey and of M. Pacho,[192] and the still
more recent explorations of Messrs.Smith and Porcher, above referred to
(p.285), they are still much less perfectly known to us than they
should be.Their number is immense, and they almost all have
architectural façades, generally consisting of two or more columns
between pilasters, like the grottoes of Beni-Hasan, or the Tomb of St.Many of them show powerful evidence of Greek taste,
while some may be as old as the Grecian era, though the greater part are
undoubtedly of Roman date, and the paintings with which many of them are
still adorned are certainly Roman in design.Two of them are illustrated
by Woodcuts Nos.165 and 166: one as showing more distinct evidence of
Greek taste and colour than is to be found elsewhere, though it is
doubtful if it belongs to the Grecian period any more than the so-called
Tomb of St.James at Jerusalem; the other, though of equally uncertain
date, is interesting as being a circular monument built over a cave like
that at Amrith (Woodcut No.122), and is the only other example now
known.None of them have such splendid architectural façades as the
Khasné at Petra; but the number of tombs which are adorned with
architectural features is greater than in that city, and, grouped as
they are together in terraces on the hill-side, they constitute a
necropolis which is among the most striking of the ancient world.Altogether this group, though somewhat resembling that at Castel d’Asso,
is more extensive and far richer in external architecture.[193]


Time has not left us any perfect structural tombs in all these places,
though there can be little doubt but they were once numerous.Almost the
only tomb of this class constructed in masonry known to exist, and which
in many respects is perhaps the most interesting of all, is found in
Asia Minor,
