What if the young chief
should make the safety of the father depend on the favour of the
daughter?He distrusted not Catharine's affections, but then her mode
of thinking was so disinterested, and her attachment to her father so
tender, that, if the love she bore her suitor was weighed against his
security, or perhaps his life, it was matter of deep and awful doubt
whether it might not be found light in the balance.Tormented by
thoughts on which we need not dwell, he resolved nevertheless to
remain at home, stifle his anxiety as he might, and await the promised
intelligence from the old man.It came, but it did not relieve his
concern.Sir Patrick Charteris had not forgotten his promise to communicate to
the smith the plans of the fugitives.But, amid the bustle occasioned by
the movement of troops, he could not himself convey the intelligence.He therefore entrusted to his agent, Kitt Henshaw, the task of making it
known.But this worthy person, as the reader knows, was in the interest
of Ramorny, whose business it was to conceal from every one, but
especially from a lover so active and daring as Henry, the real place of
Catharine's residence.Henshaw therefore announced to the anxious smith
that his friend the glover was secure in the Highlands; and though he
affected to be more reserved on the subject of Catharine, he said little
to contradict the belief that she as well as Simon shared the protection
of the Clan Quhele.But he reiterated, in the name of Sir Patrick,
assurances that father and daughter were both well, and that Henry would
best consult his own interest and their safety by remaining quiet and
waiting the course of events.With an agonized heart, therefore, Henry Gow determined to remain quiet
till he had more certain intelligence, and employed himself in finishing
a shirt of mail, which he intended should be the best tempered and the
most finely polished that his skilful hands had ever executed.This
exercise of his craft pleased him better than any other occupation which
he could have adopted, and served as an apology for secluding himself
in his workshop, and shunning society, where the idle reports which were
daily circulated served only to perplex and disturb him.He resolved to
trust in the warm regard of Simon, the faith of his daughter, and the
friendship of the provost, who, having so highly commended his valour
in the combat with Bonthron, would never, he thought, desert him at this
extremity of his fortunes.Time, however, passed on day by day; and
it was not till Palm Sunday was near approaching, that Sir Patrick
Charteris, having entered the city to make some arrangements for the
ensuing combat, bethought himself of making a visit to the Smith of the
Wynd.He entered his workshop with an air of sympathy unusual to him, and
which made Henry instantly augur that he brought bad news.The smith
caught the alarm, and the uplifted hammer was arrested in its descent
upon the heated iron, while the agitated arm that wielded it, strong
before as that of a giant, became so powerless, that it was with
difficulty Henry was able to place the weapon on the ground, instead of
dropping it from his hand."My poor Henry," said Sir Patrick, "I bring you but cold news; they are
uncertain, however, and, if true, they are such as a brave man like you
should not take too deeply to heart.""In God's name, my lord," said Henry, "I trust you bring no evil news of
Simon Glover or his daughter?""Touching themselves," said Sir Patrick, "no: they are safe and well.But as to thee, Henry, my tidings are more cold.Kitt Henshaw has, I
think, apprised thee that I had endeavoured to provide Catharine Glover
with a safe protection in the house of an honourable lady, the Duchess
of Rothsay.But she hath declined the charge, and Catharine hath been
sent to her father in the Highlands.Thou
mayest have heard that Gilchrist MacIan is dead, and that his son
Eachin, who was known in Perth as the apprentice of old Simon, by the
name of Conachar, is now the chief of Clan Quhele; and I heard from one
of my domestics that there is a strong rumour among the MacIans that the
young chief seeks the hand of Catharine in marriage.My domestic learned
this--as a secret, however--while in the Breadalbane country, on some
arrangements touching the ensuing combat.The thing is uncertain but,
Henry, it wears a face of likelihood.""Did your lordship's servant see Simon Glover and his daughter?"said
Henry, struggling for breath, and coughing, to conceal from the provost
the excess of his agitation."He did not," said Sir Patrick; "the Highlanders seemed jealous, and
refused to permit him to speak to the old man, and he feared to alarm
them by asking to see Catharine.Besides, he talks no Gaelic, nor had
his informer much English, so there may be some mistake in the matter.Nevertheless, there is such a report, and I thought it best to tell it
you.But you may be well assured that the wedding cannot go on till the
affair of Palm Sunday be over; and I advise you to take no step till we
learn the circumstances of the matter, for certainty is most desirable,
even when it is painful.Go you to the council house," he added, after a
pause, "to speak about the preparations for the lists in the North Inch?"Well, Smith, I judge by your brief answer that you are discomposed with
this matter; but, after all, women are weathercocks, that is the truth
on't.Solomon and others have proved it before you."And so Sir Patrick Charteris retired, fully convinced he had discharged
the office of a comforter in the most satisfactory manner.With very different impressions did the unfortunate lover regard the
tidings and listen to the consoling commentary."The provost," he said bitterly to himself, "is an excellent man; marry,
he holds his knighthood so high, that, if he speaks nonsense, a poor man
must hold it sense, as he must praise dead ale if it be handed to him
in his lordship's silver flagon.How would all this sound in another
situation?Suppose I were rolling down the steep descent of the
Corrichie Dhu, and before I came to the edge of the rock, comes my Lord
Provost, and cries: 'Henry, there is a deep precipice, and I grieve to
say you are in the fair way of rolling over it.But be not downcast,
for Heaven may send a stone or a bush to stop your progress.However, I
thought it would be comfort to you to know the worst, which you will
be presently aware of.I do not know how many hundred feet deep the
precipice descends, but you may form a judgment when you are at the
bottom, for certainty is certainty.when come you to take
a game at bowls?'And this gossip is to serve instead of any friendly
attempt to save the poor wight's neck!When I think of this, I could go
mad, seize my hammer, and break and destroy all around me.But I will
be calm; and if this Highland kite, who calls himself a falcon, should
stoop at my turtle dove, he shall know whether a burgess of Perth can
draw a bow or not."It was now the Thursday before the fated Palm Sunday, and the champions
on either side were expected to arrive the next day, that they might
have the interval of Saturday to rest, refresh themselves, and prepare
for the combat.Two or three of each of the contending parties were
detached to receive directions about the encampment of their little
band, and such other instructions as might be necessary to the proper
ordering of the field.Henry was not, therefore, surprised at seeing a
tall and powerful Highlander peering anxiously about the wynd in which
he lived, in the manner in which the natives of a wild country examine
the curiosities of one that is more civilized.The smith's heart rose
against the man on account of his country, to which our Perth burgher
bore a natural prejudice, and more especially as he observed the
individual wear the plaid peculiar to the Clan Quhele.The sprig of oak
leaves, worked in silk, intimated also that the individual was one
of those personal guards of young Eachin, upon whose exertions in the
future battle so much reliance was placed by those of their clan.Having observed so much, Henry withdrew into his smithy, for the sight
of the man raised his passion; and, knowing that the Highlander came
plighted to a solemn combat, and could not be the subject of any
inferior quarrel, he was resolved at least to avoid friendly intercourse
with him.In a few minutes, however, the door of the smithy flew open,
and flattering in his tartans, which greatly magnified his actual size,
the Gael entered with the haughty step of a man conscious of a personal
dignity superior to anything which he is likely to meet with.He stood
looking around him, and seemed to expect to be received with courtesy
and regarded with wonder.But Henry had no sort of inclination to
indulge his vanity and kept hammering away at a breastplate which was
lying upon his anvil as if he were not aware of his visitor's presence.(the bandy legged smith), said the Highlander."Those that wish to be crook backed call me so," answered Henry."No offence meant," said the Highlander; "but her own self comes to buy
an armour.""Her own self's bare shanks may trot hence with her," answered Henry; "I
have none to sell.""If it was not within two days of Palm Sunday, herself would make you
sing another song," retorted the Gael."And being the day it is," said Henry, with the same contemptuous
indifference, "I pray you to stand out of my light.""You are an uncivil person; but her own self is fir nan ord too; and she
knows the smith is fiery when the iron is hot.""If her nainsell be hammer man herself, her nainsell may make her nain
harness," replied Henry."And so her nainsell would, and never fash you for the matter; but it
is said, Gow Chrom, that you sing and whistle tunes over the swords and
harnishes that you work, that have power to make the blades cut steel
links as if they were paper, and the plate and mail turn back steel
lances as if they were boddle prins?""They tell your ignorance any nonsense that Christian men refuse to
believe," said Henry."I whistle at my work whatever comes uppermost,
like an honest craftsman, and commonly it is the Highlandman's 'Och hone
for Houghman stares!'"Friend, it is but idle to spur a horse when his legs are ham shackled,"
said the Highlander, haughtily."Her own self cannot fight even now, and
there is little gallantry in taunting her thus.""By nails and hammer, you are right there," said the smith, altering his
tone."But speak out at once, friend, what is it thou wouldst have of
me?I am in no humour for dallying.""A hauberk for her chief, Eachin MacIan," said the Highlander."You are a hammer man, you say?said our
smith, producing from a chest the mail shirt on which he had been lately
employed.The Gael handled it with a degree of admiration which had something of
envy in it.He looked curiously at every part of its texture, and at
length declared it the very best piece of armour that he had ever seen."A hundred cows and bullocks and a good drift of sheep would be e'en
ower cheap an offer," said the Highlandman, by way of tentative; "but
her nainsell will never bid thee less, come by them how she can.""It is a fair proffer," replied Henry; "but gold nor gear will never buy
that harness.I want to try my own sword on my own armour, and I will
not give that mail coat to any one but who will face me for the best of
three blows and a thrust in the fair field; and it is your chief's upon
these terms.""Hut, prut, man--take a drink and go to bed," said the Highlander, in
great scorn.Think ye the captain of the Clan Quhele will
be brawling and battling with a bit Perth burgess body like you?Whisht,
man, and hearken.Her nainsell will do ye mair credit than ever belonged
to your kin.She will fight you for the fair harness hersell.""She must first show that she is my match," said Henry, with a grim
smile.I, one of Eachin MacIan's leichtach, and not your match!""You may try me, if you will.Do you know
how to cast a sledge hammer?""Ay, truly--ask the eagle if he can fly over Farragon.""But before you strive with me, you must first try a cast with one of my
leichtach.Here, Dunter, stand forth for the honour of Perth!And now,
Highlandman, there stands a row of hammers; choose which you will, and
let us to the garden."The Highlander whose name was Norman nan Ord, or Norman of the Hammer,
showed his title to the epithet by selecting the largest hammer of the
set, at which Henry smiled.Dunter, the stout journeyman of the smith,
made what was called a prodigious cast; but the Highlander, making a
desperate effort, threw beyond it by two or three feet, and looked with
an air of triumph to Henry, who again smiled in reply.said the Gael, offering our smith the hammer."Not with that child's toy," said Henry, "which has scarce weight to
fly against the wind.Jannekin, fetch me Sampson; or one of you help the
boy, for Sampson is somewhat ponderous."The hammer now produced was half as heavy again as that which the
Highlander had selected as one of unusual weight.Norman stood
astonished; but he was still more so when Henry, taking his position,
swung the ponderous implement far behind his right haunch joint, and
dismissed it from his hand as if it had flown from a warlike engine.The
air groaned and whistled as the mass flew through it.Down at length it
came, and the iron head sunk a foot into the earth, a full yard beyond
the cast of Norman.The Highlander, defeated and mortified, went to the spot where the
weapon lay, lifted it, poised it in his hand with great wonder, and
examined it closely, as if he expected to discover more in it than a
common hammer.He at length returned it to the owner with a melancholy
smile, shrugging his shoulders and shaking his head as the smith asked
him whether he would not mend his cast."Norman has lost too much at the sport already," he replied."She has
lost her own name of the Hammerer.But does her own self, the Gow Chrom,
work at the anvil with that horse's load of iron?""You shall see, brother," said Henry, leading the way to the smithy."Dunter," he said, "rax me that bar from the furnace"; and uplifting
Sampson, as he called the monstrous hammer, he plied the metal with a
hundred strokes from right to left--now with the right hand, now with
the left, now with both, with so much strength at once and dexterity,
that he worked off a small but beautifully proportioned horseshoe in
half the time that an ordinary smith would have taken for the same
purpose, using a more manageable implement.said the Highlander, "and what for would you be fighting
with our young chief, who is far above your standard, though you were
the best smith ever wrought with wind and fire?"said Henry; "you seem a good fellow, and I'll tell you the
truth.Your master has wronged me, and I give him this harness freely
for the chance of fighting him myself.""Nay, if he hath wronged you he must meet you," said the life guardsman."To do a man wrong takes the eagle's feather out of the chief's bonnet;
and were he the first in the Highlands, and to be sure so is Eachin,
he must fight the man he has wronged, or else a rose falls from his
chaplet.""Will you move him to this," said Henry, "after the fight on Sunday?""Oh, her nainsell will do her best, if the hawks have not got her
nainsell's bones to pick; for you must know, brother, that Clan
Chattan's claws pierce rather deep.""The armour is your chief's on that condition," said Henry; "but I will
disgrace him before king and court if he does not pay me the price.""Deil a fear--deil a fear; I will bring him in to the barrace myself,"
said Norman, "assuredly.""You will do me a pleasure," replied Henry; "and that you may remember
your promise, I will bestow on you this dirk.Look--if you hold it
truly, and can strike between the mail hood and the collar of your
enemy, the surgeon will be needless."The Highlander was lavish in his expressions of gratitude, and took his
leave."I have given him the best mail harness I ever wrought," said the smith
to himself, rather repenting his liberality, "for the poor chance
that he will bring his chief into a fair field with me; and then let
Catharine be his who can win her fairly.But much I dread the youth will
find some evasion, unless he have such luck on Palm Sunday as may induce
him to try another combat.That is some hope, however; for I have often,
ere now, seen a raw young fellow shoot up after his first fight from a
dwarf into a giant queller."Thus, with little hope, but with the most determined resolution, Henry
Smith awaited the time that should decide his fate.What made him augur
the worst was the silence both of the glover and of his daughter."They are ashamed," he said, "to confess the truth to me, and therefore
they are silent."Upon the Friday at noon, the two bands of thirty men each, representing
the contending clans, arrived at the several points where they were to
halt for refreshments.The Clan Quhele was entertained hospitably at the rich abbey of Scone,
while the provost regaled their rivals at his Castle of Kinfauns, the
utmost care being taken to treat both parties with the most punctilious
attention, and to afford neither an opportunity of complaining of
partiality.Mary travelled to the office.All points of etiquette were, in the mean while, discussed
and settled by the Lord High Constable Errol and the young Earl of
Crawford, the former acting on the part of the Clan Chattan and the
latter patronising the Clan Quhele.Messengers were passing continually
from the one earl to the other, and they held more than: six meetings
within thirty hours, before the ceremonial of the field could be exactly
arranged.Meanwhile, in case of revival of ancient quarrel, many seeds of
which existed betwixt the burghers and their mountain neighbours, a
proclamation commanded the citizens not to approach within half a mile
of the place where the Highlanders were quartered; while on their part
the intended combatants were prohibited from approaching Perth without
special license.Troops were stationed to enforce this order, who did
their charge so scrupulously as to prevent Simon Glover himself, burgess
and citizen of Perth, from approaching the town, because he owned having
come thither at the same time with the champions of Eachin MacIan, and
wore a plaid around him of their check or pattern.This interruption
prevented Simon from seeking out Henry Wynd and possessing him with a
true knowledge of all that had happened since their separation, which
intercourse, had it taken place, must have materially altered the
catastrophe of our narrative.On Saturday afternoon another arrival took place, which interested the
city almost as much as the preparations for the expected combat.This
was the approach of the Earl Douglas, who rode through the town with a
troop of only thirty horse, but all of whom were knights and gentlemen
of the first consequence.Men's eyes followed this dreaded peer as they
pursue the flight of an eagle through the clouds, unable to ken the
course of the bird of Jove yet silent, attentive, and as earnest in
observing him as if they could guess the object for which he sweeps
through the firmament; He rode slowly through the city, and passed out
at the northern gate.He next alighted at the Dominican convent and
desired to see the Duke of Albany.The Earl was introduced instantly,
and received by the Duke with a manner which was meant to be graceful
and conciliatory, but which could not conceal both art and inquietude.When the first greetings were over, the Earl said with great gravity:
"I bring you melancholy news.Your Grace's royal nephew, the Duke of
Rothsay, is no more, and I fear hath perished by some foul practices."said the Duke' in confusion--"what practices?Who dared
practise on the heir of the Scottish throne?""'Tis not for me to state how these doubts arise," said Douglas; "but
men say the eagle was killed with an arrow fledged from his own wing,
and the oak trunk rent by a wedge of the same wood.""Earl of Douglas," said the Duke of Albany, "I am no reader of riddles.""Nor am I a propounder of them," said Douglas, haughtily, "Your Grace
will find particulars in these papers worthy of perusal.I will go for
half an hour to the cloister garden, and then rejoin you.""You go not to the King, my lord?""No," answered Douglas; "I trust your Grace will agree with me that we
should conceal this great family misfortune from our sovereign till the
business of tomorrow be decided.""If the King heard of this loss, he
could not witness the combat; and if he appear not in person, these men
are likely to refuse to fight, and the whole work is cast loose.But
I pray you sit down, my lord, while I read these melancholy papers
respecting poor Rothsay."He passed the papers through his hands, turning some over with a hasty
glance, and dwelling on others as if their contents had been of the
last importance.When he had spent nearly a quarter of an hour in this
manner, he raised his eyes, and said very gravely: "My lord, in these
most melancholy documents, it is yet a comfort to see nothing which can
renew the divisions in the King's councils, which were settled by the
last solemn agreement between your lordship and myself.My unhappy
nephew was by that agreement to be set aside, until time should send him
a graver judgment.He is now removed by Fate, and our purpose in that
matter is anticipated and rendered unnecessary.""If your Grace," replied the Earl, "sees nothing to disturb the good
understanding which the tranquillity and safety of Scotland require
should exist between us, I am not so ill a friend of my country as to
look closely for such.""I understand you, my Lord of Douglas," said Albany, eagerly."You
hastily judged that I should be offended with your lordship for
exercising your powers of lieutenancy, and punishing the detestable
murderers within my territory of Falkland.Credit me, on the contrary, I
am obliged to your lordship for taking out of my hands the punishment of
these wretches, as it would have broken my heart even to have looked
on them.The Scottish Parliament will inquire, doubtless, into this
sacrilegious deed; and happy am I that the avenging sword has been
in the hand of a man so important as your lordship.Our communication
together, as your lordship must well recollect, bore only concerning a
proposed restraint of my unfortunate nephew until the advance of a year
or two had taught him discretion?""Such was certainly your Grace's purpose, as expressed to me," said the
Earl; "I can safely avouch it.""Why, then, noble earl, we cannot be censured because villains, for
their own revengeful ends, appear to have engrafted a bloody termination
on our honest purpose?""The Parliament will judge it after their wisdom," said Douglas."For my
part, my conscience acquits me.""And mine assoilzies me," said the Duke with solemnity."Now, my lord,
touching the custody of the boy James, who succeeds to his father's
claims of inheritance?""The King must decide it," said Douglas, impatient of the conference."I will consent to his residence anywhere save at Stirling, Doune, or
Falkland.""He is gone," muttered the crafty Albany, "and he must be my ally, yet
feels himself disposed to be my mortal foe.No matter, Rothsay sleeps
with his fathers, James may follow in time, and then--a crown is the
recompense of my perplexities."Thretty for thretty faucht in barreris,
     At Sanct Johnstoun on a day besyde the black freris.At an earlier period of the Christian Church,
the use of any of the days of Passion Week for the purpose of combat
would have been accounted a profanity worthy of excommunication.The
Church of Rome, to her infinite honour, had decided that during the holy
season of Easter, when the redemption of man from his fallen state was
accomplished, the sword of war should be sheathed, and angry monarchs
should respect the season termed the Truce of God.The ferocious
violence of the latter wars betwixt Scotland and England had destroyed
all observance of this decent and religious Ordinance.Very often the
most solemn occasions were chosen by one party for an attack, because
they hoped to find the other engaged in religious duties and unprovided
for defence.Thus the truce, once considered as proper to the season,
had been discontinued; and it became not unusual even to select the
sacred festivals of the church for decision of the trial by combat, to
which this intended contest bore a considerable resemblance.On the present occasion, however, the duties of the day were observed
with the usual solemnity, and the combatants themselves took share in
them.Bearing branches of yew in their hands, as the readiest substitute
for palm boughs, they marched respectively to the Dominican and
Carthusian convents, to hear High Mass, and, by a show at least of
devotion, to prepare themselves for the bloody strife of the day.Great
care had of course been taken that, during this march, they should not
even come within the sound of each other's bagpipes; for it was certain
that, like game cocks exchanging mutual notes of defiance, they would
have sought out and attacked each other before they arrived at the place
of combat.The citizens of Perth crowded to see the unusual procession on the
streets, and thronged the churches where the two clans attended their
devotions, to witness their behaviour, and to form a judgment from
their appearance which was most likely to obtain the advantage in
the approaching conflict.Their demeanour in the church, although not
habitual frequenters of places of devotion, was perfectly decorous; and,
notwithstanding their wild and untamed dispositions, there were few of
the mountaineers who seemed affected either with curiosity or wonder.They appeared to think it beneath their dignity of character to testify
either curiosity or surprise at many things which were probably then
presented to them for the first time.On the issue of the combat, few even of the most competent judges dared
venture a prediction; although the great size of Torquil and his eight
stalwart sons induced some who professed themselves judges of the thewes
and sinews of men to incline to ascribe the advantage to the party of
the Clan Quhele.The opinion of the female sex was much decided by
the handsome form, noble countenance, and gallant demeanour of Eachin
MacIan.There were more than one who imagined they had recollection
of his features, but his splendid military attire rendered the humble
glover's apprentice unrecognisable in the young Highland chief, saving
by one person.That person, as may well be supposed, was the Smith of the Wynd, who
had been the foremost in the crowd that thronged to see the gallant
champions of Clan Quhele.It was with mingled feelings of dislike,
jealousy, and something approaching to admiration that he saw the
glover's apprentice stripped of his mean slough, and blazing forth as a
chieftain, who, by his quick eye and gallant demeanour, the noble shape
of his brow and throat, his splendid arms and well proportioned limbs,
seemed well worthy to hold the foremost rank among men selected to live
or die for the honour of their race.The smith could hardly think that
he looked upon the same passionate boy whom he had brushed off as
he might a wasp that stung him, and, in mere compassion, forebore to
despatch by treading on him."He looks it gallantly with my noble hauberk," thus muttered Henry to
himself, "the best I ever wrought.Yet, if he and I stood together where
there was neither hand to help nor eye to see, by all that is blessed in
this holy church, the good harness should return to its owner!All that
I am worth would I give for three fair blows on his shoulders to undo my
own best work; but such happiness will never be mine.If he escape from
the conflict, it will be with so high a character for courage, that he
may well disdain to put his fortune, in its freshness, to the risk of
an encounter with a poor burgess like myself.He will fight by his
champion, and turn me over to my fellow craftsman the hammerer, when all
I can reap will be the pleasure of knocking a Highland bullock on the
head.I will to the other church in
quest of him, since for sure he must have come down from the Highlands."The congregation was moving from the church of the Dominicans when the
smith formed this determination, which he endeavoured to carry into
speedy execution, by thrusting through the crowd as hastily as the
solemnity of the place and occasion would permit.In making his way
through the press, he was at one instant carried so close to Eachin
that their eyes encountered.The smith's hardy and embrowned countenance
 up like the heated iron on which he wrought, and retained
its dark red hue for several minutes.Eachin's features glowed with a
brighter blush of indignation, and a glance of fiery hatred was shot
from his eyes.But the sudden flush died away in ashy paleness, and his
gaze instantly avoided the unfriendly but steady look with which it was
encountered.Torquil, whose eye never quitted his foster son, saw his emotion, and
looked anxiously around to discover the cause.But Henry was already
at a distance, and hastening on his way to the Carthusian convent.Here
also the religious service of the day was ended; and those who had so
lately borne palms in honour of the great event which brought peace
on earth and goodwill to the children of men were now streaming to
the place of combat--some prepared to take the lives of their fellow
creatures or to lose their own, others to view the deadly strife with
the savage delight which the heathens took in the contests of their
gladiators.The crowd was so great that any other person might well have despaired
of making way through it.But the general deference entertained for
Henry of the Wynd, as the champion of Perth, and the universal sense of
his ability to force a passage, induced all to unite in yielding room
for him, so that he was presently quite close to the warriors of the
Clan Chattan.Their pipers marched at the head of their column.Next
followed the well known banner, displaying a mountain cat rampant, with
the appropriate caution, "Touch not the cat, but (i.e.The chief followed with his two handed sword advanced, as if to
protect the emblem of the tribe.He was a man of middle stature, more
than fifty years old, but betraying neither in features nor form any
decay of strength or symptoms of age.His dark red close curled locks
were in part chequered by a few grizzled hairs, but his step and gesture
were as light in the dance, in the chase, or in the battle as if he had
not passed his thirtieth year.His grey eye gleamed with a wild light
expressive of valour and ferocity mingled; but wisdom and experience
dwelt on the expression of his forehead, eyebrows, and lips.The chosen
champions followed by two and two.There was a cast of anxiety on
several of their faces, for they had that morning discovered the absence
of one of their appointed number; and, in a contest so desperate as was
expected, the loss seemed a matter of importance to all save to their
high mettled chief, MacGillie Chattanach."Say nothing to the Saxons of his absence," said this bold leader, when
the diminution of his force was reported to him."The false Lowland
tongues might say that one of Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps
that the rest favoured his escape, in order to have a pretence to avoid
the battle.I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere
we are ready for battle; or, if he should not, am not I man enough for
two of the Clan Quhele?or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty,
rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?"The tribe received the brave speech of their leader with applause, yet
there were anxious looks thrown out in hopes of espying the return of
the deserter; and perhaps the chief himself was the only one of the
determined band who was totally indifferent on the subject.They marched on through the streets without seeing anything of Ferquhard
Day, who, many a mile beyond the mountains, was busied in receiving such
indemnification as successful love could bestow for the loss of honour.MacGillie Chattanach marched on without seeming to observe the absence
of the deserter, and entered upon the North Inch, a beautiful and level
plain, closely adjacent to the city, and appropriated to the martial
exercises of the inhabitants.The plain is washed on one side by the deep and swelling Tay.There was
erected within it a strong palisade, inclosing on three sides a space of
one hundred and fifty yards in length and seventy-four yards in width.The fourth side of the lists was considered as sufficiently fenced
by the river.An amphitheatre for the accommodation of spectators
surrounded the palisade, leaving a large space free to be occupied by
armed men on foot and horseback, and for the more ordinary class of
spectators.At the extremity of the lists which was nearest to the city,
there was a range of elevated galleries for the King and his courtiers,
so highly decorated with rustic treillage, intermingled with gilded
ornaments, that the spot retains to this day the name of the Golden, or
Gilded, Arbour.The mountain minstrelsy, which sounded the appropriate pibrochs or
battle tunes of the rival confederacies, was silent when they entered on
the Inch, for such was the order which had been given.Two stately but
aged warriors, each bearing the banner of his tribe, advanced to the
opposite extremities of the lists, and, pitching their standards into
the earth, prepared to be spectators of a fight in which they were not
to join.The pipers, who were also to be neutral in the strife, took
their places by their respective brattachs.The multitude received both bands with the same general shout with which
on similar occasions they welcome those from whose exertion they expect
amusement, or what they term sport.The destined combatants returned
no answer to this greeting, but each party advanced to the opposite
extremities of the lists, where were entrances by which they were to be
admitted to the interior.A strong body of men at arms guarded either
access; and the Earl Marshal at the one and the Lord High Constable at
the other carefully examined each individual, to see whether he had the
appropriate arms, being steel cap, mail shirt, two handed sword, and
dagger.They also examined the numbers of each party; and great was the
alarm among the multitude when the Earl of Errol held up his hand and
cried: "Ho!The combat cannot proceed, for the Clan Chattan lack one of
their number."said the young Earl of Crawford; "they should have
counted better ere they left home."The Earl Marshal, however, agreed with the Constable that the fight
could not proceed until the inequality should be removed; and a general
apprehension was excited in the assembled multitude that, after all the
preparation, there would be no battle.Of all present there were only two perhaps who rejoiced at the prospect
of the combat being adjourned, and these were the captain of the Clan
Quhele and the tender hearted King Robert.Meanwhile the two chiefs,
each attended by a special friend and adviser, met in the midst of the
lists, having, to assist them in determining what was to be done, the
Earl Marshal, the Lord High Constable, the Earl of Crawford, and Sir
Patrick Charteris.The chief of the Clan Chattan declared himself
willing and desirous of fighting upon the spot, without regard to the
disparity of numbers."That," said Torquil of the Oak, "Clan Quhele will never consent to.You can never win honour from us with the sword, and you seek but a
subterfuge, that you may say when you are defeated, as you know you will
be, that it was for want of the number of your band fully counted out.But I make a proposal: Ferquhard Day was the youngest of your band,
Eachin MacIan is the youngest of ours; we will set him aside in place of
the man who has fled from the combat.""A most unjust and unequal proposal," exclaimed Toshach Beg, the second,
as he might be termed, of MacGillie Chattanach."The life of the chief
is to the clan the breath of our nostrils, nor will we ever consent that
our chief shall be exposed to dangers which the captain of Clan Quhele
does not share."Torquil saw with deep anxiety that his plan was about to fail when the
objection was made to Hector's being withdrawn from the battle, and
he was meditating how to support his proposal, when Eachin himself
interfered.His timidity, it must be observed, was not of that sordid
and selfish nature which induces those who are infected by it calmly
to submit to dishonour rather than risk danger.On the contrary, he was
morally brave, though constitutionally timid, and the shame of avoiding
the combat became at the moment more powerful than the fear of facing
it."I will not hear," he said, "of a scheme which will leave my sword
sheathed during this day's glorious combat.If I am young in arms, there
are enough of brave men around me whom I may imitate if I cannot equal."He spoke these words in a spirit which imposed on Torquil, and perhaps
on the young chief himself."I was sure the foul spell would be broken through, and that the tardy
spirit which besieged him would fly at the sound of the pipe and the
first flutter of the brattach!""Hear me, Lord Marshal," said the Constable."The hour of combat may not
be much longer postponed, for the day approaches to high noon.Let the
chief of Clan Chattan take the half hour which remains, to find, if he
can, a substitute for this deserter; if he cannot, let them fight as
they stand.""Content I am," said the Marshal, "though, as none of his own clan are
nearer than fifty miles, I see not how MacGillis Chattanach is to find
an auxiliary.""That is his business," said the High Constable; "but, if he offers a
high reward, there are enough of stout yeomen surrounding the lists,
who will be glad enough to stretch their limbs in such a game as is
expected.I myself, did my quality and charge permit, would blythely
take a turn of work amongst these wild fellows, and think it fame won."They communicated their decision to the Highlanders, and the chief of
the Clan Chattan replied: "You have judged unpartially and nobly, my
lords, and I deem myself obliged to follow your direction.So make
proclamation, heralds, that, if any one will take his share with Clan
Chattan of the honours and chances of this day, he shall have present
payment of a gold crown, and liberty to fight to the death in my ranks.""You are something chary of your treasure, chief," said the Earl
Marshal: "a gold crown is poor payment for such a campaign as is before
you.""If there be any man willing to fight for honour," replied MacGillis
Chattanach, "the price will be enough; and I want not the service of a
fellow who draws his sword for gold alone."The heralds had made their progress, moving half way round the lists,
stopping from time to time to make proclamation as they had been
directed, without the least apparent disposition on the part of any one
to accept of the proffered enlistment.Some sneered at the poverty of
the Highlanders, who set so mean a price upon such a desperate service.Others affected resentment, that they should esteem the blood of
citizens so lightly.None showed the slightest intention to undertake
the task proposed, until the sound of the proclamation reached Henry of
the Wynd, as he stood without the barrier, speaking from time to time
with Baillie Craigdallie, or rather listening vaguely to what the
magistrate was saying to him."A liberal offer on the part of MacGillie Chattanach," said the host of
the Griffin, "who proposes a gold crown to any one who will turn wildcat
for the day, and be killed a little in his service!exclaimed the smith, eagerly, "do they make proclamation for a
man to fight against the Clan Quhele?""Ay, marry do they," said Griffin; "but I think they will find no such
fools in Perth."He had hardly said the word, when he beheld the smith clear the barriers
at a single bound and alight in the lists, saying: "Here am I, sir
herald, Henry of the Wynd, willing to battle on the part of the Clan
Chattan."A cry of admiration ran through the multitude, while the grave burghers,
not being able to conceive the slightest reason for Henry's behaviour,
concluded that his head must be absolutely turned with the love of
fighting."Thou art mad," he said, "Henry!Thou hast neither two handed sword nor
shirt of mail.""Truly no," said Henry, "for I parted with a mail shirt, which I had
made for myself, to yonder gay chief of the Clan Quhele, who will soon
find on his shoulders with what sort of blows I clink my rivets!As for
two handed sword, why, this boy's brand will serve my turn till I can
master a heavier one.""This must not be," said Errol."Hark thee, armourer, by St.Mary, thou
shalt have my Milan hauberk and good Spanish sword.""I thank your noble earlship, Sir Gilbert Hay, but the yoke with which
your brave ancestor turned the battle at Loncarty would serve my turn
well enough.I am little used to sword or harness that I have not
wrought myself, because I do not well know what blows the one will bear
out without being cracked or the other lay on without snapping."The cry had in the mean while run through the multitude and passed into
the town, that the dauntless smith was about to fight without armour,
when, just as the fated hour was approaching, the shrill voice of a
female was heard screaming for passage through the crowd.The multitude
gave place to her importunity, and she advanced, breathless with haste
under the burden of a mail hauberk and a large two handed sword.The
widow of Oliver Proudfute was soon recognised, and the arms which she
bore were those of the smith himself, which, occupied by her husband on
the fatal evening when he was murdered, had been naturally conveyed
to his house with the dead body, and were now, by the exertions of
his grateful widow, brought to the lists at a moment when such proved
weapons were of the last consequence to their owner.Henry joyfully
received the well known arms, and the widow with trembling haste
assisted in putting them on, and then took leave of him, saying: "God
for the champion of the widow and orphan, and ill luck to all who come
before him!"Confident at feeling himself in his well proved armour, Henry shook
himself as if to settle the steel shirt around him, and, unsheathing
the two handed sword, made it flourish over his head, cutting the air
through which it whistled in the form of the figure eight with an ease
and sleight of hand that proved how powerfully and skilfully he could
wield the ponderous weapon.The champions were now ordered to march
in their turns around the lists, crossing so as to avoid meeting each
other, and making obeisance as they passed the Golden Arbour where the
King was seated.While this course was performing, most of the spectators were again
curiously comparing the stature, limbs, and sinews of the two parties,
and endeavouring to form a conjecture an to the probable issue of the
combat.The feud of a hundred years, with all its acts of aggression
and retaliation, was concentrated in the bosom of each combatant.Their
countenances seemed fiercely writhen into the wildest expression of
pride, hate, and a desperate purpose of fighting to the very last.The spectators murmured a joyful applause, in high wrought expectation
of the bloody game.Wagers were offered and accepted both on the general
issue of the conflict and on the feats of particular champions.The
clear, frank, and elated look of Henry Smith rendered him a general
favourite among the spectators, and odds, to use the modern expression,
were taken that he would kill three of his opponents before he himself
fell.Scarcely was the smith equipped for the combat, when the commands of the
chiefs ordered the champions into their places; and at the same moment
Henry heard the voice of Simon Glover issuing from the crowd, who were
now silent with expectation, and calling on him: "Harry Smith--Harry
Smith, what madness hath possessed thee?""Ay, he wishes to save his hopeful son in law that is, or is to be, from
the smith's handling," was Henry's first thought; his second was to turn
and speak with him; and his third, that he could on no pretext desert
the band which he had joined, or even seem desirous to delay the fight,
consistently with honour.He turned himself, therefore, to the business of the hour.Both parties
were disposed by the respective chiefs in three lines, each containing
ten men.They were arranged with such intervals between each individual
as offered him scope to wield his sword, the blade of which was five
feet long, not including the handle.The second and third lines were
to come up as reserves, in case the first experienced disaster.On the
right of the array of Clan Quhele, the chief, Eachin MacIan, placed
himself in the second line betwixt two of his foster brothers.Four of
them occupied the right of the first line, whilst the father and
two others protected the rear of the beloved chieftain.Torquil, in
particular, kept close behind, for the purpose of covering him.Thus
Eachin stood in the centre of nine of the strongest men of his band,
having four especial defenders in front, one on each hand, and three in
his rear.The line of the Clan Chattan was arranged in precisely the same order,
only that the chief occupied the centre of the middle rank, instead of
being on the extreme right.This induced Henry Smith, who saw in the
opposing bands only one enemy, and that was the unhappy Eachin, to
propose placing himself on the left of the front rank of the Clan
Chattan.But the leader disapproved of this arrangement; and having
reminded Henry that he owed him obedience, as having taken wages at his
hand, he commanded him to occupy the space in the third line immediately
behind himself--a post of honour, certainly, which Henry could not
decline, though he accepted of it with reluctance.When the clans were thus drawn up opposed to each other, they intimated
their feudal animosity and their eagerness to engage by a wild scream,
which, uttered by the Clan Quhele, was answered and echoed back by
the Clan Chattan, the whole at the same time shaking their swords and
menacing each other, as if they meant to conquer the imagination of
their opponents ere they mingled in the actual strife.At this trying moment, Torquil, who had never feared for himself, was
agitated with alarm on the part of his dault, yet consoled by observing
that he kept a determined posture, and that the few words which he spoke
to his clan were delivered boldly, and well calculated to animate them
to combat, as expressing his resolution to partake their fate in death
or victory.The trumpets
of the King sounded a charge, the bagpipes blew up their screaming and
maddening notes, and the combatants, starting forward in regular order,
and increasing their pace till they came to a smart run, met together
in the centre of the ground, as a furious land torrent encounters an
advancing tide.For an instant or two the front lines, hewing at each other with their
long swords, seemed engaged in a succession of single combats; but the
second and third ranks soon came up on either side, actuated alike by
the eagerness of hatred and the thirst of honour, pressed through the
intervals, and rendered the scene a tumultuous chaos, over which the
huge swords rose and sunk, some still glittering, others streaming with
blood, appearing, from the wild rapidity with which they were swayed,
rather to be put in motion by some complicated machinery than to
be wielded by human hands.Some of the combatants, too much crowded
together to use those long weapons, had already betaken themselves to
their poniards, and endeavoured to get within the sword sweep of those
opposed to them.In the mean time, blood flowed fast, and the groans of
those who fell began to mingle with the cries of those who fought; for,
according to the manner of the Highlanders at all times, they could
hardly be said to shout, but to yell.Those of the spectators whose
eyes were best accustomed to such scenes of blood and confusion could
nevertheless discover no advantage yet acquired by either party.The
conflict swayed, indeed, at different intervals forwards or backwards,
but it was only in momentary superiority, which the party who acquired
it almost instantly lost by a corresponding exertion on the other side.The wild notes of the pipers were still heard above the tumult, and
stimulated to farther exertions the fury of the combatants.At once, however, and as if by mutual agreement, the instruments sounded
a retreat; it was expressed in wailing notes, which seemed to imply a
dirge for the fallen.The two parties disengaged themselves from each
other, to take breath for a few minutes.The eyes of the spectators
greedily surveyed the shattered array of the combatants as they drew
off from the contest, but found it still impossible to decide which had
sustained the greater loss.It seemed as if the Clan Chattan had lost
rather fewer men than their antagonists; but in compensation, the bloody
plaids and skirts of their party (for several on both sides had thrown
their mantles away) showed more wounded men than the Clan Quhele.About
twenty of both sides lay on the field dead or dying; and arms and legs
lopped off, heads cleft to the chin, slashes deep through the shoulder
into the breast, showed at once the fury of the combat, the ghastly
character of the weapons used, and the fatal strength of the arms which
wielded them.The chief of the Clan Chattan had behaved himself with
the most determined courage, and was slightly wounded.Eachin also had
fought with spirit, surrounded by his bodyguard.His sword was bloody,
his bearing bold and warlike; and he smiled when old Torquil, folding
him in his arms, loaded him with praises and with blessings.The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space
of about ten minutes, again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly
one third of their original number.They now chose their ground nearer
to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered, which
was encumbered with the wounded and the slain.Some of the former were
observed, from time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of
the field, and sink back, most of them to die from the effusion of blood
which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as
his remaining on the spot where they had first encountered, where he
stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose bonneted head, carried
to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which had
swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the
bodyguard of Eachin MacIan.Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck
a blow, but had contented himself with warding off many that were dealt
at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief.MacGillie Chattanach
became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again
draw together, he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a
distance from the ranks, and showed little disposition to join them."Can so strong a body have a mean
and cowardly spirit?"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry."If I am
such," pointing to the headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's
wage.""He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I
reward him without reckoning wages.""Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which
best likes me.""All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who
saw the prudence of humouring an auxiliary of such promise."It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined
the rest of the combatants with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to
the chief of the Clan Quhele.It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty.He had long looked up to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its
neighbourhood could bring into the lists.His hatred to him as a rival
was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once, though
unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld
him with his eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his
hand, and obviously meditating an attack on him individually, his
courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape his
foster father.It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation
of his own temper, and that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive
the idea of one of his own tribe, much less of his chief and foster
son, being deficient in animal courage.Could he have imagined this, his
grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking
Eachin's life, to save him from staining his honour.But his mind
rejected the idea that his dault was a personal coward, as something
which was monstrous and unnatural.That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now
anxiously, but in a whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now
darken thy spirit, Eachin?""Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands
the fell enchanter!"exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making?Norman,
miserable boy, why brought you that accursed mail?""If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it,"
answered Norman nan Ord."Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell.""Yes, stand firm," said Torquil."He may be a fell enchanter; but my own
ear has heard, and my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the
battle whole, free, and unwounded; let us see the Saxon wizard who can
gainsay that.He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of the oak
shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault.Ring
around him, my sons; bas air son Eachin!"The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for
Hector."Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called
boldly to the minstrels of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached
each other more slowly than at first, as men who knew and respected
each other's valour.Henry Wynd, in his impatience to begin the contest,
advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on.Norman, however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there
was a general, though momentary, pause, as if both parties were willing
to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event of this duel.The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to
strike; but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long
and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the smith's sword, as he fetched
a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within Henry's guard,
struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat,
directing the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the
same time, "You taught me the stab!"But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining
of tempered steel.Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been
ended for ever.Even as it was, he was slightly wounded.he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long
sword, which made him stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust,
but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at his antagonist, which cleft
his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body to
engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son
Eachin!"and the two brethren who flanked their
chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking both at
once, compelled him to keep the defensive.cried MacGillie Chattanach."Save the
brave Saxon; let these kites feel your talons!"Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's
assistance, and cut down one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed.Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.answered two more of his
devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the smith and those
who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of
the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show
of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers.The two children
of the oak, who had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their
brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan chief had drawn to that part
of the field some of his bravest warriors.The sons of Torquil did not
fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons
of the dead and living.But the necessity of keeping their most
distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief told to
disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan
Chattan had fifteen of their number left, though most of them wounded,
and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten remained, of whom there were
four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed,
their fury seemed to increase.Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places,
was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold
hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity.But still the father's shout of "Another for Hector!"was cheerfully
answered by the fatal countersign, "Death for Hector!"and though the
Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious.It
was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or
three were scarce able to stand without leaning on their swords.Five
were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his youngest son were of the
number, both slightly wounded.Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without
injury.The rage of both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into
sullen desperation.They walked staggering, as if in their sleep,
through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the
friends they had lost.The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict
drawing together to renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the
river, as the spot least slippery with blood, and less encumbered with
the bodies of the slain."For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for,"
said the kind hearted old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be
ended!Wherefore should these wretched rags and remnants of humanity be
suffered to complete their butchery?Surely they will now be ruled, and
accept of peace on moderate terms?""Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother."These men are the pest
of the Lowlands.Both chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed,
the whole day's work is cast away.Remember your promise to the council,
that you would not cry 'hold.'""You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should
protect his subjects, and as a Christian man, who respects the brother
of his faith.""You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving
subjects, but disobedient rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear
witness; and they are still less Christian men, for the prior of the
Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen.""You must work your pleasure, and are too wise
for me to contend with.I can but turn away and shut my eyes from the
sights and sounds of a carnage which makes me sicken.But well I know
that God will punish me even for witnessing this waste of human life.""Sound, trumpets," said Albany; "their wounds will stiffen if they dally
longer."While this was passing, Torquil was embracing and encouraging his young
chief."Resist the witchcraft but a few minutes longer!Be of good cheer, you
will come off without either scar or scratch, wem or wound."How can I be of good cheer," said Eachin, "while my brave kinsmen have
one by one died at my feet--died all for me, who could never deserve the
least of their kindness?""And for what were they born, save to die for their chief?""Why lament that the arrow returns not to the
quiver, providing it hit the mark?Here are Tormot and I
but little hurt, while the wildcats drag themselves through the plain
as if they were half throttled by the terriers.Yet one brave stand, and
the day shall be your own, though it may well be that you alone remain
alive.The pipers on both sides blew their charge, and the combatants again
mingled in battle, not indeed with the same strength, but with unabated
inveteracy.They were joined by those whose duty it was to have remained
neuter, but who now found themselves unable to do so.The two old
champions who bore the standards had gradually advanced from the
extremity of the lists, and now approached close to the immediate scene
of action.When they beheld the carnage more nearly, they were mutually
impelled by the desire to revenge their brethren, or not to survive
them.They attacked each other furiously with the lances to which the
standards were attached, closed after exchanging several deadly thrusts,
then grappled in close strife, still holding their banners, until at
length, in the eagerness of their conflict, they fell together into the
Tay, and were found drowned after the combat, closely locked in each
other's arms.The fury of battle, the frenzy of rage and despair,
infected next the minstrels.The two pipers, who, during the conflict,
had done their utmost to keep up the spirits of their brethren, now saw
the dispute well nigh terminated for want of men to support it.They
threw down their instruments, rushed desperately upon each other with
their daggers, and each being more intent on despatching his opponent
than in defending himself, the piper of Clan Quhele was almost instantly
slain and he of Clan Chattan mortally wounded.The last, nevertheless,
again grasped his instrument, and the pibroch of the clan yet poured
its expiring notes over the Clan Chattan, while the dying minstrel had
breath to inspire it.The instrument which he used, or at least that
part of it called the chanter, is preserved in the family of a Highland
chief to this day, and is much honoured under the name of the federan
dhu, or, "black chanter."'Meanwhile, in the final charge, young Tormot, devoted, like his
brethren, by his father Torquil to the protection of his chief, had
been mortally wounded by the unsparing sword of the smith.The other
two remaining of the Clan Quhele had also fallen, and Torquil, with his
foster son and the wounded Tormot, forced to retreat before eight or ten
of the Clan Chattan, made a stand on the bank of the river, while their
enemies were making such exertions as their wounds would permit to come
up with them.Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved
to make the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired.His death
drew from his father the first and only sigh which he had breathed
throughout the eventful day.he said, "my youngest and dearest!But if I save
Hector, I save all.Now, my darling dault, I have done for thee all that
man may, excepting the last.Let me undo the clasps of that ill omened
armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will fit
thee well.While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make
what play with them I can.I trust I shall have but little to do, for
they are following each other like disabled steers.At least, darling of
my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man should
die."While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's
hauberk, in the simple belief that he could thus break the meshes which
fear and necromancy had twined about his heart."My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin,
"stay with me!With you by my side, I feel I can fight to the last.""It is impossible," said Torquil."I will stop them coming up, while you
put on the hauberk.God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward
with the same fatal war cry which had so often sounded over that bloody
field, "Bas air son Eachin!"The words rung three times in a voice of
thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down one of
the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him."Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!"exclaimed the multitude,
as they witnessed exertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to
threaten a change of the fortunes of the day.Suddenly these cries were
hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful,
as if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and
Torquil of the Oak.They cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had
drawn their blades for the first time that day; and their inveteracy was
mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed, had
cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who,
during the whole conflict, had interrupted the purpose for which alone
he had joined the combatants--that of engaging in single combat with
Hector.They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have
existed, had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat
deprived of his usual agility.Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain
attempt to put on his foster brother's harness, became animated by an
emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward to support his foster
father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan
should come up.When he was within five yards, and sternly determined
to take his share in the death fight, his foster father fell, cleft
from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring with his last
breath, "Bas air son Eachin!"The unfortunate youth saw the fall of
his last friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had
hunted him through the whole field standing within sword's point of
him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed its way to his
life through so many obstacles.Perhaps this was enough to bring his
constitutional timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected
at the same moment that he was without defensive armour, and that a
line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge and
blood, were closely approaching.It is enough to say, that his heart
sickened, his eyes darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy,
all other considerations were lost in the apprehension of instant death;
and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that which
was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former
could recover his weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay.A roar of contumely pursued him as he swam across the river, although,
perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have behaved
otherwise in the like circumstances.Henry looked after the fugitive in
silence and surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of
his flight, on account of the faintness which seemed to overpower him
as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided.He sat down on
the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were
pouring fastest.The victors had the general meed of gratulation.The Duke of Albany and
others went down to survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with
particular notice."If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I
will change thy leathern apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage
tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain thy rank withal.""I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have
shed blood enough already, and Heaven has punished me by foiling the
only purpose for which I entered the combat.""Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan,
and have they not gained a glorious conquest?""I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own
pleasure, not for your profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the
expression is still proverbial in Scotland.The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered
the barriers for the purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after."My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal
matters when it seems he may have short timer to consider those that
are spiritual.Has he no friends here who will bear him where his bodily
wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?""He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir
Patrick Charteris, "and I esteem myself one of the closest.""A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning
his horse aside; "the proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas
had recalled him from death's door, had there been a drop of gentle
blood in his body."Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns
dismounted to take Henry in his arms, as he now sunk back from very
faintness.But he was prevented by Simon Glover, who, with other
burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace."Oh, what tempted you
to this fatal affray?"No--not speechless," said Henry."Catharine--" He could utter no more."Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who,
though something affronted at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too
magnanimous not to interest himself in what was passing."She is safe,
if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich.Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour.""For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a
father go with the noble Douglas.said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises
gold!""Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight
and noble, take license to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may
reject honourable titles, such an honest man as this reverend citizen
may dispense with gold.""You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no
offence," said the Douglas.But," he
added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw the King from
this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over
broad Scotland when tomorrow dawns.Yet even I
grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie here slain, whose brands might
have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running
down his aged cheeks and white beard, as he conjured all around him,
nobles and priests, that care should be taken for the bodies and souls
of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to
the slain.The priests who were present answered zealously for both
services, and redeemed their pledge faithfully and piously.Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth.Of
sixty-four brave men (the minstrels and standard bearers included)
who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone survived, who were
conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the
dead and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession
which conveyed them from the scene of their strife.Eachin alone had
left it void of wounds and void of honour.It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the
bloody combat except the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the
defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.The clans of which it
consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner.The
Clan Chattan, on the other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and
the best families of the Northern Highlands boast their descent from the
race of the Cat a Mountain.While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied,
Albany, with a discomposed aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of
Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this most melancholy scene at
Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?""Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas."I would sooner bare my
breast, within flight shot, as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen.I could but say I saw the ill fated youth dead.How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.Were it
not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own
mind of it."So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to
his own lodgings, leaving Albany to tell his tale as he best could."Ay, and
thine own interest, haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou
darest not separate from mine.Well, since the task falls on me, I must
and will discharge it."The King looked at him with
surprise after he had assumed his usual seat."Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King."I would thou
wouldst think more deeply when blood is to be spilled, since its
consequences affect thee so powerfully.And yet, Robin, I love thee the
better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy
reflecting policy.""I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half
choked, "that the bloody field we have seen were the worst we had to see
or hear of this day.I should waste little sorrow on the wild kerne who
lie piled on it like carrion.It must
be--it is Rothsay!"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless
nephew.""Albany, as
thy brother, I conjure thee!But no, I am thy brother no longer.As thy
king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to tell the worst."Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but
the certainty is, that my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment
last night from sudden illness--as I have heard.""Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David!Would to God I had died for thee,
my son--my son!"So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft
father, tearing his grey beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless
and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt the tempest of his
grief.But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to
fury--a mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature,
that the remorse of Albany was drowned in his fear."And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious
maxims!But the besotted father who gave the son into thy hands--who
gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king, and thou shalt know
it to thy cost.Shall the murderer stand in presence of his
brother--stained with the blood of that brother's son?What ho,
without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes!Take arms, if
you love the Stuart!"MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment."Brandanes, your
noble Prince--" Here his grief and agitation interrupted for a moment
the fatal information it was his object to convey.At length he resumed
his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard!Arrest--" The word choked his utterance."Arrest whom, my noble liege?"said MacLouis, who, observing the King
influenced by a tide of passion so different from the gentleness of his
ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that his brain had been disturbed
by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed."Whom shall I arrest, my liege?""Here is none but your
Grace's royal brother of Albany.""Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion
soon dying away."Most true--none but Albany--none but my parent's
child--none but my brother.O God, enable me to quell the sinful passion
which glows in this bosom.Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who
endeavoured to hide his confusion under an affectation of deep sympathy,
and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has been too much for
his understanding."not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?""The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?"exclaimed the faithful
Brandane, with the utmost horror and astonishment."Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye
and determined look, said to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his
mental devotion: "My liege!a minute or two since you left a word--one
word--unspoken.Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!""I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken
King, "and you bring it to me.Would you arm a madman with a
drawn weapon?my friend--my brother--my bosom
counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more
firmness than before: "My castle has no barrier against the power of
death.I have not deserved the foul suspicions which your Majesty's
words imply.I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation,
by the souls of our royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!"said the King: "add not perjury to murder.And was
this all done to gain a step nearer to a crown and sceptre?Take them
to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as I have done, that they are
both of red hot iron!thou hast at least escaped
being a king!""My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre
of Scotland are, when your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of
Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights.""True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child,
to his brother's perils!You have reminded
me that I have still work upon earth.Get thy Brandanes under arms with
what speed thou canst.Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to
thee.None in especial who has trafficked with the Duke of Albany--that
man, I mean, who calls himself my brother--and order my litter to
be instantly prepared.We will to Dunbarton, MacLouis, or to Bute.Precipices, and tides, and my Brandanes' hearts shall defend the child
till we can put oceans betwixt him and his cruel uncle's ambition.Farewell, Robert of Albany--farewell for ever, thou hard hearted, bloody
man!Enjoy such share of power as the Douglas may permit thee.But seek
not to see my face again, far less to approach my remaining child; for,
that hour thou dost, my guards shall have orders to stab thee down with
their partizans!The Duke of Albany left the presence without attempting further
justification or reply.In the ensuing Parliament, the Duke
of Albany prevailed on that body to declare him innocent of the death
of Rothsay, while, at the same time, he showed his own sense of guilt by
taking out a remission or pardon for the offence.The unhappy and aged
monarch secluded himself in his Castle of Rothsay, in Bute, to mourn
over the son he had lost, and watch with feverish anxiety over the life
of him who remained.As the best step for the youthful James's security,
he sent him to France to receive his education at the court of the
reigning sovereign.But the vessel in which the Prince of Scotland
sailed was taken by an English cruiser, and, although there was a truce
for the moment betwixt the kingdoms, Henry IV ungenerously detained him
a prisoner.This last blow completely broke the heart of the unhappy
King Robert III.Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the
treachery and cruelty of his brother.Robert of Albany's own grey hairs
went, indeed, in peace to the grave, and he transferred the regency
which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch.But, nineteen years
after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and
Duke Murdoch of Albany, with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in
expiation of his father's guilt and his own.The honest heart that's free frae a'
     Intended fraud or guile,
     However Fortune kick the ba',
     Has aye some cause to smile.We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the
horrible scene at Falkland by order of the Douglas, to be placed under
the protection of his daughter, the now widowed Duchess of Rothsay.That
lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay.It arose on
the summit of a precipitous rock, which descends on the princely river,
there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract called Campsie
Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic
rock, which intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands.Delighted with a site so romantic, the monks of the abbey of Cupar
reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named St.Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or
devotion.It had readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who
was its present inmate, as the country was under the influence of
the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas.There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which
conducted Catharine and the glee maiden to Campsie.Whatever reason
she might have to complain of Rothsay, his horrible and unexpected end
greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part of the
night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she
ordered Catharine Glover and the minstrel into her presence.The spirits
of both the young women had been much sunk and shaken by the dreadful
scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more
calculated to inspire awe than confidence.She spoke with kindness,
however, though apparently in deep affliction, and learned from them
all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and
inconsiderate husband.She appeared grateful for the efforts which
Catharine and the glee maiden had made, at their own extreme peril, to
save Rothsay from his horrible fate.She invited them to join in her
devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and
dismissed them to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in
particular, of her efficient protection, which should include, she said,
her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she herself
lived.They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of
a repast with her duennas and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound
sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which chilled the light heart
of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover.The friends, for so we may now term them,
were fain, therefore, to escape from the society of these persons, all
of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves but ill assorted with
a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with
pleasure go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent.A little
garden, with its bushes and fruit trees, advanced on one side of the
convent, so as to skirt the precipice, from which it was only separated
by a parapet built on the ledge of the rock, so low that the eye might
easily measure the depth of the crag, and gaze on the conflicting waters
which foamed, struggled, and chafed over the reef below.The Fair Maiden of Perth and her companion walked slowly on a path that
ran within this parapet, looked at the romantic prospect, and judged
what it must be when the advancing summer should clothe the grove with
leaves.At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which
she had been and was now placed."Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits?Strive to forget them as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if
we shake not from our mantles the raindrops as they fall.""These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine."Yet my
mind is at present anxious respecting my father's safety; and I cannot
but think how many brave men may be at this instant leaving the world,
even within six miles of us, or little farther.""You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's
equerry told us yesterday?It were a sight for a minstrel to witness.But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could never see swords
cross each other without being dazzled.But see--look yonder, May
Catharine--look yonder!That flying messenger certainly brings news of
the battle.""Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine."But if
it be he I think of, some wild thoughts are urging his speed."As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden.Louise's
little dog ran to meet him, barking furiously, but came back, to
cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for even dumb animals can
distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career.The
fugitive rushed into the garden at the same reckless pace.His head was
bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and all his other vestments
looked as if they had been lately drenched in water.His leathern
buskins were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood.His
countenance was wild, haggard, and highly excited, or, as the Scottish
phrase expresses it, much "raised."said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing
what was before him, as hares are said to do when severely pressed by
the greyhounds.But he stopped short when he heard his own name."Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all
this?Have the Clan Quhele sustained a defeat?""I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive,
after a moment's recollection."Yes, I was called Conachar when I was
happy, and Eachin when I was powerful.But now I have no name, and there
is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to
speak of that which is not to one who has no existence."unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?""If I am coward
and villain, have not villainy and cowardice command over the elements?Have I not braved the water without its choking me, and trod the firm
earth without its opening to devour me?He will not
harm me; but I fear he will do evil to himself.See how he stares down
on the roaring waterfall!"The glee woman hastened to do as she was ordered, and Conachar's half
frenzied spirit seemed relieved by her absence."Catharine," he said, "now she is gone, I will say I know thee--I know
thy love of peace and hatred of war.But hearken; I have, rather than
strike a blow at my enemy, given up all that a man calls dearest: I have
lost honour, fame, and friends, and such friends!(he placed his hands
before his face).All know my shame; all should see my sorrow.Yes, all
might see, but who would pity it?Catharine, as I ran like a madman down
the strath, man and woman called'shame' on me!The beggar to whom I
flung an alms, that I might purchase one blessing, threw it back in
disgust, and with a curse upon the coward!Each bell that tolled rung
out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!'The brute beasts in their lowing
and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!'The
faithful nine are still pursuing me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike
but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but
with a terrified glance towards the thicket, through which one or two
attendants were stealing, with the purpose of surprising him.But the
instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air
Eachin!"plunged down the precipice into the raging cataract beneath.It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed
to pieces in such a fall.But the river was swelled, and the remains of
the unhappy youth were never seen.A varying tradition has assigned more
than one supplement to the history.It is said by one account, that the
young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of
Campsie; and that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch,
he met with Father Clement, who had taken up his abode in the wilderness
as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees.He converted, it is
said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his
cell, sharing his devotion and privations, till death removed them in
succession.Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the
daione shie, or fairy folk, and that he continues to wander through wood
and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander, but carrying his sword in
his left hand.Sometimes he
seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage,
always flies.These legends are founded on two peculiar points in his
story--his evincing timidity and his committing suicide--both of them
circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in
his own house in Curfew Street, arrived that evening at the Place of
Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of a fever, in consequence
of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate.The affection of the glee maiden
rendered her so attentive and careful a nurse, that the glover said it
should not be his fault if she ever touched lute again, save for her own
amusement.It was some time ere Simon ventured to tell his daughter of Henry's late
exploits, and his severe wounds; and he took care to make the most of
the encouraging circumstance, that her faithful lover had refused both
honour and wealth rather than become a professed soldier and follow the
Douglas.Catharine sighed deeply and shook her head at the history of
bloody Palm Sunday on the North Inch.But apparently she had reflected
that men rarely advance in civilisation or refinement beyond the ideas
of their own age, and that a headlong and exuberant courage, like that
of Henry Smith, was, in the iron days in which they lived, preferable to
the deficiency which had led to Conachar's catastrophe.If she had
any doubts on the subject, they were removed in due time by Henry's
protestations, so soon as restored health enabled him to plead his own
cause."I should blush to say, Catharine, that I am even sick of the thoughts
of doing battle.Yonder last field showed carnage enough to glut a
tiger.I am therefore resolved to hang up my broadsword, never to be
drawn more unless against the enemies of Scotland.""And should Scotland call for it," said Catharine, "I will buckle it
round you.""And, Catharine," said the joyful glover, "we will pay largely for soul
masses for those who have fallen by Henry's sword; and that will not
only cure spiritual flaws, but make us friends with the church again.""For that purpose, father," said Catharine, "the hoards of the wretched
Dwining may be applied.He bequeathed them to me; but I think you would
not mix his base blood money with your honest gains?""I would bring the plague into my house as soon," said the resolute
glover.The treasures of the wicked apothecary were distributed accordingly
among the four monasteries; nor was there ever after a breath of
suspicion concerning the orthodoxy of old Simon or his daughter.Henry and Catharine were married within four months after the battle
of the North Inch, and never did the corporations of the glovers and
hammermen trip their sword dance so featly as at the wedding of the
boldest burgess and brightest maiden in Perth.Ten months after, a
gallant infant filled the well spread cradle, and was rocked by Louise
to the tune of--

     Bold and true,
     In bonnet blue.The names of the boy's sponsors are recorded, as "Ane Hie and Michty
Lord, Archibald Erl of Douglas, ane Honorabil and gude Knicht, Schir
Patrick Charteris of Kinfauns, and ane Gracious Princess, Marjory
Dowaire of his Serene Highness David, umquhile Duke of Rothsay."Under such patronage a family rises fast; and several of the most
respected houses in Scotland, but especially in Perthshire, and many
individuals distinguished both in arts and arms, record with pride their
descent from the Gow Chrom and the Fair Maid of Perth.Next day, the Princess, when Turgi was removing the dinner,
slipped into his hand a bit of paper on which she had pricked with a pin a
request for a word from her brother's own hand.Turgi gave this paper to
Clery, who conveyed it to the King the same evening; and he, being allowed
writing materials while preparing his defence, wrote Madame Elisabeth a
short note.An answer was conveyed in a ball of cotton, which Turgi threw
under Clery's bed while passing the door of his room.Letters were also
passed between the Princess's room and that of Clery, who lodged beneath
her, by means of a string let down and drawn up at night.This
communication with his family was a great comfort to the King, who,
nevertheless, constantly cautioned his faithful servant."Take care," he
would say kindly, "you expose yourself too much."[The King's natural benevolence was constantly shown while in the Temple.His own dreadful position never prevented him from sympathy with the
smaller troubles of others.A servant in the Temple named Marchand, the
father of a family, was robbed of two hundred francs, --his wages for two
months.The King observed his distress, asked its cause, and gave Clery
the amount to be handed to Marchand, with a caution not to speak of it to
any one, and, above all, not to thank the King, lest it should injure him
with his employers.]During his separation from his family the King refused to go into the
garden.When it was proposed to him he said, "I cannot make up my mind to
go out alone; the walk was agreeable to me only when I shared it with my
family."But he did not allow himself to dwell on painful reflections.He talked freely to the municipals on guard, and surprised them by his
varied and practical knowledge of their trades, and his interest in their
domestic affairs.On the 19th December the King's breakfast was served as
usual; but, being a fast-day, he refused to take anything.At dinner-time
the King said to Clery, "Fourteen years ago you were up earlier than you
were to-day; it is the day my daughter was born--today, her birthday," he
repeated, with tears, "and to be prevented from seeing her!"Madame
Royale had wished for a calendar; the King ordered Clery to buy her the
"Almanac of the Republic," which had replaced the "Court Almanac," and ran
through it, marking with a pencil many names."On Christmas Day," Says Clery, "the King wrote his will."[Madame Royale says: "On the 26th December, St.Stephen's Day, my father
made his will, because he expected to be assassinated that day on his way
to the bar of the Convention.He went thither, nevertheless, with his
usual calmness."On the 26th December, 1792, the King appeared a second time before the
Convention.M. de Seze, labouring night and day, had completed his
defence.The King insisted on excluding from it all that was too
rhetorical, and confining it to the mere discussion of essential points.[When the pathetic peroration of M, de Seze was read to the King, the
evening before it was delivered to the Assembly, "I have to request of
you," he said, "to make a painful sacrifice; strike out of your pleading
the peroration.It is enough for me to appear before such judges, and
show my entire innocence; I will not move their feelings.--"LACRETELLE.]At half-past nine in the morning the whole armed force was in motion to
conduct him from the Temple to the Feuillans, with the same precautions
and in the same order as had been observed on the former occasion.Riding
in the carriage of the Mayor, he conversed, on the way, with the same
composure as usual, and talked of Seneca, of Livy, of the hospitals.Arrived at the Feuillans, he showed great anxiety for his defenders; he
seated himself beside them in the Assembly, surveyed with great composure
the benches where his accusers and his judges sat, seemed to examine their
faces with the view of discovering the impression produced by the pleading
of M. de Seze, and more than once conversed smilingly with Tronchet and
Malesherbes.The Assembly received his defence in sullen silence, but
without any tokens of disapprobation.Being afterwards conducted to an adjoining room with his counsel, the King
showed great anxiety about M. de Seze, who seemed fatigued by the long
defence.While riding back to the Temple he conversed with his companions
with the same serenity as he had shown on leaving it.No sooner had the King left the hall of the Convention than a violent
tumult arose there.Others,
complaining of the delays which postponed the decision of this process,
demanded the vote immediately, remarking that in every court, after the
accused had been heard, the judges proceed to give their opinion.Lanjuinais had from the commencement of the proceedings felt an
indignation which his impetuous disposition no longer suffered him to
repress.He darted to the tribune, and, amidst the cries excited by his
presence, demanded the annulling of the proceedings altogether.He
exclaimed that the days of ferocious men were gone by, that the Assembly
ought not to be so dishonoured as to be made to sit in judgment on Louis
XVI., that no authority in France had that right, and the Assembly in
particular had no claim to it; that if it resolved to act as a political
body, it could do no more than take measures of safety against the
ci-devant King; but that if it was acting as a court of justice it was
overstepping all principles, for it was subjecting the vanquished to be
tried by the conquerors, since most of the present members had declared
themselves the conspirators of the 10th of August.At the word
"conspirators" a tremendous uproar arose on all aides.Lanjuinais strove in vain to justify the word "conspirators," saying that
he meant it to be taken in a favourable sense, and that the 10th of August
was a glorious conspiracy.He concluded by declaring that he would rather
die a thousand deaths than condemn, contrary to all laws, even the most
execrable of tyrants.A great number of speakers followed, and the confusion continually
increased.The members, determined not to hear any more, mingled
together, formed groups, abused and threatened one another.After a
tempest of an hour's duration, tranquillity was at last restored; and the
Assembly, adopting the opinion of those who demanded the discussion on the
trial of Louis XVI., declared that it was opened, and that it should be
continued, to the exclusion of all other business, till sentence should be
passed.The discussion was accordingly resumed on the 27th, and there was a
constant succession of speakers from the 28th to the 31st.Vergniaud at
length ascended the tribune for the first time, and an extraordinary
eagerness was manifested to hear the Girondists express their sentiments
by the lips of their greatest orator.The speech of Vergniaud produced a deep impression on all his hearers.Robespierre was thunderstruck by his earnest and, persuasive eloquence.Vergniaud, however, had but shaken, not convinced, the Assembly, which
wavered between the two parties.Several members were successively heard,
for and against the appeal to the people.Brissot, Gensonne, Petion,
supported it in their turn.One speaker at length had a decisive
influence on the question.Barere, by his suppleness, and his cold and
evasive eloquence, was the model and oracle of the centre.He spoke at
great length on the trial, reviewed it in all its bearings--of facts, of
laws, and of policy--and furnished all those weak minds, who only wanted
specious reasons for yielding, with motives for the condemnation of the
King.The
discussion lasted till the 7th, and nobody would listen any longer to the
continual repetition of the same facts and arguments.It was therefore
declared to be closed without opposition, but the proposal of a fresh
adjournment excited a commotion among the most violent, and ended in a
decree which fixed the 14th of January for putting the questions to the
vote.Meantime the King did not allow the torturing suspense to disturb his
outward composure, or lessen his kindness to those around him.On the
morning after his second appearance at the bar of the Convention, the
commissary Vincent, who had undertaken secretly to convey to the Queen a
copy of the King's printed defence, asked for something which had belonged
to him, to treasure as a relic; the King took off his neck handkerchief
and gave it him; his gloves he bestowed on another municipal, who had made
the same request."On January 1st," says Clery, "I approached the King's
bed and asked permission to offer him my warmest prayers for the end of
his misfortunes.'I accept your good wishes with affection,' he replied,
extending his hand to me.As soon as he had risen, he requested a
municipal to go and inquire for his family, and present them his good
wishes for the new year.The officers were moved by the tone in which
these words, so heartrending considering the position of the King, were
pronounced.The correspondence between their Majesties went on
constantly.The King being informed that Madame Royale was ill, was very
uneasy for some days.The Queen, after begging earnestly, obtained
permission for M. Brunnier, the medical attendant of the royal children,
to come to the Temple.The nearer the moment which was to decide the King's fate approached, the
greater became the agitation in, Paris."A report was circulated that the
atrocities of September were to be repeated there, and the prisoners and
their relatives beset the deputies with supplications that they would
snatch them from destruction.The Jacobins, on their part, alleged that
conspiracies were hatching in all quarters to save Louis XVI.from
punishment, and to restore royalty.Their anger, excited by delays and
obstacles, assumed a more threatening aspect; and the two parties thus
alarmed one another by supposing that each harboured sinister designs."On the 14th of January the Convention called for the order of the day,
being the final judgment of Louis XVI."The sitting of the Convention which concluded the trial," says Hazlitt,
"lasted seventy-two hours.It might naturally be supposed that silence,
restraint, a sort of religious awe, would have pervaded the scene.On the
contrary, everything bore the marks of gaiety, dissipation, and the most
grotesque confusion.The farther end of the hall was converted into
boxes, where ladies, in a studied deshabille, swallowed ices, oranges,
liqueurs, and received the salutations of the members who went and came,
as on ordinary occasions.Here the doorkeepers on the Mountain side
opened and shut the boxes reserved for the mistresses of the Duc
d'Orleans; and there, though every sound of approbation or disapprobation
was strictly forbidden, you heard the long and indignant 'Ha, ha's!'of
the mother-duchess, the patroness of the bands of female Jacobins,
whenever her ears were not loudly greeted with the welcome sounds of
death.The upper gallery, reserved for the people, was during the whole
trial constantly full of strangers of every description, drinking wine as
in a tavern."Bets were made as to the issue of the trial in all the neighbouring
coffee-houses.Ennui, impatience, disgust sat on almost every
countenance.The figures passing and repassing, rendered more ghastly by
the pallid lights, and who in a slow, sepulchral voice pronounced only the
word--Death; others calculating if they should have time to go to dinner
before they gave their verdict; women pricking cards with pins in order to
count the votes; some of the deputies fallen asleep, and only waking up to
give their sentence,--all this had the appearance rather of a hideous
dream than of a reality."The Duc d'Orleans, when called on to give his vote for the death of his
King and relation, walked with a faltering step, and a face paler than
death itself, to the appointed place, and there read these words:
"Exclusively governed by my duty, and convinced that all those who have
resisted the sovereignty of the people deserve death, my vote is for
death!"Important as the accession of the first Prince of the blood was
to the Terrorist faction, his conduct in this instance was too obviously
selfish and atrocious not to excite a general feeling of indignation; the
agitation of the Assembly became extreme; it seemed as if by this single
vote the fate of the monarch was irrevocably sealed.The President having examined the register, the result of the scrutiny was
proclaimed as follows


     Against an appeal to the people........... 480
     For an appeal to the people............... 283

     Majority for final judgment............... 197


The President having announced that he was about to declare the result of
the scrutiny, a profound silence ensued, and he then gave in the following
declaration: that, out of 719 votes, 366 were for DEATH, 319 were for
imprisonment during the war, two for perpetual imprisonment, eight for a
suspension of the execution of the sentence of death until after the
expulsion of the family of the Bourbons, twenty-three were for not putting
him to death until the French territory was invaded by any foreign power,
and one was for a sentence of death, but with power of commutation of the
punishment.After this enumeration the President took off his hat, and, lowering his
voice, said: "In consequence of this expression of opinion I declare that
the punishment pronounced by the National Convention against Louis Capet
is DEATH!"Previous to the passing of the sentence the President announced on the
part of the Foreign Minister the receipt of a letter from the Spanish
Minister relative to that sentence.The Convention, however, refused to
hear it.[It will be remembered that a similar remonstrance was forwarded
by the English Government.]M. de Malesherbes, according to his promise to the King, went to the
Temple at nine o'clock on the morning of the 17th?.During the calling of the votes
he asked M. de Malesherbes, "Have you not met near the Temple the White
Lady?""Do you not know," resumed the
King with a smile, "that when a prince of our house is about to die, a
female dressed in white is seen wandering about the palace?My friends,"
added he to his defenders, "I am about to depart before you for the land
of the just, but there, at least, we shall be reunited."In fact, his
Majesty's only apprehension seemed to be for his family.--ALISON.]"All is lost," he said to Clery.The King, who
saw him arrive, rose to receive him.[When M. de Malesherbes went to the Temple to announce the result of the
vote, he found Louis with his forehead resting on his hands, and absorbed
in a deep reverie.Without inquiring concerning his fate, he said: "For
two hours I have been considering whether, during my whole reign, I have
voluntarily given any cause of complaint to my subjects; and with perfect
sincerity I declare that I deserve no reproach at their hands, and that I
have never formed a wish but for their happiness."M. de Malesherbes, choked by sobs, threw himself at his feet.The King
raised him up and affectionately embraced him.When he could control his
voice, De Malesherbes informed the King of the decree sentencing him to
death; he made no movement of surprise or emotion, but seemed only
affected by the distress of his advocate, whom he tried to comfort.On the 20th of January, at two in the afternoon, Louis XVI.was awaiting
his advocates, when he heard the approach of a numerous party.He stopped
with dignity at the door of his apartment, apparently unmoved: Garat then
told him sorrowfully that he was commissioned to communicate to him the
decrees of the Convention.Grouvelle, secretary of the Executive Council,
read them to him.guilty of treason against
the general safety of the State; the second condemned him to death; the
third rejected any appeal to the people; and the fourth and last ordered
his execution in twenty-four hours.Louis, looking calmly round, took the
paper from Grouvelle, and read Garat a letter, in which he demanded from
the Convention three days to prepare for death, a confessor to assist him
in his last moments, liberty to see his family, and permission for them to
leave France.Garat took the letter, promising to submit it immediately
to the Convention.then went back into his room with great composure, ordered his
dinner, and ate as usual.There were no knives on the table, and his
attendants refused to let him have any."Do they think me so cowardly,"
he exclaimed, "as to lay violent hands on myself?I am innocent, and I am
not afraid to die."The Convention refused the delay, but granted some other demands which he
had made.Garat sent for Edgeworth de Firmont, the ecclesiastic whom
Louis XVI.had chosen, and took him in his own carriage to the Temple.M.
Edgeworth, on being ushered into the presence of the King, would have
thrown himself at his feet, but Louis instantly raised him, and both shed
tears of emotion.He then, with eager curiosity, asked various questions
concerning the clergy of France, several bishops, and particularly the
Archbishop of Paris, requesting him to assure the latter that he died
faithfully attached to his communion.--The clock having struck eight, he
rose, begged M. Edgeworth to wait, and retired with emotion, saying that
he was going to see his family.The municipal officers, unwilling to lose
sight of the King, even while with his family, had decided that he should
see them in the dining-room, which had a glass door, through which they
could watch all his motions without hearing what he said.At half-past
eight the door opened.The Queen, holding the Dauphin by the hand, Madame
Elisabeth, and Madame Royale rushed sobbing into the arms of Louis XVI.The door was closed, and the municipal officers, Clery, and M. Edgeworth
placed themselves behind it.During the first moments, it was but a scene
of confusion and despair.Cries and lamentations prevented those who were
on the watch from distinguishing anything.At length the conversation
became more calm, and the Princesses, still holding the King clasped in
their arms, spoke with him in a low tone."He related his trial to my
mother," says Madame Royale, "apologising for the wretches who had
condemned him.He told her that he would not consent to any attempt to
save him, which might excite disturbance in the country.He then gave my
brother some religious advice, and desired him, above all, to forgive
those who caused his death; and he gave us his blessing.My mother was
very desirous that the whole family should pass the night with my father,
but he opposed this, observing to her that he much needed some hours of
repose and quiet."After a long conversation, interrupted by silence and
grief, the King put an end to the painful meeting, agreeing to see his
family again at eight the next morning."Yes, yes," sorrowfully replied the
King.["But when we were gone," says his daughter, "he requested that we might
not be permitted to return, as our presence afflicted him too much."]At this moment the Queen held him by one arm, Madame Elisabeth by the
other, while Madame Royale clasped him round the waist, and the Dauphin
stood before him, with one hand in that of his mother.At the moment of
retiring Madame Royale fainted; she was carried away, and the King
returned to M. Edgeworth deeply depressed by this painful interview.The
King retired to rest about midnight; M. Edgeworth threw himself upon a
bed, and Clery took his place near the pillow of his master.Next morning, the 21st of January, at five, the King awoke, called Clery,
and dressed with great calmness.He congratulated himself on having
recovered his strength by sleep.Clery kindled a fire,, and moved a chest
of drawers, out of which he formed an altar.M. Edgeworth put on his
pontifical robes, and began to celebrate mass.Clery waited on him, and
the King listened, kneeling with the greatest devotion.He then received
the communion from the hands of M. Edgeworth, and after mass rose with new
vigour, and awaited with composure the moment for going to the scaffold.He asked for scissors that Clery might cut his hair; but the Commune
refused to trust him with a pair.At this moment the drums were beating in the capital.All who belonged to
the armed sections repaired to their company with complete submission.It
was reported that four or five hundred devoted men, were to make a dash
upon the carriage, and rescue the King.The Convention, the Commune, the
Executive Council, and the Jacobins were sitting.in the
morning, Santerre, with a deputation from the Commune, the department, and
the criminal tribunal, repaired to the Temple.Louis XVI., on hearing
them arrive, rose and prepared to depart.He desired Clery to transmit
his last farewell to his wife, his sister, and his children; he gave him a
sealed packet, hair, and various trinkets, with directions to deliver
these articles to them.[In the course of the morning the King said to me: "You will give this
seal to my son and this ring to the Queen, and assure her that it is with
pain I part with it.This little packet contains the hair of all my
family; you will give her that, too.Tell the Queen, my dear sister, and
my children, that, although I promised to see them again this morning, I
have resolved to spare them the pang of so cruel a separation.Tell them
how much it costs me to go away without receiving their embraces once
more!"He wiped away some tears, and then added, in the most mournful
accents, "I charge you to bear them my last farewell."--CLERY.]He then clasped his hand and thanked him for his services.After this he
addressed himself to one of the municipal officers, requesting him to
transmit his last will to the Commune.This officer, who had formerly
been a priest, and was named Jacques Roux, brutally replied that his
business was to conduct him to execution, and not to perform his
commissions.Another person took charge of it, and Louis, turning towards
the party, gave with firmness the signal for starting.Officers of gendarmerie were placed on the front seat of the carriage.The
King and M. Edgeworth occupied the back.During the ride, which was
rather long, the King read in M. Edgeworth's breviary the prayers for
persons at the point of death; the two gendarmes were astonished at his
piety and tranquil resignation.The vehicle advanced slowly, and amidst
universal silence.At the Place de la Revolution an extensive space had
been left vacant about the scaffold.Around this space were planted
cannon; the most violent of the Federalists were stationed about the
scaffold; and the vile rabble, always ready to insult genius, virtue, and
misfortune, when a signal is given it to do so, crowded behind the ranks
of the Federalists, and alone manifested some outward tokens of
satisfaction.Louis XVI., rising briskly,
stepped out into the Place.Three executioners came up; he refused their
assistance, and took off his clothes himself.But, perceiving that they
were going to bind his hands, he made a movement of indignation, and
seemed ready to resist.M. Edgeworth gave him a last look, and said,
"Suffer this outrage, as a last resemblance to that God who is about to be
your reward."At these words the King suffered himself to be bound and
conducted to the scaffold.All at once Louis hurriedly advanced to
address the people."Frenchmen," said he, in a firm voice, "I die
innocent of the crimes which are imputed to me; I forgive the authors of
my death, and I pray that my blood may not fall upon France."He would
have continued, but the drums were instantly ordered to beat: their
rolling drowned his voice; the executioners laid hold of him, and M.
Edgeworth took his leave in these memorable words: "Son of Saint Louis,
ascend to heaven!"As soon as the blood flowed, furious wretches dipped
their pikes and handkerchiefs in it, then dispersed throughout Paris,
shouting "Vive la Republique!and even went to the
gates of the Temple to display brutal and factious joy.[The body of Louis was, immediately after the execution, removed to the
ancient cemetery of the Madeleine.Large quantities of quicklime were
thrown into the grave, which occasioned so rapid a decomposition that,
when his remains were sought for in 1816, it was with difficulty any part
could be recovered.Over the spot where he was interred Napoleon
commenced the splendid Temple of Glory, after the battle of Jena; and the
superb edifice was completed by the Bourbons, and now forms the Church of
the Madeleine, the most beautiful structure in Paris.Louis was executed
on the same ground where the Queen, Madame Elisabeth, and so many other
noble victims of the Revolution perished; where Robespierre and Danton
afterwards suffered; and where the Emperor Alexander and the allied
sovereigns took their station, when their victorious troops entered Paris
in 1814!The history of modern Europe has not a scene fraught with
equally interesting recollections to exhibit.It is now marked by the
colossal obelisk of blood-red granite which was brought from Thebes, in
Upper Egypt, in 1833, by the French Government.--ALLISON.]The Royal Prisoners.--Separation of the Dauphin from His Family.On the morning of the King's execution, according to the narrative of
Madame Royale, his family rose at six: "The night before, my mother had
scarcely strength enough to put my brother to bed; She threw herself,
dressed as she was, on her own bed, where we heard her shivering with cold
and grief all night long.At a quarter-past six the door opened; we
believed that we were sent for to the King, but it was only the officers
looking for a prayer-book for him.We did not, however, abandon the hope
of seeing him, till shouts of joy from the infuriated populace told us
that all was over.In the afternoon my mother asked to see Clery, who
probably had some message for her; we hoped that seeing him would occasion
a burst of grief which might relieve the state of silent and choking agony
in which we saw her."The request was refused, and the officers who
brought the refusal said Clery was in "a frightful state of despair" at
not being allowed to see the royal family; shortly afterwards he was
dismissed from the Temple."We had now a little more freedom," continues the Princess; "our guards
even believed that we were about to be sent out of France; but nothing
could calm my mother's agony; no hope could touch her heart, and life or
death became indifferent to her.Fortunately my own affliction increased
my illness so seriously that it distracted her thoughts.My
mother would go no more to the garden, because she must have passed the
door of what had been my father's room, and that she could not bear.But
fearing lest want of air should prove injurious to my brother and me,
about the end of February she asked permission to walk on the leads of the
Tower, and it was granted."The Council of the Commune, becoming aware of the interest which these sad
promenades excited, and the sympathy with which they were observed from
the neighbouring houses, ordered that the spaces between the battlements
should be filled up with shutters, which intercepted the view.But while
the rules for the Queen's captivity were again made more strict, some of
the municipal commissioners tried slightly to alleviate it, and by means
of M. de Hue, who was at liberty in Paris, and the faithful Turgi, who
remained in the Tower, some communications passed between the royal family
and their friends.The wife of Tison, who waited on the Queen, suspected
and finally denounced these more lenient guardians,--[Toulan, Lepitre,
Vincent, Bruno, and others.]--who were executed, the royal prisoners being
subjected to a close examination."On the 20th of April," says Madame Royale, "my mother and I had just gone
to bed when Hebert arrived with several municipals.We got up hastily,
and these men read us a decree of the Commune directing that we should be
searched.My poor brother was asleep; they tore him from his bed under
the pretext of examining it.My mother took him up, shivering with cold.All they took was a shopkeeper's card which my mother had happened to
keep, a stick of sealing-wax from my aunt, and from me 'une sacre coeur de
Jesus' and a prayer for the welfare of France.The search lasted from
half-past ten at night till four o'clock in the morning."The next visit of the officials was to Madame Elisabeth alone; they found
in her room a hat which the King had worn during his imprisonment, and
which she had begged him to give her as a souvenir.They took it from her
in spite of her entreaties."It was suspicious," said the cruel and
contemptible tyrants.The Dauphin became ill with fever, and it was long before his mother, who
watched by him night and day, could obtain medicine or advice for him.When Thierry was at last allowed to see him his treatment relieved the
most violent symptoms, but, says Madame Royale, "his health was never
reestablished.Want of air and exercise did him great mischief, as well
as the kind of life which this poor child led, who at eight years of age
passed his days amidst the tears of his friends, and in constant anxiety
and agony."While the Dauphin's health was causing his family such alarm, they were
deprived of the services of Tison's wife, who became ill, and finally
insane, and was removed to the Hotel Dieu, where her ravings were reported
to the Assembly and made the ground of accusations against the royal
prisoners.[This woman, troubled by remorse, lost her reason, threw herself at the
feet of the Queen, implored her pardon, and disturbed the Temple for many
days with the sight and the noise of her madness.The Princesses,
forgetting the denunciations of this unfortunate being, in consideration
of her repentance and insanity, watched over her by turns, and deprived
themselves of their own food to relieve her.--LAMARTINE, "History of the
Girondists," vol.No woman took her place, and the Princesses themselves made their beds,
swept their rooms, and waited upon the Queen.Far worse punishments than menial work were prepared for them.On 3d July
a decree of the Convention ordered that the Dauphin should be separated
from his family and "placed in the most secure apartment of the Tower."As soon as he heard this decree pronounced, says his sister, "he threw
himself into my mother's arms, and with violent cries entreated not to be
parted from her.My mother would not let her son go, and she actually
defended against the efforts of the officers the bed in which she had
placed him.The men threatened to call up the guard and use violence.My
mother exclaimed that they had better kill her than tear her child from
her.At last they threatened our lives, and my mother's maternal
tenderness forced her to the sacrifice.My aunt and I dressed the child,
for my poor mother had no longer strength for anything.Nevertheless, when
he was dressed, she took him up in her arms and delivered him herself to
the officers, bathing him with her tears, foreseeing that she was never to
behold him again.The poor little fellow embraced us all tenderly, and
was carried away in a flood of tears.My mother's horror was extreme when
she heard that Simon, a shoemaker by trade, whom she had seen as a
municipal officer in the Temple, was the person to whom her child was
confided.The officers now no longer remained in my mother's
apartment; they only came three times a day to bring our meals and examine
the bolts and bars of our windows; we were locked up together night and
day.We often went up to the Tower, because my brother went, too, from
the other side.The only pleasure my mother enjoyed was seeing him
through a crevice as he passed at a distance.She would watch for hours
together to see him as he passed.It was her only hope, her only
thought."The Queen was soon deprived even of this melancholy consolation.On 1st
August, 1793, it was resolved that she should be tried.Robespierre
opposed the measure, but Barere roused into action that deep-rooted hatred
of the Queen which not even the sacrifice of her life availed to
eradicate."Why do the enemies of the Republic still hope for success?""Is it because we have too long forgotten the crimes of the
Austrian?The children of Louis the Conspirator are hostages for the
Republic..but behind them lurks a woman who has been the cause of
all the disasters of France."At two o'clock on the morning of the following day, the municipal officers
"awoke us," says Madame Royale, "to read to my mother the decree of the
Convention, which ordered her removal to the Conciergerie,

[The Conciergerie was originally, as its name implies, the porter's lodge
of the ancient Palace of Justice, and became in time a prison, from the
custom of confining there persons who had committed trifling offences
about the Court.]She heard it without visible emotion, and
without speaking a single word.My aunt and I immediately asked to be
allowed to accompany my mother, but this favour was refused us.All the
time my mother was making up a bundle of clothes to take with her, these
officers never left her.She was even obliged to dress herself before
them, and they asked for her pockets, taking away the trifles they
contained.She embraced me, charging me to keep up my spirits and my
courage, to take tender care of my aunt, and obey her as a second mother.She then threw herself into my aunt's arms, and recommended her children
to her care; my aunt replied to her in a whisper, and she was then hurried
away.In leaving the Temple she struck her head against the wicket, not
having stooped low enough.[Mathieu, the gaoler, used to say, "I make Madame Veto and her sister and
daughter, proud though they are, salute me; for the door is so low they
cannot pass without bowing."]'No,' she replied,
'nothing can hurt me now."We have already seen what changes had been made in the Temple.Marie
Antoinette had been separated from her sister, her daughter, and her Son,
by virtue of a decree which ordered the trial and exile of the last
members of the family of the Bourbons.She had been removed to the
Conciergerie, and there, alone in a narrow prison, she was reduced to what
was strictly necessary, like the other prisoners.The imprudence of a
devoted friend had rendered her situation still more irksome.Michonnis, a
member of the municipality, in whom she had excited a warm interest, was
desirous of introducing to her a person who, he said, wished to see her
out of curiosity.This man, a courageous emigrant, threw to her a
carnation, in which was enclosed a slip of very fine paper with these
words: "Your friends are ready,"--false hope, and equally dangerous for
her who received it, and for him who gave it!Michonnis and the emigrant
were detected and forthwith apprehended; and the vigilance exercised in
regard to the unfortunate prisoner became from that day more rigorous than
ever.[The Queen was lodged in a room called the council chamber, which was
considered as the moat unwholesome apartment in the Conciergerie on
account of its dampness and the bad smells by which it was continually
affected.Under pretence of giving her a person to wait upon her they
placed near her a spy,--a man of a horrible countenance and hollow,
sepulchral voice.This wretch, whose name was Barassin, was a robber and
murderer by profession.Such was the chosen attendant on the Queen of
France!A few days before her trial this wretch was removed and a
gendarme placed in her chamber, who watched over her night and day, and
from whom she was not separated, even when in bed, but by a ragged
curtain.In this melancholy abode Marie Antoinette had no other dress
than an old black gown, stockings with holes, which she was forced to mend
every day; and she was entirely destitute of shoes.--DU  BROCA.]Gendarmes were to mount guard incessantly at the door of her prison, and
they were expressly forbidden to answer anything that she might say to
them.That wretch Hebert, the deputy of Chaumette, and editor of the disgusting
paper Pere Duchesne, a writer of the party of which Vincent, Ronsin,
Varlet, and Leclerc were the leaders--Hebert had made it his particular
business to torment the unfortunate remnant of the dethroned family.He
asserted that the family of the tyrant ought not to be better treated than
any sans-culotte family; and he had caused a resolution to be passed by
which the sort of luxury in which the prisoners in the Temple were
maintained was to be suppressed.They were no longer to be allowed either
poultry or pastry; they were reduced to one sort of aliment for breakfast,
and to soup or broth and a single dish for dinner, to two dishes for
supper, and half a bottle of wine apiece.Tallow candles were to be
furnished instead of wag, pewter instead of silver plate, and delft ware
instead of porcelain.The wood and water carriers alone were permitted to
enter their room, and that only accompanied by two commissioners.Their
food was to be introduced to them by means of a turning box.The numerous
establishment was reduced to a cook and an assistant, two men-servants,
and a woman-servant to attend to the linen.As soon as this resolution was passed, Hebert had repaired to the Temple
and inhumanly taken away from the unfortunate prisoners even the most
trifling articles to which they attached a high value.Eighty Louis which
Madame Elisabeth had in reserve, and which she had received from Madame de
Lamballe, were also taken away.No one is more dangerous, more cruel,
than the man without acquirements, without education, clothed with a
recent authority.If, above all, he possess a base nature, if, like
Hebert, who was check-taker at the door of a theatre, and embezzled money
out of the receipts, he be destitute of natural morality, and if he leap
all at once from the mud of his condition into power, he is as mean as he
is atrocious.Such was Hebert in his conduct at the Temple.He did not
confine himself to the annoyances which we have mentioned.He and some
others conceived the idea of separating the young Prince from his aunt and
sister.A shoemaker named Simon and his wife were the instructors to whom
it was deemed right to consign him for the purpose of giving him a
sans-cullotte education.Simon and his wife were shut up in the Temple,
and, becoming prisoners with the unfortunate child, were directed to bring
him up in their own way.Their food was better than that of the
Princesses, and they shared the table of the municipal commissioners who
were on duty.Simon was permitted to go down, accompanied by two
commissioners, to the court of the Temple, for the purpose of giving the
Dauphin a little exercise.Hebert conceived the infamous idea of wringing from this boy revelations
to criminate his unhappy mother.Whether this wretch imputed to the child
false revelations, or abused his, tender age and his condition to extort
from him what admissions soever he pleased, he obtained a revolting
deposition; and as the youth of the Prince did not admit of his being
brought before the tribunal, Hebert appeared and detailed the infamous
particulars which he had himself either dictated or invented.It was on the 14th of October that Marie Antoinette appeared before her
judges.Dragged before the sanguinary tribunal by inexorable
revolutionary vengeance, she appeared there without any chance of
acquittal, for it was not to obtain her acquittal that the Jacobins had
brought her before it.It was necessary, however, to make some charges.Fouquier therefore collected the rumours current among the populace ever
since the arrival of the Princess in France, and, in the act of
accusation, he charged her with having plundered the exchequer, first for
her pleasures, and afterwards in order to transmit money to her brother,
the Emperor.He insisted on the scenes of the 5th and 6th of October, and
on the dinners of the Life Guards, alleging that she had at that period
framed a plot, which obliged the people to go to Versailles to frustrate
it.He afterwards accused her of having governed her husband, interfered
in the choice of ministers, conducted the intrigues with the deputies
gained by the Court, prepared the journey to Varennes, provoked the war,
and transmitted to the enemy's generals all our plans of campaign.He
further accused her of having prepared a new conspiracy on the 10th of
August, of having on that day caused the people to be fired upon, having
induced her husband to defend himself by taxing him with cowardice;
lastly, of having never ceased to plot and correspond with foreigners
since her captivity in the Temple, and of having there treated her young
son as King.We here observe how, on the terrible day of long-deferred
vengeance, when subjects at length break forth and strike such of their
princes as have not deserved the blow, everything is distorted and
converted into crime.We see how the profusion and fondness for pleasure,
so natural to a young princess, how her attachment to her native country,
her influence over her husband, her regrets, always more indiscreet in a
woman than a man, nay, even her bolder courage, appeared to their inflamed
or malignant imaginations.Lecointre, deputy of Versailles,
who had seen what had passed on the 5th and 6th of October, Hebert, who
had frequently visited the Temple, various clerks in the ministerial
offices, and several domestic servants of the old Court were summoned..
Admiral d'Estaing, formerly commandant of the guard of Versailles; Manuel,
the ex-procureur of the Commune; Latour-du-Pin, minister of war in 1789;
the venerable Bailly, who, it was said, had been, with La Fayette, an
accomplice in the journey to Varennes; lastly, Valaze one of the
Girondists destined to the scaffold, were taken from their prisons and
compelled to give evidence.Some had seen the Queen in high spirits
when the Life Guards testified their attachment; others had seen her vexed
and dejected while being conducted to Paris, or brought back from
Varennes; these had been present at splendid festivities which must have
cost enormous sums; those had heard it said in the ministerial offices
that the Queen was adverse to the sanction of the decrees.An ancient
waiting-woman of the Queen had heard the Duc de Coigny say, in 1788, that
the Emperor had already received two hundred millions from France to make
war upon the Turks.The cynical Hebert, being brought before the unfortunate Queen, dared at
length to prefer the charges wrung from the young Prince.He said that
Charles Capet had given Simon an account of the journey to Varennes, and
mentioned La Fayette and Bailly as having cooperated in it.He then added
that this boy was addicted to odious and very premature vices for his age;
that he had been surprised by Simon, who, on questioning him, learned that
he derived from his mother the vices in which he indulged.Hebert said
that it was no doubt the intention of Marie Antoinette, by weakening thus,
early the physical constitution of her son, to secure to herself the means
of ruling him in case he should ever ascend the throne.The rumours which
had been whispered for twenty years by a malicious Court had given the
people a most unfavourable opinion of the morals of the Queen.That
audience, however, though wholly Jacobin, was disgusted at the accusations
of Hebert.[Can there be a more infernal invention than that made against the.Queen
by Hdbert,--namely, that she had had an improper intimacy with her own
son?He made use of this sublime idea of which he boasted in order to
prejudice the women against the Queen, and to prevent her execution from
exciting pity.It had, however, no other effect than that of disgusting
all parties.--PRUDHOMME.][Hebert did not long survive her in whose sufferings he had taken such an
infamous part.He was executed on 26th March, 1794.]Urged a new to explain herself, she
said, with extraordinary emotion, "I thought that human nature would
excuse me from answering such an imputation, but I appeal from it to the
heart of every mother here present."This noble and simple reply affected
all who heard it.In the depositions of the witnesses, however, all was not so bitter for
Marie Antoinette.The brave D'Estaing, whose enemy she had been, would
not say anything to inculpate her, and spoke only of the courage which she
had shown on the 5th and 6th of October, and of the noble resolution which
she had expressed, to die beside her husband rather than fly.Manuel, in
spite of his enmity to the Court during the time of the Legislative
Assembly, declared that he could not say anything against the accused.When the venerable Bailly was brought forward, who formerly so often
predicted to the Court the calamities which its imprudence must produce,
he appeared painfully affected; and when he was asked if he knew the wife
of Capet, "Yes," said he, bowing respectfully, "I have known Madame."He
declared that he knew nothing, and maintained that the declarations
extorted from the young Prince relative to the journey to Varennes were
false.In recompense for his deposition he was assailed with outrageous
reproaches, from which he might judge what fate would soon be awarded to
himself.In all the evidence there appeared but two serious facts, attested by
Latour-du-Pin and Valaze, who deposed to them because they could not help
it.Latour-du-Pin declared that Marie Antoinette had applied to him for
an accurate statement of the armies while he was minister of war.Valaze,
always cold, but respectful towards misfortune, would not say anything to
criminate the accused; yet he could not help declaring that, as a member
of the commission of twenty-four, being charged with his colleagues to
examine the papers found at the house of Septeuil, treasurer of the civil
list, he had seen bonds for various sums signed Antoinette, which was very
natural; but he added that he had also seen a letter in which the minister
requested the King to transmit to the Queen the copy of the plan of
campaign which he had in his hands.The most unfavourable construction
was immediately put upon these two facts, the application for a statement
of the armies, and the communication of the plan of campaign; and it was
concluded that they could not be wanted for any other purpose than to be
sent to the enemy, for it was not supposed that a young princess should
turn her attention, merely for her own satisfaction, to matters of
administration and military, plans.After these depositions, several
others were received respecting the expenses of the Court, the influence
of the Queen in public affairs, the scene of the 10th of August, and what
had passed in the Temple; and the most vague rumours and most trivial
circumstances were eagerly caught at as proofs.Marie Antoinette frequently repeated, with presence of mind and firmness,
that there was no precise fact against her;

[At first the Queen, consulting only her own sense of dignity, had
resolved on her trial to make no other reply to the questions of her
judges than "Assassinate me as you have already assassinated my husband!"Afterwards, however, she determined to follow the example of the King,
exert herself in her defence, and leave her judges without any excuse or
pretest for putting her to death.--WEBER'S "Memoirs of Marie Antoinette."]that, besides, though the wife of Louis XVI., she was not answerable for
any of the acts of his reign.Fouquier nevertheless declared her to be
sufficiently convicted; Chaveau-Lagarde made unavailing efforts to defend
her; and the unfortunate Queen was condemned to suffer the same fate as
her husband.Conveyed back to the Conciergerie, she there passed in tolerable composure
the night preceding her execution, and, on the morning of the following
day, the 16th of October,

[The Queen, after having written and prayed, slept soundly for some hours.On her waking, Bault's daughter dressed her and adjusted her hair with
more neatness than on other days.Marie Antoinette wore a white gown, a
white handkerchief covered her shoulders, a white cap her hair; a black
ribbon bound this cap round her temples....  The cries, the looks, the
laughter, the jests of the people overwhelmed her with humiliation; her
colour, changing continually from purple to paleness, betrayed her
agitation....  On reaching the scaffold she inadvertently trod on the
executioner's foot."Pardon me," she said, courteously.She knelt for an
instant and uttered a half-audible prayer; then rising and glancing
towards the towers of the Temple, "Adieu, once again, my children," she
said; "I go to rejoin your father."--LAMARTINE.]she was conducted, amidst a great concourse of the populace, to the fatal
spot where, ten months before, Louis XVI.She listened
with calmness to the exhortations of the ecclesiastic who accompanied her,
and cast an indifferent look at the people who had so often applauded her
beauty and her grace, and who now as warmly applauded her execution.On
reaching the foot of the scaffold she perceived the Tuileries, and
appeared to be moved; but she hastened to ascend the fatal ladder, and
gave herself up with courage to the executioner.[Sorrow had blanched the Queen's once beautiful hair; but her features and
air still commanded the admiration of all who beheld her; her cheeks, pale
and emaciated, were occasionally tinged with a vivid colour at the mention
of those she had lost.When led out to execution, she was dressed in
white; she had cut off her hair with her own hands.Placed in a tumbrel,
with her arms tied behind her, she was taken by a circuitous route to the
Place de la Revolution, and she ascended the scaffold with a firm and
dignified step, as if she had been about to take her place on a throne by
the side of her husband.-LACRETELLE.]The infamous wretch exhibited her head to the people, as he was accustomed
to do when he had sacrificed an illustrious victim.The Last Separation.--Execution of Madame Elisabeth.The two Princesses left in the Temple were now almost inconsolable; they
spent days and nights in tears, whose only alleviation was that they were
shed together."The company of my aunt, whom I loved so tenderly," said
Madame Royale, "was a great comfort to me.all that I loved
was perishing around me, and I was soon to lose her also.In
the beginning of September I had an illness caused solely by my anxiety
about my mother; I never heard a drum beat that I did not expect another
3d of September."--[when the head of the Princesse de Lamballe was carried
to the Temple.]In the course of the month the rigour of their captivity was much
increased.The Commune ordered that they should only have one room; that
Tison (who had done the heaviest of the household work for them, and since
the kindness they showed to his insane wife had occasionally given them
tidings of the Dauphin) should be imprisoned in the turret; that they
should be supplied with only the barest necessaries; and that no one
should enter their room save to carry water and firewood.Their quantity
of firing was reduced, and they were not allowed candles.They were also
forbidden to go on the leads, and their large sheets were taken away,
"lest--notwithstanding the gratings!--they should escape from the
windows."On 8th October, 1793, Madame Royale was ordered to go downstairs, that she
might be interrogated by some municipal officers."My aunt, who was
greatly affected, would have followed, but they stopped her.She asked
whether I should be permitted to come up again; Chaumette assured her that
I should.'You may trust,' said he, 'the word of an honest republican.I soon found myself in my brother's room, whom I
embraced tenderly; but we were torn asunder, and I was obliged to go into
another room.--[This was the last time the brother and sister met].Chaumette then questioned me about a thousand shocking things of which
they accused my mother and aunt; I was so indignant at hearing such
horrors that, terrified as I was, I could not help exclaiming that they
were infamous falsehoods."But in spite of my tears they still pressed their questions.There were
some things which I did not comprehend, but of which I understood enough
to make me weep with indignation and horror.They then asked me
about Varennes, and other things.I answered as well as I could without
implicating anybody.I had always heard my parents say that it were
better to die than to implicate anybody."When the examination was over
the Princess begged to be allowed to join her mother, but Chaumette said
he could not obtain permission for her to do so.She was then cautioned
to say nothing about her examination to her aunt, who was next to appear
before them.Madame Elisabeth, her niece declares, "replied with still
more contempt to their shocking questions."The only intimation of the Queen's fate which her daughter and her
sister-in-law were allowed to receive was through hearing her sentence
cried by the newsman.But "we could not persuade ourselves that she was
dead," writes Madame Royale."A hope, so natural to the unfortunate,
persuaded us that she must have been saved.For eighteen months I
remained in this cruel suspense.We learnt also by the cries of the
newsman the death of the Duc d'Orleans.[The Duc d'Orleans, the early and interested propagator of the Revolution,
was its next victim.Billaud Varennes said in the Convention: "The time
has come when all the conspirators should be known and struck.I demand
that we no longer pass over in silence a man whom we seem to have
forgotten, despite the numerous facts against him.I demand that
D'ORLEANS be sent to the Revolutionary Tribunal."The Convention, once
his hireling adulators, unanimously supported the proposal.In vain he
alleged his having been accessory to the disorders of 5th October, his
support of the revolt on 10th August, 1792, his vote against the King on
17th January, 1793.He then asked only
for a delay of twenty-four hours, and had a repast carefully prepared, on
which he feasted with avidity.When led out for execution he gazed with a
smile on the Palais Royal, the scene of his former orgies.He was detained
for a quarter of an hour before that palace by the order of Robespierre,
who had asked his daughter's hand, and promised in return to excite a
tumult in which the Duke's life should be saved.Depraved though he was,
he would not consent to such a sacrifice, and he met his fate with stoical
fortitude.--ALLISON, vol.It was the only piece of news that reached us during the whole winter."The severity with which the prisoners were treated was carried into every
detail of their life.The officers who guarded them took away their
chessmen and cards because some of them were named kings and queens, and
all the books with coats of arms on them; they refused to get ointment for
a gathering on Madame Elisabeth's arm; they, would not allow her to make a
herb-tea which she thought would strengthen her niece; they declined to
supply fish or eggs on fast-days or during Lent, bringing only coarse fat
meat, and brutally replying to all remonstances, "None but fools believe
in that stuff nowadays."Madame Elisabeth never made the officials
another request, but reserved some of the bread and cafe-au-lait from her
breakfast for her second meal.The time during which she could be thus
tormented was growing short.On 9th May, 1794, as the Princesses were going to bed, the outside bolts
of the door were unfastened and a loud knocking was heard."When my aunt
was dressed," says Madame Royale, "she opened the door, and they said to
her, 'Citoyenne, come down.'--'We shall take care of her
afterwards.'She embraced me, and to calm my agitation promised to return.'No, citoyenne,' said the men, 'bring your bonnet; you shall not return.'They overwhelmed her with abuse, but she bore it patiently, embracing me,
and exhorting me to trust in Heaven, and never to forget the last commands
of my father and mother."Madame Elisabeth was then taken to the Conciergerie, where she was
interrogated by the vice-president at midnight, and then allowed to take
some hours rest on the bed on which Marie Antoinette had slept for the
last time.In the morning she was brought before the tribunal, with
twenty-four other prisoners, of varying ages and both sexes, some of whom
had once been frequently seen at Court."Of what has Elisabeth to complain?"Fouquier-Tinville satirically asked."At the foot of the guillotine, surrounded by faithful nobility, she may
imagine herself again at Versailles.""You call my brother a tyrant," the Princess replied to her accuser; "if
he had been what you say, you would not be where you are, nor I before
you!"She was sentenced to death, and showed neither surprise nor grief."I am
ready to die," she said, "happy in the prospect of rejoining in a better
world those whom I loved on earth."On being taken to the room where those condemned to suffer at the same
time as herself were assembled, she spoke to them with so much piety and
resignation that they were encouraged by her example to show calmness and
courage like her own.The women, on leaving the cart, begged to embrace
her, and she said some words of comfort to each in turn as they mounted
the scaffold, which she was not allowed to ascend till all her companions
had been executed before her eyes.[Madame Elisabeth was one of those rare personages only seen at distant
intervals during the course of ages; she set an example of steadfast piety
in the palace of kings, she lived amid her family the favourite of all and
the admiration of the world....  When I went to Versailles Madame
Elisabeth was twenty-two years of age.Her plump figure and pretty pink
colour must have attracted notice, and her air of calmness and contentment
even more than her beauty.She was fond of billiards, and her elegance and
courage in riding were remarkable.But she never allowed these amusements
to interfere with her religious observances.At that time her wish to
take the veil at St.Cyr was much talked of, but the King was too fond of
his sister to endure the separation.There were also rumours of a
marriage between Madame Elisabeth and the Emperor Joseph.The Queen was
sincerely attached to her brother, and loved her sister-in-law most
tenderly; she ardently desired this marriage as a means of raising the
Princess to one of the first thrones in Europe, and as a possible means of
turning the Emperor from his innovations.She had been very carefully
educated, had talent in music and painting, spoke Italian and a little
Latin, and understood mathematics....  Her last moments were worthy of her
courage and virtue.--D'HEZECQUES's "Recollections," pp."It is impossible to imagine my distress at finding myself separated from
my aunt," says Madame Royale."Since I had been able to appreciate her
merits, I saw in her nothing but religion, gentleness, meekness, modesty,
and a devoted attachment to her family; she sacrificed her life for them,
since nothing could persuade her to leave the King and Queen.I never can
be sufficiently grateful to her for her goodness to me, which ended only
with her life.She looked on me as her child, and I honoured and loved
her as a second mother.I was thought to be very like her in countenance,
and I feel conscious that I have something of her character.Would to God
I might imitate her virtues, and hope that I may hereafter deserve to meet
her, as well as my dear parents, in the bosom of our Creator, where I
cannot doubt that they enjoy the reward of their virtuous lives and
meritorious deaths."Madame Royale vainly begged to be allowed to rejoin her mother or her
aunt, or at least to know their fate.The municipal officers would tell
her nothing, and rudely refused her request to have a woman placed with
her."I asked nothing but what seemed indispensable, though it was often
harshly refused," she says."But I at least could keep myself clean.I
had soap and water, and carefully swept out my room every day.I had no
light, but in the long days I did not feel this privation much.I had some religious works and travels, which I had read over and over.I
had also some knitting, 'qui m'ennuyait beaucoup'."Once, she believes,
Robespierre visited her prison:

[It has been said that Robespierre vainly tried to obtain the hand of
Mademoiselle d'Orleans.It was also rumoured that Madame Royale herself
owed her life to his matrimonial ambition.]"The officers showed him great respect; the people in the Tower did not
know him, or at least would not tell me who he was.He stared insolently
at me, glanced at my books, and, after joining the municipal officers in a
search, retired."[On another occasion "three men in scarfs," who entered the Princess's
room, told her that they did not see why she should wish to be released,
as she seemed very comfortable!"It is dreadful,' I replied, 'to be
separated for more than a year from one's mother, without even hearing
what has become of her or of my aunt.'--'No, monsieur,
but the cruellest illness is that of the heart'--' We can do nothing for
you.Be patient, and submit to the justice and goodness of the French
people: I had nothing more to say."--DUCHESSE D'ANGOULEME, "Royal
Memoirs," p.When Laurent was appointed by the Convention to the charge of the young
prisoners, Madame Royale was treated with more consideration."He was
always courteous," she says; he restored her tinderbox, gave her fresh
books, and allowed her candles and as much firewood as she wanted, "which
pleased me greatly."This simple expression of relief gives a clearer
idea of what the delicate girl must have suffered than a volume of
complaints.But however hard Madame Royale's lot might be, that of the Dauphin was
infinitely harder.Though only eight years old when he entered the
Temple, he was by nature and education extremely precocious; "his memory
retained everything, and his sensitiveness comprehended everything."His
features "recalled the somewhat effeminate look of Louis XV., and the
Austrian hauteur of Maria Theresa; his blue eyes, aquiline nose, elevated
nostrils, well-defined mouth, pouting lips, chestnut hair parted in the
middle and falling in thick curls on his shoulders, resembled his mother
before her years of tears and torture.All the beauty of his race, by
both descents, seemed to reappear in him."--[Lamartine]--For some time the
care of his parents preserved his health and cheerfulness even in the
Temple; but his constitution was weakened by the fever recorded by his
sister, and his gaolers were determined that he should never regain
strength."What does the Convention intend to do with him?"asked Simon, when the
innocent victim was placed in his clutches.For such a purpose they could not have chosen their instruments better."Simon and his wife, cut off all those fair locks that had been his
youthful glory and his mother's pride.This worthy pair stripped him of
the mourning he wore for his father; and as they did so, they called it
'playing at the game of the spoiled king.'They alternately induced him
to commit excesses, and then half starved him.They beat him mercilessly;
nor was the treatment by night less brutal than that by day.As soon as
the weary boy had sunk into his first profound sleep, they would loudly
call him by name, 'Capet!Startled, nervous, bathed in
perspiration, or sometimes trembling with cold, he would spring up, rush
through the dark, and present himself at Simon's bedside, murmuring,
tremblingly, 'I am here, citizen.'--'Come nearer; let me feel you.'He
would approach the bed as he was ordered, although he knew the treatment
that awaited him.Simon would buffet him on the head, or kick him away,
adding the remark, 'Get to bed again, wolfs cub; I only wanted to know
that you were safe.'On one of these occasions, when the child had fallen
half stunned upon his own miserable couch, and lay there groaning and
faint with pain, Simon roared out with a laugh, 'Suppose you were king,
Capet, what would you do to me?'The child thought of his father's dying
words, and said, 'I would forgive you.'"--[THIERS]

The change in the young Prince's mode of life, and the cruelties and
caprices to which he was subjected, soon made him fall ill, says his
sister."Simon forced him to eat to excess, and to drink large quantities
of wine, which he detested.He grew extremely fat without
increasing in height or strength."His aunt and sister, deprived of the
pleasure of tending him, had the pain of hearing his childish voice raised
in the abominable songs his gaolers taught him.The brutality of Simon
"depraved at once the body and soul of his pupil.He called him the young
wolf of the Temple.He treated him as the young of wild animals are
treated when taken from the mother and reduced to captivity,--at once
intimidated by blows and enervated by taming.He punished for
sensibility; he rewarded meanness; he encouraged vice; he made the child
wait on him at table, sometimes striking him on the face with a knotted
towel, sometimes raising the poker and threatening to strike him with it."[Simon left the Temple to become a municipal officer.He was involved in
the overthrow of Robespierre, and guillotined the day after him, 29th
July, 1794.]Yet when Simon was removed the poor young Prince's condition became even
worse.His horrible loneliness induced an apathetic stupor to which any
suffering would have been preferable."He passed his days without any
kind of occupation; they did not allow him light in the evening.His
keepers never approached him but to give him food;" and on the rare
occasions when they took him to the platform of the Tower, he was unable
or unwilling to move about.When, in November, 1794, a commissary named
Gomin arrived at the Temple, disposed to treat the little prisoner with
kindness, it was too late."He took extreme care of my brother," says
Madame Royale."For a long time the unhappy child had been shut up in
darkness, and he was dying of fright.He was very grateful for the
attentions of Gomin, and became much attached to him."But his physical
condition was alarming, and, owing to Gomin's representations, a
commission was instituted to examine him."The commissioners appointed
were Harmond, Mathieu, and Reverchon, who visited 'Louis Charles,' as he
was now called, in the month of February, 1795.They found the young
Prince seated at a square deal table, at which he was playing with some
dirty cards, making card houses and the like,--the materials having been
furnished him, probably, that they might figure in the report as evidences
of indulgence.He did not look up from the table as the commissioners
entered.He was in a slate-coloured dress, bareheaded; the room was
reported as clean, the bed in good condition, the linen fresh; his clothes
were also reported as new; but, in spite of all these assertions, it is
well known that his bed had not been made for months, that he had not left
his room, nor was permitted to leave it, for any purpose whatever, that it
was consequently uninhabitable, and that he was covered with vermin and
with sores.The swellings at his knees alone were sufficient to disable
him from walking.One of the commissioners approached the young Prince
respectfully.Harmond in a kind voice
begged him to speak to them.The eyes of the boy remained fixed on the
table before him.They told him of the kindly intentions of the
Government, of their hopes that he would yet be happy, and their desire
that he would speak unreservedly to the medical man that was to visit him.He seemed to listen with profound attention, but not a single word passed
his lips.It was an heroic principle that impelled that poor young heart
to maintain the silence of a mute in presence of these men.He remembered
too well the days when three other commissaries waited on him, regaled him
with pastry and wine, and obtained from him that hellish accusation
against the mother that he loved.He had learnt by some means the import
of the act, so far as it was an injury to his mother.He now dreaded
seeing again three commissaries, hearing again kind words, and being
treated again with fine promises.Dumb as death itself he sat before
them, and remained motionless as stone, and as mute."[THIERS]

His disease now made rapid progress, and Gomin and Lasne, superintendents
of the Temple, thinking it necessary to inform the Government of the
melancholy condition of their prisoner, wrote on the register: "Little
Capet is unwell."No notice was taken of this account, which was renewed
next day in more urgent terms: "Little Capet is dangerously ill."Still
there was no word from beyond the walls."We must knock harder," said the
keepers to each other, and they added, "It is feared he will not live," to
the words "dangerously ill."At length, on Wednesday, 6th May, 1795,
three days after the first report, the authorities appointed M. Desault to
give the invalid the assistance of his art.After having written down his
name on the register he was admitted to see the Prince.He made a long and
very attentive examination of the unfortunate child, asked him many
questions without being able to obtain an answer, and contented himself
with prescribing a decoction of hops, to be taken by spoonfuls every
half-hour, from six o'clock in the morning till eight in the evening.On
the first day the Prince steadily refused to take it.In vain Gomin
several times drank off a glass of the potion in his presence; his example
proved as ineffectual as his words.Next day Lasne renewed his
solicitations."Monsieur knows very well that I desire nothing but the
good of his health, and he distresses me deeply by thus refusing to take
what might contribute to it.I entreat him as a favour not to give me
this cause of grief."And as Lasne, while speaking, began to taste the
potion in a glass, the child took what he offered him out of his hands."You have, then, taken an oath that I should drink it," said he, firmly;
"well, give it me, I will drink it."From that moment he conformed with
docility to whatever was required of him, but the policy of the Commune
had attained its object; help had been withheld till it was almost a
mockery to supply it.The Prince's weakness was excessive; his keepers could scarcely drag him
to the, top of the Tower; walking hurt his tender feet, and at every step
he stopped to press the arm of Lasne with both hands upon his breast.At
last he suffered so much that it was no longer possible for him to walk,
and his keeper carried him about, sometimes on the platform, and sometimes
in the little tower, where the royal family had lived at first.But the
slight improvement to his health occasioned by the change of air scarcely
compensated for the pain which his fatigue gave him.On the battlement of
the platform nearest the left turret, the rain had, by perseverance
through ages, hollowed out a kind of basin.The water that fell remained
there for several days; and as, during the spring of 1795, storms were of
frequent occurrence, this little sheet of water was kept constantly
supplied.Whenever the child was brought out upon the platform, he saw a
little troop of sparrows, which used to come to drink and bathe in this
reservoir.At first they flew away at his approach, but from being
accustomed to see him walking quietly there every day, they at last grew
more familiar, and did not spread their wings for flight till he came up
close to them.They were always the same, he knew them by sight, and
perhaps like himself they were inhabitants of that ancient pile.He
called them his birds; and his first action, when the door into the
terrace was opened, was to look towards that side,--and the sparrows were
always there.He delighted in their chirping, and he must have envied
them their wings.Though so little could be done to alleviate his sufferings, a moral
improvement was taking place in him.He was touched by the lively
interest displayed by his physician, who never failed to visit him at nine
o'clock every morning.He seemed pleased with the attention paid him, and
ended by placing entire confidence in M. Desault.Gratitude loosened his
tongue; brutality and insult had failed to extort a murmur, but kind
treatment restored his speech he had no words for anger, but he found them
to express his thanks.M. Desault prolonged his visits as long as the
officers of the municipality would permit.When they announced the close
of the visit, the child, unwilling to beg them to allow a longer time,
held back M. Desault by the skirt of his coat.Suddenly M. Desault's
visits ceased.Several days passed and nothing was heard of him.The
keepers wondered at his absence, and the poor little invalid was much
distressed at it.The commissary on duty (M. Benoist) suggested that it
would be proper to send to the physician's house to make inquiries as to
the cause of so long an absence.Gomin and Larne had not yet ventured to
follow this advice, when next day M. Benoist was relieved by M. Bidault,
who, hearing M. Desault's name mentioned as he came in, immediately said,
"You must not expect to see him any more; he died yesterday."M. Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de l'Humanite, was next
directed to attend the prisoner, and in June he found him in so alarming a
state that he at once asked for a coadjutor, fearing to undertake the
responsibility alone.Daniel journeyed to the garden.The physician--sent for form's sake to attend the
dying child, as an advocate is given by law to a criminal condemned
beforehand--blamed the officers of the municipality for not having removed
the blind, which obstructed the light, and the numerous bolts, the noise
of which never failed to remind the victim of his captivity.That sound,
which always caused him an involuntary shudder, disturbed him in the last
mournful scene of his unparalleled tortures.M. Pelletan said
authoritatively to the municipal on duty, "If you will not take these
bolts and casings away at once, at least you can make no objection to our
carrying the child into another room, for I suppose we are sent here to
take charge of him."The Prince, being disturbed by these words, spoken
as they were with great animation, made a sign to the physician to come
nearer."Speak lower, I beg of you," said he; "I am afraid they will hear
you up-stairs, and I should be very sorry for them to know that I am ill,
as it would give them much uneasiness."At first the change to a cheerful and airy room revived the Prince and
gave him evident pleasure, but the improvement did not last.Next day M.
Pelletan learned that the Government had acceded to his request for a
colleague.M. Dumangin, head physician of the Hospice de l'Unite, made
his appearance at his house on the morning of Sunday, 7th June, with the
official despatch sent him by the committee of public safety.They
repaired together immediately to the Tower.On their arrival they heard
that the child, whose weakness was excessive, had had a fainting fit,
which had occasioned fears to be entertained that his end was approaching.He had revived a little, however, when the physicians went up at about
nine o'clock.Unable to contend with increasing exhaustion, they
perceived there was no longer any hope of prolonging an existence worn out
by so much suffering, and that all their art could effect would be to
soften the last stage of this lamentable disease.While standing by the
Prince's bed, Gomin noticed that he was quietly crying, and asked him."My dear
mother remains in the other tower."Night came,--his last night,--which
the regulations of the prison condemned him to pass once more in solitude,
with suffering, his old companion, only at his side.This time, however,
death, too, stood at his pillow.When Gomin went up to the child's room
on the morning of 8th June, he said, seeing him calm, motionless, and
mute:

"I hope you are not in pain just now?""Oh, yes, I am still in pain, but not nearly so much,--the music is so
beautiful!"Now there was no music to be heard, either in the Tower or anywhere near.Gomin, astonished, said to him, "From what direction do you hear this
music?"And the
child, with a nervous motion, raised his faltering hand, as he opened his
large eyes illuminated by delight.His poor keeper, unwilling to destroy
this last sweet illusion, appeared to listen also.After a few minutes of attention the child again started, and cried out,
in intense rapture, "Amongst all the voices I have distinguished that of
my mother!"At a quarter past two he died, Lasne
only being in the room at the time.Lasne acquainted Gomin and Damont,
the commissary on duty, with the event, and they repaired to the chamber
of death.The poor little royal corpse was carried from the room into
that where he had suffered so long,--where for two years he had never
ceased to suffer.From this apartment the father had gone to the
scaffold, and thence the son must pass to the burial-ground.The remains
were laid out on the bed, and the doors of the apartment were set
open,--doors which had remained closed ever since the Revolution had
seized on a child, then full of vigour and grace and life and health!At eight o'clock next morning (9th June) four members of the committee of
general safety came to the Tower to make sure that the Prince was really
dead.When they were admitted to the death-chamber by Lasne and Damont
they affected the greatest indifference."The event is not of the least
importance," they repeated, several times over; "the police commissary of
the section will come and receive the declaration of the decease; he will
acknowledge it, and proceed to the interment without any ceremony; and the
committee will give the necessary directions."As they withdrew, some
officers of the Temple guard asked to see the remains of little Capet.Damont having observed that the guard would not permit the bier to pass
without its being opened, the deputies decided that the officers and
non-commissioned officers of the guard going off duty, together with those
coming on, should be all invited to assure themselves of the child's
death.All having assembled in the room where the body lay, he asked them
if they recognised it as that of the ex-Dauphin, son of the last King of
France.Those who had seen the young Prince at the Tuileries, or at the
Temple (and most of them had), bore witness to its being the body of Louis
XVII.When they were come down into the council-room, Darlot drew up the
minutes of this attestation, which was signed by a score of persons.These minutes were inserted in the journal of the Temple tower, which was
afterwards deposited in the office of the Minister of the Interior.During this visit the surgeons entrusted with the autopsy arrived at the
outer gate of the Temple.These were Dumangin, head physician of the
Hospice de l'Unite; Pelletan, head surgeon of the Grand Hospice de
l'Humanite; Jeanroy, professor in the medical schools of Paris; and
Laasus, professor of legal medicine at the Ecole de Sante of Paris.The
last two were selected by Dumangin and Pelletan because of the former
connection of M. Lassus with Mesdames de France, and of M. Jeanroy with
the House of Lorraine, which gave a peculiar weight to their signatures.Gomin received them in the council-room, and detained them until the
National Guard, descending from the second floor, entered to sign the
minutes prepared by Darlot.This done, Lasne, Darlot, and Bouquet went up
again with the surgeons, and introduced them into the apartment of Louis
XVII., whom they at first examined as he lay on his death-bed; but M.
Jeanroy observing that the dim light of this room was but little
favourable to the accomplishment of their mission, the commissaries
prepared a table in the first room, near the window, on which the corpse
was laid, and the surgeons began their melancholy operation.At seven o'clock the police commissary ordered the body to be taken up,
and that they should proceed to the cemetery.It was the season of the
longest days, and therefore the interment did not take place in secrecy
and at night, as some misinformed narrators have said or written; it took
place in broad daylight, and attracted a great concourse of people before
the gates of the Temple palace.One of the municipals wished to have the
coffin carried out secretly by the door opening into the chapel enclosure;
but M. Duaser, police commiasary, who was specially entrusted with the
arrangement of the ceremony, opposed this indecorous measure, and the
procession passed out through the great gate.The crowd that was pressing
round was kept back, and compelled to keep a line, by a tricoloured
ribbon, held at short distances by gendarmes.Compassion and sorrow were
impressed on every countenance.A small detachment of the troops of the line from the garrison of Paris,
sent by the authorities, was waiting to serve as an escort.The bier,
still covered with the pall, was carried on a litter on the shoulders of
four men, who relieved each other two at a time; it was preceded by six or
eight men, headed by a sergeant.The procession was accompanied a long
way by the crowd, and a great number of persona followed it even to the
cemetery.The name of "Little Capet," and the more popular title of
Dauphin, spread from lip to lip, with exclamations of pity and compassion.Marguerite, not by the church, as
some accounts assert, but by the old gate of the cemetery.The interment
was made in the corner, on the left, at a distance of eight or nine feet
from the enclosure wall, and at an equal distance from a small house,
which subsequently served as a school.The grave was filled up,--no mound
marked its place, and not even a trace remained of the interment!Not
till then did the commissaries of police and the municipality withdraw,
and enter the house opposite the church to draw up the declaration of
interment.It was nearly nine o'clock, and still daylight.Release of Madame Royale.--Her Marriage to the Duc d'Angouleme.The last person to hear of the sad events in the Temple was the one for
whom they had the deepest and most painful interest.After her brother's
death the captivity of Madame Royale was much lightened.She was allowed
to walk in the Temple gardens, and to receive visits from some ladies of
the old Court, and from Madame de Chantereine, who at last, after several
times evading her questions, ventured cautiously to tell her of the deaths
of her mother, aunt, and brother.Madame Royale wept bitterly, but had
much difficulty in expressing her feelings."She spoke so confusedly,"
says Madame de la Ramiere in a letter to Madame de Verneuil, "that it was
difficult to understand her.It took her more than a month's reading
aloud, with careful study of pronunciation, to make herself
intelligible,--so much had she lost the power of expression."She was
dressed with plainness amounting to poverty, and her hands were disfigured
by exposure to cold and by the menial work she had been so long accustomed
to do for herself, and which it was difficult to persuade her to leave
off.When urged to accept the services of an attendant, she replied, with
a sad prevision of the vicissitudes of her future life, that she did not
like to form a habit which she might have again to abandon.She suffered
herself, however, to be persuaded gradually to modify her recluse and
ascetic habits.It was well she did so, as a preparation for the great
changes about to follow.Nine days after the death of her brother, the city of Orleans interceded
for the daughter of Louis XVI., and sent deputies to the Convention to
pray for her deliverance and restoration to her family.Names followed
this example; and Charette, on the part of the Vendeans, demanded, as a
condition of the pacification of La Vendee, that the Princess should be
allowed to join her relations.At length the Convention decreed that
Madame Royale should be exchanged with Austria for the representatives and
ministers whom Dumouriez had given up to the Prince of Cobourg,--Drouet,
Semonville, Maret, and other prisoners of importance.At midnight on 19th
December, 1795, which was her birthday, the Princess was released from
prison, the Minister of the Interior, M. Benezech, to avoid attracting
public attention and possible disturbance, conducting her on foot from the
Temple to a neighbouring street, where his carriage awaited her.She made
it her particular request that Gomin, who had been so devoted to her
brother, should be the commissary appointed to accompany her to the
frontier; Madame de Soucy, formerly under-governess to the children of
France, was also in attendance; and the Princess took with her a dog named
Coco, which had belonged to Louis XVI.[The mention of the little dog taken from the Temple by Madame Royale
reminds me how fond all the family were of these creatures.Mesdames had beautiful spaniels; little grayhounds
were preferred by Madame Elisabeth.was the only one of all his
family who had no dogs in his room.I remember one day waiting in the
great gallery for the King's retiring, when he entered with all his family
and the whole pack, who were escorting him.All at once all the dogs
began to bark, one louder than another, and ran away, passing like ghosts
along those great dark rooms, which rang with their hoarse cries.The
Princesses shouting, calling them, running everywhere after them,
completed a ridiculous spectacle, which made those august persons very
merry.--D'HEZECQUES, p.She was frequently recognised on her way through France, and always with
marks of pleasure and respect.It might have been supposed that the Princess would rejoice to leave
behind her the country which had been the scene of so many horrors and
such bitter suffering.But it was her birthplace, and it held the graves
of all she loved; and as she crossed the frontier she said to those around
her, "I leave France with regret, for I shall never cease to consider it
my country."She arrived in Vienna on 9th January, 1796, and her first
care was to attend a memorial service for her murdered relatives.After
many weeks of close retirement she occasionally began to appear in public,
and people looked with interest at the pale, grave, slender girl of
seventeen, dressed in the deepest mourning, over whose young head such
terrible storms had swept.The Emperor wished her to marry the Archduke
Charles of Austria, but her father and mother had, even in the cradle,
destined her hand for her cousin, the Duc d'Angouleme, son of the Comte
d'Artois, and the memory of their lightest wish was law to her.Her quiet determination entailed anger and opposition amounting to
persecution.Every effort was made to alienate her from her French
relations.She was urged to claim Provence, which had become her own if
Louis XVIII.A pressure of opinion
was brought to bear upon her which might well have overawed so young a
girl."I was sent for to the Emperor's cabinet," she writes, "where I
found the imperial family assembled.The ministers and chief imperial
counsellors were also present.When the Emperor invited me to
express my opinion, I answered that to be able to treat fittingly of such
interests I thought, I ought to be surrounded not only by my mother's
relatives, but also by those of my father.Besides, I said, I
was above all things French, and in entire subjection to the laws of
France, which had rendered me alternately the subject of the King my
father, the King my brother, and the King my uncle, and that I would yield
obedience to the latter, whatever might be his commands.This declaration
appeared very much to dissatisfy all who were present, and when they
observed that I was not to be shaken, they declared that my right being
independent of my will, my resistance would not be the slightest obstacle
to the measures they might deem it necessary to adopt for the preservation
of my interests."In their anxiety to make a German princess of Marie Therese, her imperial
relations suppressed her French title as much as possible.When, with
some difficulty, the Duc de Grammont succeeded in obtaining an audience of
her, and used the familiar form of address, she smiled faintly, and bade
him beware."Call me Madame de Bretagne, or de Bourgogne, or de
Lorraine," she said, "for here I am so identified with these
provinces--[which the Emperor wished her to claim from her uncle Louis
XVIII.]--that I shall end in believing in my own transformation."After
these discussions she was so closely watched, and so many restraints were
imposed upon her, that she was scarcely less a prisoner than in the old
days of the Temple, though her cage was this time gilded.Rescue,
however, was at hand.accepted a refuge offered to him at Mittau by the
Czar Paul, who had promised that he would grant his guest's first request,
whatever it might be.Louis begged the Czar to use his influence with the
Court of Vienna to allow his niece to join him."Monsieur, my brother,"
was Paul's answer, "Madame Royale shall be restored to you, or I shall
cease to be Paul I."Next morning the Czar despatched a courier to Vienna
with a demand for the Princess, so energetically worded that refusal must
have been followed by war.Accordingly, in May, 1799, Madame Royale was
allowed to leave the capital which she had found so uncongenial an asylum.In the old ducal castle of Mittau, the capital of Courland, Louis XVIII.and his wife, with their nephews, the Ducs d'Angouleme

[The Duc d'Angonleme was quiet and reserved.He loved hunting as means of
killing time; was given to early hours and innocent pleasures.He was a
gentleman, and brave as became one.He had not the "gentlemanly vices" of
his brother, and was all the better for it.He was ill educated, but had
natural good sense, and would have passed for having more than that had he
cared to put forth pretensions.Of all his family he was the one most ill
spoken of, and least deserving of it.--DOCTOR DORAN.]and de Berri, were awaiting her, attended by the Abbe Edgeworth, as chief
ecclesiastic, and a little Court of refugee nobles and officers.With
them were two men of humbler position, who must have been even more
welcome to Madame Royale,--De Malden, who had acted as courier to Louis
XVI.during the flight to Varennes, and Turgi, who had waited on the
Princesses in the Temple.It was a sad meeting, though so long anxiously
desired, and it was followed on 10th June, 1799, by an equally sad
wedding,--exiles, pensioners on the bounty of the Russian monarch,
fulfilling an engagement founded, not on personal preference, but on
family policy and reverence for the wishes of the dead, the bride and
bridegroom had small cause for rejoicing.During the eighteen months of
tranquil seclusion which followed her marriage, the favourite occupation
of the Duchess was visiting and relieving the poor.In January, 1801, the
Czar Paul, in compliance with the demand of Napoleon, who was just then
the object of his capricious enthusiasm, ordered the French royal family
to leave Mittau.Their wanderings commenced on the 21st, a day of bitter
memories; and the young Duchess led the King to his carriage through a
crowd of men, women, and children, whose tears and blessings attended them
on their way.The Duc d'Angouleme took another route
to join a body of French gentlemen in arms for the Legitimist cause.]The exiles asked permission from the King of Prussia to settle in his
dominions, and while awaiting his answer at Munich they were painfully
surprised by the entrance of five old soldiers of noble birth, part of the
body-guard they had left behind at Mittau, relying on the protection of
Paul.The "mad Czar" had decreed their immediate expulsion, and,
penniless and almost starving, they made their way to Louis XVIII.All
the money the royal family possessed was bestowed on these faithful
servants, who came to them in detachments for relief, and then the Duchess
offered her diamonds to the Danish consul for an advance of two thousand
ducats, saying she pledged her property "that in our common distress it
may be rendered of real use to my uncle, his faithful servants, and
myself."The Duchess's consistent and unselfish kindness procured her
from the King, and those about him who knew her best, the name of "our
angel."Warsaw was for a brief time the resting-place of the wanderers, but there
they were disturbed in 1803 by Napoleon's attempt to threaten and bribe
Louis XVIII.It was suggested that refusal might bring
upon them expulsion from Prussia."We are accustomed to suffering," was
the King's answer, "and we do not dread poverty.I would, trusting in
God, seek another asylum."In 1808, after many changes of scene, this
asylum was sought in England, Gosfield Hall, Essex, being placed at their
disposal by the Marquis of Buckingham.From Gosfield, the King moved to
Hartwell Hall, a fine old Elizabethan mansion rented from Sir George Lee
for L 500 a year.A yearly grant of L 24,000 was made to the exiled
family by the British Government, out of which a hundred and forty persons
were supported, the royal dinner-party generally numbering two dozen.At Hartwell, as in her other homes, the Duchess was most popular amongst
the poor.In general society she was cold and reserved, and she disliked
the notice of strangers.In March, 1814, the royalist successes at
Bordeaux paved the way for the restoration of royalty in France, and
amidst general sympathy and congratulation, with the Prince Regent himself
to wish them good fortune, the King, the Duchess, and their suite left
Hartwell in April, 1814.The return to France was as triumphant as a
somewhat half-hearted and doubtful enthusiasm could make it, and most of
such cordiality as there was fell to the share of the Duchess.As she
passed to Notre-Dame in May, 1814, on entering Paris, she was vociferously
greeted.The feeling of loyalty, however, was not much longer-lived than
the applause by which it was expressed; the Duchess had scarcely effected
one of the strongest wishes of her heart,--the identification of what
remained of her parents' bodies, and the magnificent ceremony with which
they were removed from the cemetery of the Madeleine to the Abbey of St.Denis,--when the escape of Napoleon from Elba in February,1815, scattered
the royal family and their followers like chaff before the wind.The Duc
d'Angouleme, compelled to capitulate at Toulouse, sailed from Cette in a
Swedish vessel.The Comte d'Artois, the Duc de Berri, and the Prince de
Conde withdrew beyond the frontier.The
Duchesse d'Angouleme, then at Bordeaux celebrating the anniversary of the
Proclamation of Louis XVIII., alone of all her family made any stand
against the general panic.Day after day she mounted her horse and
reviewed the National Guard.She made personal and even passionate
appeals to the officers and men, standing firm, and prevailing on a
handful of soldiers to remain by her, even when the imperialist troops
were on the other side of the river and their cannon were directed against
the square where the Duchess was reviewing her scanty followers.["It was the Duchesse d'Angouleme who saved you," said the gallant General
Clauzel, after these events, to a royalist volunteer; "I could not bring
myself to order such a woman to be fired upon, at the moment when she was
providing material for the noblest page in her history."--"Fillia
Dolorosa," vol.With pain and difficulty she was convinced that resistance was vain;
Napoleon's banner soon floated over Bordeaux; the Duchess issued a
farewell proclamation to her "brave Bordelais," and on the 1st April,
1815, she started for Pouillac, whence she embarked for Spain.During a
brief visit to England she heard that the reign of a hundred days was
over, and the 27th of July, 1815, saw her second triumphal return to the
Tuileries.She did not take up her abode there with any wish for State
ceremonies or Court gaieties.Her life was as secluded as her position
would allow.Her favourite retreat was the Pavilion, which had been
inhabited by her mother, and in her little oratory she collected relics of
her family, over which on the anniversaries of their deaths she wept and
prayed.In her daily drives through Paris she scrupulously avoided the
spot on which they had suffered; and the memory of the past seemed to rule
all her sad and self-denying life, both in what she did and what she
refrained from doing.[She was so methodical and economical, though liberal in her charities,
that one of her regular evening occupations was to tear off the seals from
the letters she had received during the day, in order that the wax might
be melted down and sold; the produce made one poor family "passing rich
with forty pounds a year."--See "Filia Dolorosa," vol.Her somewhat austere goodness was not of a nature to make her popular.The
few who really understood her loved her, but the majority of her
pleasure-seeking subjects regarded her either with ridicule or dread.She
is said to have taken no part in politics, and to have exerted no
influence in public affairs, but her sympathies were well known, and "the
very word liberty made her shudder;" like Madame Roland, she had seen "so
many crimes perpetrated under that name."The claims of three pretended Dauphins--Hervagault, the son of the tailor
of St.Lo; Bruneau, son of the shoemaker of Vergin; and Naundorf or
Norndorff, the watchmaker somewhat troubled her peace, but never for a
moment obtained her sanction.Of the many other pseudo-Dauphins (said to
number a dozen and a half) not even the names remain.In February,1820, a
fresh tragedy befell the royal family in the assassination of the Duc de
Berri, brother-in-law of the Duchesse d'Angouleme, as he was seeing his
wife into her carriage at the door of the Opera-house.He was carried
into the theatre, and there the dying Prince and his wife were joined by
the Duchess, who remained till he breathed his last, and was present when
he, too, was laid in the Abbey of St.She was present also when
his son, the Duc de Bordeaux, was born, and hoped that she saw in him a
guarantee for the stability of royalty in France.In September, 1824, she
stood by the death-bed of Louis XVIII., and thenceforward her chief
occupation was directing the education of the little Duc de Bordeaux, who
generally resided with her at Villeneuve l'Etang, her country house near
St.Thence she went in July, 1830, to the Baths of Vichy,
stopping at Dijon on her way to Paris, and visiting the theatre on the
evening of the 27th.She was received with "a roar of execrations and
seditious cries," and knew only too well what they signified.She
instantly left the theatre and proceeded to Tonnere, where she received
news of the rising in Paris, and, quitting the town by night, was driven
to Joigny with three attendants.Soon after leaving that place it was
thought more prudent that the party should separate and proceed on foot,
and the Duchess and M. de Foucigny, disguised as peasants, entered
Versailles arm-in-arm, to obtain tidings of the King.The Duchess found
him at Rambouillet with her husband, the Dauphin, and the King met her
with a request for "pardon," being fully conscious, too late, that his
unwise decrees and his headlong flight had destroyed the last hopes of his
family.The act of abdication followed, by which the prospect of royalty
passed from the Dauphin and his wife, as well as from Charles X.--Henri V.
being proclaimed King, and the Duc d'Orleans (who refused to take the boy
monarch under his personal protection) lieutenant-general of the kingdom.Then began the Duchess's third expatriation.At Cherbourg the royal
family, accompanied by the little King without a kingdom, embarked in the
'Great Britain', which stood out to sea.The Duchess, remaining on deck
for a last look at the coast of France, noticed a brig which kept, she
thought, suspiciously near them."To fire into and sink the vessels in which we sail, should any attempt be
made to return to France."Such was the farewell of their subjects to the House of Bourbon.The
fugitives landed at Weymouth; the Duchesse d'Angouleme under the title of
Comtesse de Marne, the Duchesse de Berri as Comtesse de Rosny, and her
son, Henri de Bordeaux, as Comte de Chambord, the title he retained till
his death, originally taken from the estate presented to him in infancy by
his enthusiastic people.Holyrood, with its royal and gloomy
associations, was their appointed dwelling.The Duc and Duchesse
d'Angouleme, and the daughter of the Duc de Berri, travelled thither by
land, the King and the young Comte de Chambord by sea."I prefer my route
to that of my sister," observed the latter, "because I shall see the coast
of France again, and she will not."The French Government soon complained that at Holyrood the exiles were
still too near their native land, and accordingly, in 1832, Charles X.,
with his son and grandson, left Scotland for Hamburg, while the Duchesse
d'Angouleme and her niece repaired to Vienna.The family were reunited at
Prague in 1833, where the birthday of the Comte de Chambord was celebrated
with some pomp and rejoicing, many Legitimists flocking thither to
congratulate him on attaining the age of thirteen, which the old law of
monarchical France had fixed as the majority of her princes.Three years
later the wanderings of the unfortunate family recommenced; the Emperor
Francis II.was dead, and his successor, Ferdinand, must visit Prague to
be crowned, and Charles X. feared that the presence of a discrowned
monarch might be embarrassing on such an occasion.Illness and sorrow
attended the exiles on their new journey, and a few months after they were
established in the Chateau of Graffenburg at Goritz, Charles X. died of
cholera, in his eightieth year.At Goritz, also, on the 31st May, 1844,
the Duchesse d'Angouleme, who had sat beside so many death-beds, watched
over that of her husband.Theirs had not been a marriage of affection in
youth, but they respected each other's virtues, and to a great extent
shared each other's tastes; banishment and suffering had united them very
closely, and of late years they had been almost inseparable,--walking,
riding, and reading together.When the Duchesse d'Angouleme had seen her
husband laid by his father's side in the vault of the Franciscan convent,
she, accompanied by her nephew and niece, removed to Frohsdorf, where they
spent seven tranquil years.Here she was addressed as "Queen" by her
household for the first time in her life, but she herself always
recognised Henri, Comte de Chambord, as her sovereign.The Duchess lived
to see the overthrow of Louis Philippe, the usurper of the inheritance of
her family.Her last attempt to exert herself was a characteristic one.She tried to rise from a sick-bed in order to attend the memorial service
held for her mother, Marie Antoinette, on the 16th October, the
anniversary of her execution.But her strength was not equal to the task;
on the 19th she expired, with her hand in that of the Comte de Chambord,
and on 28th October, 1851, Marie Therese Charlotte, Duchesse d'Angouleme,
was buried in the Franciscan convent."In the spring of 1814 a ceremony took place in Paris at which I was
present because there was nothing in it that could be mortifying to a
French heart.had long been admitted to be one of
the most serious misfortunes of the Revolution.The Emperor Napoleon
never spoke of that sovereign but in terms of the highest respect, and
always prefixed the epithet unfortunate to his name.The ceremony to
which I allude was proposed by the Emperor of Russia and the King of
Prussia.It consisted of a kind of expiation and purification of the spot
on which Louis XVI.I went to see the
ceremony, and I had a place at a window in the Hotel of Madame de Remusat,
next to the Hotel de Crillon, and what was termed the Hotel de Courlande."The expiation took place on the 10th of April.The weather was extremely
fine and warm for the season.The Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia,
accompanied by Prince Schwartzenberg, took their station at the entrance
of the Rue Royale; the King of Prussia being on the right of the Emperor
Alexander, and Prince Schwartzenberg on his left.There was a long
parade, during which the Russian, Prussian and Austrian military bands
vied with each other in playing the air, 'Vive Henri IV.!'The cavalry
defiled past, and then withdrew into the Champs Elysees; but the infantry
ranged themselves round an altar which was raised in the middle of the
Place, and which was elevated on a platform having twelve or fifteen
steps.The Emperor of Russia alighted from his horse, and, followed by
the King of Prussia, the Grand Duke Constantine, Lord Cathcart, and Prince
Schwartzenberg, advanced to the altar.When the Emperor had nearly
reached the altar the "Te Deum" commenced.At the moment of the
benediction, the sovereigns and persons who accompanied them, as well as
the twenty-five thousand troops who covered the Place, all knelt down.The Greek priest presented the cross to the Emperor Alexander, who kissed
it; his example was followed by the individuals who accompanied him,
though they were not of the Greek faith.On rising, the Grand Duke
Constantine took off his hat, and immediately salvoes of artillery were
heard."The following titles have the signification given below during the period

feathers once more, by way of 'good-by.'Woodchuck, I have seen little
of you, but I trust you have enjoyed your visit, in your own way."And now, last of all, Bruin!come here and let
me shake your honest, shaggy paw, and thank you for all that you have
done for me and for my boy.""Why, where _is_ Bruin?"cried Toto, starting and looking round; "surely
he was here a minute ago.But no deep voice was heard, roaring cheerfully, "Here, Toto boy!"No
shaggy form came in sight."He has gone on ahead, probably," said the raccoon; "he said something,
this morning, about not liking to say good-by.Come, you others, we must
follow our leader.And with many a backward glance, and many a wave of paw, or tail, or
fluttering wing, the party of friends took their way to the forest home.Boy Toto stood with his hands in his pockets, looking after them with
bright, wide-open eyes.He did not cry,--it was a part of Toto's creed
that boys did not cry after they had left off petticoats,--but he felt
that if he had been a girl, the tears might have come in spite of him.So he stared very hard, and puckered his mouth in a silent whistle, and
felt of the marbles in his pockets,--for that is always a soothing and
comforting thing to do."Toto, dear," said his grandmother, "do you think our Bruin is really
_gone_, without saying a word of farewell to us?"cried the old lady, putting her handkerchief
to her sightless eyes,--"very, very much grieved!If it had been <DW53>,
now, I should not have been so much surprised; but for Bruin, our
faithful friend and helper, to leave us so, seems--"

"_Hello!_" cried Toto, starting suddenly, "what is that noise?"on the quiet air came the sharp crashing sound
of an axe.I'll go--" and with that
he went, as if he had been shot out of a catapult.Rushing into the wood-shed, he caught sight of the well-beloved shaggy
figure, just raising the axe to deliver a fearful blow at an unoffending
log of wood.Flinging his arms round it (the figure, not the axe nor the
log), he gave it such a violent hug that bear and boy sat down suddenly
on the ground, while the axe flew to the other end of the shed.cried Toto, "we thought you were gone, without
saying a word to us.The bear rubbed his nose confusedly, and muttered something about "a few
more sticks in case of cold weather."But here Toto burst out laughing in spite of himself, for the shed was
piled so high with kindling-wood that the bear sat as it were at the
bottom of a pit whose sides of neatly split sticks rose high above his
head."There's kindling-wood enough here to
last us ten years, at the very least.She
thought--"

"There will be more butter to make, now, Toto, since that new calf has
come," said the bear, breaking in with apparent irrelevance."And that pig is getting too big for you to manage," continued Bruin, in
a serious tone."He was impudent to _me_ the other day, and I had to
take him up by the tail and swing him, before he would apologize.Now,
you _couldn't_ take him up by the tail, Toto, much less swing him, and
there is no use in your deceiving yourself about it.""No one could, except you, old
monster.But what _are_ you thinking about that for, now?Granny will think you are gone, after all."And catching the
bear by the ear, he led him back in triumph to the cottage-door, crying,
"Granny, Granny!Now give him a good scolding, please, for
frightening us so."She only stroked the shaggy black
fur, and said, "Bruin, dear!my good, faithful, true-hearted Bruin!I
could not bear to think that you had left me without saying good-by.But you would not have done it, would you,
Bruin?The bear looked about him distractedly, and bit his paw severely, as if
to relieve his feelings."At least, if I meant
to say good-by.I wouldn't say it, because I couldn't.But I don't mean
to say it,--I mean I don't mean to do it.If you don't want me in the
house,--being large and clumsy, as I am well aware, and ugly too,--I can
sleep out by the pump, and come in to do the work.But I cannot leave
the boy, please, dear Madam, nor you.And the calf wants attention, and
that pig _ought_ to be swung at least once a week, and--and--"

But there was no need of further speech, for Toto's arms were clinging
round his neck, and Toto's voice was shouting exclamations of delight;
and the grandmother was shaking his great black paw, and calling him
her best friend, her dearest old Bruin, and telling him that he should
never leave them.And, in fact, he never did leave them.He settled down quietly in the
little cottage, and washed and churned, baked and brewed, milked the cow
and kept the pig in order.Happy was the good bear, and happy was Toto,
in those pleasant days.For every afternoon, when the work was done,
they welcomed one or all of their forest friends; or else they sought
the green, beloved forest themselves, and sat beside the fairy pool, and
wandered in the cool green mazes where all was sweetness and peace, with
rustle of leaves and murmur of water, and chirp of bird and insect.But
evening found them always at the cottage door again, bringing their
woodland joyousness to the blind grandmother, making the kitchen ring
with laughter as they related the last exploits of the raccoon or the
squirrel, or described the courtship of the parrot and the crow.And if you had asked any of the three, as they sat together in the
porch, who was the happiest person in the world, why, Toto and the
Grandmother would each have answered, "I!"But Bruin, who had never
studied grammar, and knew nothing whatever about his nominatives and his
accusatives, would have roared with a thunder-burst of enthusiasm,

Transcriber's Notes:

Obvious punctuation errors repaired.Page 44, illustration caption, "Wah-song!Cholera came; her lover died,
     Want drove her to the streets again,
   And women found her there, who tried
     To turn her beauty into gain.But she who in those garden ways
     Had learnt of Love, would now no more
   Be bartered in the market place
     For silver, as in days before.That former life she strove to change;
     She sold the silver off her arms,
   While all the world grew cold and strange
     To broken health and fading charms.Till, finding lovers, but no friend,
     Nor any place to rest or hide,
   She grew despairing at the end,
     Slipped softly down a well and died.And yet, how short, when all is said,
     This little life of love and tears!Her age, they say, beside her bed,
     To-day is only fifteen years.The Garden by the Bridge

   The Desert sands are heated, parched and dreary,
     The tigers rend alive their quivering prey
   In the near Jungle; here the kites rise, weary,
     Too gorged with living food to fly away.All night the hungry jackals howl together
     Over the carrion in the river bed,
   Or seize some small soft thing of fur or feather
     Whose dying shrieks on the night air are shed.I hear from yonder Temple in the distance
     Whose roof with obscene carven Gods is piled,
   Reiterated with a sad insistence
     Sobs of, perhaps, some immolated child.Strange rites here, where the archway's shade is deeper,
     Are consummated in the river bed;
   Parias steal the rotten railway sleeper
     To burn the bodies of their cholera dead.But yet, their lust, their hunger, cannot shame them
     Goaded by fierce desire, that flays and stings;
   Poor beasts, and poorer men.Blame the Inherent Cruelty of Things.The world is horrible and I am lonely,
     Let me rest here where yellow roses bloom
   And find forgetfulness, remembering only
     Your face beside me in the scented gloom.I am not here for passion,
     I crave no love, only a little rest,
   Although I would my face lay, lover's fashion,
     Against the tender coolness of your breast.I am so weary of the Curse of Living
     The endless, aimless torture, tumult, fears.Surely, if life were any God's free giving,
     He, seeing His gift, long since went blind with tears.Seeing us; our fruitless strife, our futile praying,
     Our luckless Present and our bloodstained Past.Poor players, who make a trick or two in playing,
     But know that death _must_ win the game at last.As round the Fowler, red with feathered slaughter,
     The little joyous lark, unconscious, sings,--
   As the pink Lotus floats on azure water,
     Innocent of the mud from whence it springs.You walk through life, unheeding all the sorrow,
     The fear and pain set close around your way,
   Meeting with hopeful eyes each gay to-morrow,
     Living with joy each hour of glad to-day.I love to have you thus (nay, dear, lie quiet,
     How should these reverent fingers wrong your hair?)So calmly careless of the rush and riot
     That rages round is seething everywhere.You think your beauty
     Does but inflame my senses to desire,
   Till all you hold as loyalty and duty,
     Is shrunk and shrivelled in the ardent fire.You wrong me, wearied out with thought and grieving
     As though the whole world's sorrow eat my heart,
   I come to gaze upon your face believing
     Its beauty is as ointment to the smart.Lie still and let me in my desolation
     Caress the soft loose hair a moment's span.Since Loveliness is Life's one Consolation,
     And love the only Lethe left to man.Ah, give me here beneath the trees in flower,
     Beside the river where the fireflies pass,
   One little dusky, all consoling hour
     Lost in the shadow of the long grown grass

   Give me, oh you whose arms are soft and slender,
     Whose eyes are nothing but one long caress,
   Against your heart, so innocent and tender,
     A little Love and some Forgetfulness.Fate Knows no Tears

   Just as the dawn of Love was breaking
          Across the weary world of grey,
   Just as my life once more was waking
          As roses waken late in May,
   Fate, blindly cruel and havoc-making,
          Stepped in and carried you away.Memories have I none in keeping
          Of times I held you near my heart,
   Of dreams when we were near to weeping
          That dawn should bid us rise and part;
   Never, alas, I saw you sleeping
          With soft closed eyes and lips apart,

   Breathing my name still through your dreaming.--
          Ah!But Fate, unheeding human scheming,
          Serenely reckless came between--
   Fate with her cold eyes hard and gleaming
          Unseared by all the sorrow seen.well-beloved, I never told you,
          I did not show in speech or song,
   How at the end I longed to fold you
          Close in my arms; so fierce and strong
   The longing grew to have and hold you,
          You, and you only, all life long.They who know nothing call me fickle,
          Keen to pursue and loth to keep.Ah, could they see these tears that trickle
          From eyes erstwhile too proud to weep.Could see me, prone, beneath the sickle,
          While pain and sorrow stand and reap!Unopened scarce, yet overblown, lie
          The hopes that rose-like round me grew,
   The lights are low, and more than lonely
          This life I lead apart from you.I want you only,
          And you who loved me never knew.You loved me, pleaded for compassion
          On all the pain I would not share;
   And I in weary, halting fashion
          Was loth to listen, long to care;
   But now, dear God!I faint with passion
          For your far eyes and distant hair.Yes, I am faint with love, and broken
          With sleepless nights and empty days;
   I want your soft words fiercely spoken,
          Your tender looks and wayward ways--
   Want that strange smile that gave me token
          Of many things that no man says.Cold was I, weary, slow to waken
          Till, startled by your ardent eyes,
   I felt the soul within me shaken
          And long-forgotten senses rise;
   But in that moment you were taken,
          And thus we lost our Paradise!Farewell, we may not now recover
          That golden "Then" misspent, passed by,
   We shall not meet as loved and lover
          Here, or hereafter, you and I.
   My time for loving you is over,
          Love has no future, but to die.And thus we part, with no believing
          In any chance of future years.We have no idle self-deceiving,
          No half-consoling hopes and fears;
   We know the Gods grant no retrieving
          A wasted chance.Verses: Faiz Ulla

   Just in the hush before dawn
   A little wistful wind is born.A little chilly errant breeze,
   That thrills the grasses, stirs the trees.And, as it wanders on its way,
   While yet the night is cool and dark,
   The first carol of the lark,--
   Its plaintive murmurs seem to say
   "I wait the sorrows of the day."Two Songs by Sitara, of Kashmir

   Beloved!your hair was golden
   As tender tints of sunrise,
   As corn beside the River
         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,
   Your melancholy sweetness,
   Your changeful eyes, that promised
         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,
   Were mine upon the River,
   The azure water saw us
         And the blue transparent sky;
   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

   Love, let me thank you for this!Now we have drifted apart,
   Wandered away from the sea,--
     For the fresh touch of your kiss,
   For the young warmth of your heart,
     For your youth given to me.Thanks: for the curls of your hair,
     Softer than silk to the hand,
   For the clear gaze of your eyes.For yourself: delicate, fair,
   Seen as you lay on the sand,
     Under the violet skies.Thanks: for the words that you said,--
     Secretly, tenderly sweet,
   All through the tropical day,
     Till, when the sunset was red,
   I, who lay still at your feet,
     Felt my life ebbing away,

   Weary and worn with desire,
     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.Naturally some
suburbs are more favored than others in this respect, notably Dulwich,
which, though fast losing its beautiful character under the ruthless
grip of the builder, still retains some delightful nooks where one may
occasionally hear the Nightingale's lovely song in its season.But the most noticable additions to the bird population of London have
been among the Starlings.Their quaint gabble and peculiar minor
whistle may now be heard in the most unexpected localities.Even
the towering mansions which have replaced so many of the slums of
Westminster find favor in their eyes, for among the thick clustering
chimneys which crown these great buildings their slovenly nests may be
found in large numbers.In some districts they are so numerous that the
irrepressible Sparrow, true London gamin that he is, finds himself in
considerable danger of being crowded out.This is perhaps most evident
on the sequestered lawns of some of the inns of the court, Gray's Inn
Square, for instance, where hundreds of Starlings at a time may now
be observed busily trotting about the greensward searching for food.Several long streets come to mind where not a house is without its pair
or more of Starlings, who continue faithful to their chosen roofs, and
whose descendants settle near as they grow up, well content with their
surroundings.House Martins, too, in spite of repeated efforts on the
part of irritated landlords to drive them away by destroying their
nests on account of the disfigurement to the front of the dwelling,
persist in returning year after year and rebuilding their ingenious
little mud cells under the eaves of the most modern suburban villas or
terrace houses.--_Pall Mall Gazette._




  [Illustration: From col.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Pigmy Antelopes present examples of singular members of the family,
in that they are of exceedingly diminutive size, the smallest being
no larger than a large Rat, dainty creatures indeed.The Pigmy is an
inhabitant of South Africa, and its habits are said to be quite similar
to those of its brother of the western portion of North America.The Antelope is a very wary animal, but the sentiment of curiosity
is implanted so strongly in its nature that it often leads it to
reconnoitre too closely some object which it cannot clearly make out,
and its investigations are pursued until "the dire answer to all
inquiries is given by the sharp'spang' of the rifle and the answering
'spat' as the ball strikes the beautiful creatures flank."The Pigmy
Antelope is not hunted, however, as is its larger congener, and may
be considered rather as a diminutive curiosity of Natures' delicate
workmanship than as the legitimate prey of man.No sooner had the twilight settled over the island than new bird voices
called from the hills about us.The birds of the day were at rest, and
their place was filled with the night denizens of the island.They
came from the dark recesses of the forests, first single stragglers,
increased by midnight to a stream of eager birds, passing to and fro
from the sea.Many, attracted by the glow of the burning logs, altered
their course and circled about the fire a few times and then sped on.From their notes we identified the principal night prowlers as the
Cassin's Auklet, Rhinoceros Auk, Murrelet, and varieties of Petrel.All through the night our slumbers were frequently disturbed by birds
alighting on the sides of the tent, slipping down with great scratching
into the grass below, where our excited Dog took a hand in the matter,
daylight often finding our tent strewn with birds he had captured
during the night.When he found time to sleep I do not know.He was
after birds the entire twenty-four hours.In climbing over the hills of the island we discovered the retreats of
these night birds, the soil everywhere through the deep wood being
fairly honeycombed with their nesting burrows.The larger tunnels
of the Rhinoceros Auks were, as a rule, on the <DW72>s of the hill,
while the little burrows of the Cassin's Auklet were on top in the
flat places.We opened many of their queer abodes that ran back with
many turns to a distance of ten feet or more.One or both birds were
invariably found at the end, covering their single egg, for this
species, like many other sea birds, divide the duties of incubation,
both sexes doing an equal share, relieving each other at night.The Puffins nested in burrows also, but lower down--often just above
the surf.One must be very careful, indeed, how he thrusts his hand
into their dark dens, for should the old bird chance to be at home, its
vise-like bill can inflict a very painful wound.The rookeries of the
Murres and Cormorants were on the sides of steep cliffs overhanging the
sea.Looking down from above, hundreds of eggs could be seen, gathered
along the narrow shelves and chinks in the rocks, but accessible only
by means of a rope from the top.--_Outing._

published in Birds._Kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, _kee-oe_, that is my cry, very loud and plaintive;
they say I am a very noisy bird; perhaps that is the reason why Mr.Blue Jay imitates me more than he does other Hawks.I am called Chicken Hawk, and Hen Hawk, also, though I don't deserve
either of those names.There are members of our family, and oh, what
a lot of us there are--as numerous as the Woodpeckers--who do drop
down into the barnyards and right before the farmer's eyes carry off
a Chicken.Red Squirrels, to my notion, are more appetizing than
Chickens; so are Mice, Frogs, Centipedes, Snakes, and Worms.A bird
once in a while I like for variety, and between you and me, if I am
hungry, I pick up a chicken now and then, that has strayed outside the
barnyard.But only _occasionally_, remember, so that I don't deserve
the name of Chicken Hawk at all, do I?Wooded swamps, groves inhabited by Squirrels, and patches of low timber
are the places in which we make our homes.Sometimes we use an old
crow's nest instead of building one; we retouch it a little and put in
a soft lining of feathers which my mate plucks from her breast.When
we build a new nest, it is made of husks, moss, and strips of bark,
lined as the building progresses with my mate's feathers.Young lady
Red-shouldered Hawks lay three and sometimes four eggs, but the old
lady birds lay only two.Blue Jay never sees a Hawk without giving the alarm, and on
he rushes to attack us, backed up by other Jays who never fail to go
to his assistance.They often assemble in great numbers and actually
succeed in driving us out of the neighborhood.Not that we are afraid
of them, oh no!We know them to be great cowards, as well as the crows,
who harass us also, and only have to turn on our foes to put them to
rout.Sometimes we do turn, and seizing a Blue Jay, sail off with him
to the nearest covert; or in mid air strike a Crow who persistently
follows us.But as a general thing we simply ignore our little
assailants, and just fly off to avoid them.RED-SHOULDERED HAWK.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.The Hawk family is an interesting one and many of them are beautiful.The Red-shouldered Hawk is one of the finest specimens of these birds,
as well as one of the most useful.Of late years the farmer has come to
know it as his friend rather than his enemy, as formerly.It inhabits
the woodlands where it feeds chiefly upon Squirrels, Rabbits, Mice,
Moles, and Lizards.It occasionally drops down on an unlucky Duck or
Bob White, though it is not quick enough to catch the smaller birds.It is said to be destructive to domestic fowls raised in or near the
timber, but does not appear to search for food far away from its
natural haunts.As it is a very noisy bird, the birds which it might
destroy are warned of its approach, and thus protect themselves.During the early nesting season its loud, harsh _kee-oe_ is heard from
the perch and while in the air, often keeping up the cry for a long
time without intermission.Goss says that he collected at Neosho
Falls, Kansas, for several successive years a set of the eggs of this
species from a nest in the forks of a medium sized oak.In about nine
days after each robbery the birds would commence laying again, and
he allowed them to hatch and rear their young.One winter during his
absence the tree was cut down, but this did not discourage the birds,
or cause them to forsake the place, for on approach of spring he found
them building a nest not over ten rods from the old one, but this time
in a large sycamore beyond reach.This seemed to him to indicate that
they become greatly attached to the grounds selected for a home, which
they vigilantly guard, not permitting a bird of prey to come within
their limits.This species is one of the commonest in the United States, being
especially abundant in the winter, from which it receives the name of
Winter Falcon.The name of Chicken Hawk is often applied to it, though
it does not deserve the name, its diet being of a more humble kind.The eggs are usually deposited in April or May in numbers of three or
four--sometimes only two.The ground color is bluish, yellowish-white
or brownish, spotted, blotched and dotted irregularly with many shades
of reddish brown.According to
Davie, to describe all the shades of reds and browns which comprise the
variation would be an almost endless task, and a large series like this
must be seen in order to appreciate how much the eggs of this species
vary.The flight of the Red-shouldered Hawk is slow, but steady and strong
with a regular beat of the wings.They take delight in sailing in the
air, where they float lightly and with scarcely a notable motion of
the wings, often circling to a great height.During the insect season,
while thus sailing, they often fill their craws with grass-hoppers,
that, during the after part of the day, also enjoy an air sail.Venice, the pride of Italy of old, aside from its other numerous
curiosities and antiquities, has one which is a novelty indeed.Its
Doves on the San Marco Place are a source of wonder and amusement to
every lover of animal life.Their most striking peculiarity is that
they fear no mortal man, be he stranger or not.They come in countless
numbers, and, when not perched on the far-famed bell tower, are found
on the flags of San Marco Square.They are often misnamed Pigeons, but
as a matter of fact they are Doves of the highest order.They differ,
however, from our wild Doves in that they are fully three times as
large, and twice as large as our best domestic Pigeon.Their plumage
is of a soft mouse color relieved by pure white, and occasionally
one of pure white is found, but these are rare.Hold out to them a
handful of crumbs and without fear they will come, perch on your hand
or shoulder and eat with thankful coos.To strangers this is indeed
a pleasing sight, and demonstrates the lack of fear of animals when
they are treated humanely, for none would dare to injure the doves of
San Marco.He would probably forfeit his life were he to injure one
intentionally.And what beggars these Doves of San Marco are!They will
crowd around, and push and coo with their soft soothing voices, until
you can withstand them no longer, and invest a few centimes in bread
for their benefit.Their bread, by the way, is sold by an Italian, who
must certainly be in collusion with the Doves, for whenever a stranger
makes his appearance, both Doves and bread vender are at hand to beg.The most remarkable fact in connection with these Doves is that they
will collect in no other place in large numbers than San Marco Square,
and in particular at the vestibule of San Marco Church.True, they are
found perched on buildings throughout the entire city, and occasionally
we will find a few in various streets picking refuse, but they never
appear in great numbers outside of San Marco Square.The ancient bell
tower, which is situated on the west side of the place, is a favorite
roosting place for them, and on this perch they patiently wait for a
foreigner, and proceed to bleed him after approved Italian fashion.There are several legends connected with the Doves of Venice, each of
which attempts to explain the peculiar veneration of the Venetian and
the extreme liberty allowed these harbingers of peace.The one which
struck me as being the most appropriate is as follows:

Centuries ago Venice was a free city, having her own government, navy,
and army, and in a manner was considered quite a power on land and sea.The city was ruled by a Senate consisting of ten men, who were called
Doges, who had absolute power, which they used very often in a despotic
and cruel manner, especially where political prisoners were concerned.On account of the riches the city contained, and also its values as
a port, Venice was coveted by Italy and neighboring nations, and, as
a consequence, was often called upon to defend itself with rather
indifferent success.In fact, Venice was conquered so often, first by
one and then another, that Venetians were seldom certain of how they
stood.They knew not whether they were slave or victor.It was during
one of these sieges that the incident of the Doves occurred.The city
had been besieged for a long time by Italians, and matters were coming
to such a pass that a surrender was absolutely necessary on account of
lack of food.In fact, the Doges had issued a decree that on the morrow
the city should surrender unconditionally.All was gloom and sorrow, and the populace stood around in groups
on the San Marco discussing the situation and bewailing their fate,
when lo!in the eastern sky there appeared a dense cloud rushing upon
the city with the speed of the wind.At first consternation reigned
supreme, and men asked each other: "What new calamity is this?"As the
cloud swiftly approached it was seen to be a vast number of Doves,
which, after hovering over the San Marco Place for a moment, gracefully
settled down upon the flagstones and approached the men without fear.Then there arose a queer cry, "The Doves!It
appears that some years before this a sage had predicted stormy times
for Venice, with much suffering and strife, but, when all seemed lost,
there would appear a multitude of Doves, who would bring Venice peace
and happiness.And so it came to pass that the next day, instead of
attacking, the besiegers left, and Venice was free again.The prophet
also stated that, so long as the Doves remained at Venice prosperity
would reign supreme, but that there would come a day when the Doves
would leave just as they had come, and Venice would pass into
oblivion.That is why Venetians take such good care of their Doves.You will not find this legend in any history, but I give it just as it
was told me by a guide, who seemed well versed in hair-raising legends.Possibly they were manufactured to order by this energetic gentleman,
but they sounded well nevertheless.Even to this day the old men of
Venice fear that some morning they will awake and find their Doves gone.There in the shadow of the famous bell-tower, with the stately San
Marco church on one side and the palace of the cruel and murderous
Doges on the other, we daily find our pretty Doves coaxing for bread.Often you will find them peering down into the dark passage-way in the
palace, which leads to the dungeons underneath the Grand Canal.What
a boon a sight of these messengers of peace would have been to the
doomed inmates of these murder-reeking caves.But happily they are now
deserted, and are used only as a source of revenue, which is paid by
the inquisitive tourist.She never changes, and the Doves of San
Marco will still remain.May we hope, with the sages of Venice, that
they may remain forever.--_Lebert, in Cincinnati Commercial Gazette._




BUTTERFLIES.It may appear strange, if not altogether inappropriate to the season,
that "the fair fragile things which are the resurrection of the ugly,
creeping caterpillars" should be almost as numerous in October as in
the balmy month of July.Yet it is true, and early October, in some
parts of the country, is said to be perhaps the best time of the year
for the investigating student and observer of Butterflies.While not
quite so numerous, perhaps, many of the species are in more perfect
condition, and the variety is still intact.Many of them come and
remain until frost, and the largest Butterfly we have, the Archippus,
does not appear until the middle of July, but after that is constantly
with us, floating and circling on the wing, until October.How these
delicate creatures can endure even the chill of autumn days is one of
the mysteries.Very curious and interesting are the Skippers, says _Current
Literature_.They are very small insects, but their bodies are robust,
and they fly with great rapidity, not moving in graceful, wavy lines
as the true Butterflies do, but skipping about with sudden, jerky
motions.Their flight is very short, and almost always near the
ground.They can never be mistaken, as their peculiar motion renders
their identification easy.They are seen at their best in August and
September.All June and July Butterflies are August and September
Butterflies, not so numerous in some instances, perhaps, but still
plentiful, and vying with the rich hues of the changing autumnal
foliage.The "little wood brownies," or Quakers, are exceedingly interesting.Their colors are not brilliant, but plain, and they seek the quiet and
retirement of the woods, where they flit about in graceful circles over
the shady beds of ferns and woodland grasses.Many varieties of the Vanessa are often seen flying about in May, but
they are far more numerous and perfect in July, August, and September.A beautiful Azure-blue Butterfly, when it is fluttering over flowers
in the sunshine, looks like a tiny speck of bright blue satin.Several
other small Butterflies which appear at the same time are readily
distinguished by the peculiar manner in which their hind wings are
tailed.Their color is a dull brown of various shades, marked in some
of the varieties with specks of white or blue."Their presence in the gardens and meadows," says a recent writer,
"and in the fields and along the river-banks, adds another element
of gladness which we are quick to recognize, and even the plodding
wayfarer who has not the honor of a single intimate acquaintance among
them might, perhaps, be the first to miss their circlings about his
path.As roses belong to June, and chrysanthemums to November, so
Butterflies seem to be a joyous part of July.It is their gala-day,
and they are everywhere, darting and circling and sailing, dropping to
investigate flowers and overripe fruit, and rising on buoyant wings
high into the upper air, bright, joyous, airy, ephemeral.But July can
only claim the larger part of their allegiance, for they are wanderers
into all the other months, and even occasionally brave the winter with
torn and faded wings."[Illustration: BUTTERFLIES.--Life-size.Somehow people always say that when they see a Fox.I'd rather they
would call me that than stupid, however."Look pleasant," said the man when taking my photograph for Birds,
and I flatter myself I did--and intelligent, too.Look at my brainy
head, my delicate ears--broad below to catch every sound, and tapering
so sharply to a point that they can shape themselves to every wave
of sound.Note the crafty calculation and foresight of my low, flat
brow, the resolute purpose of my pointed nose; my eye deep set--like
a robber's--my thin cynical lips, and mouth open from ear to ear.You
couldn't find a better looking Fox if you searched the world over.I can leap, crawl, run, and swim, and walk so noiselessly that even the
dead leaves won't rustle under my feet.It takes a deal of cunning for
a Fox to get along in this world, I can tell you.I'd go hungry if I
didn't plan and observe the habits of other creatures.When I want one for my supper off I trot to the nearest
stream, and standing very quiet, watch till I spy a nice, plump trout
in the clear water.A leap, a snap, and it is all over with Mr.Another time I feel as though I'd like a crawfish.I see one snoozing
by his hole near the water's edge.I drop my fine, bushy tail into the
water and tickle him on the ear.That makes him furious--nobody likes
to be wakened from a nap that way--and out he darts at the tail; snap
go my jaws, and Mr.Crawfish is crushed in them, shell and all.Between you and me, I consider that a very clever trick, too.How I love the green fields,
the ripening grain, the delicious fruits, for then the Rabbits prick up
their long ears, and thinking themselves out of danger, run along the
hillside; then the quails skulk in the wheat stubble, and the birds hop
and fly about the whole day long.I am very fond of Rabbits, Quails,
and other Birds.For dessert I have
only to sneak into an orchard and eat my fill of apples, pears, and
grapes.You perceive I have very good reason for liking the summer.It's the merriest time of the year for me, and my cubs.They grow fat
and saucy, too.The only Foxes that are hunted (the others only being taken by means of
traps or poison) are the Red and Gray species.The Gray Fox is a more
southern species than the Red and is rarely found north of the state
of Maine.Indeed it is said to be not common anywhere in New England.In the southern states, however, it wholly replaces the Red Fox, and,
according to Hallock, one of the best authorities on game animals in
this country, causes quite as much annoyance to the farmer as does
that proverbial and predatory animal, the terror of the hen-roost and
the smaller rodents.The Gray Fox is somewhat smaller than the Red and
differs from him in being wholly dark gray "mixed hoary and black."He
also differs from his northern cousin in being able to climb trees.Although not much of a runner, when hard pressed by the dog he will
often ascend the trunk of a leaning tree, or will even climb an erect
one, grasping the trunk in his arms as would a Bear.Nevertheless the
Fox is not at home among the branches, and looks and no doubt feels
very much out of place while in this predicament.The ability to climb,
however, often saves him from the hounds, who are thus thrown off the
scent and Reynard is left to trot home at his leisure.Foxes live in holes of their own making, generally in the loamy soil
of a side hill, says an old Fox hunter, and the she-Fox bears four or
five cubs at a litter.When a fox-hole is discovered by the Farmers
they assemble and proceed to dig out the inmates who have lately, very
likely, been making havoc among the hen-roosts.An amusing incident,
he relates, which came under his observation a few years ago will
bear relating.A farmer discovered the lair of an old dog Fox by
means of his hound, who trailed the animal to his hole.This Fox had
been making large and nightly inroads into the poultry ranks of the
neighborhood, and had acquired great and unenviable notoriety on that
account.The farmer and two companions, armed with spades and hoes,
and accompanied by the faithful hound, started to dig out the Fox.The
hole was situated on the sandy <DW72> of a hill, and after a laborious
and continued digging of four hours, Reynard was unearthed and he and
Rep, the dog, were soon engaged in deadly strife.The excitement had
waxed hot, and dog, men, and Fox were all struggling in a promiscuous
melee.Soon a burly farmer watching his chance strikes wildly with his
hoe-handle for Reynard's head, which is scarcely distinguishable in the
maze of legs and bodies.a sudden movement
of the hairy mass brings the fierce stroke upon the faithful dog, who
with a wild howl relaxes his grasp and rolls with bruised and bleeding
head, faint and powerless on the hillside.Reynard takes advantage of
the turn affairs have assumed, and before the gun, which had been laid
aside on the grass some hours before, can be reached he disappears over
the crest of the hill.Hallock says that an old she-Fox with young, to supply them with food,
will soon deplete the hen-roost and destroy both old and great numbers
of very young chickens.They generally travel by night, follow regular
runs, and are exceedingly shy of any invention for their capture, and
the use of traps is almost futile.If caught in a trap, they will gnaw
off the captured foot and escape, in which respect they fully support
their ancient reputation for cunning.Copyright by

abounds everywhere; absolutely unmolested, they are as tame as a
poultry yard, making the country one vast aviary.Yellow-beaked Minas,
Ring-doves, Jays, Hoopoes, and Parrots take dust baths with the merry
Palm-squirrel in the roadway, hardly troubling themselves to hop out
of the way of the heavy bull-carts; every wayside pond and lake is
alive with Ducks, Wild Geese, Flamingoes, Pelicans, and waders of every
size and sort, from dainty red-legged beauties the size of Pigeons up
to the great unwieldy Cranes and Adjutants five feet high.We pass a
dead Sheep with two loathsome vultures picking over the carcass, and
presently a brood of fluffy young Partridges with father and mother in
charge look at us fearlessly within ten feet of our whirling carriage.Every village has its flock of sacred Peacocks pacing gravely through
the surrounding gardens and fields, and Woodpeckers and Kingfishers
flash about like jewels in the blazing sunlight."----

WARNING COLORS.--Very complete experiments in support of the theory
of warning colors, first suggested by Bates and also by Wallace, have
been made in India by Mr.He concludes
that there is a general appetite for Butterflies among insectivorous
birds, though they are rarely seen when wild to attack them; also that
many, probably most birds, dislike, if not intensely, at any rate
in comparison with other Butterflies, those of the Danais genus and
three other kinds, including a species of Papilio, which is the most
distasteful.The mimics of these Butterflies are relatively palatable.He found that each bird has to separately acquire its experience with
bad-tasting Butterflies, but well remembers what it learns.He also
experimented with Lizards, and noticed that, unlike the birds, they ate
the nauseous as well as other Butterflies.----

INCREASE IN ZOOLOGICAL PRESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES--The
establishment of the National Zoological Park, Washington, has led
to the formation of many other zoological preserves in the United
States.In the western part of New Hampshire is an area of 26,000
acres, established by the late Austin Corbin, and containing 74 Bison,
200 Moose, 1,500 Elk, 1,700 Deer of different species, and 150 Wild
Boar, all of which are rapidly multiplying.In the Adirondacks, a
preserve of 9,000 acres has been stocked with Elk, Virginia Deer,
Muledeer, Rabbits, and Pheasants.The same animals are preserved by W.
C. Whitney on an estate of 1,000 acres in the Berkshire Hills, near
Lenox, Mass., where also he keeps Bison and Antelope.Other preserves
are Nehasane Park, in the Adirondacks, 8,000 acres; Tranquillity Park,
near Allamuchy, N. J., 4,000 acres; the Alling preserve, near Tacoma,
Washington, 5,000 acres; North Lodge, near St.Paul, Minn., 400 acres;
and Furlough Lodge, in the Catskills, N. Y., 600 acres.----

ROBINS ABUNDANT--Not for many years have these birds been so numerous
as during 1898.Once, under some wide-spreading willow trees, where the
ground was bare and soft, we counted about forty Red-breasts feeding
together, and on several occasions during the summer we saw so many in
flocks, that we could only guess at the number.When unmolested, few
birds become so tame and none are more interesting.East of the Missouri River the Gray Squirrel is found almost
everywhere, and is perhaps the most common variety.Wherever there is
timber it is almost sure to be met with, and in many localities is very
abundant, especially where it has had an opportunity to breed without
unusual disturbance.Its usual color is pale gray above and white or
yellowish white beneath, but individuals of the species grade from this
color through all the stages to jet black.Gray and black Squirrels
are often found associating together.They are said to be in every
respect alike, in the anatomy of their bodies, habits, and in every
detail excepting the color, and by many sportsmen they are regarded as
distinct species, and that the black form is merely due to melanism,
an anomaly not uncommon among animals.Whether this be the correct
explanation may well be left to further scientific observation.Like all the family, the Gray Squirrels feed in the early morning
just after sunrise and remain during the middle of the day in their
hole or nest.It is in the early morning or the late afternoon, when
they again appear in search of the evening meal, that the wise hunter
lies in wait for them.Then they may be heard and seen playing and
chattering together till twilight.Sitting upright and motionless
on a log the intruder will rarely be discovered by them, but at the
slightest movement they scamper away, hardly to return.This fact is
taken advantage of by the sportsmen, and, says an observer, be he
at all familiar with the runways of the Squirrels at any particular
locality he may sit by the path and bag a goodly number.Gray and Black
Squirrels generally breed twice during the spring and summer, and have
several young at a litter.We have been told that an incident of migration of Squirrels of a very
remarkable kind occurred a good many years ago, caused by lack of mast
and other food, in New York State.When the creatures arrived at the
Niagara river, their apparent destination being Canada, they seemed
to hesitate before attempting to cross the swift running stream.The
current is very rapid, exceeding seven miles an hour.They finally
ventured in the water, however, and with tails spread for sails,
succeeded in making the opposite shore, but more than a mile below the
point of entrance.They are better swimmers than one would fancy them
to be, as they have much strength and endurance.We remember when a
boy seeing some mischievous urchins repeatedly throw a tame Squirrel
into deep water for the cruel pleasure of watching it swim ashore.The
"sport" was soon stopped, however, by a passerby, who administered a
rebuke that could hardly be forgotten.Squirrels are frequently domesticated and become as tame as any
household tabby.Unfortunately Dogs and Cats seem to show a relentless
enmity toward them, as they do toward all rodents.The Squirrel is
willing to be friendly, and no doubt would gladly affiliate with
them, but the instinct of the canine and the feline impels them to
exterminate it.We once gave shelter and food to a strange Cat and
was rewarded by seeing it fiercely attack and kill a beautiful white
Rabbit which until then had had the run of the yard and never before
been molested.Until we shall be able to teach the beasts of the field
something of our sentimental humanitarianism we can scarcely expect to
see examples of cruelty wholly disappear.I killed a Robin--the little thing,
    With scarlet breast on a glossy wing,
      That comes in the apple tree to sing.I flung a stone as he twittered there,
      I only meant to give him a scare,
      But off it went--and hit him square.A little flutter--a little cry--
      Then on the ground I saw him lie.I didn't think he was going to die.But as I watched him I soon could see
      He never would sing for you or me
      Any more in the apple tree.Never more in the morning light,
      Never more in the sunshine bright,
      Trilling his song in gay delight.And I'm thinking, every summer day,
      How never, never, I can repay
      The little life that I took away.--SYDNEY DAYRE, in The Youth's Companion.THE PECTORAL SANDPIPER.More than a score of Sandpipers are described in the various works
on ornithology.The one presented here, however, is perhaps the most
curious specimen, distributed throughout North, Central, and South
America, breeding in the Arctic regions.It is also of frequent
occurrence in Europe.Low, wet lands, muddy flats, and the edges
of shallow pools of water are its favorite resorts.The birds move
in flocks, but, while feeding, scatter as they move about, picking
and probing here and there for their food, which consists of worms,
insects, small shell fish, tender rootlets, and birds; "but at the
report of a gun," says Col.Goss, "or any sudden fright, spring into
the air, utter a low whistling note, quickly bunch together, flying
swift and strong, usually in a zigzag manner, and when not much hunted
often circle and drop back within shot; for they are not naturally
a timid or suspicious bird, and when quietly and slowly approached,
sometimes try to hide by squatting close to the ground."Of the Pectoral Sandpiper's nesting habits, little has been known until
recently.Nelson's interesting description, in his report upon
"Natural History Collections in Alaska," we quote as follows: "The
night of May 24, 1889, I lay wrapped in my blanket, and from the raised
flap of the tent looked out over as dreary a cloud-covered landscape as
can be imagined.As my eyelids began to droop and the scene to become
indistinct, suddenly a low, hollow, booming note struck my ear and
sent my thoughts back to a spring morning in northern Illinois, and
to the loud vibrating tones of the Prairie Chickens.[See BIRDS AND
ALL NATURE, Vol.Again the sound arose, nearer and more
distinct, and with an effort I brought myself back to the reality of my
position, and, resting upon one elbow, listened.A few seconds passed,
and again arose the note; a moment later I stood outside the tent.The
open flat extended away on all sides, with apparently not a living
creature near.Once again the note was repeated close by, and a glance
revealed its author.Standing in the thin grass ten or fifteen yards
from me, with its throat inflated until it was as large as the rest of
the bird, was a male Pectoral Sandpiper.The succeeding days afforded
opportunity to observe the bird as it uttered its singular notes, under
a variety of situations, and at various hours of the day, or during the
light Arctic night.The note is deep, hollow, and resonant, but at the
same time liquid and musical, and may be represented by a repetition of
the syllables _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_, _too-u_."The bird
may frequently be seen running along the ground close to the female,
its enormous sac inflated.Murdock says the birds breed in abundance at Point Barrow, Alaska,
and that the nest is always built in the grass, with a preference for
high and dry localities.The nest was like that of the other waders, a
depression in the ground, lined with a little dry grass.The eggs are
four, of pale purplish-gray and light neutral tint.Copyright by
                 Nature Study Pub.Why was the sight
    To such a tender ball as th' eye confined,
    So obvious and so easy to be quenched,
    And not, as feeling, through all parts diffused;
    That she might look at will through every pore?--MILTON."But bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."The reason we know anything at all is that various forms of vibration
are capable of affecting our organs of sense.These agitate the brain,
the mind perceives, and from perception arise the higher forms of
thought.Perhaps the most important of the senses is sight.It ranges
in power from the mere ability to perceive the difference between light
and darkness up to a marvelous means of knowing the nature of objects
of various forms and sizes, at both near and remote range.One the simplest forms of eyes is found in the Sea-anemone.It has a
 mass of pigment cells and refractive bodies that break up the
light which falls upon them, and it is able to know day and night.An examination of this simple organ leads one to think the scientist
not far wrong who claimed that the eye is a development from what was
once merely a particular sore spot that was sensitive to the action
of light.The protophyte, _Euglena varidis_, has what seems to be the
least complicated of all sense organs in the transparent spot in the
front of its body.We know that rays of light have power to alter the color of certain
substances.The retina of the eye is changed in color by exposure to
continued rays of light.Frogs in whose eyes the color of the retina
has apparently been all changed by sunshine are still able to take a
fly accurately and to recognize certain colors.Whether the changes produced by light upon the retina are all chemical
or all physical or partly both remains open to discussion.An interesting experiment was performed by Professor Tyndall proving
that heat rays do not affect the eye optically.He was operating along
the line of testing the power of the eye to transmit to the sensorium
the presence of certain forms of radiant energy.It is well known that
certain waves are unnoticed by the eye but are registered distinctly
by the photographic plate, and he first showed beyond doubt that heat
waves as such have no effect upon the retina.By separating the light
and heat rays from an electric lantern and focusing the latter, he
brought their combined energy to play where his own eye could be placed
directly in contact with them, first protecting the exterior of his
eye from the heat rays.There was no sensation whatever as a result,
but when, directly afterward, he placed a sheet of platinum at the
convergence of the dark rays it quickly became red hot with the energy
which his eye was unable to recognize.The eye is a camera obscura with a very imperfect lens and a receiving
plate irregularly sensitized; but it has marvelous powers of quick
adjustment.The habits of the animal determine the character of the
eye.Birds of rapid flight and those which scan the earth minutely
from lofty courses are able to adjust their vision quickly to long and
short range.The eye of the Owl is subject to his will as he swings
noiselessly down upon the Mouse in the grass.The nearer the object the
more the eye is protruded and the deeper its form from front to rear.The human eye adjusts its power well for small objects within a few
inches and readily reaches out for those several miles away.A curious
feature is that we are able to adjust the eye for something at long
range in less time than for something close at hand.If we are reading
and someone calls our attention to an object on the distant hillside,
the eye adjusts itself to the distance in less than a second, but when
we return our vision to the printed page several seconds are consumed
in the re-adjustment.The Condor of the Andes has great powers of sight.He wheels in
beautiful curves high in the air scrutinizing the ground most carefully
and all the time apparently keeping track of all the other Condors
within a range of several miles.No sooner does one of his kind descend
to the earth than those near him shoot for the same spot hoping the
find may be large enough for a dinner party.Others soaring at greater
distances note their departure and follow in great numbers so that when
the carcass discovered by one Condor proves to be a large one, hundreds
of these huge birds congregate to enjoy the feast.The Condor's
eyes have been well compared to opera glasses, their extension and
contraction are so great.The Eagle soars towards the sun with fixed gaze and apparent fullness
of enjoyment.This would ruin his sight were it not for the fact
that he and all other birds are provided with an extra inner eyelid
called the nictitating membrane which may be drawn at will over the
eye to protect it from too strong a light.Cuvier made the discovery
that the eye of the Eagle, which had up to his time been supposed of
peculiarly great strength to enable it to feast upon the sun's rays, is
closed during its great flights just as the eye of the barnyard fowl
is occasionally rested by the use of this delicate semi-transparent
membrane.Several of the mammals, among them being the horse, are
equipped with such an inner eyelid.One of my most striking experiences on the ocean was had when I pulled
in my first Flounder and found both of his eyes on the same side of
his head.On the side which
glides over the bottom of the sea, the Halibut, Turbot, Plaice, and
Sole are almost white, the upper side being dark enough to be scarcely
distinguishable from the ground.On the upper side are the two eyes,
while the lower side is blind.When first born the fish swims upright with a slight tendency to favor
one side; its eyes are on opposite sides of the head, as in most
vertebrates and the head itself is regular.With age and experience in
exploring the bottom on one side, the under eye refuses to remain away
from the light and gradually turns upward, bringing with it the bones
of the skull to such an extent that the adult Flat-fish becomes the
apparently deformed creature that appears in our markets as a regular
product of the deep.The eyeless inhabitant of the streams in Mammoth Cave presents a
curious instance of the total loss of a sense which remains unused.These little fishes are not only without sight but are also almost
destitute of color and markings, the general appearance being much like
that of a fish with the skin taken off for the frying pan.The eyes of fishes generally are so nearly round that they may be used
with good effect as simple microscopes and have considerable magnifying
power.Being continually washed with the element in which they move,
they have no need for winking and the lachrymal duct which supplies
tears to the eyes of most of the animal kingdom is entirely wanting.Whales have no tear glands in their eyes, and the whole order of
Cetacea are tearless.Among domestic animals there is considerable variety of structure in
the eye.The pupil is usually round, but in the small Cats it is long
vertically, and in the Sheep, in fact, in all the cud chewers and many
other grass eaters, the pupil is long horizontally.Insects present a wonderful array of eyes.These are not movable, but
the evident purpose is that there shall be an eye in readiness in
whatever direction the insect may have business.The common Ant has
fifty six-cornered jewels set advantageously in his little head and
so arranged as to take in everything that pertains to the pleasure of
the industrious little creature.As the Ant does not move about with
great rapidity he is less in need of many eyes than the House-fly which
calls into play four thousand brilliant facets, while the Butterfly
is supplied with about seventeen thousand.The most remarkable of all
is the blundering Beetle which bangs his head against the wall with
twenty-five thousand eyes wide open.Then as a nimble Squirrel from the wood
      Ranging the hedges for his filbert food
      Sits pertly on a bough, his brown nuts cracking
      And from the shell the sweet white kernel taking;
    Till with their crooks and bags a sort of boys
    To share with him come with so great a noise
    That he is forced to leave a nut nigh broke,
    And for his life leap to a neighbor oak,
    Thence to a beech, thence to a row of ashes;
    Whilst through the quagmires and red water plashes
    The boys run dabbing through thick and thin.One tears his hose, another breaks his shin;
    This, torn and tattered, hath with much ado
    Got by the briars; and that hath lost his shoe;
    This drops his band; that headlong falls for haste;
    Another cries behind for being last;
    With sticks and stones and many a sounding holloa
    The little fool with no small sport they follow,
    Whilst he from tree to tree, from spray to spray
    Gets to the woods and hides him in his dray.--WILLIAM BROWNE,

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Birds and all Nature, Vol.In the knees, elbows, shoulders, and hips the
swelling is usually confined to the articulations, and there is but
little redness of the integument, but in the wrists and ankles the
inflammatory process is often more severe, and may invade the whole
dorsum of the hand or foot, rendering the integument tense, tumid red,
and shining.Pitting of the swollen parts, although quite exceptional
in acute articular rheumatism, will exist under the conditions just
mentioned.The metacarpo-phalangeal articulations are likewise often a
good deal swollen and of a bright-red color.The pain in the affected articulations varies from a trifling
uneasiness or dull ache to excruciating anguish; sometimes the pain is
felt only on moving or pressing the joint; pressure always aggravates
it; even the weight of the bed-clothes may be intolerable; and in
severe cases the slightest movement of the joint or a jar of the bed
produces great suffering.The pain, like the swelling, sometimes
extends beyond the affected joints to the tendinous sheaths, the
tendons, and muscles, and even to the nerves of the neighborhood.It is a striking peculiarity of acute rheumatism that the inflammation
tends to invade fresh joints from day to day, the inflammation usually,
but not invariably, declining in those first affected; and sometimes
this retrocession of the inflammation in a joint is so sudden, and so
coincident {28} with the invasion of a different one, that it is often
regarded as a true metastasis.Exceptionally, however, one or several
joints remain painful and swollen, although this occurs chiefly in
subacute attacks.In this way most of the large joints may successively
suffer once, twice, or oftener during an attack of acute rheumatism.And as the inflammation commonly lasts in each articulation from two to
four or more days, it is usual to have six or eight of the joints
affected by the end of the first week.While the ankles and knees,
wrists, elbows, and shoulders, are especially liable to be affected,
and with a frequency pretty closely corresponding to the above order,
the joints of the hands occasionally, and the hips even more
frequently, escape.The intervertebral and tempero-maxillary
articulations have very rarely suffered in the writer's experience.If the ear be applied to the cardiac region in acute rheumarthritis,
another local inflammation than the articular will very frequently be
detected, which otherwise would probably be unrecognized, and yet it is
the most important feature of the disease.In the first or second, or
even as late as the fourth, week of the fever the signs of endocarditis
of the mitral valve, occasionally of the aortic, and sometimes of both,
will exist in an uncertain but large proportion of cases, or those of
pericarditis, but in a less proportion, will obtain.Indeed, the
cardiac inflammation may even precede the articular, and some believe
it may be the only local evidence of rheumatic fever.As a general
rule, the implication of the endo- or pericardium in acute
rheumarthritis gives rise to no marked symptoms or abrupt modification
of the clinical features of the case, and a careful physical
examination must be instituted to discover its existence.But the
recurrence of pain or tightness either in the precordial or sternal
region, of marked anxiety or pallor of the face, of sudden increase in
the weakness or frequency of the pulse, or of irregularity in its
rhythm, of restlessness or delirium, of oppression of breathing, or of
short, dry cough,--may indicate the invasion of the endo- or peri- or
myocardium, and a physical examination will be needed to detect the
cardiac disease and to exclude the presence of pleuritis, pneumonia, or
bronchitis.Sometimes, however, especially in severe cases, an
extensive pericarditis, with or without myocarditis, will produce grave
constitutional disturbance, in which sleeplessness, delirium, stupor,
generally associated with a very high temperature and marked
prostration, will, as it were, mask both the articular and the cardiac
affection.[26]

[Footnote 26: See Stanley's case, _Med.-Chir.323, and Andral's _Clinique Medicale_, t. i.As regards the murmurs which arise in acute rheumatic endo- or
pericarditis, while they are usually present and quite typical, this is
not always so.The only alteration of the cardiac sounds may be at
first and for some time a loss of clearness and sharpness, passing into
a prolongation of the sound, which usually develops into a distinct
murmur, or the sounds may be simply muffled.In pericarditis limited to
that portion of the membrane which covers the great vessels no friction
murmur may be audible, or it may be heard and be with difficulty
distinguished from an endocardial murmur.On the other hand, a systolic
basic murmur not due to endo- or pericarditis frequently exists,
sometimes in the early, but usually in the later, stages of rheumatic
fever.{29} Other local inflammations occasionally arise in the course of
acute rheumatism: pneumonia is one of the most frequent; left pleuritis
is not infrequent, and is doubtless often caused by the extension of a
pericarditis; but both pneumonia and pleurisy are occasionally double
in rheumatic fever.Severe bronchitis is observed now and then, and
very rarely peritonitis, and even meningitis.These several affections,
together with delirium, coma, convulsions, chorea, and hyperpyrexia,
which are likewise occasional incidents of the disease, will be
considered under the head of non-articular manifestations and
complications of acute articular rheumatism.[27]

[Footnote 27: See observations of W. S. Cheesman, M.D., _New York
Medical Record_, Feb.Some of the symptoms of acute articular rheumatism need individual
notice.The temperature in acute articular rheumatism maintains no typical
course, and usually exhibits a series of exacerbations and remissions,
which correspond closely in time and degree with the period, duration,
and severity of the local inflammatory attacks.As a very general rule
in average cases, the temperature attains by the end of the first or
second day to 102 degrees F., and while the subsequent evening
exacerbations may reach 104 degrees, 104.4 degrees, or very rarely 105
degrees, yet in the great majority of cases the maximum temperature
does not exceed 103 degrees F., and in a very considerable number falls
short of 102 degrees.Southey's tables[28]
shows that in 84 cases of acute rheumatism 1 attained the temperature
of 105.8 degrees; 8, that of 104 degrees to 105 degrees; 15, that of
103 degrees to 104 degrees; 32, that of 102 degrees to 103 degrees; 17,
that of 101 degrees to 102 degrees; 10, that of 100 degrees to 101
degrees; and 1, that of 99.8 degrees; that is, the temperature was
below 103 degrees in five-sevenths, and below 104 degrees in about
ten-twelfths, of the whole.In very mild cases, in which but a few
joints are inflamed, and only to a slight degree, the temperature may
not reach 100 degrees at any time, and there may be intervals of
complete apyrexia.On the other hand, in a few rare severe cases of
rheumatic fever, especially when complicated with pericarditis,
pneumonia, or delirium, or other disturbance of the cerebral functions,
the temperature attains to 106 degrees, 108 degrees,[29] 109.4
degrees,[30] 110.2 degrees,[31] or even 111 degrees,[32] or 112
degrees.Such cases are now spoken of as examples of rheumatic
hyperpyrexia.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, xiv.[Footnote 29: Weber, _Clinical Society's Trans._, vol.Simon, quoted by Senator, _Ziemssen's Cyclop.[Footnote 31: Murchison and Burdon-Sanderson, two cases, _Clinical
Society's Trans._, vol.[Footnote 32: Ringer, _Med.There is no rule about the mode of invasion of this high temperature.It may ensue gradually or suddenly, the previous range having been low,
moderate, or high, steady or oscillating.Defervescence in rheumatic fever takes place, as a very general rule,
gradually--_i.e._ by lysis--but exceptionally it is completed in
forty-eight or even twenty-four hours.An interesting observation,
which will be of much prognostic value if it be confirmed hereafter,
has been made by Reginald Southey,[33] to the effect "that a short
period of defervescence, or a sudden remission and an early remission,
betokens the relapsing form of the disease, and the likelihood of
frequent relapses, as well as of slow ultimate recovery, in the direct
ratio as this defervescence has been early and abrupt."Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, xiv.{30} The characters of the urine in acute rheumatism are tolerably
uniform, but far from constantly so.Its quantity in the majority of
cases is reduced, frequently not exceeding twenty-four ounces per diem,
and occasionally not exceeding fourteen.This is owing in some degree
to profuse sweating, but also, as in other febrile affections, to
retention of water.Its density is usually high--1020 to 1030, or even
1035--which is due chiefly to its concentration, and not, as has been
generally supposed, mainly to an increase in the total solids
excreted.[34] Its color is a very dark red or deep reddish-yellow,
partly from concentration; but it is yet not known whether the deep hue
is partly from increase of the normal pigments or of one of them
(urobilin),[35] or from the presence of some abnormal coloring matter.Its reaction is generally highly acid, and continues so for many hours
after its discharge, unless in subacute cases, when it is occasionally
neutral or sometimes alkaline at the time of its escape, or becomes so
in a very short time afterward.It is commonly toward the decline of
the attack that the urine becomes neutral or alkaline.As a very
general rule, the amount of urea and of uric acid excreted during the
febrile stage exceeds what is physiological, and begins to decline when
convalescence commences; but this may be reversed (Parkes,[36]
Lede,[37] Marrot[38]).The sulphuric acid is notably increased
(Parkes), the chlorides often diminished and sometimes absent, and the
phosphoric acid very variable (Beneke, Brattler[39]), but usually
lessened (Marrot).[Footnote 34: See _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 3d Series, vol.[Footnote 35: Jaffe, _Virchow's Archiv_, xlvii.405, quoted in
_Ziemssen's Cyclopaed.[Footnote 36: _On Urine_, p.[Footnote 37: _Recherches sur l'Urine dans le Rheumatisme Artic.[Footnote 38: _Contribution a l'Etude du Rheumatisme Artic., etc._,
Paris, 1879, 41.][Footnote 39: Quoted by Parkes, _op.During convalescence the urine increases in quantity, while, as a
general rule, the urea and uric acid lessen relatively and absolutely,
and the chlorides resume their normal proportions to the other
ingredients.The reaction frequently becomes alkaline, and the specific
gravity falls considerably, although not always as soon as the
articular inflammation subsides.Temporary albuminuria occurs very
frequently in the febrile and occasionally in the declining stage, but
generally disappears when convalescence is completed.It obtained on
admission in 8 out of 43 cases lately reported by Dr.[40] A
more abiding albuminuria, due very rarely to acute parenchymatous
nephritis, may be met with (Johnson, Bartels, Hartmann, Corm).Blood,
even in considerable amounts, has also rarely appeared in the
urine,[41] sometimes in connection with embolic nephritis and
endocarditis, for such appear to have been the nature of Rayer's
nephrite rheumatismale.[42]

[Footnote 40: _Lancet_, 1882, i.[Footnote 41: _Clinical Lectures_, R. B. Todd, edited by Beale, 1861,
p.[Footnote 42: _Traite des Maladies Reins_.The saliva, which is normally alkaline, has usually a decidedly acid
reaction in acute articular rheumatism, and Dr.Bedford Fenwick states
that it always in this disease contains a great excess of the
sulpho-cyanides, and that these slowly and steadily diminish, till at
the end of the third week or so they become normal in amount.A profuse, very acid, sour-smelling perspiration is one of the striking
symptoms occurring in the course of acute articular rheumatism, and
{31} until very lately it has been generally held to indicate an
excessive formation in, and elimination of acid from, the system,
either lactic acid or some of the acids normal to the perspiration, as
acetic, butyric, and formic.However, not only have chemists failed to
detect lactic acid in the perspiration of acute rheumatism, but late
research tends to show that the excessive acidity of the perspiration
in this disease is but very partially due to the perspiration itself,
and is chiefly owing to chemical changes taking place in the overheated
and macerated surface of the skin and its epidermis, and to the
retention of solid products accumulated on that surface.Besnier says
that if in acute articular rheumatism or other disease attended with
much perspiration the surface be kept well washed, the sweat will be
found in the greater number of cases at the moment of its secretion to
be nearly neutral as soon as actual diaphoresis occurs, more decidedly
acid when the perspiration is less abundant or begins to flow, and
exceptionally alkaline.Most physicians are aware that the profuse
perspiration of acute rheumatism is non-alleviating; it is not a real
critical discharge of noxious materials from the system, nor is it
followed by prompt reduction of the temperature and other symptoms.It
is but a symptom of the disease, and occurs especially in severe cases,
and when it continues long after the reduction of the temperature it is
a source of exhaustion, and may be checked with advantage.The blood is deficient in red globules, Malassez finding in men from
2,850,000 to 3,700,000 per cubic millimeter instead of 4,500,000 to
5,000,000, and in women 2,300,000 to 2,570,000 instead of 3,500,000 to
4,000,000.The haemoglobin and the oxidizing power of the blood are
also considerably reduced; the fibrin is largely increased (6 to 10
parts in 1000 instead of 3); the albumen and albuminates are lessened,
the extractives increased; the proportion of urea is normal, and no
excess of uric acid is found in the blood.Instead of that fluid being
less alkaline than normal, Lepine and Conard have recently stated that
its alkalinity is increased in acute rheumatism, but constantly
diminished in chronic rheumatism,[43] and no excess of lactic acid has
been proved to exist in the blood in either acute or chronic
rheumatism.A condition of excessive coagulability of the fibrin,
independently of its excessive amount (inopexia), is an habitual
character of acute rheumatism; however, in very bad cases, especially
those attended with hyperpyrexia and grave cerebral symptoms, the blood
after death has been black and coagulated and the fluid in the serous
cavities has given an acid reaction.The above alterations in the blood
usually are proportionate to the intensity of the fever and the number
of the joints and viscera involved.[Footnote 43: Lepine, "Note sur la determination de l'Alcalinite du
Sang," _Gaz.de Paris_, 1878, 149; Conard, _Essai sur l'Alcalinite
du Sang dans l'Etat de Sante, etc._, These, Paris, 1878.]The manifestations of acute articular rheumatism other than the
articular are various, and some of them, more especially those observed
in the heart, may be regarded as integral elements of the disease, for
they occur in a large proportion of the cases, often coincidentally
with the articular affection, and may even precede it, and probably may
be the sole local manifestation of acute rheumatism, although under the
last-mentioned circumstances it is difficult to prove the rheumatic
nature of the ailment.The cardiac affections may be divided into inflammatory and {32}
non-inflammatory.The former consist of pericarditis, endocarditis, and
myocarditis; the latter embrace deposition of fibrin on the valves,
temporary incompetence of the mitral or tricuspid valves, and the
formation of thrombi in the cavities of the heart.For practical
purposes haemic murmurs may be included in the latter group.No reliable conclusions can be drawn respecting the gross frequency of
recent cardiac affections in rheumatic fever, for not only do authors
differ widely on this point, but they do not all distinguish recent
from old disease, nor inflammatory from non-inflammatory affections,
nor haemic from organic murmurs.Nor does it appear probable, from the
published statistics, that these differences are owing to peculiarities
of country or race.The gross proportion of heart disease of recent
origin in acute and subacute articular rheumatism was in Fuller's[44]
cases 34.3 per cent.; in Peacock's,[45] 32.7 per cent.; in Sibson's[46]
(omitting his threatened or probable cases), 52.3 per cent.;[47] in
3552 St.Bartholomew's Hospital cases analyzed by Southey,[48] 29.8 per
cent.; in Bouilland's cases, quoted by Fuller,[49] 5.7 per cent.; in
Lebert's,[50] 23.6 per cent.; in Vogel's,[50] 50 per cent.; in
Wunderlich's,[50] 26.3 per cent.I am not aware of any analysis,
published in this country, of a large number of cases of rheumatism
with reference to cardiac complications, but Dr.Austin Flint,[51]
after quoting Sibson's percentage of cases of pericarditis, which was
(63 in 326 or) 19 to the 100, remarks, "I am sure that this proportion
is considerably higher than in my experience."[Footnote 44: _On Rheumatism, Rheumatic Gout, etc._, 3d ed., p.[Footnote 46: Reynolds's _Syst.[Footnote 47: Those familiar with the accuracy and diagnostic skill of
the lamented Sibson will not hesitate to add his 13 cases of very
probable endocarditis to his 170 positive cases of cardiac inflammation
in 325 examples of acute rheumatism, which will raise his percentage to
56.3.][Footnote 50: See Senator in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed.The frequency of cardiac complications in rheumatism is influenced by
several circumstances.Some unexplained influence, such as is implied
in the terms epidemic and endemic constitution, appears to obtain.Peacock found the proportion of cardiac complications in rheumatism to
range from 16 to 40 per cent.during the five years from 1872 to 1876,
and a similar variability is shown in Southey's statistical table[52]
covering the eleven years from 1867 to 1877.Be it observed that these
variations occurred in the same hospitals and under, it may be
presumed, very similar conditions of hygiene and therapeusis.Youth
predisposes to rheumatic inflammation of the heart, so that it may
still be said that the younger the patient the greater the proclivity.were under twenty-one, and the
liability diminished very markedly after thirty.Of Sibson's cases, 62
per cent.In infancy and early childhood the
liability is very great, and at those periods of life the heart, and
more especially the endocardium, rarely escapes; and the cardiac
inflammation often precedes by one or two days the articular.The
careful observations of Sibson confirm the spirit, but not the letter,
of Bouilland's original statement, and proves that the danger of heart
disease is greater in severe than in mild cases of acute rheumatism,
and that this is especially true of pericarditis.(It may be remarked
here, en parenthese, that the number of joints affected is {33} very
generally in proportion to the severity of the attacks.)However, the
mildest case of subacute rheumatism is not immune from cardiac
inflammation, and it has occasionally been observed even in primary
chronic rheumatism.[53] Occupations involving hard bodily labor or
fatigue, whether in indoor or outdoor service, render the heart very
obnoxious to rheumatic inflammation.Existing valvular disease, the
result of a previous attack of rheumatism, favors the occurrence of
endocarditis in that disease.Some authorities maintain that treatment
modifies the liability to rheumatic affection of the heart, and this
will be spoken of hereafter.The period of the rheumatic fever at which
cardiac inflammation sets in varies very much, but it may be
confidently stated that it occurs most frequently in the first and
second weeks, not infrequently in the third week, seldom in the fourth,
and very exceptionally after that, although it has happened in the
seventh.An analysis of Fuller's experience[54] in 22 cases of
rheumatic fever and 56 of endocarditis--a total of 78--shows that the
disease declared itself under the sixth day in 8; from the sixth to the
tenth in 29; from the tenth to the fifteenth in 17; from the fifteenth
to the twenty-fifth in 18; and after the twenty-fifth in 6.The
friction sound was audible in Sibson's 63 cases of rheumatic
pericarditis--from the third to the sixth day in 10, and before the
eleventh day in 30, or nearly one-half of the whole.That observer
concludes "that in a certain small proportion of the cases, amounting
to one-eighth of the whole," the cardiac inflammation took place at the
very commencement of the disease, and simultaneously with the invasion
of the joints.[55]

[Footnote 52: _Lib.cit._]

[Footnote 53: Raynaud, _Nouveau Dict.et de Chir._, t. viii.See also Dickinson in _Lancet_, i.,
1869, 254; Bauer in _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vi.Of the several forms of rheumatic cardiac inflammation, endocarditis is
the most frequent, and in a large proportion of cases it may exist
alone; pericarditis is also very often observed, but it seldom is found
per se, being in the vast majority of cases combined with endo- and
occasionally with myocarditis.It is generally the ordinary verrucose
endocarditis that obtains.The ulcerative form occurs sometimes, and
should be suspected if in a mild or protracted case of acute rheumatism
endocarditis sets in with, or is accompanied by, rigors, and the
general symptoms are of pyaemic or typhoid character or both, even
although an endocardial murmur is not present, for extensive vegetating
ulcerative endocarditis frequently exists without audible murmur.It is
remarkable, as Osler has shown,[56] how few instances of ulcerative
endocarditis developing during the course of acute rheumatism are
reported; and I would add that by no means all of these were examples
of first attacks, chronic valvular lesions, the consequence of former
illness, existing in many of them at the time of the final acute
attack.Southey's[57] patient, and both of Bristowe's,[58] had had
previous rheumatic seizures.However, Peabody's case,[59] one of Ross's
three cases,[60] and Pollock's[61] case appear to have been examples of
ulcerative {34} endocarditis occurring during a first attack of acute
articular rheumatism.The united and thickened condition of two
segments of the aortic valve in one of Ross's cases indicates
old-standing disease, although no history of former rheumatism is
given.Goodhardt[62] has lately insisted upon the tendency of
ulcerative endocarditis to appear in groups or epidemics, but the
evidence is not conclusive.[Footnote 56: _Archives Medecine_, vol.Jour._, i., 1880, 798.][Footnote 59: _Medical Record N.Y._, 24th Sept., 1881, 361.]xi., 1882, 1, and
_ib._, vol.[Footnote 61: _Lancet_, ii., 1882, 976.]Space will not permit any detailed description of the symptoms and
signs of endo- or pericarditis: these will be found in their proper
places in this work, but a few observations are needed upon
myocarditis, which occasionally occurs in combination with rheumatic
pericarditis, and is a source of much more danger than the latter is,
per se.Maclagan[63] is almost the only authority who recognizes
the occurrence of rheumatic myocarditis independently of inflammation
of the membranes of the heart.He maintains that the rheumatic poison
probably and not infrequently acts directly on the cardiac muscle; in
which case the resulting inflammation is apt to be diffused over the
left ventricle and to produce grave symptoms, while in other instances
the inflammatory process begins in the fibrous rings which surround the
orifices of the heart (especially the mitral), extends to the substance
at the base of the heart, and is there localized.As in this latter
form the inflammation usually extends also to the valves, "any symptoms
to which the myocarditis gives rise are lost in the more obvious
indications of the valvulitis."However, this limited inflammation of
the myocardium is not dangerous.Maclagan asserts that the more
diffused and dangerous inflammation of the walls of the left ventricle,
while always difficult, and sometimes impossible, of diagnosis, can be
determined with tolerable certainty in some cases.In this view,
however, he has been preceded by Dr.Hayden,[64] who states that the
diagnosis of myocarditis is quite practicable irrespective of the
accompanying inflammation of the membranes of the heart.[Footnote 63: _Rheumatism: its Nature, Pathology, and Successful
Treatment_, 1881.][Footnote 64: _Diseases of the Heart and Aorta_, 1875, 746.]From the observations of the author just named, as well as of many
others, it may be inferred that acute diffused myocarditis of the left
ventricle exists in rheumatic fever when either with or without
coexisting pericarditis there are marked smallness, weakness, and
frequency of pulse, anguish or pain or great oppression at the
praecordia, severe dyspnoea, the respiration being gasping and
suspirious, feeble, rapid, and irregular action of the heart, great
weakness of the cardiac sounds, and almost extinction of the impulse,
evidence of deficient aeration of the blood combined with coldness of
surface, tendency to deliquium, and when these symptoms and signs
cannot be fairly attributed to extensive pericardial effusion or to
pulmonary disease, or to obstructed circulation in the heart consequent
upon endocarditis with intra-cardiac thrombosis or upon rupture of a
valve.It might, however, be impossible to exclude endocarditis
complicated with thrombosis, conditions which do occur in rheumatic
endocarditis, or a ruptured valve, which, although rarely, has been
occasionally observed.Grave cerebral symptoms, delirium, convulsions,
coma, though frequently present, are not peculiar to acute
myocarditis.[65] {35} Hence, even with the above group of clinical
facts, the diagnosis at best can be but probable.The disease, too, may
be latent, or, like Stanley's[66] celebrated case, produce disturbances
of the cerebral system rather than of the circulatory.[Footnote 65: In illustration see case by Southey in which the symptoms
and signs agree very well with the above description, and yet, although
the heart's substance was of dirty-brown color and the striation of its
fibre lost, Southey did not believe these appearances due to carditis.[Footnote 66: _Med.-Chir.Maclagan has advanced the opinion that a subacute myocarditis is
not of uncommon occurrence in acute articular rheumatism, and may be
unattended by endo- or pericarditis.Such a condition, he says, may be
diagnosed when early in the course of the case the heart's sounds
quickly become muffled rather than feeble.As he quotes but one
case[67] in which an autopsy revealed alterations in the walls of the
heart, and as endocarditis and a little effusion in the pericardium
coexisted, it is premature to accept the evidence as final, and the
great importance of the subject demands further investigation.Admitting with Fuller the occasional deposition of fibrin upon the
valves and endocardium in rheumatic fever independently of
endocarditis, the murmur resulting therefrom could not be reliably
distinguished from that of inflammatory origin.It remains to speak
briefly of temporary incompetence of the mitral and tricuspid valves
and their dynamic murmurs, and of haemic murmurs.Occasionally, in
severe cases of rheumatic fever, more especially in the advanced stage,
there may be heard a systolic murmur of maximum intensity either in the
mitral area or over the body of the left ventricle, unaccompanied by
accentuation of the second sound, or, as a general rule, by evidence of
pulmonary obstruction.Such murmurs are apt to be intermittent, and as
they disappear on the return of health, they have been satisfactorily
referred to temporary weakness of the walls of the heart, so that the
auriculo-ventricular orifices are not sufficiently contracted during
the ventricular systole for their valves to close them, and
regurgitation follows.Yet, inasmuch as Stokes distinctly mentions the
absence of murmur in many cases of softening of the heart in typhus, it
is probable that an excessive weakness of the ventricular wall is
incompatible with the production of murmur, and that the presence of
murmur in such circumstances is evidence of some remaining power in the
heart.D. West[68] has published some cases of acute dilatation of the
heart in rheumatic fever which strongly corroborate these views.The
murmur in one of them became appreciable only as the heart's sounds
increased in loudness and the dilatation lessened.One ended fatally,
and acute fatty degeneration of the heart's fibres was found in
patches.[69] I believe that some of these temporary mitral murmurs in
acute rheumatism depend upon a moderate degree of valvulitis quite
capable of complete resolution.Sibson[70] has lately stated that he
has met with the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation without a mitral
murmur in 13 out of 107 cases of rheumatic endocarditis, and with a
recent mitral murmur in 27 out of 50 {36} cases."The tricuspid murmur
generally comes into play about the tenth or twelfth day of the primary
attack, along with symptoms of great general illness;" it appears
earlier, as a rule, in those cases in which it is associated with
mitral regurgitation than when it exists alone; it is of variable
duration, but usually short--from one to nineteen days or more.He
regards it as of non-inflammatory origin, and dependent upon
regurgitation due to the so-called safety-valve function of the
tricuspid valve; and when limited to the region of the right ventricle
he infers that it is usually the effect and the evidence of
endocarditis affecting the left side of the heart.These novel
statements are confirmed by the observations of Parrot, Balfour, and
William Russell,[71] which go to prove that tricuspid regurgitation
occurs frequently in the more advanced stages of debility.No other
authority than Sibson, however, insists upon its frequent occurrence in
acute rheumatism.[Footnote 69: On this subject see Stokes, _Dis.423, 435, 502; Stark, _Archives generales de Med._, 1866; DaCosta,
_American Journal Med.Sci._, July, 1869; Hayden, _Dis.Heart and
Aorta_, 1875; Balfour, _Clin.on Heart and Aorta_, 1876; Cuming,
_Dublin Quart.Sci._, May, 1869; Nixon, _ib._, June, 1873.I. A. Fothergill has seen several cases in which such mitral murmurs
have followed sustained effort in boys, and have disappeared after a
time: _The Heart and its Diseases_, 2d ed., 1879, p.The anaemia which is so striking a symptom of rheumatic fever,
especially when several joints are severely inflamed, coexists very
frequently with a systolic basic murmur, which is most often louder
over the pulmonary artery (in second left intercostal space and more or
less to left of sternum) than over the aorta.The murmur may appear
early in the disease, but sets in most frequently when the disease is
subsiding.When thus appearing late in a case accompanied by
endocarditis and pulmonary congestion, it is of favorable omen and
indicates improvement in the thoracic affection.The growing opinion,
however, respecting so-called anaemic murmurs is, that they depend
chiefly upon regurgitation through the tricuspid orifice, although Dr.W. Russell refers them to pressure of a distended left auricle upon the
pulmonary artery.[72]

[Footnote 72: _Ib._, 1065.]Pulmonary affections in form of pleuritis, pneumonia, or bronchitis are
common complications of rheumatic fever.Adding Latham's,[73]
Fuller's,[74] Southey's,[75] Gull and Sutton's,[76] Pye-Smith's,[77]
and Peacock's[78] cases together, we have a total of 920 in which some
one or more of the above pulmonary affections obtained in 109
instances, or 11.8 per centum.A further analysis of Latham's and
Fuller's cases shows that it is especially when rheumatic fever is
complicated with cardiac disease that the lungs suffer; thus, pulmonary
affections obtained in 26.5 per cent.of cases complicated with heart
disease, and in only 7 per cent.It is
more especially when pericarditis complicates rheumatic polyarthritis
that pulmonary affections occur.Thus, these were found in only 10.5
per cent.of cases of recent rheumatic endocarditis, in 58 per cent.of
cases of pericarditis, and in 71 per cent.of cases of
endo-pericarditis.The tendency which inflammation of the pericardium
has to extend to the pleura probably partially accounts for the more
frequent association of the pulmonary affections with rheumatic peri-
than with rheumatic endocarditis.(Sibson found pleuritic pain in the
side twice as frequent in pericarditis, usually accompanied with
endocarditis (31 in 63), as in simple endocarditis, 26 in 108.[79]) But
the greater severity of those cases of rheumatic fever complicated with
peri- or endo-pericarditis must also have a decided influence in
developing the pulmonary affections.{37} Pneumonia and pleuritis are
very frequently double in rheumatic fever, and are often latent,
requiring a careful physical examination for their detection.So
suddenly does the exudation take place in some cases of rheumatic
pneumonia that the first stage is not to be detected either by symptoms
or signs.On the other hand, in some cases the absence of the typical
signs of hepatization, the want of persistence in the physical signs,
and their rapid removal, and even in rare instances an obvious
alternation between the pulmonary and the articular symptoms, suggest
that the process often stops short of true hepatization, and partakes
rather of congestion and splenization, with or without pulmonary
apoplexy--a view which has been occasionally confirmed by the
autopsy.[80]

Pleuro-pulmonaires du Rheumatisme Artic.Aigue_, Paris, 1878, pp.25-31; M. Duveau, _Dictionnaire de Med.et de Chir._, t. xxviii.Active general congestion of the lungs has occasionally been observed
in this disease, and has proved fatal in five minutes[81] and in an
hour and a half[82] from the invasion of the symptoms.The rheumatic
poison frequently excites pleuritis, some of the characters of which
are--the suddenness with which free effusion occurs; the promptness
with which it is removed, only perhaps to invade the other pleura, and
then to reappear in the cavity first affected; the diffusion of the
pain over the side and its persistence during the effusion; and its
frequent concurrence with pericarditis, and in children with
endocarditis; its little tendency to become chronic, and its marked
proclivity to become double.It is often latent and unattended with
pain.Sibson asserts that if in rheumatic pericarditis "pain over the
heart is increased or excited by pressure over the region of the organ,
it may with an approach to certainty be attributed to inflammation of
the pleura," etc.The product of the inflammation is commonly serous,
but occasionally purulent.[Footnote 81: _These d'Aigue pleur._, 1866, par B.[Footnote 82: M. Aran, quoted by Vasquez, _lib.The disturbances of the nervous system are amongst the most important
complications of acute rheumatism, and are due either to functional
disorder or very rarely to obvious organic lesions of the nerve-centres
or their membranes.The dominant functional disturbance may be
delirium, which is greatly the most frequent; or coma, which is rare;
or chorea, very frequently observed in children; or tetaniform
convulsions, which occur very seldom per se.As a rule, two or more of
these forms coexist or alternate with or succeed one another, and the
grouping, as well as the variety, of the symptoms may be greatly
diversified.In 127 observations there were 37 of delirium only, 7 of
convulsions, 17 of coma and convulsions, 54 of delirium, convulsions,
and coma, 3 of other varieties (Ollivier et R., cited by Besnier).Rheumatic Delirium.--Either with or without subsidence of the articular
inflammation, about from the eighth to the fourteenth day of the
illness, but occasionally at its beginning, or sometimes on the eve of
apparent convalescence, the patient becomes restless, irritable,
excited, and talkative; sleep is wanting or disturbed; some excessive
discharge from the bowels or kidneys occasionally occurs; profuse
perspiration is usually present, and may continue, but frequently
lessens or altogether ceases; the skin becomes pungently hot, the
temperature generally--not always, however--rising rapidly toward a
hyperpyrexial point, and ranging from {38} 104 degrees to 111 degrees;
and transient severe headache and disturbances of special sense
sometimes obtain.At a later period, or from the outset in hyperacute
cases, flightiness of manner or incoherence in ideas is quickly
succeeded either by a low muttering delirium, twitchings of the
muscles, violent tetaniform movements and general tremors, and a
condition perhaps of coma-vigil, or by an active, noisy, even furious,
delirium.The articular pains are no longer complained of, and
sometimes the local signs of arthritis also quickly disappear; but
neither statement is uniformly true.The pulse becomes rapid;
prostration extreme; semi-consciousness or marked stupor gradually or
rapidly supervenes; the temperature continues to rise; the face,
previously pale or flushed, becomes cyanotic; and very frequently death
ensues, either by gradual asthenia or rapid collapse, often preceded by
profound coma or rarely by convulsions.Deep sleep often precedes
prompt recovery.The duration of the nervous symptoms varies from one or two, or more
usually six or seven, hours in very severe cases, to three or four days
in moderate ones, or occasionally seven, eight, or sixteen[83] or
twenty-nine days[84] in unusually protracted cases.In the
last-mentioned, however, the delirium is not usually constant, and
frequently disappears as the temperature falls, and recurs when its
rises.Moreover, a rapid and extreme elevation of temperature is
frequently altogether wanting.[Footnote 83: Southey's case, _Clin.Sleeplessness preceded it for four days, and there was no
hyperpyrexia.][Footnote 84: Graham's case, _ib._, vi.Delirium set in on the
seventh day of illness, and three days after invasion of joints.Temperature 104.8 degrees early in disease; never exceeded 106 degrees,
probably owing to repeated use of cold baths.Temperature at death,
104.2 degrees.]No real distinction can be established between these protracted cases
of rheumatic delirium and so-called rheumatic insanity, in which occur
prolonged melancholia, with stupor, mania, hallucinations, illusions,
etc., often associated with choreiform attacks.This variety may be of
short duration or continue until convalescence is established, or may
rarely persist after complete recovery from the articular affection.Coma may occur in acute rheumatism without having been preceded or
followed by delirium or convulsions, although it is very rare; and,
like delirium, it may obtain without as well as with peri- or
endocarditis or hyperpyrexia.In
Priestly's case, an anaemic woman of twenty-seven, during a mild attack
of acute rheumatism, one night became restless; at 3 A.M.the pain
suddenly left the joints; apparent sleep proved to be profound coma,
and at 6 A.M.[85] Southey relates the
history of a girl of twenty who, without previous delirium or high
temperature, suddenly became unconscious, and died in half an hour.[86]
One of Wilson Fox's cases had become completely comatose, and was
apparently dying nine hours after the temperature had rapidly risen to
109.1 degrees, when she was restored to consciousness by a cold bath
and ice to her chest and spine.[87]

[Footnote 85: _Lancet_, ii., 1870, 467.][Footnote 87: _The Treatment of Hyperpyrexia_, 1871, 4.]Convulsions of epileptiform, choreiform, or tetaniform character
frequently succeed the delirium, but in exceptional cases they occur
independently of it, and may even prove fatal.Besides the choreiform disturbances which occur in connection with
delirium, stupor, tremor, etc.in cerebral rheumatism, simple chorea is
{39} frequently observed as a complication or a sequence, or even as an
antecedent, of acute articular rheumatism, and they occasionally
alternate in the same patient and in the same family.Chorea is perhaps
most frequently seen in mild cases and in the declining and
convalescent stages of rheumatic fever, and, while very common in
childhood and adolescence (five to twenty), it is very rare later in
life.Such are the chief functional disturbances of the brain met with in
rheumatic fever, and the post-mortem examination reveals in them either
quite normal naked-eye appearances, or more frequently, especially in
rapidly fatal cases, general congestion of the pia mater, and to a less
degree of the cerebral substance, or in more protracted cases a greater
or less increase of transparent or opalescent serum in the subarachnoid
space and ventricles.The serum may be slightly or deeply tinged with
blood.If the serous or sero-sanguinolent effusion be considerable, the
encephalic mass or portions of it may be anaemic.But besides these
conditions, which are also commonly observed in many other febrile
diseases, and which are probably only concomitants of the functional
disturbance arising in the advanced stage of acute articular
rheumatism, certain organic affections of the nervous centres or their
membranes occasionally occur in this disease, and are plainly the cause
of the cerebral disturbance observed during life.Cerebral meningitis,
although very rare as a complication of acute articular rheumatism,
except in certain hot climates, like that of Turkey,[88] does occur,
and lymph or pus is found, usually over the convexity of the brain, but
sometimes at the base and down the cord.[89] The symptoms of rheumatic
cerebral meningitis are very like those of rheumatic delirium;
vomiting, and even, but less frequently, pain in the head, may be
absent, while hyperpyrexia may coexist (Foster's case), although not
necessarily present.Should the pulse from being frequent become slow
and irregular, and any paralytic symptoms ensue, meningitis may be
suspected.In some of these cases the meningitis is a consequence of
ulcerative endocarditis and embolism of the cerebral vessels,[90] but
in others it obtains without endocarditis or any purulent formation
elsewhere than in the meninges, as there is probably a true rheumatic
localization like pericarditis.The articular inflammation may continue
after the invasion of the meningitis, or the latter may promptly follow
the disappearance of the former, as though a metastasis of morbid
action had taken place.[91] In many instances, according to Ollivier,
Ranvier, Behier, and others, although the macroscopic signs of
meningitis are absent, the microscope detects proof of its presence in
the existence of an increased number of vessels, fatty granulations on
their walls, proliferation of nuclei and capillary
extravasations--histological conditions identical with those found in
the mild degrees of rheumatic inflammation of the joints.[Footnote 88: Senator, in _Ziemssen_, xvi.[Footnote 89: Watson's _Prac.335; Fyfe,
_Med.cit._, 302; Leudet,

_ib._, ii.1868, 115; Hicks, _New York Medical Record_, Nov., 1878,
404.][Footnote 90: That ulcerative endocarditis frequently produces
meningitis is illustrated by Osler's cases, 4 out of 7 of which were
complicated with purulent meningitis: _Transactions of International
Med.[Footnote 91: See a case reported by W. L. Ramsey in _New York Medical
Record_, i., 1881, p.Embolism of the cerebral arteries, producing meningitis, or more
frequently softening of the cerebral substance or hemorrhage, or
proving {40} fatal before necrobiosis has time to set in, is an
occasional complication of acute articular rheumatism.A young lady,
while under my care suffering from her first attack of articular
rheumatism complicated with endocarditis, became suddenly hemiplegic
and aphasic, and died twelve hours later.In a girl of thirteen, the
subject of acute articular rheumatism complicated with ulcerative
endocarditis, right hemiplegia suddenly occurred, and at the autopsy
Bristowe found an embolon in the left middle cerebral artery and a
softened area in the left corpus striatum.Bradbury reports a primary
acute rheumatism with endocarditis, delirium, and coma, but without
paralysis, in which a plug was found in the right middle cerebral
artery, but the brain was quite healthy.[92]

[Footnote 92: _Lancet_, ii., 1870, 148; also a case in _Lancet_, i.,
1882, p.605: in eighth week of subacute articular rheumatism;
embolism; right hemiplegia.Autopsy: large vegetations on valves;
obstruction in middle cerebral artery.]Very much the same observations are applicable to the disturbances of
the spinal cord and its envelopes in rheumatic fever as have been made
in reference to those of the cerebrum and its coverings.They may exist
with or without any alteration of the cord or membranes to which they
can be reliably referred; that is to say, they may be simply functional
in the peculiar sense in which that word is now understood, or they may
be connected with obvious structural changes, and chiefly with those
indicating inflammation of the membranes or substance of the cord.The
spinal symptoms may precede the articular affection, but generally
appear after it.They sometimes closely resemble those of idiopathic
tetanus,[93] or of spinal meningitis, or of myelitis, or of
meningo-myelitis; and in the last case, along with severe rachialgia,
muscular rigidity, cutaneous and muscular hyperaesthesia, and neuralgic
pains, there will occur numbness and more or less paralysis of the
lower extremities,[94] bladder, and rectum (paraplegia).These spinal
disturbances may or may not be accompanied by hyperpyrexia, and when
simply functional they are usually less severe and persistent, have a
greater tendency to alternate with one another and with the articular
affection, and are more amenable to treatment, than when due to those
very rare complications of rheumatic fever, spinal meningitis or
meningo-myelitis.The inflammation may involve both the cerebral and
spinal membranes at the same time.[Footnote 93: Bright's case, 2, _Med.-Chirurgical Transactions_, xxii.E. C. Mann, _N.Y.Medical Record_, 1875, 38; Bouilland, _Traite
sur les Maladies du Coeur_, t. i. p.[Footnote 94: Leudet, _lib.139; Dowse, _Lancet_, i., 1872,
9.]The causes of these disturbances of the nervous system, when not
attributable to appreciable lesions, such as congestion, inflammation,
hemorrhage, embolism, thrombosis, and softening, are not established.The following appear to be reasonable conclusions from the facts at
present known:

The most constant condition, and without which these cerebral symptoms
very rarely arise, appears to be some susceptibility or vulnerability
of the nervous system, inherited or acquired, rendering it apt to be
disturbed by influences which less susceptible centres would
successfully resist.Trousseau, who has especially advocated this
view,[95] considered intemperance in the use of spirits to be a
frequent source of this nervous predisposition.Accepting this neurotic
predisposition as the factor generally present when acute articular
rheumatism is complicated {41} with disturbances of the nerve-centres,
we may inquire what are the circumstances in the disease capable of
developing into activity the predisposition.[Footnote 95: _Clin.-Med._, Syd.513 _et seq._]

Unquestionably, the existence of acute pericarditis, or of
endocarditis, or of inflammation of the lungs or pleura, is one of
those conditions.Probably hyperpyrexia acts in some cases as an exciting cause of the
nervous phenomena, for while the delirium preceded the hyperpyrexia in
6 cases, it accompanied it in 19 and followed it in 10;[96] and the
nervous symptoms disappear when the hyperthermia is removed by the
employment of cold, and recur with the return of high temperature.The
phenomena of sunstroke and heat-apoplexy prove that a high temperature
is capable of producing convulsions and coma.That these grave cerebral
disturbances are so infrequent in acute rheumatism (obtaining in about
3 or 4 per cent.only) is probably owing to the usual moderate range of
temperature and the rarity of hyperpyrexia in the disease.Still, while
hyperpyrexia is a disturber of cerebro-spinal function, too much
importance must not be attached to it, for not only does such
disturbance very frequently precede the hyperpyrexia, but there are
many facts indicating that the hyperpyrexia is itself very frequently,
like the delirium, tremor, and coma which precede or accompany it, but
a consequence of disorder, usually of a paralyzing kind, of the
nerve-centres.It has been met with in lesions of the pons, in tetanus,
in injuries of the cord, in some cases of non-inflammatory softening of
the brain and of cerebral hemorrhage; that is, in a class of affections
not belonging to the specific fevers, but to those directly disturbing
or destroying the functions of the nerve-centres.And cases of acute
rheumatism do rarely occur in which a very high temperature is not
accompanied by cerebral disturbances.Sibson quotes two such,[97] one
of which, with a temperature of 110.8 degrees, was only restless and
talked when asleep, and the other, with a temperature of 106.3 degrees,
presented only vomiting and dyspnoea.DaCosta relates one in his valuable paper upon cerebral
rheumatism in which, although the temperature was 110 degrees, no
cerebral symptoms nor cardiac affection existed.[98]

[Footnote 96: "Abstract Report upon Hyperpyrexia in Ac.[Footnote 98: This essay contains a record of 11 cases of cerebral
rheumatism and several autopsies: _Am.Sci._, 69, 1845, p.The goodly number of instances lately published in which grave cerebral
symptoms have obtained in acute articular rheumatism at ordinary
febrile temperatures, while they prove that hyperthermia is not an
essential condition productive of such symptoms, require to be
explained.Some such, no doubt, have been instances of marked
predisposition, so that a moderate febrile temperature or some
complication sufficed to disturb the brain, as we see in typhoid and
other fevers, in pneumonia, etc.If there be a rheumatic poison--which
has not yet been proved--it may, in predisposed persons, produce the
cerebral symptoms.The argument[99] that such poison should produce
inflammation of the nervous centres if it acted directly on them is not
convincing.It need not necessarily produce similar alterations in
serous or synovial membranes and in nervous tissues.Many toxic agents
disturb, and even suspend, the {42} cerebro-spinal functions, and leave
no appreciable changes in them.Do these cases prove that there is
something peculiar to rheumatic fever which tends to disturb the
nervous centres?Hardly; for while such disturbance is comparatively
rare in that disease, it is observed frequently in many other febrile
affections, notably in typhus, scarlatina, and small-pox; and as in
these, so in rheumatic fever, it is more often observed in the severe
than in the mild cases, as though it were a part of the systemic
disturbance incident to the febrile affection and largely proportionate
to its severity.[Footnote 99: Maclagan, _Rheumatism: Its Nature, Pathology, etc._,
1881, 287.]Yet there is something special in acute rheumatism which perhaps has to
do with the occurrence as well as the severity of the cerebro-spinal
symptoms and of the hyperpyrexia; viz.the long duration and severity
of the pain, and the number and importance of the parts, in addition to
the articulations, which are one after the other or simultaneously
involved in severe inflammation--peri-, endo-, myocardium, lungs,
pleura, etc.Perhaps in no other acute febrile disease are so many
distinct and important organs involved in inflammation at the same time
or in rapid succession; and it is no wonder that the functions of the
nervous system should in consequence become greatly depressed,
exhausted, or disturbed.The kidneys appear very rarely to suffer serious disease in acute
rheumatism, if we except embolism of their arteries due to
endocarditis; and it is very doubtful whether the rare instances[100]
in which an acute parenchymatous nephritis has been observed in acute
rheumatism can be referred to direct rheumatic inflammation, or not,
rather, to the operation of the exposure which induced the rheumatism.Further investigation is needed to determine whether interstitial
nephritis is even very exceptionally an indirect consequence of
rheumatism, as Lancereaux admits.[Footnote 100: See DaCosta's cases 1 and 2, _Cerebral Rheumatism, lib.cit._; case 1 certainly favors the view that either the rheumatic
poison, if there be such, or the constitutional disturbance incident to
acute polyarticular rheumatism, may sometimes produce nephritis.See
also a case by A. Deroye, These, Doctorat, Paris, 1874, quoted by P.
Coubere in _Contribution a l'Etude des Complications Renales du
Rheumatisme Artic.The other complications, being of less importance, must be but barely
alluded to.A pharyngitis attended with severe dysphagia and high fever
occasionally precedes the other symptoms or occurs in the early stage
of the disease.Gastralgia, enteralgia, simple serous diarrhoea, and
dysentery also rarely occur in acute rheumatism.That they are
sometimes, at least, truly rheumatic appears probable from the
circumstance that they may precede, follow, or alternate with the
articular affection, and are all intensely painful.I have but once met
with acute peritonitis as a complication of acute rheumatism; the
immunity of this serous membrane from rheumatic inflammation is an
inexplicable anomaly in view of the proclivity of the pericardium and
pleura to that process.Cystitis and orchitis are rare.Several cutaneous affections are not unfrequently observed in relation
with acute rheumatism.Besides sudamina and miliaria rubra, which are
very common as consequences of the excessive perspiration,[101] there
{43} are others which may be themselves rheumatic manifestations.Such
are especially erythema marginatum,[102] e. papulatum, and e. nodosum.A well-marked urticaria frequently precedes acute rheumatism in a
friend of the writer's; it may occur during its course or soon after
the cessation of the pains.Scarlatiniform eruptions are occasionally
observed, and very rarely punctiform hemorrhages--peliosis rheumatica
or rheumatic purpura.The purpuric symptom may be accompanied by
erythema or urticaria, and may precede, accompany, or alternate with
other rheumatic manifestations.Unlike purpura variolosa and idiopathic
purpura haemorrhagica, this variety appears to be free from danger.J. T. Metcalfe of New York many years ago showed me
a case of rheumatic fever in which the sweat-vesicles had run together,
forming, instead of the usual pearly globular vesicles, irregular flat
blebs, some of them equal in area to seven or nine primary vesicles,
filled with transparent fluid, and this fluid could be displaced by
pressure to adjacent parts, as though it lay simply under the
superficial epidermic layer.Palmer relates a case complicated with erysipelas
and peritonitis in _Boston Med.Besides a slight local oedema affecting the malleoli, scrotum, eyelids,
etc., or accompanying the cutaneous eruptions just mentioned, a more
decided infiltration of the subcutaneous cellular tissue occasionally
exists in the vicinity of the inflamed joints and tendinous sheaths,
and more rarely extends to an entire limb, which may not only be
considerably enlarged and painful and resemble a milk leg, but may be
red, hot, and tender, and excite suspicion of phlegmonous erysipelas.Phlebitis, although infinitely less frequent than in gout, has been
observed in acute articular rheumatism.[103] Jaccoud in 1871[104]
mentioned the exceptional occurrence of subcutaneous nodosities in
rheumatism, which he says Froriep first pointed out;[105] but Homolle
states that they had been previously mentioned by Sauvage and
Chomel.[106] Since then several independent observers have met with
this affection, and Drs.Thomas Barlow and Francis Warner of London
have lately written a short valuable paper upon the subject based upon
27 cases which they had separately or conjointly investigated.From
their paper the following account is chiefly derived:[107] These
nodules may vary in number from one to fifty, and in size from that of
a pin's head to the volume of an almond, and are quite subcutaneous,
firm and elastic, painless, and freely movable.They are not usually
attached to the skin, but to the tendons, deep fasciae, pericranium,
periosteum, etc.; the integument over them is free from heat, redness,
and infiltration, although exceptionally tenderness on pressure and
slight redness may exist over them.They are found most frequently on
the back of the elbow, the malleoli, and margins of the patella, but
occur occasionally on the extensor tendons of the hand and foot, the
scapular spine and iliac crest, the temporal ridge and superior
occipital curved line, the ear, etc.These nodules occur singly or in
clusters, and are often symmetrical; they are very rapidly developed in
crops or in succession, and last sometimes for a few hours, more
frequently from three or four days to four or five months, or even
eighteen to thirty months.The original formations may disappear, and
be succeeded by fresh ones; and sometimes, when no longer perceptible
by touch, they may be found post-mortem.Their development is
unattended by pyrexia, unless pleuritis, pericarditis, or other
condition coexist to which the pyrexia might {44} be referred.These
nodosities do not appear to suppurate or ossify or become infiltrated
with urate of soda, and histologically they resemble organizing
granulative tissue.Barlow and Warner found evidences of rheumatism in 25 out of 27 cases;
a morbid condition of the heart existed in all of them, and chorea in
10 of them.Two of the conclusions formulated by the authors just
mentioned are of great importance: that these subcutaneous nodosities
"may be considered as in themselves indicative of rheumatism, even in
the absence of pain;" that, while unimportant in themselves, they are
"of serious import, because in several cases the associated heart
disease has been found actively progressive."Dyce Duckworth has
reported two cases in which these nodules occurred in adults, lasted
eighteen months in one, and were still present in the other case after
thirty months, and were attached to the skin and periosteum.In one of
them the nodules were very painful and ached more in cold weather, and
the patient had no history of rheumatism or of chorea, although her
mother and one sister had.Stephen Mackenzie's case the
woman was the subject of tertiary syphilis, and had no personal history
of rheumatism or chorea, and she was free from heart disease; but her
family history was not given.[109]

much, and are apparently influenced by several circumstances, such as
the severity or the mildness of the articular affection, as well as of
the constitutional disturbance; the presence or not of complications;
the state of health of the patient about the time of the attack, and,
probably, the existence or not of a proclivity to the disease; and
whether the disease present the continued or the relapsing type.As a
tolerably general rule, when the constitutional symptoms are acute, the
skin hot, the perspiration free and very acid, the urine of high
density, color, and acidity, and several of the articulations are
swollen and very painful--when no serious complication, and especially
no severe cardiac affection, exists, and when the patient is endowed
with a fair constitution and with organs not damaged by previous
disease, the course of the fever is tolerably short and continuous, and
the recovery more or less prompt.Amongst the most reliable evidences
of approaching recovery in such cases is the tongue becoming clean and
losing its red color and the urine increasing considerably in quantity,
but containing a large proportion of solid matter, as indicated by a
high density.On the other hand, a large proportion of cases run a more irregular and
protracted course, and more or less marked relapses succeed real but
temporary improvements, the local disturbance affecting fresh joints or
reappearing in those previously attacked, and the general symptoms
resuming renewed activity.The duration of the active symptoms in these
cases is considerable, seldom under six weeks, and frequently occupying
seven, eight, or more.In these protracted cases the symptoms, as a
rule, are usually rather milder, the perspiration not as profuse or
sour, the urine of less density and acidity, the articulations less hot
and painful, than in the previously described group.Sometimes, indeed,
the perspiration and the urine are of neutral or even faintly alkaline
reaction.It is not only the unexplained tendency to relapse which
protracts these {45} cases, but sometimes in addition an established
proclivity to the disease--the rheumatic habit--or a condition of
previous unsound or frail health.Such cases occasionally pass into the subacute form, or the mild
febrile symptoms gradually and finally decline, and the joints may
either remain tender, swollen, and stiff some time longer, or these
signs of recent inflammation may soon disappear and leave the
articulations merely weak.Many cases of acute rheumatism embody several of the features of the
two groups just described, and no definite course or duration of acute
articular rheumatism can be accurately laid down.The course and duration of acute polyarticular rheumatism have received
a good deal of attention of late years.Austin Flint[110] was
one of the first to study the natural history of the disease
uninfluenced by active treatment, and he was followed in 1865,[111]
1866,[112] and 1869[113] by Sir William Gull and Dr.Sutton, who
treated a series of cases without medicine, unless mint-water be so
regarded.The mean duration of Flint's 13 cases from the date of attack
to convalescence, excluding one in which pericarditis and pneumonia
occurred, was a fraction under twenty-six days.It is unfortunate that
the number of cases was so small, and that 11 of the patients were
females, who appear to be especially subject to the milder and more
protracted attacks of the disease.A larger number, with an equal
proportion of the sexes, would probably have given a different result.[Footnote 110: _American Journal of Med.[Footnote 111: _Ib._, vol.[Footnote 112: _Medico-Chirurgical Transactions_, vol.[Footnote 113: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 2d Series, vol.Gull and Sutton have published the natural histories of 62 cases--viz.of 41 in their first series, of 8 more in their second, and of 13 more
in their third.The average duration of the acute symptoms was, in the
first series, 8.5 days, in the second, 9 days, and in the third, 10
days, giving an average of 9.1 days for the duration, after admission
to hospital, of the acute symptoms of acute polyarticular rheumatism
when there is no very severe cardiac disease.In their third paper,
based upon 13 new cases and 12 of those published in their two previous
communications, they conclude "that rheumatic fever uncomplicated with
any very severe heart affection tends to run its course in nineteen
days, calculating from the time the rheumatic symptoms first set in to
their termination."[114] Yet an analysis of the 23 of the 41 cases
contained in their first series[115] respecting which the duration of
the rheumatic symptoms before admission and from admission to complete
convalescence is given, shows that the period occupied from the setting
in of the rheumatic symptoms to convalescence was in the 13 male
subjects 25.8 days, and in the 10 female 42 days, or, including both
sexes, the average duration was 32.8 days--_i.e._ 6.8 days longer than
Flint's result.[Footnote 114: _Med.-Chir.[Footnote 115: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, xi.As Gull and Sutton had especially pointed out the class that tends to
assume acute characters and recover more quickly than any other, and
the class that runs a protracted course and tends to relapse, it is
somewhat remarkable that they did not tabulate the cases belonging to
those classes separately, and show distinctly their differences in
duration and {46} modes of convalescence.This has been attempted by
Southey,[116] but, unfortunately, his conclusions, as will hereafter
appear, have not been confirmed by other observers.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, xiv., and _ib._,
xv.]Finally, in this connection, after carefully weighing ten subjects of
acute articular rheumatism during their illness and until they had
regained their usual weight, A. Roussel[117] found that the time during
convalescence occupied in regaining the weight previously lost was
inversely proportional to the duration of the attack.[Footnote 117: _Essai sur la Convalescence du Rheumatisme Artic.Aigue_, Paris, 1881, 66.]Subacute Articular Rheumatism.Under this head Charcot, Besnier, and Homolle describe an affection
which corresponds closely with one variety of the disease commonly
called rheumatoid arthritis, but the writer employs the term with the
same significance as most modern English authors (Garrod, Sutton,
Flint, Maclagan).It is milder yet more enduring than the acute form,
but their symptoms are identical in kind.It is usually subacute from
the outset, although occasionally succeeding the acute type.The
febrile disturbance is but slight, rarely reaching 101 degrees, and the
perspiration is less abundant; there is less pain, heat, and tenderness
in the joints, and only a few of them are involved together; but
although the articular affection moves from joint to joint, it persists
for weeks or months in several of them or in one only, improving and
relapsing generally without apparent reason.However, it does not
seriously damage the articulations, and they ultimately quite recover.Mild cardiac affections also occur, but less frequently, and the
serious disturbances of the cerebral and respiratory systems are very
seldom met with.The gradations between subacute articular rheumatism
and the acute form on the one hand, and the simple chronic form on the
other, are almost innumerable.Marked anaemia is as much a feature of
subacute as of acute articular rheumatism, and its victims are often of
unhealthy or asthenic constitution, and subject to recurring attacks of
the disease on but slight provocation.The return of warm weather often
relieves such cases.THE MORBID ANATOMY OF ACUTE AND SUBACUTE ARTICULAR
RHEUMATISM.--Although opportunities of ascertaining the conditions of
the articulations in acute articular rheumatism are rare, yet it is now
established that the process is an inflammation involving chiefly the
synovial membrane, and to a less degree the cartilages, ligaments,
tendinous sheaths, and in some cases even the bones and periarticular
soft parts.The synovial membrane is more or less injected and reddened
diffusely or in patches, especially where it forms fringe-like folds
and at its line of union with the cartilage.It is somewhat thickened,
opaque, and devoid of its satin-like lustre, and in somewhat protracted
cases covered here and there with a thin, easily detached
neo-membranous formation.Within the articulations will be found from a
few drops to one or two ounces of a viscid, pale, citron- or
reddish- fluid, like synovia, but more fluid, and generally
turbid and containing transparent or semi-opaque gelatinous masses or
albumino-fibrinous flocculi.The {47} microscope reveals in the
effusion large detached spherical epithelial cells in various stages of
germination or of fatty degeneration, and a variable number of red
blood-corpuscles and pus-cells.Very exceptionally, the effusion is
mixed with more or less true pus.In two out of the eight fatal cases
reported by Fuller, in which the joints were examined, pus in moderate
quantity was found along with other products in some, but not in all,
of the inflamed articulations, and one of them was complicated with
erysipelas, the other with sloughs over both trochanters.In very
severe forms complicated with hemorrhagic tendencies the inflammatory
products have contained a large proportion of blood.Cornil et
Ranvier[118] insist that even in slight cases of rheumatic arthritis
the diarthrodial cartilage constantly suffers changes arising from
nutritive irritation and proliferation of the cartilage-cells.At first
the cartilage loses here and there some of its polished hyaline
appearance, and the microscope reveals a finely-striated condition of
its structure which gives it a velvety aspect.When the inflammation
has been more severe and of longer duration, so that the deeper layers
have been involved, the unaided eye will perceive local swellings in
which the natural elasticity and resistance of the cartilage are
impaired, and its surface is fissured or villous-like in appearance."In certain rare cases of mono-articular acute arthritis true
ulcerations of the cartilage are observed."[Footnote 118: _Manual d'Histologie pathologique_, Paris, 1869, 406.]The soft parts in the immediate vicinity of the inflamed joints may be
in some cases more or less congested and oedematous, and the tendinous
sheaths, and even the bursae mucosae, inflamed and distended with
inflammatory products like those in the articulations.Charcot,[119]
holding the opinion that arthritis deformans is but a chronic variety
of articular rheumatism, quotes Gurlt's statement that in acute
articular rheumatism "the medullary tissue of the ends of the bones
undergoes a great increase of vascularity, with proliferation of its
corpuscles," and remarks that Hasse and Kussmaul have also referred to
lesions of the bone and periosteum in that disease.But the condition
of the osseous parts of the joints in acute articular rheumatism can
hardly be said to be known, and it is premature to speak positively
respecting it.[Footnote 119: _Clinical Lectures on Acute and Chronic Diseases_,
Sydenham Soc., 1881, p.Finally, in subacute rheumatism the alterations in the synovial
membrane, and especially in the cartilages just described, are likely
to be more marked than in the acute form.The DIAGNOSIS of acute polyarticular rheumatism is seldom difficult in
adults, but when acute rheumatism localizes itself in one joint or
occurs in infancy or early childhood, a diagnosis, especially an early
one, sometimes cannot be easily established.The considerations by
which acute polyarticular rheumatism may be distinguished from acute
gout, subacute rheumatoid arthritis, and gonorrhoeal rheumatism will be
given in connection with those topics.Pyaemia has perhaps been confounded with acute articular rheumatism
more than any other disease, but the rheumatic affection, unlike the
pyaemic, is not necessarily connected with any pre-existing condition
capable of causing purulent infection of the blood or system, such as a
wound, fracture, abscess, or a local inflammation of bone, periosteum,
vein, pelvic organ, or a specific fever (variola, relapsing, typhoid,
{48} glanders, etc.); it does not present severe rigors, which recur at
irregular intervals and are attended with teeth-chattering and a high
temperature, 104 degrees to 105 degrees, rapidly attained; its type of
fever is not so intermittent or markedly remittent as that of pyaemia;
its profuse sweating continues although the temperature remains
febrile, but that of pyaemia coincides with the decline of the
temperature; unlike pyaemia, it only very rarely produces profound
constitutional disturbance of a typhoid character, and has no tendency
to run a rapidly fatal course in eight to ten days or in two or three
weeks; its visceral inflammations are chiefly cardiac, pleural, and
pulmonary, and tend to resolve; those of pyaemia are especially
pulmonary, pleural, and hepatic, although frequently cardiac also, and
generally produce suppuration and destruction of tissue.Multiple
subcutaneous abscesses and cutaneous blebs and pustules do not occur in
acute articular rheumatism, and its articular affection differs in many
respects from that of pyaemia; many more joints are involved; the
inflammation is erratic, very rarely fixed, and generally resolves
without damage to the articulation; the affected joint is usually
hotter, redder, more painful, and more sensitive, and the swelling is
less diffused, and its outline corresponds more accurately with that of
the synovial capsule.Sometimes acute articular rheumatism is
complicated with the phenomena of pyaemia, as when so-called ulcerative
endocarditis obtains.The acute inflammations which are occasionally observed in one or
several articulations of newly-born infants are generally pyaemic.It
is only in the early stage of acute glanders that the severe muscular
and articular pains sometimes present in that very rare disease in man
might lead to its being confounded with acute articular rheumatism; but
the patient's occupation and history, the early and severe prostration,
the absence, as a rule, of redness and swelling around the painful
articulations, and, in some instances, the early appearance of pustules
and blebs on the skin and of abscesses in the deeper tissues, will
suggest the real nature of the case.Acute periostitis frequently occurs in children in close proximity
either to one joint, or less frequently to more than one, and may
readily be confounded with acute articular rheumatism.But the
constitutional disturbance in acute periostitis is prompt and severe at
the outset; the swelling increases rapidly, is firmer than that of
arthritis, does not involve the joint proper and its capsule, but, like
the tenderness on pressure, exists above or below the articulations,
especially around the head of the bone; there are no visceral
complications, provided pyaemia has not supervened; the constitutional
symptoms early assume a typhoid character, and unless an early incision
be made a fatal issue soon ensues.The enlarged ends of the long bones and the pains in the limbs of
rickets might lead to a suspicion of acute articular rheumatism, but
the early age of such children, the absence of pain and swelling in the
joints, the beaded condition of the sternal ends of the ribs, the late
dentition and locomotion, the peculiarly shaped head, and other
evidences of that affection, would prevent a careful observer from
making a mistake.Inherited syphilis in infants, like rickets, may
produce fusiform swelling and thickening at the ends of the long bones,
especially the humerus and femur, and sometimes pain in the joints on
movement; but at first the swelling {49} is confined to the epiphyseal
line, and only later extends to the joint; there is a pseudo-paralysis
of the limb, and but little pain or fever; bony osteophytes may often
be felt under the skin at the line of union of the epiphysis with the
shaft; the epiphysis often becomes separated from the shaft, and
suppuration may ensue around the bone and in the articulation;
sometimes adhesions and perforation of the integument take place,
allowing of the escape of disintegrating osseous and cartilaginous
tissue; and there will coexist either on the skin or mucous membrane
some of the ordinary evidences of inherited syphilis.[120] The acute
and subacute articular inflammations occasionally observed in cerebral
softening and hemorrhage, in injuries and inflammation of the spinal
cord and caries of the vertebrae, may be distinguished from acute and
subacute articular rheumatism by the following circumstances: the
existence of some one of these diseases of the brain or cord, the
articular affection being usually confined to the paralyzed limbs; its
invasion about the time of the setting in of the late rigidity, or even
still later; the absence of cardiac complications and the presence of
other trophic or neuro-paralytic lesions, such as acute sloughings,
rapid atrophy of the palsied muscles, cystitis, ammoniacal urine,
etc.[121]

and 1876; R. W. Taylor, _Bone Syphilis in Children_, New York, 1875.][Footnote 121: See J. K. Mitchell, _Am.viii., 1831, and _ib._, 1833; Scott Alison, _Lancet_, i., 1846, 276;

Charcot, _Archives de Physiologie_, t. i. p.396, 1868, and many
others.]Acute articular rheumatism in children presents peculiarities.It often
affects but one joint, and has little tendency to become general; the
joints of the lower extremity, ankle, and knee are most obnoxious; the
local signs of inflammation, redness, swelling, and pain, are feebly
developed, and the child may walk as if nothing were wrong; the disease
is usually subacute; the temperature rarely very high; the perspiration
not profuse; the urine not scanty, and not often loaded with lithic
acid.Cardiac and the other internal complications, except the
cerebral, are more frequent than in adults; endocarditis is especially
frequent, pericarditis and pleuritis not rare.It is almost exclusively
in childhood that acute articular rheumatism becomes associated with or
followed by chorea, and yet the delirium, coma, and convulsions
frequently observed during rheumatic fever in the adult are very rarely
seen in the child.Muscular rheumatism, however, in the form of
torticollis, frequently coexists, and so do erythema nodosum and the
subcutaneous fibrous nodules previously described.Mono- or Uni-Articular Acute and Subacute Rheumatism.It is very rarely indeed that acute rheumatism invades a single joint
to the exclusion of the rest; and it is perhaps impossible to be
certain that such an arthritis is rheumatic unless some of the other
symptoms or complications of articular rheumatism supervene, or unless
it have succeeded a polyarticular rheumatism, which it very rarely
does.Mono-articular rheumatism is very generally of the subacute type,
and unattended with fever from the outset, or only a moderate pyrexia
obtains for a few days; there is generally considerable effusion into
the joint, with {50} swelling, pain, and moderate local heat; visceral
complications very rarely arise, but the local inflammation persists
most obstinately for six or eight weeks or three or four months, and
often leaves the joint tender, stiffs, and weak for a long time or even
permanently.In both the acute and subacute forms, before concluding
that the uni-arthritis is rheumatic, we must exclude the probability of
its being traumatic, strumous, syphilitic, gonorrhoeal, neurotic, or,
above all, of the nature of rheumatoid arthritis, which many such cases
really are.PROGNOSIS.--The disease is rarely directly fatal during the attack, yet
as the frequency of the complications varies unaccountably from time to
time, so the mortality may be exceptionally large or small for even
prolonged periods.It may be said that the average mortality ranges
between 1.16 and 4 per cent.The
average mortality in the Paris hospitals for four years (1868-69,
1872-73) Besnier fixes at 1.65 per cent.Bartholomew's,
London, Southey found it for fifteen years (1861-75) to be 1.16 per
cent.;[123] Pye-Smith fixes the rate at 4 per cent.in 400 cases
treated in Guy's;[124] W. Carter gives 2.5 per cent.as the rate during
ten years at the Southern and Royal Southern Hospitals of
Liverpool.[125] The death-rate appears to vary remarkably with age, as
Southey's figures show:[126] under ten years, 3.40 per cent.; between
ten and fifteen, 1.5 per cent.; between fifteen and twenty-five, 1.4
per cent.; between twenty-five and thirty-five, 0.9 per cent.; between
thirty-five and forty-five, 0.8 per cent., the mortality declining very
greatly after the tenth, after the twenty-fifth, and after the
forty-fifth year of life.[Footnote 122: _Dictionnaire Encyclopedique_, Troisieme serie, t.[Footnote 124: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, xix.[Footnote 125: _The Liverpool Medico-Chirurgical Journal_, July, 1881,
p.The danger of the case is usually proportionate to the youth of the
patient, the degree of the pyrexia, the number of the joints involved,
and the number and the character of the complications, the habits, and
previous health of the patient.A fatal issue is most frequently
observed in connection with hyperpyrexia alone, or in combination with
delirium or coma.A rapid rise of temperature and a temperature over
105 degrees, especially if cerebral disturbance coexist, indicate
danger; and so does arrested perspiration while the temperature is
high.In a much smaller number of cases death is due to some other
complication, especially to purulent pericarditis or to that combined
with pleuritis or pneumonia; in not a few cases the prior existence of
chronic valvular disease, with fibroid induration of liver and kidneys,
renders a fresh rheumatic endo- or pericarditis, occurring as part of
acute articular rheumatism, fatal.There is good if not conclusive
evidence that rather sudden death in acute articular rheumatism is
occasionally due either to diffuse myocarditis or to fatty degeneration
of the muscle of the heart.In Greenhow's 2 deaths out of 50 cases
treated by sodium salicylate the pericardium was universally adherent
and the heart's fibre fatty in one and pale and flabby in the other.Sudden death in this disease is very rarely due to embolism of the
pulmonary artery or of the cerebral vessels, while ulcerative
endocarditis is very exceptionally one of the sources of a fatal
issue.[127] But although acute articular rheumatism rarely kills {51}
directly, it frequently lays the foundation of subsequent ill-health,
and ultimately proves fatal through organic disease of the heart and
its many consequences.However, it is an interesting circumstance that
while acute rheumatic inflammation is prone to damage the heart
permanently, it very rarely, quite exceptionally, impairs the structure
or functions of the articulations.It is almost solely the subacute
form that now and then becomes chronic or renders a joint for a long
time painful, swollen, and crippled in its movements.Whether acute
rheumatism, however intense per se, ever ends in destructive
suppuration and ulceration of a joint is doubted by some authorities,
notwithstanding the cases published by Fuller and others.No doubt some
of the cases were really pyaemic, or perhaps gonorrhoeal; and it must
be borne in mind that acute articular rheumatism occasionally develops
pyaemia, and then an arthritis might be considered rheumatic when truly
pyaemic.The question of acute rheumatic arthritis exciting a chronic
rheumatoid affection will arise hereafter.[Footnote 127: See an article on the mortality among rheumatic risks by
A. Huntingdon, M.D., in _N.Y.TREATMENT.--Owing to our imperfect knowledge of the real nature of
acute articular rheumatism, its treatment is still largely either
empirical or intended to combat certain prominent symptoms or
complications of the disease.Of the various methods of treatment which
have been employed space will not permit a description; even of those
advocated by authorities of the present hour only very few will be
considered.The method which is now unquestionably the favorite one in both Europe
and America, and which in its power of promptly relieving the articular
and muscular pains and reducing the fever of acute rheumatic
polyarthritis may without exaggeration be compared to that exercised by
quinia over the paroxysms of ague, is that in which salicylic acid or
salicylate of sodium is given in repeated and full doses.It was in
July, 1875,[128] that Buss first asserted that salicylic acid was a
specific for rheumatism, and in March, 1876,[129] Maclagan, after
having employed salicine from 1874, published his experience of it as a
valuable remedy in the treatment of acute rheumatism, its beneficial
action being "generally apparent within twenty-four, always within
forty-eight, hours of its administration in sufficient dose."Perhaps a
sufficient time has now elapsed to permit of a just opinion of the
power of these new remedies, the salicyl compounds, over acute
articular rheumatism.The facts presented at the discussion recently
held at the Medical Society of London[130] are sufficiently numerous
and authoritative to justify, at least provisionally, some definite
conclusions as to the remedial relations of the salicylates to acute
articular rheumatism.[Footnote 128: "Die Antepyr.Wirkung der Salycylsaure," _Centralbl.Wissenschr._, 1875, 276.][Footnote 129: _The Lancet_, March 4 and 11, 1876.][Footnote 130: _The Lancet_, Dec.17, 24, 31, 1881; Jan.7, 14, 28,
1882.]The articular pain and the fever of acute rheumatic polyarthritis
are more or less speedily removed by the salicyl remedies (salicylic
acid, sodium salicylate, and salicine); the pains very frequently
persist after the temperature has become normal.Both symptoms were
removed by five days' use of such agents in 50 per cent., and by eleven
days' use in 80 per cent., of 355 cases treated at Guy's Hospital, and
tabulated by Fagge,[131] and by five days' use in 60 per cent., and by
eleven days' use {52} in 66 per cent., of the 60 severe cases treated
and severely criticised by Greenhow.[132]

[Footnote 131: _Ibid._, ii., 1881, 1031.][Footnote 132: _Clinical Society's Transactions_, vol.Fagge's table iv., _Lancet_, ii., 1881, 1032.]Again, in 190 cases of acute and subacute rheumatism the average
duration, under salicyl remedies, of pyrexia was 5.5 days and of joint
disease, 5.3 days (Warner[133]); in 156 cases at St.George's Hospital
the average duration of pyrexia was 3.66 days, of pain 4 days
(Owen[134]); in 82 at the Middlesex the average duration of pyrexia was
5 days, of pain 5.6 days (Coupland[135]); and in 55 at the Westminster
the average duration of pyrexia was 7 days, of pain 7.25
days[136]--that is, a general average duration in the whole series for
the pain and pyrexia of 5.4 days.[Footnote 133: _Ibid._, p.[Footnote 134: _Ibid._, p.[Footnote 135: _Ibid._, i., 1882, 10.][Footnote 136: _Ibid._, ii., 1881, p.of Fagge's cases and 58 per cent.of Greenhow's
were relieved of both the above symptoms on the fourth day; 24.8 per
cent.of Fagge's and 50 per cent.of Greenhow's on the third day; and
13.5 per cent.of Fagge's and 26.6 per cent.of Greenhow's on the
second day.In Clouston's 27 cases, treated in private, 66.6 per cent.from fever within three days, and
85.2 per cent.were devoid of pain and 72.7 per cent.[137] Finally, all who have had much experience of this
method of treating acute rheumatism will agree that the first or second
dose frequently relieves the articular pains like a charm, and the
local swelling then frequently subsides in from sixteen to forty-eight
hours.[Footnote 137: _The Practitioner_, i., 1882.]Relapses are more frequent--probably considerably more
frequent--under treatment by salicylates than under other methods.Thus, the average of relapses in eight different tables of cases
treated by the salicyl remedies ranged from 16.6 per cent.to 35 per
cent., giving a general average of 26 per cent.;[138] while under other
methods in three different tables the average ranged from 5.4 per cent.to 27.6 (this last under the full alkaline), giving a general average
of 16 per cent.[139] Relapses appeared to recur less frequently in
those cases which yielded to the salicylates within five days than in
those which took from six to eleven days to yield, in the ratio,
according to Fagge's figures, of 26.6 per cent.for the first, and 29.4
per cent.for the second day; and, according to Hood's, as 18.4 per
cent.There does not appear to be any regularity in
the order of occurrence or recurrence of relapses, nor is Southey's
definite statement that in "relapsing cases the temperature is nearly
or quite normal on the eighth evening, and a slight relapse occurs on
the thirteenth morning," borne out by the statistics produced at the
London Medical Society.Moreover, W. Carter's cases[140] have not
confirmed Southey's precise statement respecting the gradual remission
of the temperature on the eighth and ninth days of illness in the
continued or non-relapsing, uncomplicated forms.Irregularity and
inconstancy are the typical features of articular rheumatism.The
relapses under the treatment by the salicylates have been referred to
the premature disuse of those remedies, but they do occur
notwithstanding {53} the continued employment of them.It is a general
opinion that exposure to cold, errors in diet, and an early return to
work are frequent causes of relapse; and Broadbent refers the increased
liability to relapse under the salicyl compounds to the rapidity with
which those remedies relieve the acute symptoms of articular
rheumatism, in consequence of which sufficient care is not observed
either by the patients or their nurses, and they are exposed to some of
the above exciting causes of relapse.All the above causes do probably
play their part so long as the materies morbi (if that really exist
either as a chemical principle or as a germ) has not been wholly
eliminated or destroyed.Indeed, the short intervals which frequently
obtain between the primary invasion of the so-called relapses, and the
failure of the salicyl compounds to prevent peri- and endocarditis,
render it probable that what are commonly spoken of as relapses are not
due to a new infection, as in the case of the relapse of typhoid fever,
but to the recrudescences of a disease not yet terminated, but over
some of the manifestations of which--the articular inflammation and the
pyrexia--the salicylates exercise some control.[Footnote 138: Fagge's, 26.2 per cent.; Greenhow's, 35; Warner's, 33.6;
Owen's, 30.2; Hood's, 18.8; Coupland's, 35.3; Broadbent's, 16.6;
Powell's, 18.7; total, 214 divided by 8 = 26 per cent.][Footnote 139: Hood's, 5.4; Warner's, 14.9; Owen's, 27.6; total, 47.9
divided by 3 = 16 per cent.][Footnote 140: _The Liverpool Med.-Chirurgical Journal_, July, 1881, p.Authorities are generally agreed that the salicyl compounds do not
arrest or control rheumatic inflammation of the endo- or pericardium or
pleura, or subdue the pyrexia, if these complications in well-marked
degree exist; and there is strong evidence to show that they do not at
all constantly prevent the disease from involving those organs, even
after the articular affection has subsided under their use.Inestimable
as is the benefit conferred by these remedies in promptly relieving the
articular pain and fever, they do not secure the great desideratum in
the treatment of acute articular rheumatism--protection of the heart.In 352 cases treated with salicylate of soda at the Westminster
Hospital, heart disease developed in 13.6 per cent.; in 267 treated
without the salicylate, heart disease developed in 14.2 per cent.[141] In 350 cases treated with salicylates at Guy's,
heart complications obtained in 68 per cent., while in 850 treated
without them, the cardiac complications occurred in 58.8 per cent.[142] Gilbart-Smith collected a large number of cases from
several of the London hospitals, and analyzed them with the following
results: Of 1727 cases of acute rheumatism treated before the
introduction of the salicyl compounds, the proportion of cardiac
complications was 54.4 per cent.; in 1748 cases treated subsequently to
their introduction, the cardiac affections obtained in 63.4 per cent.;
and in 533 cases treated by the salicyl compounds, those affections
obtained in 68.4 per cent.[143]

[Footnote 141: _The Lancet_, ii., 1881, 1080.][Footnote 142: _Ibid._, ii., 1881, 1120.][Footnote 143: _Ibid._, i., 1882, 136.]These facts certainly seem to prove that the salicyl compounds do not
prevent the occurrence of the visceral complications or manifestations
of acute articular rheumatism; and if space permitted instances might
be quoted from many authors in which either endo- or pericarditis or
pleuritis or pneumonia or other visceral manifestation had set in after
the patient had been taking the salicylates long enough to have
produced their usual physiological effects; some of these will be
mentioned under the next section.It may be objected that in the above estimates sufficient attention has
not been paid to the period of the disease at which the treatment by
the {54} salicylates was begun, the time it was continued, the doses
given, the age of the patient, the severity and other characters of the
illness, such as whether acute or subacute, first or second attack,
complicated or not.It must be admitted that there are a few facts which render it very
probable that the salicyl compounds do really reduce the frequency of
these complications, and thus give some protection to the heart in
rheumatism.Of Powell's 32 cases, 19 = 60 per cent.had heart disease
when admitted; and of the remaining 13, 6 = 46 per cent.developed
cardiac disease after admission and while under the salicylates.Jacobi's[145] 150 cases, 78 = 52 per cent.were admitted with
unsound hearts, and of the other 72, only 5 = 6.9 per cent.developed
cardiac disease after beginning salicylate treatment.Of Southey's 51
cases, 24 = 47 per cent.were admitted with diseased hearts; and of the
remaining 27, only 4 = 14.8 per cent.developed a cardiac affection
subsequent to beginning treatment by the salicylates.[146] Of the
Boston Hospital cases, 38 per cent.were affected with heart disease at
entrance, and only 4.76 per cent.No heart affection was
developed in any of Clouston's 27 private cases--a result he attributes
to the early period at which the remedies are given in private
practice.But the number is too small to permit of any conclusion being
drawn, and 4 of the cases were examples of recurrence of the disease at
short intervals (three and four weeks) in the same patient, in whom
there appears to have existed no proclivity to cardiac complication,
for he had had four attacks before he came under Clouston's care.Moreover, his cases were mild, but 16 of them being acute, and of these
only 3 attaining a temperature of 103 degrees and upward.Finally,
Herman[147] estimates the percentage of heart affections that developed
after beginning the salicylates in the London Hospital at 18.7 per
cent., and after other treatment at 30 per cent.Omitting Clouston's,
the general average of the above results is, that in 49.2 per cent.cardiac disease existed before the patients began the salicyl
treatment, and that in 18.2 per cent.it developed after that, while 30
per cent.of cardiac disease developed after other methods of treatment
were begun.[Footnote 144: _Lancet_, i., 1882, 134.]Thomas's Hospital Reports_, New Series, viii.Bartholomew's Hospital Reports_, xvi.[Footnote 147: Quoted by T. G. Smith, _Lancet_, i., 1882, 137.]The subject is one beset with difficulties, and still needs
investigation.It is reasonable to infer that as the salicylates
promptly arrest the articular inflammation and allay the fever of
uncomplicated acute rheumarthritis, they will prevent the visceral
inflammations so apt to develop when the disease runs its course
uninfluenced by treatment; but experience has shown that they do not
control or arrest rheumatic inflammation of the heart or pleura or the
attending pyrexia, although capable of subduing the articular
inflammation and the pyrexia that accompanies it.The most eminent
therapeutists are divided on the subject.Maclagan, while admitting
that the salicyl compounds do not ward off cardiac complications, or
cure them when they exist, maintains that their existence is an
additional reason for giving those remedies freely and in large
doses.[148] Broadbent,[149] while believing in the protective influence
of the salicylates "when brought to bear upon the fever in the first
days of its existence," finds in the presence of any cardiac
inflammation a reason for at once discontinuing those remedies.Flint[150] believes that rheumatic endo- and {55} pericarditis are more
common since the introduction of the salicyl treatment than when the
alkaline method was relied upon almost entirely, and advises[151] the
administration of alkalies with the salicylates to protect the heart.Vulpian[152] thinks the protective power in question probable, but not
established; while the latest French authority, Homolle, is of opinion
that "cardiac affections are really less frequent in patients treated
by salicylate of sodium than in others."[153]

[Footnote 148: _Lib.[Footnote 149: _Lancet_, i., 1882, 138.]Med._, 5th ed., 1098.][Footnote 152: _Du Mode d'Action du Salicylate du Soude dans le
Traitement du Rheum.Aigue_, Paris, 1881, 11.][Footnote 153: _Nouveau Dict.et de Chir._, xxxi., 1882, 648.]The occurrence of hyperpyrexia is not always prevented by the
salicyl remedies, even when they have produced their full physiological
effects.Fagge endeavors to explain away the two cases of hyperpyrexia
which occurred under Greenhow and the other two which happened amongst
the cases tabulated by himself, and remarks that if the temperature
should begin to fall under the use of salicylic acid, and then should
change its course and rapidly attain a dangerous height, that would
really show that the drug is sometimes incapable of preventing the
occurrence of hyperpyrexia.This actually happened in one of Powell's
two cases,[154] and the patient died suddenly at a temperature of 107
degrees.In Greenhow's first case the patient had been taking the
salicylate for four days, and was deaf and delirious when the
temperature became 105.8 degrees.[155] Finney reports a case in which
drachm iss of salicine were given daily for two days, and drachm ij on
the third day, when pericarditis set in, and on the fourth day
hyperpyrexia supervened.[156] Haviland Hall records an instance in
which the temperature fell from 103.5 degrees to 100.6 degrees after
twenty-grain doses of salicylate soda, every three hours, taken for two
days; on the third day the medicine was given every four hours; the
temperature rose in the evening to 103.4 degrees, and on the next day
it rose rapidly to 108.7 degrees, and the patient became delirious.[157]

[Footnote 154: _Lancet_, i., 1882, 135.]Journ._, ii., 1881, 932.][Footnote 157: _Lancet_, ii., 1881, 1082.Times and Gaz._, ii., 1876, 383.]Pericarditis is not always present when hyperpyrexia arises during the
administration of salicylic acid; it was absent in Powell's cases, is
not mentioned in Hall's, and did not ensue in one of Greenhow's until
two days after the temperature had reached 105.4 degrees F. However,
either pericarditis or pneumonia is very frequently present when the
temperature is excessive.It is generally admitted that the salicylates
do not control rheumatic hyperpyrexia once it exists.Notwithstanding the prompt removal of the pain and reduction of the
fever by the salicyl compounds, the average duration of acute articular
rheumatism is not very considerably lessened by those remedies.Thus,
of Hood's[158] 350 cases treated by salicylates the average duration of
the illness was 35.95 days as against 38.75 under other methods.The
average time spent in bed by Warner's 342 cases was 19.5 days under the
salicylates, and by 352 patients under other remedies 23.5 days.Both
estimates show a curtailment of the duration of the disease by the new
treatment of three to four days only; which is not a very material
improvement.Hood's Tables 1 and 1_a_, _Lancet_,
ii., 1881, 1119.]Nor do the salicylates materially alter the time spent in
hospital by rheumatic patients; some evidence indicates that they
actually prolong that period.The following are the average residences
in hospital under the salicylates, according to several recent authors,
and they are remarkably uniform with two exceptions: Coupland, 36 days;
Warner, 34.9; Hall, 34; Southey, 32.5; Broadbent, 31.2; Powell, 31;
Finlay and Lucas, 29.7;[159] Owen, 23; Brown, 21.9;[160] or a general
average of 30.4 days for the salicyl remedies.Under full alkaline
treatment: Owen, 26 days; Dickinson, 25;[161] Fuller, 22.2;[162]
Blakes, 24;[163] or a general average of 24.3 days for full alkaline
treatment.And if to these we add Finlay and Lucas's results, 27.7
days, under but two to three drachms of alkaline salts in the
twenty-four hours--a quantity only the fourth of that given under the
full alkaline method--the general average residence in hospital under
alkaline treatment was but 25.4 days; that is, five less than under the
salicylate.[Footnote 159: _Lancet_, ii., 1879, 420.]The four
cases excluded by the reports are included in this calculation, that it
may more fairly be compared with other reports.][Footnote 161: _Lancet_, i., 1869.][Footnote 162: _The Practitioner_, i., 1869, p.[Footnote 163: _Boston City Hospital Reports_, 1st Series.]These several estimates of the time spent in hospital under the
salicylates, with the exception of Owen's and Brown's, correspond
closely with that of the time spent by Gull's and Sutton's patients
under mint-water--32.8 days--although the general average of them falls
short of the latter by 2.4 days.of Hood's[164] shows that under the
salicylate method 45.7 per cent.remained in hospital beyond forty
days, and 39 per cent.under other methods, and that about 50 per cent.more were discharged within twenty days under the other methods than
under the salicylate:

  350 cases treated with salicylates:
                        Days.850 without salicylates:
                        Days.[Footnote 164: _The Lancet_, ii., 1881, 1120.]These statistics favor Greenhow's opinion that patients treated with
salicylate of sodium regain their strength slowly, and are long in
becoming able to resume their ordinary occupations.Some allowance,
however, must be made for the precautions against relapse under
salicylates observed in hospitals since the great tendency thereto has
been recognized.Certain unpleasant or toxic effects are produced by salicylic acid
and salicylate of sodium; such are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
frontal headache, tinnitus, incomplete deafness, vertigo, tremor,
quickened respiration, very rarely amblyopia and even temporary
amaurosis, and not unfrequently delirium.A feeling of prostration and
general misery is not uncommon.These phenomena of salicylism are in
great measure proportionate to the dose employed, but they have
followed moderate {57} doses, owing sometimes to idiosyncrasy, and
perhaps frequently to retarded elimination consequent upon previous
disease of the kidneys or disturbance of their function by the
salicylic acid or its salt.Those agents are usually completely
excreted in forty-eight hours, but in one of Powell's[165] cases
elimination was not completed before the fifth day, and not before the
eighth in Byanow's case.[166] Possibly uraemia may in some cases cause
the delirium.[167] The delirium, which may be violent or not, is often
preceded by dryness of the tongue, restlessness, and rapid breathing.Impurities in the acid may account for the inconstancy with which
delirium has been noticed by different observers.While but 2 instances
in 82 cases were met with by Coupland, 3 out of 90 cases by Broadbent,
and 3 out of 109 by Brown,[168] Charles Barrows[169] encountered 8
instances in 28 cases.In one of these a boy of eleven became delirious
in eighteen hours, having taken 10 grs.of salicylate of sodium every
three hours.In another instance the drug had been in full use for five
days before the delirium manifested itself.These phenomena of
salicylism rapidly disappear when the medicine is stopped, and delirium
has not always recurred on its resumption.They are less frequent in
children, in whom elimination by the kidneys takes place very rapidly
and a marked tolerance of salicyl compounds exists.Occasionally more
serious effects appear to be produced by the salicylates, owing to
their direct action on the heart, impairing its power, as evidenced by
feeble impulse and sounds, increased frequency of the pulse, and
diminution of the arterial pressure.[170] But, notwithstanding the very
large number of cases of acute rheumatism that have been treated by the
salicyl compounds, very few clear instances of their toxic action on
the heart have been recorded, and even in some of these there were
other conditions present that may have played some part, perhaps a
chief part, in the production of cardiac failure.In Greenhow's
case[171] the autopsy revealed a dilated fatty heart and slightly
granular kidneys, and the cardiac failure coincided with a fall of
temperature to 97 degrees F. Goodhardt's[172] patient died in nine
hours after beginning the salicylic acid, of which she took but one
drachm, in divided doses, every three hours.The pulse rose rapidly to
160; she was restless and moaning, but died quietly and suddenly.Recent pericarditis, with one or two points of fatty degeneration of
the heart's substance, and sound kidneys were found.The reporter of
the case inclines to the opinion that the acid produced sudden collapse
and cardiac failure, while Bristowe referred them to the rheumatic
poison itself.I have not been able to refer to Hoppe Seyler's
paper,[173] in which he relates that having given 5 grammes of
salicylic acid to a child of seven and a half years affected with
articular rheumatism, shortly afterward there occurred deafness,
agitation, profuse sweating, dyspnoea, and finally fatal collapse.The
condition of the heart and kidneys before and after death is not given.Weber {58} published[174] an instance in which 15-gr.doses of salicin
given to a woman of twenty-seven produced in thirty-four hours a rapid
fall of temperature from 103 degrees to 96 degrees F., accompanied by
delirium and serious but not fatal collapse.It is well to remember
that a similar failure of cardiac power is occasionally observed in
other fevers when rapid defervescence occurs, although the salicyl
compounds have not been taken; and it is certainly necessary to give
these remedies cautiously, and often to administer alcohol with them,
when the heart's action is at all enfeebled by protracted pyrexia and
pain, or by disease (inflammatory or degenerative) of its substance or
envelope.Indeed, if severe cardiac inflammation obtain in rheumatism,
the remedies are powerless and perhaps unsafe.The sudden reduction of
the temperature when much exhaustion obtains, even in the hyperpyrexia
of rheumatic and other fevers, whether by salicylic acid or quinia or
the cold bath, may be attended with fatal collapse of the heart.[Footnote 165: _Lancet_, i., 1882, 135.][Footnote 166: Quoted by Wood in his _Therapeutics and Mat.Med._,
1880, from _Centralb.fur Chir._, 1877, 809.][Footnote 167: See DaCosta's observations in _Am.lxix., and Ackland's in _B.Journal_, i., 1881, 337.]Record_, April 29, 1882, 456.][Footnote 170: Kohler, _Centralb.Wissensch._, 1876, and

le Rheumatism_, Paris, 1879, p.Instead of the frequent weak pulse above mentioned, I have many times
found salicylate of sodium render the pulse very slow, labored, and
compressible in typhoid fever, and generally at the same time the
temperature has been considerably reduced below what it had been.A temporary albuminuria is not infrequent; excluding mere traces, it
obtained in 52 per cent.of cases treated by the salicylates alone or
in conjunction with full doses of alkali, and in but 25 per cent.of
those in which full doses of alkali, with or without quinia, were
employed.[175]

[Footnote 175: Isambard Owen, _Lancet_, ii., 1881, p.Very rarely haematuria and even nephritis have occurred.The active
principle is chiefly eliminated by the kidneys, which may account for a
local irritating influence upon those organs.Salicine is much preferred by Maclagan to salicylic acid and to
salicylate of sodium, on the grounds that it is a bitter tonic and
produces less debility and more rapid convalescence than those agents,
and that it never produces delirium nor depresses the heart's action.Ringer[176] and Charteris[177] state that they have never seen
salicine, even in large doses, cause delirium; and Prof.Gairdner has
not found it produce any unfavorable symptoms.[178] On the other hand,
Greenhow[179] found that marked depression of the heart's power ensued
in 4 out of 10 cases whilst the patients were taking salicine, and
entirely subsided after it was discontinued.Further careful and
extended observation is needed before the relative value of salicine
and salicylate of sodium can be reliably stated.It is probable that
the salt is more active and prompt than the bitter principle; and this,
with the greater cheapness of the former, may perhaps account for the
more general employment in hospitals of the salicylate than of
salicine.The latter, moreover, is often tolerated when the former is
not.[Footnote 176: _Handbook Therapeutics_, 8th ed., 1880, 587.]Jour._, i., 1881, 229.][Footnote 178: _Lancet_, i., 1882, in table giving experience of
British hospitals, prepared by Maclagan.]As regards the doses of these agents required in acute rheumatic
arthritis, practitioners are not agreed; Maclagan, Stricker, Fagge,
Broadbent, Ringer, Flint, See, recommend large doses at short intervals
at the outset, with the view of getting the patient rapidly under the
influence of the drug.Maclagan gives salicine scruple i-ij at first
hourly, then every two hours {59} as the acute symptoms begin to
decline; after the second day he allows 20 to 30 grs.every four hours
for two or three days; "and for a week or ten days more that quantity
should be taken three times a day."Stricker, Fagge, Broadbent, and See
recommend about 20 to 30 grs.of salicylate of sodium every hour or two
for six doses (= drachm ij-iij in the day), and Ringer would employ 10
grs.hourly, and if in twenty-four hours this dose has not either
modified the disease or produced its characteristic symptoms, he would
increase it to 15 and then to 20 grains hourly.On the other hand,
Owen's[180] results show practically no difference in the duration of
pain and pyrexia and in the average duration of illness from the
commencement, whether drachm iij or drachm ij or drachm iss were given
every twenty-four hours; and C. G. Young[181] found that 10 to 15 grs.every one, two, or three hours are sufficient.[Footnote 180: _Lancet_, ii., 1881.]Sci._, Sept., 1880, 193.]Indeed, exceptionally good and exceptionally indifferent results are
reported under similar doses.No such good results are reported as
those of the Boston City Hospital under doses of drachm ij to drachm iv
per diem, the average residence in hospital being only eighteen days if
four cases which became chronic are excluded, or 21.9 days if they are
included.The plan in vogue at our hospital here and in my own private practice
is to give about 15 grains every two or three hours, according to the
severity of the case and until the articular pain and pyrexia are
relieved.After the pain and pyrexia have yielded, the remedy should be
continued in smaller doses, say 10 to 15 grs., three or four times a
day, according to the severity of the case, for eight to ten days
longer, to prevent relapse, and during this period exposure, exercise,
and dietetic excesses must be carefully guarded against.The salicine may be given dissolved in milk or enclosed in wafers; the
salicylate of soda, in a solution of any aromatic water, to which
extract of liquorice or syrup of lemon and a few drops of spirits of
chloroform may be added.The French add a little rum to flavor the
mixture.Should severe cardiac inflammation exist, and, even although
not severe, should there exist signs of failure of cardiac power,
salicylates and salicine had better be avoided.If the secretion of
urine diminish considerably under their use, or haematuria supervene,
or organic disease of the kidneys exist, they must be employed
cautiously, and may require prompt suspension.If marked debility
exist, stimulants, especially the alcoholic, should be combined with
them.The oil of wintergreen has recently been well spoken of by F. P.
Kinnicutt of St.Luke's Hospital, New York,[182] as a substitute for
salicylate sodium.It is itself a methyl salicylate 90 per cent., plus
terebene 10 per cent.Its officinal name is oleum gaultheria, and it is
given in doses of minim x-xv every two hours except during sleep, and
in severe cases of articular rheumatism during the twenty-four hours,
either by floating the oil upon a wineglass of water or milk or in
capsules or upon lumps of white sugar.It resembles in its influence
upon acute rheumatism very closely the sodium salicylate, for which it
may perhaps be substituted, and Kinnicutt maintains that it is quite as
effectual, pleasanter to take, and free from the intoxicating
properties of the salt and the salicylic acid.It requires to be
continued during convalescence just like the salicylate.Record of New York_, Nov., 1882, 505.]{60} The alkalies--in this country at least--were the favorite remedies
in the treatment of acute articular rheumatism before the powers of
salicine and salicylic acid became generally known, and there are still
authorities who maintain their excellence, if not their superiority
over the salicylates, in protecting the heart against the recurrence of
rheumatic inflammation (Flint, Dickinson, Sinclair, Stille).Under the term the alkaline treatment unfortunately are included two
distinct methods of administering the salts composed of potash and soda
and the vegetable acids, carbonic, tartaric, citric, etc.--viz.: that
in which about half a drachm of one of these salts is given three or
four times a day; and the other known as Fuller's method, in which
large doses are prescribed, so that from an ounce to an ounce and a
half is given in the first twenty-four hours, with the view of rapidly
rendering the urine alkaline, and if possible the perspiration also;
for I have frequently produced the former effect in less than twelve
hours, yet have found the perspiration still redden litmus on the
second, and even the third, day and later.A disregard of the essential
differences existing between these two methods of employing alkalies in
acute rheumatism may partially account for the differences of opinion
existing as to the value of the alkaline treatment, and for the
differences in the statistical results thereof published by various
observers--a remark applicable to other methods and statistics also.Fuller commonly ordered every three or four hours bicarb.sodium drachm
iss and acetate of potassium drachm ss dissolved in ounce iij of water
and rendered effervescing at the moment of administration by the
addition of an ounce of lemon-juice or drachm ss of citric acid.As
soon as the urine presents an alkaline reaction--which is usually the
case in twelve to twenty-four hours--the quantity of the alkali is
reduced by one-half, or to about 8 drachms, during the succeeding
twenty-four hours, and provided the urine continues alkaline to 3
drachms on the third day.On the fourth day and subsequently only a
scruple to half a drachm of alkali is given three times a day,
sufficient to keep the urine alkaline, and to each dose are added 3
grains of quinia dissolved in lemon-juice; and this combination is
continued till convalescence sets in.An aperient pill is given
whenever needed, but is administered "only under conditions of extreme
nervous irritation."The method is not an exclusively alkaline one.Space will not allow of a lengthened analysis of the statistics that
have been published on this subject, and I will give only some of the
more important statistical results.While, as we have seen, the average
duration of pyrexia and articular pain under salicylate treatment is
about 5.4 days, under moderate alkaline treatment, according to the
recent statistics of Finlay and Lucas,[183] the average duration of
pyrexia was 10.3 days and of articular pain 12.2 days, and of Owen[184]
6.5 days for the first and 8 days for the second, or a general average
for the pain and pyrexia together of 9.25 days, or about 3.85 days
longer than under the salicylate treatment.Nor can it be said even of
the full alkaline plan that the first or second dose frequently
relieves the articular pains like a charm.On the other hand, it has
been already shown that the average time spent in hospital was five
days less under the full alkaline than under the salicylate treatment.[Footnote 183: _Lancet_, ii.[Footnote 184: _Ibid._, ii., 1881, 1081.]As regards the relative power of the salicylates and of full alkaline
{61} treatment in protecting the heart, the following analysis and
calculation deserve attention.The percentage of cases in which cardiac
disease set in after the salicylate treatment began was, according to
Powell, 18.75; according to Haviland Hall, 37.1; according to Finlay
and Lucas, 11.60; Southey, 8; Brown, 4.76; Jacobi, 3.35, or a general
average of 14 per cent.; whereas cardiac disease developed after the
alkaline treatment had commenced in 13.6 per centum according to
Blake;[185] in 10.7 per cent.according to Dickinson;[186] in 7 per
cent.according to Owen; in 6.6 per cent.according to Finlay and
Lucas; and in 2 per cent.according to Fuller; making a general average
of only 7.8 per cent.Reports of Boston City Hospital_, 1st
Series, 1870.][Footnote 186: This percentage is obtained by adding together all the
cases treated by alkalies given by Dickinson in his IX., X., XI., and
XII.Their total was 65 cases in which the heart was affected
seven times.from drachm ii-iv of alkaline salts were
given daily, and in table X. about drachm iij daily.--_Lancet_, i.,
1869.]Judging from these statistics, it is not improbable that a combination
of sodium salicylate, with full doses of bicarbonate of sodium or
chlorate of potassium, will give better results in the treatment of
acute rheumatism than either of those classes of remedies singly.Indeed, Flint and others have advised such combinations, and Bedford
Fenwick has recently stated, as a result of his experience in 30 cases,
that if, after giving a free purge, followed by scruple doses of sodium
salicylate hourly for six hours, that salt be stopped, and in twelve
hours afterward half-drachm doses of citrate of potassium be
administered every four or six hours until the saliva becomes alkaline,
relapses will be extremely rare, and that this is the safest and most
successful method of treating acute and subacute articular
rheumatism.[187]

[Footnote 187: _Lancet_, i., 1882.]Having spoken somewhat fully upon the remedies of which I have most
personal experience, and which have the largest number of advocates at
the present time, and having advised the combination of these remedies,
I shall only glance at some of the other remedies or methods of
treating the disease still more or less employed.Quinia, given in divided doses to the extent of 15 to 30 grains in the
day, is still highly thought of in France in the early stages, during
the course of and on the occurrence of relapses, in acute (especially
febrile poly-) articular rheumatism.It is claimed by Briquet,
Monneret,[188] Legroux, and others that although not a specific for the
disease it moderates the general disturbance, diminishes the local
affections, and even <DW44>s the development or lessens the gravity of
the cerebral symptoms--that, although it does not control the cardiac
inflammations, it is not contraindicated by them.The only recent
English authority who has strongly advocated full doses of quinia in
this disease is Garrod,[189] but he mixed the drug, in five-grain
doses, with half a drachm of bicarbonate of potassium, a little
mucilage, and spirits of chloroform, and gave it every four hours until
the fever and articular affection had completely abated.Sufficient
facts have not been published to permit of the formation of a reliable
judgment as to the actual or the comparative value of either the simple
quinia or the quino-alkaline treatment of acute and subacute articular
rheumatism.There can be no doubt as to the value of quinia to meet
certain conditions incident to the disease, such as debility, lingering
{62} convalescence, periodical relapse, excessive perspiration, failure
of appetite, and perhaps, in some instances, high temperature.Barclay
has found quinia of much service when depression has followed the long
continuance of the alkaline treatment and is attended with alkaline
urine and a deposit of the earthy phosphates.[190] It may be given by
the rectum if not tolerated by the stomach or if the alkalines are
being taken.[Footnote 188: _La Goutte et le Rheumatisme_, Paris, 1857.][Footnote 189: Reynolds's _Syst.111 _et
seq._]

Greenhow[191] has treated 43 cases with iodide of potassium and
quinine, and says that his experience of this method contrasts
favorably with that of salicine and salicylate of soda.However,
pneumonia supervened in 3 cases while under treatment; cardiac
inflammation arose in 6 cases (= 14 per cent.)after admission; single
relapses of short duration occurred in 21 per cent.; and, excluding two
cases in which the treatment was soon discontinued and 7 very mild
cases, the remaining 34 cases were on the average each thirty-six days
in hospital.Under this method relapses were less frequent (21 per
cent.), and stay in hospital longer (36 instead
of 30.4 days), than under that by the salicylates; but the number of
cases treated is too small to base a final opinion upon.He prescribed
5 grains each of iodide of potassium and carbonate of ammonia three or
four times a day, and 2 grains of quinia with three of extract of
hyoscyamus in pill as often.This method, in principle at least,
resembles that recommended by DaCosta, who administers in uncomplicated
cases bromide of ammonium in 15- to 20-grain doses every three hours,
and as soon as the acute symptoms have disappeared follows it by quinia
in fair doses.It has not come into general use in this country,
although its eminent proposer published his cases in 1869.[192]

York Medical Record_, September, 1874, p.Notwithstanding the encomiums passed upon propylamine--or, more
correctly, trimethylamine--as a remedy for acute and chronic rheumatism
by Awenarius of St.Petersburg in 1856, by Gaston of Indiana in 1872,
by Dujardin-Beaumetz in 1873, and Peltier in 1874 (both of France), and
Spencer of England in 1875, it has not been much employed, especially
since the salicylates have attracted attention.It appears that in a
considerable proportion of cases the articular pains have subsided in
two or three days under its employment, and then the temperature has
declined, but the visceral complications have not been prevented.From
4 to 8 minims of trimethylamine in an ounce of peppermint-water, with a
drachm of syrup of ginger, may be given every hour or two, the
intervals to be increased as the pains diminish.When pain has quite
ceased the drug may be stopped and quinia given its place.It merits
further study in this disease,[193] and Dr.Shapter of the Exeter
Hospital has very recently stated that he is so convinced or the value
of propylamine that salicylic acid has not fully commended itself[194]
to him.Senator has recently recommended benzoic acid or its sodium
salt in large doses (about ounce ss in the day) in those cases of acute
rheumatic arthritis in which {63} the salicylates have failed, although
he admits that it scarcely rivals them.[195] His 22 patients were
relieved in 4.4 days as the average, and no complications occurred in
any of them.Benzoic acid is said not to produce the nausea,
depression, or unpleasant head phenomena of salicylic acid, to which it
is closely related in chemical composition.[Footnote 193: On this subject see Farier-Lagrange's _Essai sur la

iron, the mineral acids, or the blistering treatment.Of this last my
experience enables me to say that it frequently relieves the pains
promptly, but does not at all always protect the heart.In my opinion
it deserves an extended employment in conjunction with early and full
doses of the sodium salicylate.As Andrews has not by any communication
made since the publication of his paper in 1874[196] maintained the
value of the treatment of the disease by an exclusively non-nitrogenous
diet of arrowroot, and as he had then treated but eight cases in that
way, it is hardly necessary to consider it as a method of treatment.Having spoken of the treatment of the general disease acute articular
rheumatism, it remains to speak of the treatment of its visceral
manifestations and of some of its more important incidental symptoms
and complications.As the treatment of the various forms of cardiac
inflammation will be given in extenso in the articles specially devoted
to those topics, I will be very brief in my notice of them.In every case of rheumatic fever it is our primary duty to employ those
measures as early and deftly as possible which in the present state of
knowledge appear to promptly relieve the pyrexia and articular
symptoms, and lessen the tendency to, but do not altogether prevent,
the visceral complications.Such measures have been already said to be
the administration of the salicylates and alkaline salts together in
full doses, and the observance of certain dietetic and hygienic details
to be given hereafter.Sandra went back to the hallway.If, notwithstanding, peri- or endocarditis, or
both, supervene, as it frequently happens, what is to be done?I reply
that even in pericarditis active interference is seldom necessary; the
general treatment previously employed may be continued in the hope that
it may mitigate the cardiac inflammation by reducing the pyrexia and
subduing the polyarthritis, even although it be incapable of directly
controlling the pericardial inflammation.If the pain in pericarditis
be really severe and the heart's action much disturbed, a dozen leeches
may be applied over the heart, and be followed by anodyne fomentations
or hot poultices applied, as Lauder Brunton advised, over several
layers of flannel interposed between the skin and them.Leeching,
however, is seldom needed, a hypodermic injection of morphia generally
sufficing to relieve the pain.Should these measures not relieve the
pain and allay the cardiac excitement, small and repeated doses of
chloral, which Balfour observes "is not more useful as a sedative than
as an antiphlogistic," may be given.If there be, as so frequently
happens, but little pain or cardiac disturbance, there being only a
friction sound revealing the inflammation, the hot poultices or anodyne
fomentations, or even covering the front of the chest with wadding or a
belladonna plaster, which I prefer, will suffice.Should pericardial
effusion ensue, the diet must be improved, and if much {64} debility
exists, the salicylate and alkalies should be stopped, and wine may be
given along with quinine alone or with pretty full doses of muriate of
iron.As the strength returns absorption commonly takes place; but if
it is delayed, either the iodide of potassium or the infusion of
digitalis may be employed along with the quinia; or, if no special
contraindication exist, a pill containing a grain each of blue mass,
digitalis, squill, and quinia may be given three times a day and its
effects carefully watched.Much difference of opinion obtains as to the
value of flying blisters on the praecordia.Although not often
required, they appear to be more useful than iodine applications.In
those comparatively rare instances in which the effusion is abundant
and remains unabsorbed, either because it is largely sero-purulent or
purulent, it is proper to aspirate the pericardial sac, which should
certainly be done if marked signs of cardiac oppression and failure
coexist.Having once hesitated to aspirate in recent rheumatic
pericarditis with copious effusion in a lad, and found a large amount
of pus in the sac after death, I would warn against hesitancy under
such circumstances.Careful employment of the instrument can hardly do
harm if even no large amount of effusion exist.Active treatment is quite uncalled for, as a rule, in acute rheumatic
endocarditis unattended by pericarditis.If the valvulitis occur
notwithstanding the employment of the anti-rheumatic remedies, it is
very doubtful if we have any others capable of directly controlling
that inflammation.Inasmuch, however, as, owing to the inflamed surface
being in constant contact with the fluid, many of our remedies may be
applied directly to the diseased part, it is well neither to be
dogmatic on the point nor to abandon hope that agents may yet be found
that will prove directly useful.While carefully treating the rheumatic
fever, the main indications remaining to be filled appear to be to
quiet the cardiac excitement and secure as much rest to the inflamed
valves as possible.The alkaline salts, salicine, and the salicylate of
sodium do usually greatly reduce the frequency of the heart, and, pro
tanto, secure rest.The tincture of aconite given hourly, so as to
slacken the heart's speed, is useful in the sthenic stage of endo- and
of pericarditis; and the benefit of absolute rest of the body in bed
and of the joints in splints during the entire course of rheumatic
fever, in preventing cardiac inflammations and in treating them, has
been shown by Sibson.[197] When signs and symptoms of cardiac weakness
arise, whether from the pressure of pericardial effusion or from
myocarditis or any other cause, the employment of salicylates,
alkalies, aconite, and chloral should be at once stopped and alcoholic
stimulants and tonics (strychnia, quinia, iron) and good food should be
freely administered.The most valuable point made of late in the
therapeutics of acute inflammations of the valves is Fothergill's
development of Sibson's principle--viz.that "general quietude for
weeks after an attack of acute endocarditis is indicated," as the
cell-growth in the valve may not be quite over in a less time,[198] and
the work of repair, we may add, not completed.The same principle is
specially applicable in myocarditis.[Footnote 197: Reynolds's _System of Med._, vol.[Footnote 198: _Diseases of Heart, with their Treatment_, 2d Series,
1879, 149.]The disturbances of the nervous system were divided into those {65}
dependent upon gross organic alterations of the nervous centres and
their envelopes, and those not so related, but which we commonly speak
of as functional.Were it possible generally--which it is not--to
diagnosticate rheumatic meningitis from the merely functional form of
so-called cerebral rheumatism, then its treatment would resolve itself
into a vigorous use of the anti-rheumatic remedies, salicylates,
alkalies, etc., and the active employment of ice and leeches to the
scalp, purgatives, full doses of the iodide and bromide of potassium,
ergot, etc.If, together with the symptoms of that often obscure and
comparatively rare complication of rheumatic fever, ulcerative
endocarditis, there occurred severe headache, delirium, or paralysis,
we might find great difficulty in determining the cause of the cerebral
disturbance, and would naturally vary our measures according as we
suspected meningitis, embolism, or simple functional disturbance, and
the treatment adapted to these several conditions will be found under
their respective heads in this work.Coming now to the functional disturbances of the nervous centres, which
are the ordinary forms met with in acute articular rheumatism, they may
be divided, for therapeutical reasons, into two groups: (1) Those
unattended by hyperpyrexia, and (2) those preceded, accompanied, or
followed by hyperpyrexia.(1) When any sign of disturbance of the nervous system, delirium,
restlessness, taciturnity or talkativeness, insomnia or somnolence,
deafness, tremulousness, vacancy, stupor, or what not, occurs in
rheumatism with but a moderate temperature, 101 degrees to 103 degrees,
while we anxiously watch the temperature from hour to hour, prepared to
combat any tendency to hyperthermia the moment it is discovered, we
endeavor to control the cerebral disturbance as in other febrile
affections, but with greater diligence, knowing that in this disease
these nervous symptoms very often precede hyperpyrexia.We persist with
the salicylates to reduce the rheumatic element of the affection,
employ remedies to control the cardiac or pulmonary inflammations which
are so frequent in such circumstances, sustain the general powers by
food, wine, and quinia, if, as frequently happens, there are evidences
of failing strength, and meet any other special indication that may
arise.For example, we procure sleep and allay motor and mental
excitement by opium or chloral and by evaporating lotions or the
ice-cap to the head.We reduce temperature, allay restlessness,
preserve the strength, and promote sleep by lightening the bed-clothes,
drying frequently the entire surface of the body if it is perspiring
freely, or by sponging it with tepid water hourly if dry and hot.We
act on the kidneys, bowels, and if necessary the skin, if from the
scantiness of the urine or other evidence we suspect uraemia.Should
these means fail and the delirium and other symptoms which occur in
cerebral rheumatism continue, and especially should they be severe, it
would be, in the writer's opinion, proper to employ the methods that
are now resorted to when hyperpyrexia accompanies those symptoms; for
patients suffering from cerebro-spinal disturbance or rheumatic fever,
although unattended by hyperthermia, do die if those symptoms continue.Moreover, the hyperthermia may at any moment supervene; it is itself
perhaps as much a nervous disturbance as delirium, and apt to succeed
the latter.It was in these very cases in which the delirium preceded
the hyperpyrexia that the London committee to be presently mentioned
found the highest {66} mortality.If along with these nervous symptoms
the articular pain or the sweating disappear suddenly, or if the pulse
suddenly increase in frequency without demonstrable increase of cardiac
mischief, there is reason to anticipate the supervention of
hyperpyrexia.(2) When the cerebro-spinal disturbance of rheumatic fever is followed,
preceded, or accompanied by hyperpyrexia, there is one indication for
treatment which dominates all others, and that is the prompt reduction
of the hyperthermia.The terrible danger of this condition in rheumatic
fever is known to all persons who have had much experience of the
disease.Wilson Fox in 1871 had not known a case recover after a
temperature of 106 degrees unless under the use of cold, yet that is
not an alarming temperature in intermittent or relapsing fever, and is
often recovered from in typhoid fever.Thanks to Wilson Fox,[199]
Meding,[200] H. Thompson,[201] H. Weber,[202] I. Andrew,[203] Maurice
Raynaud,[204] Black,[205] Fereol,[206] and many others since, it has
been established that when the hyperthermia is removed by external cold
the nervous disturbances also usually at once disappear or lessen very
much.And thus we are brought to the treatment of the hyperpyrexia of
acute articular rheumatism.On this important topic it will be most
satisfactory and convincing to give some of the conclusions arrived at
respecting hyperpyrexia in acute rheumatism by a committee of the
Clinical Society of London.[207] I will condense some of them.[Footnote 199: _Treatment of Hyperpyrexia_, 1871, and _Lancet_, ii.,
1871.][Footnote 200: _Archiv fur Heilkunde_, 1870, xi.Jour._, ii., 1872; _Lancet_, ii., 1872; and
_Clinical Lectures_, 1880.][Footnote 204: _Journal de Therap._, No.des Hopitaux_, 8 Juin, 1877.]"Cases of hyperpyrexia in acute rheumatism prevail at certain
periods;" "such excess corresponds in a certain degree, but not in
actual proportion, to a similar excessive prevalence of acute
rheumatism generally.The largest number of cases of hyperpyrexia arise
in the spring and summer months, whereas rheumatism is relatively more
common in the autumn and winter.""Whilst very little difference
obtains between the two sexes in regard to proclivity to rheumatism,
the proportion of males to females exhibiting hyperpyrexial
manifestations is 1.8 to 1.""The cases of hyperpyrexia
preponderate in first attacks of rheumatic fever.""Hyperpyrexia is
not necessarily accompanied by any visceral complications, but may
itself be fatal.The complications with which it is most frequently
associated are pericarditis and pneumonia.""The mortality of these
cases is very considerable, hyperpyrexia being one of the chief causes
of death in acute rheumatism.""Although present in a certain number
of cases, and these of much value from their prodromal significance,
neither the abrupt disappearance of articular affection, nor the
similarly abrupt cessation of sweating, is an invariable antecedent of
the hyperpyrexial outburst.""The post-mortem
examinations in a certain proportion elicited no distinct visceral
lesions, and when present the lesions were not necessarily extensive.""The prompt and early application of cold to the surface is a most
valuable mode of treatment of hyperpyrexia.The chances of its efficacy
are greater the earlier it is had recourse to.The temperature cannot
safely be allowed to rise above 105 degrees F. Failing the most {67}
certain measure--viz.the cold bath--cold may be applied in various
ways: by the application of ice, by cold affusions, ice-bags, wet
sheets, and iced injections."Whatever differences of opinion may obtain as to the value of cold in
the treatment of the hyperthermia of typhoid fever, there is a
tolerable consensus of opinion that it is our most reliable and
promptest resource in those formidable cases of rheumatic fever
attended with hyperpyrexia, both when alarming delirium and coma
coexist and when they are absent.[208] Space will not allow of details
here in the employment of cold to reduce hyperpyrexia--a subject
discussed elsewhere in this work.Suffice it to say, that besides the
cold bath (70 degrees or 60 degrees) which the committee regards as the
most certain, the tepid bath (96 degrees to 86 degrees) is employed by
Fox and regarded as the best by Andrews; it may be cooled down to 70
degrees by adding ice or cold water to it (Ziemssen).The cold wet
sheet-pack is still thought much of, like the last, in old and feeble
people.Kibbie's method deserves more attention than it has received.He pours tepid water (95 degrees to 80 degrees) over the patient's
body, covered from the axillae to the thighs with a wet sheet and laid
upon a cot, through the open canvas of which the water passes and is
caught on a rubber cloth beneath the cot, and conveyed into a bucket at
the foot of the bed.[Footnote 208: The powerful depressing effects of high temperature on
the human body, and the remarkable opposite influences of a cool
temperature, have been personally experienced by the writer in the last
three days.For two or three days the weather has been very hot, and he
has experienced the usual feeling of exhaustion, incapacity for thought
and action.After a thunderstorm last evening the temperature fell 25
degrees, and this morning, twelve hours later, he feels vigorous,
refreshed, and capable of intellectual and physical labor.The existence of polyarthritis, of peri- or endocarditis, of pneumonia
or pleurisy, does not contraindicate the cold bathing.If much weakness
of the heart obtains, it is well to give some wine or brandy before
employing the bath, and perhaps while in it, and the patient should not
be kept in the bath until the temperature reaches the norm, for it
continues to fall for some time after his removal from the bath.If the
temperature fall rapidly 2 degrees to 3 degrees in five or six minutes,
remove the patient from it as soon as the temperature recedes to 102
degrees or 101 degrees F. If it fall very slowly, the bath may be
continued till the temperature declines to 99.5 degrees, when he should
be taken out.Should marked symptoms of exhaustion or of cyanosis
arise, the bathing should be at once stopped.After it has been found
necessary to employ cold in this way, the thermometer should be used
every hour, and if the temperature tend to rise rapidly again, the
diligent application of a succession of towels wrung out of iced water
and applied to the body and limbs, or of Kibbie's method, may suffice;
but should they not, and a temperature of 103 degrees or 104 degrees be
rapidly attained again, the cold or tepid bath should be at once
resumed.In severe cases of this kind a liberal administration of
alcohol and liquid food is generally needed, and it is well to try
antipyretic doses of quinia by mouth or rectum, although they are
usually very disappointing in these cases.It is admitted that cold
baths have in a few rare instances caused congestion of the mucous
membrane, pneumonia, pleurisy, and even fatal syncope.This is a reason
for the exercise of care and constant oversight on the part of the
physician, but hardly an excuse for permitting a person to die in
rheumatic hyperpyrexia without affording {68} him at least the chance
of recovery by the use of the cold or tepid bath.If delirium and deafness supervene during the employment of the
salicylates, it is prudent to suspend their use and take the
temperature every couple of hours, as one cannot feel confident that
hyperpyrexia may not be impending.Both Caton and Carter have found
that the addition of bromohydric acid to the sodium salicylate
mitigated or controlled the tinnitus and deafness produced by full
doses of that salt.SUMMARY OF TREATMENT OF ACUTE RHEUMATIC POLYARTHRITIS.--As a general
rule, commence at once with a combination of sodium salicylate, say 10
grains, and citrate of potass.xv, every hour for twelve doses,
after which give the citrate alone every two hours during the rest of
the day.Repeat these medicines in the same way daily until the
temperature and pain have subsided, when only half the above quantities
of the drugs are to be given every twenty-four hours for about a week
longer, after which three 15-gr.doses of the salicylate, with a like
quantity of the citrate, are to be administered every day for another
week or ten days, to prevent relapses.It is in this third week that
quinia is most likely to be required, and as a general rule it may be
given with benefit at this period in doses of 2 grains three times a
day between the doses of the salicylate.Should the above dose of
salicylate not relieve the pains sensibly in twenty-four hours,
increase next day the hourly dose to 15 or 20 grains; and if this free
administration of the medicine afford no relief after four or five
days' use, substitute for the salicylate salt the benzoate of ammonia
in 15- to 20-grain doses hourly, continuing the citrate of potassium
and conducting the treatment in the manner first advised.Should the
benzoate likewise fail after four or five days' trial, omit it, and
employ the full alkaline method together with the quinia, of which
about 10 to 15 grains may be given in the day between the doses of the
alkaline salt.For the local treatment no uniform method is invariably applicable.In
many cases simply painting the joints with iodine daily, or enveloping
them in cotton wool, with or without the addition of belladonna or
laudanum, and securing it by the smooth and gentle pressure of a
flannel roller, proves sufficient.Hot linseed poultices containing a
teaspoonful of nitre or of carbonate of soda often afford relief, and
so does Fuller's lotion, applied to the articulations by means of
spongio-piline, or lint covered with oiled silk.drachm iv to drachm vj,
glycerinum fl.If the articular affection be very severe and not relieved by
the above measures, absolute immobility of the joints, secured by means
of starch and plaster-of-Paris bandages, has been shown to be very
useful, relieving the pain, shortening the duration of the local and
the general disturbance, and protecting neighboring joints from
invasion.[209]

[Footnote 209: See Heubner in _Archiv der Heilkunde_, vol.xii., and
Oehme in _ibid._, vol.xiv., and a striking case in _St.174, by R. Bridges, M.D.]We have little experience in this country of ice continuously applied
to the joints until all the symptoms of acute rheumatism have
disappeared (Esmarch and Stromeyer).Circlets of blistering fluid applied above all the affected joints {69}
simultaneously, as practised especially by Herbert Davies,[210] often
afford prompt relief to the pain, but they do not invariably protect
the heart, in my experience.[Footnote 210: _London Hospital Reports_, vol.The hygienic and dietetic management of acute articular rheumatism
demands careful attention.While the room should be well supplied with
fresh air and sunlight, it should be kept at a uniform temperature and
free from draughts.Feather and other very soft beds should be
prohibited.Many authorities put the patient between heavy blankets,
which I regard as a mistake.The bed-clothing should be light and just
sufficient to keep the patient agreeably warm; the night-gown may be of
thin flannel and the sheets of cotton.The excess of perspiration
should be removed by gentle rubbing with a warm towel at regular
intervals, and the sheets should be changed frequently before they
become almost saturated with the perspiration.Fatigue and exposure of
the patient's person when taking food, attending to his natural calls,
or having his personal or bed-clothing changed should be specially
guarded against.The diet in the early actively febrile stage should consist of panada,
corn-meal or oat-meal gruel, milk, and barley-water, or even pure milk.Where persons will not take milk the various thin animal broths to
which good barley-water or arrowroot or well-boiled rice has been
added, jellies, sago and other starchy puddings, may be allowed.Suitable drinks are--plain water, Seltzer and Apollinaris water,
carbonic-acid water, lemonade.This low, unstimulating diet should be
observed until all fever and articular inflammation have subsided, the
tongue become clean, and the visceral inflammations declined, and a
return to solid food, and especially to animal food, should be made
cautiously.Eggs are to be regarded as of very doubtful safety in this
disease.As a very general rule, ales, wines, and the stronger
alcoholic liquids are objectionable, but they may be required under the
same conditions as in other fevers.Should the salicylates depress the
heart, old wine or whiskey may be given with advantage.During convalescence the patient should not be permitted to leave his
bed for several days after complete removal of the fever and articular
pain, and for the first four days he should occupy a sofa or
easy-chair.An occasional
alkaline or sulphur bath, if cautiously taken, sometimes appears to
complete the recovery.If endocarditis have existed, a longer rest is
desirable, more especially in severe cases, in order that the
reparative process going on in the lately inflamed valves may not be in
the least disturbed.Chronic Articular Rheumatism,

synonymous with rheumarthritis chronica, rheumatisme articulaire
chronique simple (Besnier), polyarthritis synovialis chronica (Heuter),
is defined here as a chronic idiopathic inflammation of one or a few
articulations, which is more prone to become fixed than the acute form,
and which, notwithstanding its protracted duration, produces no
profound structural alterations in the joints.ETIOLOGY.--It may be the direct sequel of a single attack or more {70}
commonly of several attacks, of acute, or more especially of subacute,
articular rheumatism.But it is generally a primary affection,
occurring in persons who have not had either acute or subacute
rheumarthritis, yet owning the same causation as these, and
occasionally in its course exhibiting acute or subacute symptoms.The
specially predisposing conditions are inheritance; repeated attacks of
subacute or acute articular rheumatism, which in accordance with
general laws impair the resisting power of the affected joints;
prolonged residence or employment in cold, damp, or wet rooms or
localities; repeated exposure to bleak, cold currents of air or to
frequent wettings of the body or lower limbs.For these reasons it is
most common amongst the poor, who are especially exposed to the
influences just mentioned; and amongst them cellar-men and sailors,
washerwomen and maid-servants, are very liable to the disease.It is
chiefly an affection of advanced life, or at least of mid-age, and is
rare in youth.The first attacks, and especially exacerbations, are apt
to be induced by the direct action of a draught of cold air or by
unusual exposure to cold and damp air, especially when the body has
been fatigued or overheated.In many cases no distinct exciting cause
can be traced.The morbid anatomy of simple chronic articular rheumatism will vary
with the severity and duration of the disease.The alterations are such
as chronic inflammation of a non-suppurative character might be
expected to produce in the joints by one who had learned those
characteristic of acute rheumarthritis.In the simple chronic form the
proliferating process involves chiefly the synovial membrane, the
capsular and other ligaments, and the periarticular tissues; to a less
degree the cartilages, and to a much less degree, and exceptionally,
the osseous surfaces.The synovial membrane is thickened, slightly
injected, and its fringes hypertrophied and more vascular than
normally.Little fluid usually exists in the joint unless during an
exacerbation, when a moderate amount of thin, cloudy serum may be
present; generally only a trace of thick, turbid fluid, containing
oil-globules, and in severe cases debris of the cartilages, but no pus,
is found.The fibrous capsule and ligaments become thickened, dense,
and stiffened by hyperplasia; and sometimes the adjacent tendons and
their sheaths, the fasciae and aponeuroses, undergo similar
alterations, so that the movements of the joints become seriously
interfered with.In some cases this irritative hyperplasia specially
involves these periarticular fibrous structures, and these, undergoing
retraction, produce marked deviations, subluxations, and deformities of
the articulations very like those observed in rheumatoid arthritis,
although the osseous components of the joints are unaffected.Jaccoud
gave to such cases the title of chronic fibrous rheumatism.[211] It is
worth noting that Jaccoud's, Charcot's,[212] and Rinquet's[213] cases
of so-called "chronic fibrous rheumatism" developed out of acute
articular rheumatism, while Besnier's was primarily chronic.In simple
chronic rheumatism, if protracted, the cartilages also proliferate,
lose their semi-transparency and polish, and become opaque and white;
they are often rough and traversed by fissures, and occasionally
present erosions; and these erosions {71} are either naked or covered
with a layer of newly-formed connective tissue, which may occasionally
produce fibrous adhesions between the articular surfaces.Points of
calcification occur in the cartilages and tendons in very chronic
cases.Instances are observed in which the bones exhibit, to a slight
degree, the alterations found in rheumatoid arthritis, and are probably
transitional between the two affections.The muscles which move the
affected articulations in severe cases are often atrophied, and the
wasting imparts to the joints an appearance of considerable
enlargement.[Footnote 211: Vide Jaccoud, _Clin.de la Charite_, 23e Lecon,
Paris, 1867.][Footnote 212: Besnier, _Dictionnaire Encycloped., etc._, t.680 _et seq._]

[Footnote 213: _Du Rheum.Chronique, etc._, par Martial Rinquet,
These, Paris, 1879, pp.SYMPTOMS AND COURSE.--Simple chronic articular rheumatism presents many
varieties.In the milder forms the patient experiences trifling or
severe pain in one, or less frequently in two or more, joints, more
especially in the knee or shoulder, or both, attended with want of
power in the member or with stiffness in the affected articulation.The
pain frequently is likewise felt in the soft parts, muscular and
tendinous, near the joints, and is usually increased by active or
passive movement; it is not always accompanied by tenderness, and
rarely with local elevation of temperature or swelling.The wearying
aching in the joint is of an abiding character, but is very liable to
exacerbations, especially at night; and these come on just before
atmospheric changes, such as a considerable fall of temperature, the
approach of rain, variations in the direction of the wind, etc., and
they usually continue as long as the weather remains cold and wet.A
very common symptom is a creaking or a grating which may be felt and
heard during the movements of the joint.The above symptoms may rarely prove more or less constant by night and
day for years, but far more frequently, at least at first, they last an
indefinite period and disappear to recur again and again, especially in
the cold and changeable seasons of the year.Although in the earlier
attacks, and often for a long time, no alteration of structure is
perceptible in the painful joints, yet in some instances slight
effusion into the articulation may be observed during the
exacerbations, or the capsule and ligaments may at length become
slightly thickened, or the muscles may waste and produce an apparent
enlargement of the joint; and this prominence of the articular surfaces
may be increased by retraction of the tendons and aponeuroses--a
condition which causes real deformities (deviations, subluxations,
etc.)of the articulation and impairs more or less its movements.In
very chronic cases a fibrous ankylosis may be established.These last-mentioned conditions often entail great and long-continued
suffering, and may even cause some anaemia and general debility; but
very frequently the general health and vigor continue good,
notwithstanding the permanent impairment of the functions of one or
several of the large articulations, and the liability to exacerbations
often amounting to attacks of subacute rheumarthritis from changes in
the weather, fatigue, or exposure.Besides the above varieties may be mentioned a not infrequent one
consisting of a series of attacks of subacute articular rheumatism
recurring at short intervals, involving the same joints, and attended
with slight elevation of temperature, febrile urine, perspiration, and
moderate local evidences of synovitis, heat, pain, tenderness,
swelling, and effusion into the affected joints.This is an obstinate
variety, and is often associated with rheumatic pain in the muscles and
fibrous tissues of the affected member.{72} Simple chronic articular rheumatism, like the acute form, is most
apt to affect the larger articulations, knees, shoulders, etc., but it
frequently also involves the smaller ones of the hands and feet.Although usually polyarticular, it is prone to become fixed in a single
joint, but even then it may attack several other articulations, and may
migrate from one to another without damaging any.The course of the disease is usually one of deterioration during
persistent or recurring attacks, and in many cases the intervals of
relief become shorter and less marked; the joints become weaker and
stiffer; and although the pain may not increase and the general health
may not be seriously impaired, yet the patients may continue for many
years or the rest of their lives severe sufferers, unable to work, and
often hardly able to walk even with the aid of a stick.Occasionally,
after several years of pain and weakness, a sudden or slow improvement
may set in and the patient become free from pain and lameness, and only
experience some stiffness in the movements of the joints after several
hours of rest, and slight thickening of the ligaments and capsule of
one or more articulations.The duration of the disease is indefinite;
the danger to life trifling.The complications of simple chronic articular rheumatism are held by
many, and especially by those who regard the disease as constitutional
or diathetic, to be the same as those of the acute form, and that they
may precede, follow, alternate, or occur simultaneously with the
articular affection.All admit that they are observed much less
frequently in the former than in the latter.Other pathologists either
deny the occurrence of the visceral complications (Senator, Flint) or
do not mention them (Niemeyer).It is not denied that cardiac disease
may be found in chronic articular rheumatism which has succeeded the
acute form, and which may then be referred to the acute attack.The
tissue-changes then set up may not have produced at the time the
murmurs indicative of endocarditis, but these tissue-changes may have
ultimately roughened the endocardium, puckered a valve, or shortened
its cords, so that cases of chronic articular rheumatism having a
history of an acute attack cannot be safely included when inquiring
into the influence of the chronic form upon the heart or other internal
organ.Attention has not been sufficiently given to ascertain the
frequency of the occurrence of these complications in primary chronic
articular rheumatism, and reliable evidence is not at hand.It is not
unlikely that the chronic form may slowly develop cardiac changes, as
the acute form rapidly does; but when the advanced age of the persons
most liable to chronic rheumatism is borne in mind, it must be admitted
that valvular and arterial lesions (endarteritis) are observed at such
periods of life independently of rheumatism, and referable to such
causes as repeated muscular effort, strain, chronic Bright's disease,
senile degeneration, etc.Somewhat similar observations are applicable
to the attacks of asthma, of subacute bronchitis, of neuralgia, and of
dyspepsia, which are frequently complained of by sufferers from simple
chronic rheumarthritis.Such affections are common in elderly people in
cold and damp climates; they may be mere complications rather than
manifestations of rheumatism, or outcomes of the confinement and its
attendant evils incident to chronic articular rheumatism, as is
probably the relationship of the dyspepsia.There is {73} no doubt of
the frequent coexistence of muscular rheumatism with this variety.DIAGNOSIS.--Simple chronic articular rheumatism may be confounded with
rheumatoid arthritis, with the articular affections of locomotor ataxia
and other spinal diseases, with chronic articular gout, with syphilitic
and with strumous disease of the joints.The reader may consult the
observations made on four of these affections in connection with the
diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.A few additional remarks are called
for in distinguishing chronic articular rheumatism from chronic
articular gout, which is often a very difficult problem.Both are apt
to be asymmetrical in distribution, to have paroxysmal exacerbations,
to recur frequently without damaging the articulations, to have been
preceded by acute attacks of their respective affections, and to be
uncomplicated by endo- or pericarditis.But chronic rheumarthritis has
no special tendency to attack the great toe; it is more persistent than
gouty arthritis; it does not, even when of long standing, produce the
peculiar deformities of the articulations or the visible chalk-like
deposits in the ears or fingers observed in chronic gout.The etiology
of the two diseases is dissimilar.There is no special liability to
interstitial nephritis in articular rheumatism, nor is urate of soda
present in the blood in that disease.In chronic strumous or tubercular disease of a joint the youth, the
personal and family history, and sometimes the evident defective
nutrition, of the patient; the moderate degree of local pain compared
with the considerable progressive and uniform enlargement of the joint;
the evident marked thickening of the synovial membrane, either early or
late according as the disease has originated in the synovial membrane
or in the bones; the continuous course, without marked remissions or
exacerbations, of the disease; the rarity with which more than one
joint is affected; and the tendency to suppuration, ulceration, marked
deformity, and final destruction of the joint,--will prevent the
disease from being mistaken for chronic rheumatism.The PROGNOSIS in simple chronic rheumarthritis is unfavorable as
regards complete recovery, and it is chiefly while comparatively
recent, and when the sufferer can be removed from the conditions
productive of the disease, that permanent improvement, and sometimes
cure, may be expected.As a rule, the disease once established recurs.TREATMENT.--All are agreed that hygienic treatment constitutes an
essential, if not the most valuable, part of the curative and
palliative management of chronic rheumarthritis.A dry and uniform
climate is the most suitable, and there is much evidence in favor of a
dry and warm rather than a dry and cold climate.Protection of the body
against cold and damp by means of flannel next the skin, sufficient
clothing, residence in dry and warm houses, etc., is of prime
importance.In fact, all the known or suspected causes of the disease
should be as far as possible removed.The direct treatment of the disease resolves itself into general and
local, and is essentially the same as that recommended for rheumatoid
arthritis, to which subject the reader is referred.A few observations
only need be made here.Although, like everything else in chronic
rheumarthritis, it often fails, no single remedy has in the writer's
{74} experience afforded so much relief to the pain and stiffness of
the joints as the sodium salicylate; and he cites with pleasure the
confirmatory testimony of J. T. Eskridge of Philadelphia,[214] of whose
28 cases 75 per cent.Jacob of Leeds also
reports some benefit in 75 per cent.out of 87 cases treated by the
same agent.[215] It must be given in full doses, and be persevered
with.Salicylate of quinia should be tried if there be much debility or
if the sodium salt fail.Propylamine or trimethylamine is deserving of
further trial in this disease.From 100 to 200 grains are given in the
day in peppermint-water.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Iodide of potassium, cod-liver oil, arsenic,
iodide of iron, and quinia are all and several remedies from which more
or less benefit is derived in chronic articular rheumatism.The
combination of iodide of potassium with guiaiac resin--gr.ij-iij of
each three times a day in syrup and cinnamon-water--is sometimes very
useful.The writer has no experience of the bromide of lithium
(Bartholow).When the skin is habitually dry and harsh a dose of
pilocarpine every other night for a few times will often prove very
useful.75-77, 1878, and _The
Medical Bulletin_, Phila., July, 1879, pp.Jour._, ii., 1879, 171.]Cod-liver oil, iron, quinia, etc., the various forms of baths and
mineral waters, electricity, and the several local measures recommended
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, are all occasionally very
useful in, and constitute the appropriate treatment of, simple chronic
articular rheumatism.The dietetic management of the two affections
should be the same.SYNONYMS.--Myalgia rheumatica or myopathia; _Fr._ Rheumatisme
musculaire; _Ger._ Muskelrheumatismus.DEFINITION.--The affections included under this term are certain
painful disorders of fibro-muscular structures.They are commonly found
in persons the subjects of the rheumatic diathesis, and are
characterized by pain and often spasm, and sometimes a slight degree of
fever.No doubt as our knowledge increases so many attacks connected
with painful states of muscles and fasciae are eliminated from the
somewhat uncertain group of muscular rheumatism.True inflammation is
not believed to exist, and pathological investigation has rarely shown
any morbid changes in the affected parts.The symptoms, therefore, have
been attributed to some temporary hyperaemia, slight serous exudation,
or neuralgic state of the sensory nerve-filaments.The strongest
support is given to this statement from the absence of any marked
tenderness in such affected muscles as can be sufficiently examined.In
certain cases, undistinguishable clinically, it is quite probable that
a periarthritis is in reality the principal factor in the case.In
others, again, a subacute rheumatism affecting a joint seems to spread
to the adjoining tendinous sheaths, and thus secondarily to attack the
muscles themselves, the affection of which may ultimately remain the
only condition present.ETIOLOGY.--Muscular rheumatism is a very common affection.All ages are
liable to its occurrence, but the part affected varies with the time
{75} of life, children and young adults being much more subject to
torticollis, and older persons to lumbago and general rheumatism of the
limbs.Amongst hospital patients the disease prevails more amongst men
than women, owing doubtless to the greater exposure of the former to
the cold; but amongst other classes the same difference is not seen.It
is observed in all countries, but according to some writers it is
unusually frequent in tropical climates, although there acute
rheumatism is very uncommon.The causes of muscular rheumatism are
mainly exposure to cold and strain or fatigue of muscles.If these two
conditions coexist--_e.g._ standing in a draught of cold air or lying
on the ground when fatigued--the chances of the affection coming are
greatly enhanced.Strain, a twist of the body, or a false step can
actively start an attack of this kind, and by the sufferers themselves
it is constantly attributed to this cause.The part played by this
element is difficult to determine, a very slight strain being often
followed by great pain and distress from the subsequent rheumatic
affection.Some individuals are specially prone to attacks, the
slightest current of air, change of clothing, etc.being sufficient to
determine its occurrence.These persons are often found to have
suffered from rheumatism in some other form, and thus in them we must
consider that the rheumatic diathesis furnishes the reason for their
unusual susceptibility.It only remains to mention the fact that a
disposition to gout seems to favor the development of muscular
rheumatism.In gouty families, therefore, it has been observed to be
common.SYMPTOMS.--In all cases pain is the prominent, and in many cases the
only, symptom present.In all except the more aggravated attacks pain
is felt only when the affected part is disturbed.In such when complete
rest or fixed immobility is maintained there is comfort, or at most a
somewhat dull, uneasy sensation, but when any contraction of the
muscles in question is produced, whether voluntary or otherwise, severe
often excruciating pain is at once experienced, often giving rise to a
sudden cry or causing the features to be contracted in a grimace.The
suffering ceases almost at once when the muscular contraction is
relaxed.In more aggravated attacks the pain is more severe, and
besides persists, though to a less degree, even when there is no
contraction.In rare cases when the maximum degree has been attained
there is continuous pain, but the affected muscles are persistently
maintained in a relaxed condition by means of true spasm in the
surrounding muscles.Slow passive movement affects the subject of
muscular rheumatism, and may often be accomplished with a little
management without causing pain.If, at the same time, these muscles be
handled by pinching and slight pressure, it will be found that they are
very sensitive to the touch.When some tenderness does exist, it is
slight and is not located in the district of the lower nerve-trunks.The constant effort to avoid pain
gives rise to a feeling and appearance of stiffness, and thus
characteristic attitudes and positions of the head, trunk, or limbs are
voluntarily and persistently maintained.There is no spasm of the
affected muscles; the distortion is the result of stiff contraction of
the associated muscles, which thus forcibly fix the faulty one and hold
it in a state of relaxation.Cramp or spasmodic contraction of a single
muscle of a painful character does, however, sometimes occur in
rheumatic subjects, and much resembles the condition above described.In {76} the same persons also muscular rheumatism may occur in a much
more fugitive or erratic form, frequently being nothing more than a
slightly painful condition of some group of muscles which have in some
way been exposed to cold.This may last but a short time, and either
spontaneously disappear or be readily removed by exercise or friction.Muscular rheumatism is generally confined to one muscle or a single
group of muscles.Those most liable to it are the very superficial and
those easily exposed to cold (_e.g._ the deltoid and trapezius),
powerful muscles often subjected to violent strain (_e.g._ the lumbar
muscles), and those aiding in the formation of the parietes of the
great cavities.This affection very commonly exists without any constitutional
disturbances, but sometimes there are present the symptoms of
pyrexia--slight elevation of temperature and temporary disorder of the
digestive organs--loss of appetite, constipation, and general malaise.The acute forms generally last but a few days, terminating by gradual
subsidence and final disappearance of the pain.The fugitive kind,
already alluded to, may, however, be present more or less during
several weeks.DIAGNOSIS.--Errors of diagnosis between muscular rheumatism and a
variety of other disorders are common.Laymen especially are only too
apt to attribute pain felt in muscles at once to rheumatism of these
muscles--a term which is badly abused.Some of these errors are of no
great interest, but others are of the highest importance, for they may
cause the onset of a serious disease to be overlooked.The principal
affections to be borne in mind with reference to diagnosis are the
following: organic diseases of the spinal cord (notably tabes
dorsalis), causing peripheral pains as an early symptom; functional
disorder of the same part, as hysteria or spinal irritation;
intra-thoracic inflammation; the onset of an exanthem; the pains
produced by the chronic poisoning of lead and mercury; neuralgia;
painful spasm of muscle from deep-seated inflammation or suppuration.It is sufficient to indicate these various sources of fallacy, which,
if remembered, can generally be guarded against by a consideration of
the special features characteristic of each one.TREATMENT.--The indications for the treatment are mainly two--viz.to
relieve the pain and to counteract the diathetic condition generally
present.The relief of the pain is accomplished in various ways,
according to the seat of the trouble.In severe cases it is proper to
resort to the hypodermic use of morphia, to which may be advantageously
added some atropia.When the pain is seated in large muscles, the
injection will produce better results if thrown not merely under the
skin, but into the substance of the muscle.Sometimes perfect rest in
bed is necessary to secure the required immobility; in other cases this
can better be secured by plaster or firm bandages.Soothing anodynes
are extremely useful locally, and counter-irritants also may be used
with benefit.Liniments give us a convenient form of application.The
best are those containing a considerable proportion of chloroform with
either aconite or belladonna, or both.The repeated application of
tincture of iodine often gives great relief.Galvanism sometimes proves
a rapid cure.Continuous heat is nearly always grateful, and may be
applied either in the dry form or by means of soft warm linseed
poultices with or without a {77} percentage of mustard.When these are
discontinued, care should be taken to protect the affected muscles from
cold by keeping them enveloped in flannel or woollen coverings.Whilst these local measures are being adopted the constitutional
disorder should also receive attention.A diaphoretic action should be
set up.For this purpose the hot-air or Turkish bath at the outset
would seem to be sometimes really abortive.Of medicinal means amongst
the most reliable are liquor ammonii acetatis and Dover's powder.The fixed alkaline salts are
also sometimes beneficial, such as the acetate and citrate of potassium
and, at a later stage, the iodide of potassium.In a certain number of
cases of muscular rheumatism the sodium salicylate acts promptly and
well.This drug will succeed well in proportion as the evidence of the
rheumatic constitution is well marked, as shown by the tendency on
other occasions to attacks of acute articular rheumatism.Persons who are subject to muscular rheumatism should be made to wear
warm clothing, avoid draughts, guard against strains and twists, and in
other respects to be careful of their general hygiene.Obstinately
recurring cases will very often receive benefit from a visit to some of
the natural springs known to possess antirheumatic qualities.The chief varieties of muscular rheumatism, divided according to the
locality affected, require some separate description.Lumbago, or myalgia lumbalis, is that common form which attacks the
lumbar muscles and the strong aponeurotic structures in connection with
these.It is more frequently than any other form attributed to some
effort of lifting or sudden twist of the trunk, but in many cases it
owes its origin directly to exposure to cold.The pain comes on
suddenly and renders the person helpless, the body, if he is able to go
about, being held stiffly to prevent any movement or bending; if
severe, he is absolutely compelled to observe complete rest in bed.The
muscles, when handled, appear slightly sore, but no local point of
acute tenderness can be found.This fact, with the characteristic
shrinking from any movement, distinguishes lumbago from neuralgia and
from abscess.Pain in the loins, more or less severe, is such a
frequent accompaniment of disorder of several organs and parts that
careful examination should always be instituted lest some serious
organic disease with lumbar pain as a symptom be mistaken for a simple
lumbago.The most important of these are perinephritis, lumbar abscess,
spinal disease, abdominal abscess, and disease of the rectum and
uterus.Pleurodynia, myalgia pectoralis or intercostalis.Here the affected
muscles are the intercostals, and in some cases the pectorals as well.Spasmodic pain is felt in one or other side of the chest, and is
especially aggravated by the movements of respiration; it is rendered
intense by the efforts of coughing or sneezing.Pleurodynia may be
confounded with pleurisy, the distinguishing features being the absence
of fever and the friction sound of pleurisy.Intercostal neuralgia is
sometimes with difficulty known from pleurodynia, but in the former the
pain is more circumscribed, more paroxysmal, and more easily aggravated
by pressure than in pleurodynia, and when severe there are tender
points in the course of the nerve a little outside of the middle line
posteriorly (dorsal point) and anteriorly (sternal point).Now and then
the hyperaesthetic {78} areas become anaesthetic, and even patches of
herpes may form in the course of the nerve, when doubt can no longer
remain.From periostitis of a rib pleurodynia may be known by the fact
that in the one the tenderness is marked in the intercostal space, and
in the other in the rib itself.Pleurodynia is a frequent accompaniment
of thoracic affections, causing cough, the frequent paroxysms of
coughing tending to induce a painful state of the overworked muscles.The pain, which may be very great, can often be controlled by fixing
the chest with imbricated plaster or a firm bandage.Dry cups sometimes
answer very well; if more active measures are necessary, then
hypodermic injections of morphia must be resorted to.Torticollis, myalgia cervicalis, stiff neck or wry neck, caput
obstipum.This term includes those cases of rheumatic idiopathic
affection of one or more of the muscles of the side and nape of the
neck, which fixes the head firmly in the median line or else in a
twisted fashion, with the face turned toward the sound side.The
disease can be recognized at a glance by the peculiar manner in which a
person will turn his whole body round instead of rotating his head
alone.It is much more common in children than in adults.The
sterno-mastoid is the muscle chiefly affected, but any of the muscles
of the neck may become rheumatic in the same way, and frequently
several of them suffer at the same time.The most important point at
the outset of an attack of wry neck is to determine whether we have to
do with a true rheumatic (idiopathic) disorder, or whether the muscular
stiffness is secondary to some spinal or vertebral lesion.The
diagnosis is usually founded upon the suddenness of the onset, the
absence of other symptoms of nerve disease, and the rapid course of the
case, terminating in a cure in a few days.There is nothing special in
the treatment of torticollis beyond what has been already said under
the general heading.Other forms of muscular rheumatism which have received special names
and have been separately described are the following: myalgia
scapularis or omalgia, when the surroundings of the shoulder are
affected; myalgia cephalica or cephalodynia, an affection of the
occipito-frontalis; and abdominal rheumatism, when the external muscles
of the abdomen are involved.SYNONYMS.--Nodosity of the joints (Haygarth); Chronic rheumatic
arthritis, or rheumatic gout (Adams); Arthritis, rheumatismo
superveniens (Musgrove); Goutte asthenique primitive; Arthritis
pauperum; A. sicca; Usure des cartilages articulaires (Cruveilhier);
Arthrite chronique (Lute); Progressive chronic articular rheumatism;
General and partial chronic osteo-arthritis;[216] Arthritis deformans.[Footnote 216: _Nomenclature of Diseases R. C. Physicians_, London.]Neither my space nor time will permit of a history of this disease; it
must suffice to say that Sydenham in 1766-69 appears to have first
tersely described it and distinguished it from gout; that in 1800,
Landre-Beauvais in his inaugural thesis made some observations upon the
disease under the title of primary asthenic gout; that in 1804,
Heberden, and {79} more especially Haygarth, in 1805, pointed out some
of the more striking clinical features of this disease, and
distinguished it from both gout and chronic rheumatism under the title
nodosity of the joints.The latter author, in the work mentioned,
claims to have written a paper upon the subject twenty-six years
previously, although it was not published; and to him belongs the merit
of having so described the disease as to have given it a place in
nosology.Incidental allusions were made to the affection in 1813 by
Chomel, in 1818 by Brodie, and by Aston-Key in 1835; in 1833, Lobstein,
and about the same time Cruveilhier, pointed out some of the more
striking characters of the morbid anatomy of the affection.But it is
to Adams of Dublin that we are indebted for the most complete account
of the anatomy and of many of the clinical features of the
disease--first in a paper read before the British Association in 1836,
next in his article on "The Abnormal Conditions of the Elbow, Hand,
Hip, etc.,"[217] and finally in his able monogram "On Rheumatic Gout"
in 1857.The contributions to this subject since that date have been
very numerous as well as valuable from the leading countries of Europe,
and I must not here attempt to assign to each investigator his proper
portion of the work.[Footnote 217: Todd's _Cyclop.and Phys._ (1836-39).]It may be here remarked that Landre-Beauvais and Haygarth described
more particularly that form of the disease which, beginning in the
small joints of the extremities, tends to extend to the larger joints
in a centripetal way, and to involve many of them--peculiarities which
have given rise to the epithets progressive polyarticular chronic
rheumatism, peripheral arthritis deformans, and which is the form of
the disease usually described by physicians as rheumatic gout,
rheumatoid arthritis, nodular rheumatism, and by the other names just
mentioned.On the other hand, Key, Colles, Adams in his earlier paper,
and R. W. Smith described the disease as it affects the larger joints,
hip, shoulder, or knee, to one or two only of which it may be confined;
and as this variety is frequently observed in elderly persons, and in
them often involves the hip, it is often spoken of as senile arthritis,
malum senile articulorum, morbus coxe senilis, mono-articular arthritis
deformans, partial chronic rheumatism, and has been described by
surgeons rather than by physicians.However, even when beginning in the
hip or shoulder, the disease is apt to involve several of the
intervertebral articulations, and not unfrequently to extend to other
joints than the one first affected, and even to the peripheral joints.Its progressive and general nature is thus evidenced, whether it invade
from the beginning a single large joint or several symmetrical small
articulations.Finally, on this topic Charcot has insisted that
Heberden's nodi digitorum contributes a special form of the disease
under consideration, and proposes to call it Heberden's rheumatism or
nodosities.[218]

[Footnote 218: _Lectures on Senile Diseases_, Syd.Rheumatoid arthritis presents the clinical varieties or groupings of
phenomena just mentioned, at times quite distinctly appreciable from
one another, but sometimes more or less blended, yet even then
manifesting in their periods of invasion and early stages an adhesion
to all of these typical groupings.Charcot has especially dwelt upon
these: 1st, the general or polyarticular and progressive form; 2d, the
partial or oligo- or mono-articular form; 3d, Heberden's nodosities.The symptoms and clinical history of general or polyarticular
and progressive rheumatoid arthritis.This is the most common form of
so-called chronic rheumatic arthritis, the classical rheumatic gout, or
rheumatisme noueux, and it may declare itself, as Garrod and Fuller
pointed out, very rarely in an active or acute form, or, as it usually
does, in a chronic and insidious form.The acute form of rheumatoid arthritis closely resembles the milder
varieties of acute articular rheumatism or the best marked examples of
the subacute form of that disease.But it presents the following
particulars, by which it may generally perhaps, but not always, be
distinguished: while the temperature, the thirst, the furring of the
tongue, the frequency of the pulse, the articular pains and tenderness,
etc., are less developed than in acute articular rheumatism, there is
wanting the profuse and continued perspiration, the early involvement
of the endo- or pericardium in the inflammation, and the prompt
prostration of the strength so commonly witnessed in that disease.On
the other hand, while the rheumatoid affection may involve the larger
joints--knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists--it almost certainly
implicates the smaller joints of the fingers, and often of the toes.There is apt to be greater effusion into the synovial capsules
(McLeod's capsular rheumatism) and into the synovial sheaths and bursae
about the affected joints than in ordinary acute or subacute
rheumatism; further, the inflammation does not migrate from joint to
joint, but obstinately persists in several of them, and more especially
in the wrist and in the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the index and
middle finger, perhaps also in the ankles and in the
metatarso-phalangeal articulation of the great toe.Instead of
disappearing in four to six weeks, the articular inflammation
continues, although the pain may abate very much, and the capsules of
the joints continue swollen and rather tense.The muscles of the
extremities waste, and are the seat of painful reflex spasms which
interfere with the movements of the joints; and although the patient is
capable of moving about, and is free from all febrile disturbance, one
or several of his joints remain permanently swollen, painful, and
crippled.Perfect restoration of all the affected joints seldom if ever
occurs.In common with other observers, I have met with this acute form
most frequently in young women twenty to thirty years of age--several
times in connection with recent delivery or rapid child-bearing, or
lactation; once after what was regarded by the medical attendant as an
attack of acute rheumatism occurring not long after labor.It has been
observed in children, and is not uncommon after forty.These patients
usually suffer in their general health--become weak, pale, depressed in
spirits, and lose flesh.In several cases of this form marked intervals
of improvement have occurred; the local disease has ceased to progress,
and tolerable comfort has been experienced, perhaps, till pregnancy,
delivery, or lactation again determined a fresh outbreak of the
disease.Sometimes, however, this acute form steadily advances, and in
a year or two establishes changes in the cartilaginous and osseous
structure of the affected joints.Such a case I met in a lady of
twenty-one who had had a good deal of anxiety as a mathematical
teacher, and whose illness set in during vacation while at the seaside.It proved obstinately progressive for several years, until several of
the larger joints, as well as the smaller, were badly crippled.{81} The primary chronic form is much the more frequent, although
between it and the acute variety there are many intermediate grades.For weeks or months the patient may experience numbness or formication
and rheumatic pains in the limbs, perhaps with a sense of stiffness in
the joints, especially felt after rest or the day after unusual
fatigue.Then one or more joints--most frequently the
metacarpo-phalangeal of the fingers--become painful, swollen, tender
when touched, and inordinately hot; these symptoms may subside under
rest or treatment, and after weeks or months recur, either without
known cause or from exposure, fatigue, or some impairment of the
health.Usually, the original joint is again affected, but frequently
one or two more of the same on the other hand suffer likewise.More or
less complete remissions of the pain and local inflammation now tend to
take place from time to time and alternate with exacerbations or fresh
attacks of the local disturbance, and the disease extends, as it were,
centripetally and more or less symmetrically to the wrists, then to the
elbows, and then to the shoulders, or from the toes to the ankles and
thence to the knees--although there is no invariable sequence of this
kind--and next to the hands; the knees are specially liable to
invasion.Of Haygarth's 34 cases, in 2 the knees alone suffered, and
"in all or nearly all the rest the hands, chiefly the fingers, were
probably affected."In Charcot's 45 cases the debut took place in the
small joints of the hands and feet 29 times; in the hands, feet, and
one large articulation, 7 times; in one large joint, and later in the
fingers, 9 times.Even in this primary chronic form there is usually in
the earlier stages some effusion into the joints; the soft parts of the
articulation are thickened and swollen; obscure fluctuation in the
smaller and very distinct fluctuation in the larger joints may be felt.The pain may be severe, especially at night, and during the
exacerbations of the disease it varies greatly in its degree and
persistency.The position and shape of the joints are altered, partly
by spasmodic retraction of the muscles, and more or less by the
effusion into the capsules and adjacent bursae and sheaths, and the
thickening of the soft parts covering the articulations.As the disease
progresses further deformities ensue from the growth of new bone around
the heads of the bones, the absorption of the articular cartilage, the
development of masses of cartilage in the hypertrophied synovial
processes and beneath the synovial membrane at the margin of the bones;
the relaxation of the articular ligaments; and the displacements and
subluxations of the unshapely bones composing the joint.The great
wasting of the muscles of the member affected has some share in
producing its unnatural appearance.In the advanced stage there is more
or less abiding pain, soreness, and stiffness in the affected
articulations, violent cramps are experienced in the course of the
adjacent muscles, and pains either along the nerves or vaguely down the
limbs.Crackings or creakings are to be heard, and grating is to be
felt during the movements of the joints; these movements become more
and more restricted, so that an immobility almost equal to that of true
bony ankylosis is established, this result seldom occurring except
amongst the carpal, tarsal, tibio-tarsal, and the vertebral
articulations.Interlocking of the osteophites formed on and around the
articular surfaces, and in other cases union of these surfaces by the
interposition of newly-formed fibrous tissue, produce a spurious
ankylosis {82} destructive of the articular functions.In the very
advanced stages the feet, ankles, and legs are often considerably
enlarged and the integument thickened by a chronic oedematous
infiltration, or the bones and soft parts are atrophied and the
integument is pale, smooth, and attenuated, resembling parchment or the
condition seen in certain stages of scleroderma and tightly drawn over
the wasted rigid fingers.This primary chronic form is especially apt
to progress steadily for many years, the joints earliest affected
becoming gradually more distorted and crippled, and fresh joints
becoming invaded until there may hardly remain a single sound
articulation in the limbs, or even in the body; and at length the
patient may be unable to feed himself or masticate or raise his chin
from his sternum or rotate his head or stand.The deformities of the several joints, being largely the result of
muscular contraction, observe certain general types, which, however,
are not peculiar to the disease, but occur in various affections of the
nerve-centres, involving paralysis or spasm or both.Charcot has
carefully described those met with in the hands, and I must refer to
his masterly article upon chronic articular rheumatism for his account
of them.(1) It must suffice to say here that the predominant features of the
hand in chronic rheumatoid arthritis are the following: The first
phalanx of the fingers is either flexed upon the metacarpus or
extended, and the terminal phalanx in like manner is either markedly
flexed or extended upon the second, or these two phalanges are
maintained in a straight line, while the first phalanx is, as usual,
decidedly flexed upon the metacarpus.[219] In all these varieties the
hand is pronated; there is a great tendency to deviation of the fingers
toward the ulnar border of the hand, although sometimes the deformed
fingers stand out, not unlike a bunch of parsnips.The thumb escapes
longer than the other fingers, and its metacarpo-phalangeal joint is
usually flexed, rarely extended.[Footnote 219: _Lectures on Senile Diseases_, Syd.II., on the hand, give good illustrations of these
deformities.](2) The great toe, enlarged at the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation,
is usually drawn to the outer border of the foot, across and above, but
rarely below, the other toes, and the foot is usually abducted and
flattened, the prominent internal border resting on the ground.The
wrist, elbow, and knee-joints are generally flexed; the distal ends of
the ulna and radius, more or less enlarged, project backward; the
semi-flexed tibia is drawn backward on the femur and rotated outward,
thus rendering the internal condyle of the femur prominent and
displacing the patella toward the external condyle, and foreign bodies
may frequently be felt in the enlarged knee- and elbow-joints.Finally,
the extremities of the affected bones will, as a rule, be found
enlarged and misshapen, and nodosities, rims, tips, ridges, and
stalactiform growths of new bone may be felt on them.[220]

[Footnote 220: Figs.12 to 18 and 22 in Adams's _Treatise on Rheumatic
Gout_ are nice illustrations of these deformities.]The general condition in this chronic form varies in different
individuals, and there is no characteristic disturbance of the
functions, such as obtains in chronic gout.There is no elevation of
temperature, unless to a slight degree during an active crisis of the
disease; the tongue may be clean, the pulse tranquil, the appetite and
digestion satisfactory, and {83} the urine normal or perhaps pale and
of low density.Fuller, however, says that "more generally the
complexion is sallow and the skin sluggish, and evidence of mischief is
furnished by yellowishness of the conjunctivae, constipation of the
bowels, a pale and unhealthy character of the dejections, excessive
flatulence after meals, turbidity of the urine, and fulness of the
pulse."My own experience hardly harmonizes with this, and I have seen
many persons suffering for years from the general and partial form in
the enjoyment of excellent general health.Should, however, the disease
develop in a person the subject of menorrhagia or other uterine
disorder, or of repeated child-bearing, or after prolonged mental
anxiety, some disturbance of the general health fairly referable to
such disturbing conditions may be certainly looked for.In the advanced
stages the prolonged suffering and confinement often induce anaemia,
dyspepsia, and failing health.More numerous and exhaustive analyses of the perspiration, urine, and
blood in the disease are needed.There is no uniform condition of the
skin; general perspirations, chiefly at night, often obtain, but I know
of no authoritative report as to the chemical reaction of the sweat in
this disease; Garrod[221] and Charcot[222] vouch for an absence of uric
acid in the blood, while Marrot[223] found both this acid and the urea
below the normal quantity in the urine, although the acid increased
notably under baths of high temperature.[Footnote 221: Reynolds's _Syst.[Footnote 223: _Contribution a l'Etude des Rheum.Artic., Examen de
l'Urine et du Sang_, Paris, 1879, p.Certain affections other than the articular have been occasionally
observed in persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, but many even
of those authors who regard the disease as a form of rheumatism speak
of these affections as coincidences, and not as essential
manifestations of the disease.Charcot and Besnier, however, maintain
the latter to be their true relation to the articular affection which
they regard as chronic rheumatism.The two authors just named allege
that all the visceral localizations that occur in acute articular
rheumatism may obtain in the nodular form, but that such localizations
are infinitely less frequent and serious than in the acute, subacute,
or simple chronic forms of articular rheumatism--that endo- and
pericarditis undoubtedly do occur in nodular rheumatism, and appear
especially where there is an exacerbation of the disease and where
there is some approach to the acute state.[224] As Charcot has adduced
these cardiac affections in proof of the rheumatic nature of rheumatoid
arthritis, it is deserving of mention that he had personally met with
but two instances of endocarditis and five of pericarditis, four of the
latter having been discovered not during life, but in nine autopsies,
and that he cites only eight other cases of endo- or pericarditis which
had been either published or reported to him.He admits too that there
had generally been in these cases, at some former period, an attack of
acute rheumatism.Besnier, Homolle, Malherbe, Vidal, and Colombel, in
their articles upon the disease under consideration, do not cite a
single case in which they have seen cardiac disease in rheumatoid
arthritis.On the other hand, McLeod, Garrod, Fuller, Flint, Senator,
and Pye-Smith either deny or ignore the occurrence of cardiac disease
as a manifestation or complication of this disease.My personal {84}
experience coincides with that of those authorities last cited, except
in one instance, and that is open to the objection that the patient's
father had had acute articular rheumatism, the mother was the subject
of chronic deforming arthritis, and the patient had experienced during
many winters an affection which began in the smaller joints and
permanently damaged them; when first seen by me he had chronic disease
of the aortic valves.He may have had true articular rheumatism as well
as rheumatoid arthritis.His father had experienced the one, his mother
the other.If those instances be excluded in which a former attack of
acute rheumatism might be adduced in explanation of the supervention of
cardiac disease, but few cases will remain to suggest that rheumatoid
arthritis may develop endo- or pericarditis; and when it is borne in
mind that in several ways the cardiac affections may have arisen as
mere coincidences of the rheumatoid affection, it is well to wait for
further evidence before accepting as proved the occurrence of cardiac
affections as local manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis.Garrod's
observation is still pertinent: "The form of the disease in which acute
cardiac inflammation has occurred may be rather that of true articular
rheumatism of a very subacute character."cit._, 172-175; Besnier, _loc.Nor is the evidence at all satisfactory in favor of any special
tendency to the following affections, much less of their being local
manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis: viz.pleuritis (McLeod,
Fuller), asthma (Charcot), chronic laryngitis (Garrod), grave cerebral
or spinal disturbances (McLeod, Fuller, Vidal), paralysis agitans,
locomotor ataxia, sciatica, trifacial neuralgia, and albuminous
nephritis.[225]

[Footnote 225: To mention only some of the many sources of cardiac
disease other than rheumatism may be adduced scarlet and other fevers,
extension of inflammation from the pleura or lung and other sources of
local irritation, powerful or oft-repeated muscular efforts, Bright's
disease, senile degeneration, etc.]Among the more frequent complications may be mentioned migraine,
certain cutaneous affections, more especially psoriasis, prurigo,
lichen, and some diseases of the eye, chiefly iritis, which is apt to
be relapsing, and sometimes episcleritis.It is remarkable that iritis
very seldom occurs as a complication of acute articular rheumatism.The so-called rheumatic nodules occur also in chronic rheumatoid
arthritis.It is not yet established that they are peculiar to
rheumatism and to rheumatoid arthritis.Stephen Mackenzie has seen
them in one instance in tertiary syphilis, the patient not having had
arthritis, rheumatism, or chorea.The partial or oligo-articular form of rheumatoid arthritis, like
the general or polyarticular variety, is usually a primarily chronic
affection, insidious in its invasion and slow in its progress.It is
chiefly observed in old persons, especially men (senile arthritis),
affects frequently a single joint, and chiefly the hip, but
occasionally the knee, shoulder, or spinal column, either as a
consequence of special injury or of the wear and tear of life, or
exposure to cold and wet, or even of what seemed to be simple acute or
subacute articular rheumatism or gonorrhoeal rheumatism.When not the
result of injury, two or three joints may suffer, both hips or knees,
or hip and some of the vertebrae, hip, knee, and ankle of the same
limb, and so on.Even in those cases in which the disease for a long
time is confined to a single joint and may have been caused by an
injury,[226] other joints, finally, are apt to become {85} affected,
often in a symmetrical order.So that it may seem almost general, or at
least polyarticular, just as the converse sometimes happens in the
general rheumatoid arthritis of long standing, where the disease
becomes greatly aggravated in one articulation and produces great
deformity and destruction of it, the others remaining as they were.[Footnote 226: See Ord's case, II., _Brit.Journal_, i., 1880,
158.]The symptoms of this partial chronic form are very much those of the
general form already described, but there is usually in the early
stages less heat, tenderness, and swelling of the affected joint; the
pain is less acute, but more abiding, and, with the exception of more
or less stiffness or impeded movement in the joint, it may be the only
sign of disease present, so that at this stage of the affection it may
be taken for simple chronic articular rheumatism.But the disease
persists; the voluntary movements become more painful and difficult;
slight exercise of the joint is followed promptly by fatigue and
aggravation of the pain, and yet the articular surfaces may be pressed
together, and flexion and extension be practised, without causing much
suffering.Slowly and continuously alterations take place in the
affected articulation; with but little heat or redness it enlarges
steadily, the soft parts becoming infiltrated and thickened, or
effusion taking place into the capsule; the articular surfaces become
irregularly depressed by the growth of osteo-cartilaginous rings,
osseous nodosities, and stalactiform processes upon them, and these
irregularities, together with one or several loose bodies, may be felt
in the joint.The enlargement of the articulation becomes more
apparent, owing to the wasting of the muscles of the limb; its
movements become more and more restricted and difficult, although
perhaps not more painful, and are attended with creakings and gratings
perceptible to the ear and hand; and at last nearly all movement of the
joint may be prevented by the alterations in the shape of the
epiphyses, or by the interlocking of the osseous outgrowths, or in rare
cases by actual union of the bones.This form constitutes, par
excellence, arthritis deformans.In many instances there is little
effusion throughout the process, notwithstanding the grave deformity in
progress; hence the term dry arthritis.Even the partial form is
sometimes more active in its invasion, as when it very rarely succeeds
acute or subacute articular or gonorrhoeal rheumatism, or, more
frequently, follows an injury.The duration of the partial form is usually very protracted; it may be
ten or twenty years.Exacerbations of the disease occur from time to
time, in the intervals of which the patient may be free from pain,
although the affected joints are seriously crippled.The affection is not in itself fatal; the patient may attain an
advanced age and die of some intercurrent disease, such as dysentery,
pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, or other affection incident to old age.A description of the features presented by partial rheumatoid arthritis
affecting the hip (morbus coxa senilis), the shoulder, and other joints
rather appertains to works on surgery, and only a glance at the
evidences of the disease in the vertebral column (spondylitis
deformans) will here be given.When the cervical vertebrae are
implicated the power of rotating the head from side to side is usually
preserved and is attended with a crackling noise, while the rest of the
cervical region is stiff and the head cannot be bent forward; when the
dorsal or lumbar vertebrae suffer the back becomes bent, the patient
stoops greatly and cannot stand {86} erect, and his body is shortened
and more or less twisted.A careful examination will discover not only
the great rigidity of the spine, and as it were fusion en masse of its
joints, but in these persons the bony outgrowths may be felt.Occasionally the alteration in the vertebrae by compressing the cord or
its membranes, or the spinal nerves and ganglia, may produce neuralgic
pains in the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, or sciatic nerves, wasting of
the muscles, more or less paralysis, and even vasomotor disturbances.Heberden's nodosities are certainly sometimes the effect of
rheumatoid arthritis, implicating chiefly, often solely, the distal
joints of the fingers, where it slowly forms two little hard nodules
about the size of dried peas upon the side of the articulations.These
are notably enlarged and their movements impaired, but pain is seldom
experienced, and were it not for deviation of the end of the finger to
one side or the knob-like excrescences upon the joints--appearances
which much disfigure the hand--patients would not speak of the
affection.In many cases these alterations likewise involve, but in a
minimum degree, the first phalangeal articulations, and less frequently
the metacarpo-phalangeal, and even some of the larger joints--the
wrist, knee, or hip, etc.Like the other varieties of rheumatoid
arthritis, this form occasionally has a more active invasion than is
above mentioned, and may be attended by local pain, heat, and redness,
or such symptoms may occur as exacerbations of the chronic disease.Gout may precede these nodosities, or, as in the case of
Charcot's,[227] the latter may precede the former by several years.Finally, Charcot remarks that Heberden's nodosities are "often
accompanied by asthma, migraine, neuralgia, especially of the sciatic
nerve, and muscular rheumatism, and that these manifestations may
alternate with the exacerbations of the disease."MORBID ANATOMY.--Every component tissue of the articulations exhibits
signs of a chronic inflammatory process.In the chronic form affecting
the larger joints the synovial membrane is found more or less
congested, opaque, and thickened; at the point of its reflection upon
the bones its fringes are thickened and injected and their villosities
greatly increased in number, length, and thickness, and in extreme
instances have been aptly compared to the wool on a sheep's back.The
cartilage-cells normally existing in the synovial fringes likewise
proliferate and develop into cartilaginous growths, many of which
become infiltrated with lime salts, or even ossified, and in this way
originate some of the foreign bodies, pedunculated or sessile, which
are found in the joints.These may be attached to the synovial fringes,
or imbedded in the membrane itself, or set free by rupture of their
pedicles.In some examples these neoplasms resemble in size small
melon-seeds; in others they form irregular masses, many of which are as
large as hazel-nuts.At the outset there is frequently an increase of synovial fluid, richer
in mucine than natural, which lessens considerably in the later stages
and becomes a turbid, viscid fluid of a dirty white or reddish-yellow
color, containing no pus, but degenerating epithelium and fragments of
villosities and cartilage.In many cases, more especially of the
partial {87} form, very little effusion into the articulations takes
place (arthrite seche).The inflammatory irritation excites proliferating and degenerating
processes in the cells and basis-substance of the cartilage covering
the bones, and the changes described in connection with acute rheumatic
arthritis ensue.Those parts of the cartilage covering the bones which
suffer pressure in locomotion fibrillate on their surface, and either
undergo mucous degeneration, resulting in ulceration and complete
absorption, or are thinned and worn away by attrition.In either way
the ends of the bones become laid bare.Those portions of the cartilage
at the periphery of the joints which escape compression in the erect
posture likewise proliferate, but, according to Cornil and Ranvier, in
consequence of being covered by the synovial membrane the proliferating
elements are retained in situ, instead of escaping into the articular
cavity, and develop into actual cartilage, and may ultimately ossify.In this way irregular masses of cartilage (enchondromata) and bone
(osteophytes) form around the heads of the bones, enlarging them
considerably, altering their shape, encroaching upon the articular
cavity as well as extending up the shafts of the bones, and displacing
the capsules of the articulations.Similar productions of cartilage
sometimes form in the thickened capsules and ligaments, especially in
very protracted cases, or these parts become infiltrated with lime
salts.While these processes are going on at the periphery and the centre of
the cartilages, in its deeper layers the proliferating cells are
undergoing ossification and rendering the ends of the bones very dense
and compact, so that under the attrition to which they are exposed by
the articular movements they acquire the smoothness, polish, and white
aspect of ivory (eburnated).It is probable that the articular ends of
the bones participate in this proliferation and development of bone,
which increases their compactness and is followed by eburnation.That
the bone itself does sometimes play a part in the hyperostosis which is
in progress is shown by an increase of an inch in the length of the
right ramus of the maxilla over that of the left in Adams's first
plate.[228] Forster's[229] and Ziegler's[230] later investigations
confirm this view.Nor is the periosteum exempted from the
proliferating process which may have long existed in the several
articular tissues, as is shown by the considerable enlargement of the
diameter of the shaft of the long bones and by the osteophytes which
form on the exterior of the vertebrae and often unite several of them
together by a series of osseous splints, interfering with the mobility
of the spine.Notwithstanding this development of cartilage and bone
upon the exterior of the articular extremities, the interior,
especially in old people or in very chronic examples of the general
form of the disease, or rarely in the partial form, undergoes
degeneration and atrophy.The spongy substance becomes rarefied,
thinned, and friable (osteoporosis), so that it has been easily cut or
crushed, and it is frequently loaded with fat.True ankylosis of the
diseased joints is rare, except in the very small articulations when
kept at rest; even under this condition fibrous ankylosis is not of
frequent occurrence.[Footnote 228: _Illustrations of the Effects of Rheumatic Gout_,
London, 1857.][Footnote 229: Forster, _Handbuch der Path.[Footnote 230: _Virchow's Archiv_, 1877.]Finally, the interarticular fibro-cartilages and ligaments and the long
{88} tendon of the biceps degenerate and are absorbed.The muscles in
protracted cases suffer simple atrophy, but are sometimes the seat of
an interstitial accumulation of fat.Thus far, no lesions of the nerves
supplying the diseased joints nor of the spinal cord have been
discovered.ETIOLOGY.--The causation of rheumatoid arthritis is involved in much
obscurity--in part, because sufficient attention has not been paid to
its clinical varieties.We will examine first the general progressive
form which is the more common.In women it prevails during the child-bearing period.It is probably
oftenest developed between twenty and thirty, and continues to occur
frequently up to the period of the menopause, fifty, after which it
develops comparatively seldom.Of Ord's 33 cases, 10 were between
twenty and thirty years; 11 between thirty and forty; 9 between forty
and fifty; and 3 between fifty and sixty.E. C. Seguin saw three children of the same family suffering from the
disease at ages from two and a half to four years.[232] Moncorvo[233]
met with an example at two years and a half, Laborde at four, and
Charcot at ten.Record_, London, 1877, 797.][Footnote 233: _Du Rheumatisme Chronique Noueux des Enfans_, Paris,
1880.]It is pre-eminently a disease of females up at least to fifty; after
that it is not infrequent in men, and is then often only partial, at
least at first.The most frequent progressive form, however, does often
occur even in boys.It is probably more frequently observed in cold and damp climates than
in those of opposite qualities, for cold is regarded as its most common
cause.However, it is met with in India and other hot climates.Besnier
asserts it is almost unknown in the tropics, but new investigations are
needed on this point.Direct hereditary predisposition exercises but little influence,
according to Garrod, and we certainly often see the disease confined to
a single member of a large family, although Seguin saw three young
children of one family affected with it, their parents being free from
any disease.Trastour three times saw the children of women who were
afflicted with nodular rheumatism already suffering from articular
rheumatism; and Charcot once saw the grandmother, the mother, and the
granddaughter successively attacked.At present I have a patient whose
mother at fifty-five and maternal grandmother at sixty became subjects
of a crippling polyarticular affection; another of my patients informed
me that his mother and a young sister were like himself victims of the
disease.This direct transmission appears to be rare, judging from my
own experience and from the few instances of it mentioned by writers.But very many authorities maintain that simple acute and chronic
rheumatism and gout in the parents predispose to rheumatoid arthritis
in the offspring (Charcot, Trastour, Besnier).Now, the facts given in
support of this opinion are not numerous.Trastour found that out of 45
cases of nodular rheumatism the father or mother were rheumatic in 10
instances, but the form of the rheumatic affection is not stated.Charcot, Besnier, and Homolle, although believers in the doctrine, do
not cite an example in proof.However, in Pye-Smith's 27 cases of
osteo-arthritis, five stated that rheumatism had occurred in their
families.Thus, two fathers {89} had had rheumatic fever, and one was
rheumatic, and two sisters of different families had had rheumatic
fever.Besides, the father of a sixth and the grandmother of a seventh
had had gout.[234]

[Footnote 234: _Guy's Hospital Reports_, 3d Series, xix.The evidence in favor of the doctrine that true articular rheumatism
transmits an hereditary tendency to rheumatoid arthritis does not
appear to be conclusive, although it is highly thought of by those who
regard the latter disease as a variety of rheumatism.Some
considerations of an opposing character deserve mention.Acute
articular rheumatism has very rarely passed continuously into
rheumatoid arthritis, and very rarely has been followed at short
interval by that disease; and in such exceptional cases the antecedent
affection may have been really the acute form of rheumatoid arthritis,
which closely resembles acute articular rheumatism.Trastour,[235]
Vidal,[236] Charcot,[237] and others admit that acute rheumatism can
hardly be placed amongst the antecedents of the rheumatoid affection.Garrod[238] with some others states that now and then acute rheumatism
acts as an exciting cause of it, which appears to have been Fuller's
view;[239] he had repeatedly known it to commence apparently as a
sequel of acute rheumatism.However, Ord met with a case in which the
lesions of rheumatoid arthritis were present in a typical form in a
patient who had mitral disease as a result of acute rheumatism, the
arthritis having begun as a continuation of the acute attack.[240]

[Footnote 235: _These de Paris_, 1853, p.[Footnote 236: _Ibid._, 1855, p.[Footnote 237: _Lecons Cliniques_, p.[Footnote 238: Reynolds's _Syst.Jour._, 1880, i., 158.]That so common an affection as articular rheumatism should occur in the
family or personal history of a patient the subject of the rheumatoid
arthritis is not improbable; nasal catarrh and many other very common
diseases must be frequent antecedents of the rheumatoid affection, yet
are not causes of it.Much the same remarks apply to the view that gout
in the parents may transmit a tendency to rheumatoid arthritis in the
offspring.The experience of English physicians in this matter is
hardly reliable, owing to the great prevalence of gout in England.In
Canada and many parts of the United States, however, while gout is a
rare disease, rheumatoid arthritis is a common one, and the writer has
not found an intimate relationship to obtain between the two
affections.It is not intended to deny that when the children of
rheumatic or gouty parents fail in health owing to their inherited
constitutional disease, they become liable to rheumatoid arthritis, for
feeble health predisposes to that affection.Finally, many of the difficulties connected with this subject are
reasonably met by Hutchinson's[241] doctrine that there exists a state
of tissue-health which is transmissible by inheritance, which involves
liability to inflammations of joints and fibrous structures, and upon
this arthritic diathesis as a foundation may be built up, under the
influence of special causes, a tendency to gout, rheumatism, or any one
of their various modifications or combinations.95; Gueneau de
Mussy's chap., "De la Diathese Arthritique," _Clin.Med._, 1874, t. i.Hutchinson has demonstrated that gout is often followed by rheumatoid
arthritis, the lesions characteristic of both affections coexisting in
the same joint.Charcot and Cornil had previously observed the same
{90} thing.[242] Acute and perhaps chronic rheumarthritis have
sometimes preceded rheumatoid arthritis.If a predisposition, inherited
or acquired, to rheumatoid arthritis exist, the occurrence of gouty or
rheumatic irritation in the joints may suffice to induce the peculiar
form of disturbance characteristic of the rheumatoid affection, just as
injuries sometimes develop the partial form.[Footnote 242: _Memoires de la Societe de Biologie_, 1864.]There is a group of conditions affecting the sexual functions and
organs of women which appear to be specially connected with the general
peripheral form of rheumatoid arthritis.The disease follows pregnancy,
and specially frequent pregnancies, protracted lactation, and various
disorders of menstruation.The latter influence obtained in ten out of
eleven instances of the disease met with in girls under eighteen by
Fuller.[243] The frequency of the disease about the period of the
menopause has been already mentioned.Todd noticed its coincidence with
dysmenorrhoea.Ord in an able and original paper[244] has lately dwelt
upon ovario-uterine disorder or irritation as a frequent active cause
of the disease, having in his opinion met with 33 instances of the
kind.The relationship between these various conditions of the
functions and organs of generation and rheumatoid arthritis cannot be
regarded as settled.Garrod supposed that such conditions, by causing
debility, predisposed to the articular disease.Todd, an ardent
humoralist, held the nexus between the two to be unhealthy secretions
of the uterus, leading to blood impurity; while Ord has ably defended
Remak's view that a direct influence of the nervous system is the real
link of relationship.It seems necessary to remark that mere
coincidence may play a large role in the explanation of many of these
cases.In 17 at least of Ord's 33 cases the conditions stated by that
author cannot safely be adduced as anything more; and it is probable
that they would be found present in much the same proportion in any
other chronic painful disease of women.Jour._, i., 1880, 151-153.]Scrofula and phthisis are regarded by Charcot, Cornil, and Garrod as
frequent antecedents of rheumatoid arthritis: the first had several
times seen white swelling in youth, followed by nodular rheumatism in
later life;[245] and Fuller found that 23 out of 119 victims of
rheumatic gout had lost a parent or one or more brothers and sisters by
consumption.[246] Chlorosis has several times preceded rheumatoid
arthritis.When the prevalence of scrofula, phthisis, and chlorosis is
borne in mind, it will not appear strange that they should frequently
be found amongst the antecedents of rheumatoid arthritis, without
inferring any other relationship between them.Gonorrhoeal rheumatism
has also occasionally preceded rheumatoid arthritis, but Ord and
Hutchinson are probably correct in regarding that affection as a
variety of rheumatoid arthritis.[247]

[Footnote 245: _Loc.Cold, especially when prolonged and associated with dampness, is
commonly held to be the most common cause of general rheumatoid
arthritis.A protracted residence in low, damp dwellings, deprived of
the sun's rays and of a free circulation of air, is a condition thought
most favorable to the provocation of this disease, perhaps years after
the condition has been done away with.{91} Poverty and all that it implies are at least frequent antecedents
of the disease (hence one of its epithets, arthritis pauperum), as are
other debilitating influences, such as night-watching, insufficient
food, mental worry, grief, anxiety, etc.Be it remembered, however,
that the disease is frequently observed in the well-to-do, who live in
dry climates and warm houses, are well fed, and want for nothing; so
that the external conditions first mentioned are not essential causes
of the disease, and many of them may act merely as adjuvants.Direct injury of a joint from a blow, a fracture, a whitlow, etc.may
sometimes induce a local rheumatoid arthritis, which may subsequently
become multiple and involve several articulations more or less
symmetrically.[248]

[Footnote 248: Vide Charcot's and Ord's cases, _loc.cit._]

The partial form presents some peculiarities of causation--thus: it
occurs chiefly in advanced life (senile arthritis), much less
frequently in middle life, very exceptionally in the very young.Men
are much more liable to it than women.It is chiefly this variety which
follows injuries, blows, dislocations, pressure, etc., and the disease
may then be limited to the injured joint and be monoarticular, or it
may extend and become polyarticular, or rarely, as in Ord's case, even
general.This monoarticular form appears to be sometimes induced by
other local irritations of the articular structures than those
following traumatic influences; and as foreign growths in joints and
gouty irritation may respectively induce the lesions indicative of
rheumatoid arthritis, so, it is probable, may simple chronic
rheumatism; and this may be the true relationship existing between
these several affections.It is doubtful at present whether purely
local irritation or injury of a joint can originate the alterations
belonging to rheumatoid arthritis--that is, in the absence of all
predisposition to that disease or of the arthritic diathesis.Cold and
dampness are generally admitted to be causes of the partial form, but
the evidence on this point is not altogether satisfactory.It may be
that chronic articular rheumatism is induced by the prolonged operation
of damp cold, and that the prolonged rheumatic irritation, aggravated
by constant use of the joint and by occasional violence, ultimately
superinduces the profounder alterations characteristic of arthritis
deformans.It appears highly probable that if the predisposition exist,
any long-abiding irritation of a joint, whether the result of violence
or disease, may ultimately originate the alterations of the cartilages
and bones which obtain in rheumatoid arthritis.As regards the etiology of Heberden's nodosities, and their relation to
other affections of the joints, the following summary must suffice:
They obtain chiefly in advanced life, but do occur rarely in the young;
they are probably somewhat more frequent in women than in men; although
more frequently seen in the upper classes, the poor are not exempt from
them, no doubt because they are specially exposed to slight but
oft-recurring injuries of their digits, such traumatism being an
exciting cause of the disease, especially when confined to a single
joint.The affection is sometimes hereditary; both it and the general
or the partial forms of rheumatoid arthritis may coexist in the same
family and even in the same person.The alterations in the joints are
identical with those found in the general variety of rheumatoid
arthritis, and exist without {92} deposits of urate of soda (Charcot).It resembles the general form of the disease just mentioned in its
tendency to involve many symmetrical articulations at the same time,
and the partial form in the rarity with which it extends beyond the
joints first attacked.While Heberden's nodosities, as Haygarth taught,
do occur independently of gout and the gouty habit, I believe with
Begbie[249] and Duckworth[250] that in some persons they are evidences
of gout or the gouty diathesis.[Footnote 249: _Contributions to Practical Med._, 1802, p.[Footnote 250: "On Unequivocal Gouty Diseases," _St.Bartholomew's
Hospital Reports_, vol.Quite recently a woman aged forty-eight consulted me with these
nodosities beginning upon the last joint of the fingers, while she was
the subject of vesico-renal irritation and was passing free uric acid
in the urine.Hutchinson has twice seen them in combination with a
peculiar insidious and painless inflammation of the iris and vitreous
body, which occurs in the children of the gouty, yet such children have
no deposits of lithates in their joints, nor any lithiasis, nor acute
paroxysms of true gout, and he considers that "the last joint arthritis
is to be regarded as in part gouty, and in part a kind of articular
chilblain."[251]

[Footnote 251: _Trans.Lastly, in some instances they are no doubt the hybrid offspring of an
inherited tendency to both gout and rheumatoid arthritis.No more important principle in pathology exists than has been of late
years insisted upon, especially by Jonathan Hutchinson and in his
recent lecture by Sir James Paget[252]--to wit, that "by inherited
dispositions, accumulating and combining or converging in definite
proportions, new diseases may be developed and old ones be variously
modified."[Footnote 252: _Lancet_, ii., 1882, 1017-1021.]The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis is the subject of differences
of opinion very like those existing in regard to acute articular
rheumatism.The weight of evidence is in favor of its diathetic
relationship to rheumatism; and the doctrine of an arthritic diathesis
and of the operation of the causes of the disease through the nervous
system appears to be specially applicable to it, with less difficulty
than to acute rheumatism, and the probability of a specific germ being
its true cause is very remote.What seems to be necessary in addition
to the preceding is, that the causes shall be more persisting and
oft-recurring, so as to maintain a prolonged local irritation of the
articular tissues, or that the neuro-arthritic diathesis shall be
highly developed.Under these conditions the prolonged or oft-repeated
application of cold and damp to the peripheral nerves, severe or
oft-repeated slight injuries to joints, urethral or ovario-uterine
irritation, chronic gout or rheumatism, or even, exceptionally, an
attack of the acute form of these diseases, may originate rheumatoid
arthritis; and all wearing influences, such as anaemia, excessive
menstruation, prolonged lactation, innutrition, failing health, mental
anxiety, or shock, etc., act as adjuvants in the development,
aggravation, and maintenance of the articular disease.DIAGNOSIS.--It is perhaps not possible to distinguish with certainty
either the acute or the chronic form of rheumatoid arthritis from
subacute or chronic rheumarthritis respectively before the
characteristic deformities of the former affections have appeared.Acute rheumatoid arthritis, which is comparatively rare, may be said to
exist, rather than subacute {93} articular rheumatism, if the disease
affect early and chiefly the smaller joints of the hands and feet alone
or along with some of the larger articulations, especially the
sterno-clavicular or the temporo-maxillary; if the effusion into the
joints be abundant; if inflammation persist in the articulations first
involved, notwithstanding the invasion of other joints; if the heart
escape; if the patient be a female who is constitutionally delicate, or
has borne children rapidly, or is the subject of disordered
menstruation, or has been attacked soon after childbirth or during
lactation;--finally, if, on cessation of the attack, one or more of the
joints remain swollen and permanently enlarged and impaired in
function.The coexistence of iritis, or a history of a previous attack
of that disease not attributable to syphilis or gout, would strengthen
the above view.Daniel moved to the office.Precisely the same considerations serve to distinguish chronic general
or polyarticular rheumatoid arthritis from chronic articular
rheumatism, with the following qualifications: endo- or pericarditis is
not of frequent occurrence in chronic rheumatism, so that this
distinction is not available, and chronic rheumarthritis of long
standing does sometimes impair the movements of the joints, and even
produce slight alterations in them.However, it does not, as a rule,
involve so many joints as rheumatoid arthritis; it is less symmetrical
in its distribution, and much less prone to implicate the
sterno-clavicular, the temporo-maxillary, or the vertebral
articulations.Nor does it cause removal of the articular cartilage,
enlargement of the heads of the bones, and the formation of osteophytes
around them, and of loose bodies in the articulations, together with
marked deformities and luxations of the joints.A history of a remote
or recent attack of acute rheumarthritis or of chorea, or the presence
of chronic valvular disease, would strongly indicate the simple
rheumatic nature of the case.The partial form of rheumatoid arthritis can with even less certainty
than the general be distinguished from chronic articular rheumatism
before the characteristic alterations of the joints have been
developed, more especially as it is sometimes a consequence of gouty
irritation and probably of chronic rheumatism.Chronic arthritis
following a traumatic cause, and persisting obstinately in the injured
joint is probably rheumatoid, if not strumous, gouty, or periarthritic.But before definitely deciding it will be prudent to await the
development of some of the characteristic alterations of structure
appertaining to rheumatoid arthritis.An affection of the shoulder
frequently occurs which resembles in many respects rheumatoid
arthritis, and has been well described by Simon Duplay[253] and W.[254] It usually follows an injury, such as contusion, sprain,
etc., of the joint, but may be spontaneous; it is unattended by
swelling or deformity.Its early symptoms are pain on pressure of the
shoulder a little below the outer border of the acromion, and
especially behind it and at the coracoid process, also about the
insertion of the deltoid and below the acromion during movements of the
joint, especially when the arm is raised from the side or rotated
inwardly; early restriction of these movements, which increases till a
fibrous ankylosis becomes established and scapula and humerus move
together as one piece, motion between those bones no longer existing,
and forcible attempts to produce it giving great pain, and sometimes
producing {94} crepitus in or about the articulation; sometimes early
numbness and pain down the member to the hand in the course of the
ulnar, internal cutaneous, or the radial nerve; vicious and painful
semiflexion of the elbow; after a time wasting of the group of muscles
which move the shoulder-joint.Although usually monoarticular and of
traumatic origin, I have seen it affect first one and then the other
shoulder in the absence of any known injury, and beginning like a
neuritis or a neuralgia of the scapulo-humeral nerves.Duplay, however,
regards it as a periarthritis.It may be distinguished from the
rheumatoid arthritis by the absence of effusion into or enlargement of
the articulation, and of deformity of the bones; by the early
restriction of the movements and the rapid development of adhesions
which fix the articulation; and by the curability of the disease.[Footnote 253: _Archives Generales de Med._, Nov., 1872, pp.[Footnote 254: _Archives of Med._, Oct., 1880.]The articular affection of locomotor ataxia sometimes closely resembles
monoarticular rheumatoid arthritis,[255] but may be distinguished by
its sudden invasion, often without pain or fever; the prompt
development of a general and often enormous tumefaction of the entire
member, with copious effusion into the joint; the early destruction of
the articular cartilages, the rapid wearing away of the heads of the
bones, and the proneness to spontaneous fracture of their brittle
shafts; the prompt absorption of the articular effusion, followed by a
relaxed state of the ligaments and a facility of dislocation; the early
occurrence of the articular affection, when motor inco-ordination is
scarcely developed, and its frequent association with the crises of
ataxia or the presence of some of the other symptoms of that disease.The importance of these facts will be especially evident in those
examples of ataxic articular disease in which, at an advanced stage,
eburnation and deformity of the articular surfaces, with the formation
of loose bodies and osteophytes, are observed, just as they are in
arthritis deformans.[Footnote 255: Charcot's _Lectures on Diseases of the Nervous System_,
Syd.Soc., 1877; _Archives de Physiologie_, t. i., p.161, 1868;
_ibid._, xi., 1869.]Articular disease closely allied to what occurs in locomotor ataxia is
now and then observed in the early stages of progressive muscular
atrophy,[256] but while the large joints, more particularly the knee
and the shoulder, suffer in the former affection, the phalangeal
chiefly and the larger articulations more rarely are attacked in the
latter.Of course the peculiar symptoms of progressive muscular atrophy
coexisting with those of the articular affection would serve to
distinguish the latter from rheumatoid arthritis.[Footnote 256: Remak, _Allgem.Zeitung_, March, 1862;
Rosenthal, _Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Nervous System_,
translated by L. Putzel, M.D., 1879, p.It is often very difficult to say whether a given case is one of
chronic rheumatoid arthritis or of chronic gout; and there is no doubt
that in England, where gout prevails, it is not unfrequently associated
with rheumatoid arthritis, sometimes preceding and even causing it,
much more often following it, for the one does not exclude the other.While rheumatoid arthritis most frequently begins in the hand, and is
usually symmetrical and bilateral, gout commonly begins in the lower
extremities, and especially in the metatarsal joint of the great toe,
and of one foot only.Chronic gout is far more frequently preceded by
attacks of acute gout than chronic rheumatoid arthritis is by the acute
form of that affection; a history of inherited predisposition, of
indulgence in the {95} use of wine, ale, porter, and of animal food, of
deficient bodily exercise, with perhaps great mental occupation or
anxiety, of recurring gouty dyspepsia or of a tendency to lithiasis,
would indicate gout, while the absence of these and a history of
frequent exposure to cold and wet, of injury to the joint, of previous
exhausting disease or drain, of impaired health, debility, or poverty,
would strongly imply rheumatoid arthritis.Gout is especially observed
in males over thirty, and very rarely in children; general rheumatoid
arthritis is chiefly a disease of females during menstrual life, and
occasionally occurs in children of either sex.The partial form is, like gout, chiefly a disease of men, but occurs
generally at a more advanced age than gout.Even chronic gout is more
or less paroxysmal, with distinct intermissions; chronic rheumatoid
arthritis is more or less abiding and progressive, with only remissions
in its course and severity; the former is frequently associated with
chronic renal disease, the latter is not.The urate-of-soda deposits
about the articulations in gout appear as more or less round or ovoid
swellings in the close vicinity of the joints, but not observing their
exact level or their general form; softish when recent, they never
acquire a bony hardness, and are nearly always capable of slight
lateral movement.The skin covering them is frequently stretched and
glossy, and may exhibit white spots of urate of soda.The articular
nodosities in chronic rheumatoid arthritis are actual osseous
enlargements of, or outgrowths from, the articular surfaces, forming
part of them, immovable and conserving more or less their form.The
integument covering the nodosities is not glossy or dotted with
chalk-like specks.The several types of deformity of the fingers
previously described, and mainly produced in rheumatoid arthritis by
muscular contractions and altered shape of the articular surfaces, are
not seen in gout.Finally, if chalk-like concretions are visible in the
ears, joints, or finger-ends, or if the blood contain uric acid, gout
is present.While rheumatoid arthritis and chronic gout occasionally
coexist in the same patient in England, in Canada, where the latter
disease is comparatively rare and the former quite common, the writer
does not remember to have observed such coexistence.Besides the acute syphilitic disease of the joints already alluded to
as occurring in children (inherited), a chronic arthritis is observed
in the adult amongst the very late lesions of syphilis.It is usually
monoarticular, affects the larger joints, especially the knee, and may
originate either in the synovial membrane or in the bone and
periosteum.In syphilitic synovitis the history of the case, the
existence occasionally of soft gummy tumors in the periarticular
tissues and of hydrarthrosis, the trivial degree of pain and
tenderness, the insidious invasion and chronic course of the affection,
and its prompt relief by antisyphilitic remedies, will indicate the
nature of the case.When it originates in the bone and periosteum, although the invasion
may be prompt and the pain at first severe, the latter usually
moderates greatly and becomes nocturnal, and the articular surfaces
present localized rather than general enlargement (hyperostosis); nodes
often coexist; effusion is moderate, unless the synovial membrane is
also involved, and full doses of iodide of potassium will soon afford
relief.PROGNOSIS.--In the polyarticular form the course varies much more than
is commonly believed, and the disease must not be regarded as
necessarily {96} progressive and incurable.When it occurs in young
persons, and in children more especially, although it may suffer
exacerbations and remissions for a few years, yet arrest of the disease
and recovery of the functions of the joints, sometimes with very little
deformity, now and then take place under suitable management.Quite
recently a man of thirty-two consulted me about a vesical affection who
from the age of eight had suffered every winter for twenty years from
rheumatoid arthritis in his hands and feet, and finally in the knees.Yet when seen by me he had been free from pain in his joints for three
years, and, although they were somewhat deformed, their movements were
remarkably free and painless.Several of my younger patients while bearing children rapidly and
nursing them have had the disease in their hands or hands and wrists;
exacerbations have recurred during subsequent lactations, and yet the
disease has either become arrested or progressed very slowly and at
long intervals.It is admitted, however, that these are all exceptional
cases, and that the tendency both of polyarticular and of the
monoarticular forms is to progress, and, either steadily or at
intervals and by recurring attacks, to permanently deform the joints
and impair their movements.Even under these circumstances, however,
the patients may suffer little pain unless when forcible movements of
the articulations are attempted.On the other hand, while the disease cannot be regarded as curable
under the employment of drugs, very much can frequently be done,
especially in the polyarticular form, to relieve the suffering and to
<DW44>, if not arrest, the progress of the disease, and even to restore
sometimes very considerably the functions of the joints.Neither of
these forms of rheumatoid arthritis can be said to be dangerous to
life, and they often exist ten or twenty years and more without
seriously injuring the general health.Heberden's nodosities are
incurable, but they are little more than deformities.TREATMENT.--The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is, as a rule,
disappointing, and perhaps no affection requires more perseverence and
self-reliance on the part of the physician or more hopeful resolution
on that of the patient.Our first duty is to make an exhaustive search
as to the probable cause of the disease, as its removal is an important
step in the treatment of the affection, although such search is
frequently futile, and many of the alleged causes may, after all, be
mere antecedents or coincidences.However, inasmuch as the pathology of
the disease is very obscure, any abnormal condition of organ or
function that may be discovered should receive strict and prompt
attention, lest it should, either through disturbed innervation or
malassimilation or impaired nutrition or defective excretion, be the
predisposing or exciting cause of the disease.In women the most
careful inquiry should be made into the state of the ovario-uterine
organs and functions, and the least departure from their norm should be
at once treated.Deficient, excessive, or painful menstruation,
leucorrhoea, ovarian irritations, or pain, even displacements of the
uterus or ovary, should be corrected as soon as possible.Repeated
pregnancy and prolonged lactation, recurring mental anxiety and
physical fatigue, defects of diet, want of food, of sunlight, and of
good air, residence in damp dwellings, occupations involving exposure
to cold and wet, are conditions supplying important indications which
too often are {97} beyond the control of the physician, although they
peremptorily require his attention.The general form is often met with
in anaemic persons and in those of impaired health and vigor, and
probably very rarely occurs under opposite circumstances; and there is
a consensus of opinion that a lowering system of treatment is
contraindicated in rheumatoid arthritis.Having efficiently set about correcting or removing these various
predisposing or determining causes of the disease, we next direct our
care to the disease itself.The remedies which had been found most
useful in rheumatoid arthritis before the introduction of salicylic
acid were cod-liver oil, quinia, iodine, iron, arsenic, and various
mineral waters, employed either externally or internally, usually in
both ways.Judging from my own late experience and from the results
obtained by See[257] and other French physicians, as communicated by
Jules Compagnon,[258] sodium salicylate, given in sufficient doses,
promises to be more generally useful in the more acute forms or in the
actively inflammatory periods and exacerbations of the disease than any
of those agents.Including See's cases, Compagnon has related 17
examples of rheumatoid arthritis, most of them of the general
progressive form, in which great improvement as regards pain,
stiffness, swelling, and even deformity, followed promptly the
employment of that salt, even after the failure of other remedies.It
proved signally useful recently in a rebellious chronic case of my own.Pollock has lately published an instance in which 5 grains of
salicylate of quinia three times a day were in three or four days
followed by great relief.[259] The testimony already given of Dr.J. T.
Eskridge as to the great value of this salt in chronic rheumatism will
be held by some to be corroborative of its value in rheumatoid
arthritis.It is hardly necessary to say that it often fails in this
intractable disease, but it has frequently relieved the pain and
swelling and arrested the progress of it, at least for the time, even
when alkalies, iodine, arsenic, baths, etc.[Footnote 257: _Bulletin de l'Academie de Med._, Paris, t. v., 2d
Serie, 1877.][Footnote 258: _De l'Utilite du Salicylate de Soude dans le Traitement
du Rheumatisme_, par Jules Compagnon, Paris, 1880.][Footnote 259: _The Lancet_, ii., 1882, 141.]It is probable that less than 45 grains per diem of the sodium salt is
of little value in even the most chronic forms, and that the quantity
requires to be increased in proportion as the febrile symptoms are
active, so that a drachm and a half or two drachms may need to be
administered in the day to some persons.It should be given in divided
doses at intervals of two hours, and, what is of primary importance, it
should be continued for a long time, even after much improvement has
resulted, and should be resorted to from time to time, especially
during recurrences of the pain, heat, or swelling.It is of
consequence, especially in elderly patients, to ascertain that the
medicine is being promptly eliminated by the kidneys and to watch its
effect upon the heart.The administration along with it of a little old
rye whiskey or brandy will sometimes be necessary in feeble people.In
those rather common cases in which the skin is inactive and perhaps
harsh the salicylate often improves that important organ of oxidation
and elimination, and should it not do so the addition of the ammonium
carbonate may be tried, especially in feeble persons with weak hearts.{98} Moreover, the other drugs which sometimes prove serviceable in
this disease may be given at the same time or alternately with the
salicylate, or instead of it if it is not found to be of use or is not
tolerated.In chronic cases a prolonged course of cod-liver oil, alone
or along with malt extract, often seems to be of real service,
especially when nutrition is much impaired or when the patient is the
subject of acquired or inherited struma.Iodide of potassium, in
combination with quinia or other tonic, will often prove signally
useful in chronic cases unaccompanied by pyrexia, in which the pains
are worst at night.It should be first tried in moderate doses (5 to 8
grains), and be continued for a long time with occasional
intermissions, and before discarding it from disappointment--which
often arises--15- to 20-grain doses may be given tentatively for a
short period.Milk or coffee or Vichy water are good vehicles for its
administration.Whether free iodine in the form of the tincture, so
highly spoken of by Lasegue,[260] acts as well or better than the
iodide of potassium is doubtful.He gave it at meals, in doses
progressively increased from 10 drops to 5 or 6 grammes twice a day, in
sherry or sweetened water, and persevered with it for a long period.Garrod has had many restorations to health in severe forms of this
disease from the persevering employment of the syrup of the iodide of
iron.The iron in these preparations may deserve as much commendation
as the iodine, for it has often proved signally useful in this disease,
not alone on account of the anaemia which so frequently attends it, but
through its beneficial influence upon the nutritive functions and the
circulation.The usual rules regulating the employment of iron are to be observed,
and the condition of the digestive organs will demand special attention
during its employment.Although the influence of arsenic upon
rheumatoid arthritis is not uniform, yet as it sometimes proves really
useful[261] it should be tried.Like iron, it may prove beneficial in
several ways--by improving the quality of the blood, promoting the
circulation in the superficial layers of the skin, or exerting some
influence upon either the nerve-centres or perhaps upon the vaso-motor
nerves of the cutaneous or articular tissues.The last-mentioned
suggestion is favored by the circumstance noted by Charcot--viz.that
the first effects of arsenic in nodular rheumatism are often
intensification of the articular pains, and sometimes the production of
redness and swelling where they did not exist before.That author found
arsenic without effect or injurious in very inveterate cases and when
the disease had appeared at an advanced age.Five to ten minims of
Fowler's solution, or of the solution of the arseniate of sodium, which
is perhaps less irritating than the former, should be given immediately
after meals, and its effects upon the gastric and hepatic functions
carefully watched.De Mussy has highly recommended arsenical baths
(drachm ss-ij of arseniate of soda to 30 gallons of water), but as the
arsenic is not absorbed by the unbroken skin, any improvement which may
follow its employment is probably owing to the temperature of the bath
or the bath itself.[Footnote 261: As to the value of arsenic in rheumatoid arthritis, see
Bardsley's _Medical Reports_, London, 1807; Begbie, _Edin.Jour._, 1858; Fuller, _lib.cit._,
3d ed., p.534; Gueneau de Mussy, _Bull.lxvii.,
1864, p.A similar remark has been made respecting the value of the various {99}
thermal mineral baths, natural and artificial, so much employed in this
disease.[262] It is neither the nature nor proportion of their mineral
ingredients, but the degree of temperature, which constitutes the
essential point in the action of a bath.This, if true, explains the
almost equal reputation of the many varieties of thermal mineral
springs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic
rheumatism.It is this that permits the physician to promise the poor
patient as much benefit from the employment of hot baths of simple
water as of those of New Zealand, Plombieres, or Arkansas.[Footnote 262: Vide Niemeyer, _Text-Book Pract.Med._, N.Y., 1867, p.488; _Traitement du Rheum.par les bains a haute temperature_, par Ch.The time for a resort to hot baths in rheumatoid arthritis is when the
very violent pains have subsided sufficiently to allow of their
employment; and while they may be hopefully used in the most chronic
and advanced cases, the earlier they are employed the more curative
they are.The temperature of these hot baths need not, as a rule,
exceed 95 to 100 degrees F., although some authorities approve of
raising the temperature to 110 degrees or 112 degrees while the patient
is in the water.A series of twenty to thirty such baths, taken every
second day for ten to twenty minutes, is sufficient for one trial, and
often effects very great improvement in the disease.The aggravation or
return of pain in the joints which often follows the employment of warm
baths will cease after the fifth or sixth bath.Garrod's experience of
the Turkish bath is not favorable; it very often does much mischief by
causing debility, and its excessive use has induced rheumatoid
arthritis in persons previously free from the disease.Now, while it may be true that simple hot-water baths employed at home
are as good as mineral thermal baths taken at their source, it is
generally admitted that it is best to send persons who can afford the
expense to the springs themselves, where they may drink the waters as
well as employ them externally, and at the same time secure all the
advantages arising from change of habits, scene, and climate, from
restriction to a proper diet, and from the systematic employment of the
waters and baths under the direction of persons experienced in their
administration, etc.No reliable rules can be laid down for the
selection of the mineral waters best adapted to each case: the stronger
alkaline waters perhaps had better be used with great care, such as
those of Carlsbad, Vichy, Mont Dore, Weisbaden, and after a course of
thermal mineral baths at such places as Aix-les-Bains, Wildbad, Bath,
Aix-la-Chapelle, etc., Garrod advises resort to some place where the
air is bracing and the waters tonic or chalybeate, as Buxton, Spa,
Schwalbach, or St.In this country good results are often
obtained at the Hot Springs of Arkansas and the Hot Sulphur and the
Lithia Springs of Virginia.The use internally and in the form of hot
baths of the mineral springs of Saratoga, of Michigan, of the Licks of
Kentucky, and of California, of St.Catherine's (Canada),
is frequently very beneficial.In the selection of the mineral waters
to be drunk, and of the temperature and other qualities of the baths to
be employed, careful attention must be paid to the condition of the
functions of the skin, liver, kidneys, and nervous system; but space
cannot be afforded here for the consideration of this extensive topic.Moreover, it occasionally happens that after failure of {100} sulphur
or alkaline baths some other form may succeed, as the vapor or hot-air,
or tepid or very hot-water bath.If decided benefit follow the first
series of baths, recourse should be had from time to time to a fresh
series, even for several years, in obstinate cases.Mud and peat baths
are much valued in Germany, although they do not always agree with
weakly or aged people.The local treatment is of equal importance with the general, and it is
not unfrequently more effective in restoring the functions of the
articulations.In that rare variety, acute rheumatoid arthritis,
attended with much pain and heat in the joints, perfect rest in bed is
called for, together with other measures adapted to subdue the
inflammation and allay the pain.Compresses wet with warm water,
rendered anodyne by the addition of laudanum or belladonna, or both,
and covered with oiled silk, suit some cases--light linseed poultices,
applied moderately warm and extending considerably beyond the limits of
the articulation and covered with gutta-percha or oiled silk, in
others.As the pain and local heat subside, the tincture of iodine may
be applied extensively, or blistering-fluid over limited areas above
and below the affected joints, but not on them until the inflammation
has very much abated and is becoming chronic.These simple methods
should be employed assiduously and be aided by appliances to secure
actual rest of the inflamed joints.In the chronic variety complete
rest is not needed unless during the acute exacerbations, but the
movements should be at first somewhat restrained and be regulated by
the effects produced.But the severe pain experienced during the
movements must be borne; it will subside promptly.Decided increase of
pain and heat in the part, lasting many hours, would indicate more
reserve in the use of the joints.It is frequently very difficult to
determine when and to what extent movement may be permitted in this
disease.No fixed rule can be laid down of universal application, but
it may be stated that in proportion as the local disease becomes
indolent and inactive may pressure and active movements of the joints
be resorted to, for they then have a beneficial influence in preventing
stiffness, contraction, and deformity.Indeed, in my opinion it is not
wise to delay these movements long even in subacute cases.The editor
of this work has especially insisted upon the importance of systematic
daily movements of the affected joints as the most essential part of
the treatment,[263] "combined with thorough massage of all the muscles
whose functional activity is impeded and impaired."[Footnote 263: "Some Practical Remarks on Chronic Rheumatism," by Wm.Pepper, M.D., _Archives of Medicine_, Oct., 1880.]The abiding chronic inflammation indicated by local heat, swelling, and
inflammation of the affected tissues may be variously treated.The
joints may be thoroughly fomented with tolerably hot water or by means
of the local vapor bath for half an hour, morning and night, and then
be gently rubbed for ten or fifteen minutes with iodine or weak
mercurial ointment or with the compound camphor or acetic turpentine
liniment, or, if these are too stimulating, with some bland oil, such
as cod-liver or neats' foot or cocoa oil, after which should be applied
hot-water compresses or linseed poultices or a wrap of soft cotton wool
covered with oiled silk and secured by an elastic, moderately tight
roller.If these means prove inefficient and the inflammatory process
grow more {101} indolent, counter-irritants may be conjoined with or
substituted for them.Small fly blisters or strong iodine paint may be
applied close to the joints, or the ordinary iodine tincture may be
brushed over them, or the above ointments or liniments and one of the
bland oils may be more forcibly rubbed in.The prolonged rubbing of
these stiff, swollen joints with oil is not valued as much as it
deserves.Compression of the thickened tissues by means of a thick envelope of
cotton wool and thin flannel or rubber bandage sometimes acts very
well, probably by reducing the amount of blood and interfering with
cell-growth or promoting cell-degeneration.Hot sand-baths to the
affected joints are sometimes useful.These several measures should be perseveringly applied, and in
proportion as chronicity prevails the active and passive movements of
the articulations and massage of the muscles and adjacent tissues
should be daily and efficiently practised.Electricity will often be found an important adjuvant in this as well
as in an earlier stage, not only in improving the nutrition of the
muscles, but in promoting absorption, allaying pain, and subduing
excitability of the peripheral structures, removing muscular
contractions, and probably modifying the local inflammatory processes.It appears also in some cases to improve the general health.The
constant current is generally the most useful, and should have an
intensity of about ten to fifteen milliamperes, and be applied daily
for ten or fifteen minutes.The positive pole, terminating in a large
flat moistened sponge, is applied to the spinal origin of the brachial
or lumbar plexus, according as the superior or inferior members suffer,
while the negative pole is immersed in a vessel of warm salt water in
which the hands or feet are placed.Some apply the negative electrode
to the joints and the positive to the limb higher up.[264] The faradic
current may also be employed on account of its action upon the muscles
and small vessels.In the advanced stage attended with marked
thickening of the articular and periarticular tissues, with
contractions of the muscles and greater or less impairment of movement,
the above measures are still our chief resources; but they may be
employed more vigorously.We have little fear now of lighting up
inflammation; we indeed desire to excite a more active circulation in
the part with a view of removing the congested state of the capillaries
and venules, so favorable to the development of fibroid growths.In
this stage especially vigorous active and passive movements of the
affected joints, and massage of the muscles which move them, and
gymnastics, are imperatively needed, and it is sometimes almost
marvellous what an amount of mobility and usefulness may thereby be
restored to apparently helplessly crippled and deformed articulations
and members.Persons who have not walked for years are frequently so
much improved as to be able to leave their sofa or bed, and with or
without crutches or mechanical aids walk about, while their abiding
pains depart, and this notwithstanding the permanent deformity of the
articular surfaces.(For the various mechanical appliances that are
sometimes necessary in this advanced stage works upon surgery may be
consulted.)[Footnote 264: Homolle, _lib.The hygienic measures to be observed are probably very much the {102}
same as those indicated in the article upon simple chronic articular
rheumatism--some of them at least--and are such as may be inferred from
a review of the exciting causes of rheumatoid arthritis.Be it
remembered also that acute and chronic articular rheumatism appear
amongst the causes of that disease.We are hardly justified in
promising arrest of the disease on removal to a warm, dry, and even
climate; yet wealthy patients need not be dissuaded from trying the
experiment.The use of flannel underclothing and the employment of
tepid or even moderately cool baths, followed by the use of the
flesh-brush or rough towel, are important means of protecting persons
predisposed to this disease.The ordinary hygienic laws adapted to
maintain a healthy state of all the functions, mental as well as
physical, are to be observed, for in this disease the influence of the
mind over the body is shown by the frequency with which rheumatoid
arthritis follows closely upon mental shocks, worry, etc.The diet, it is generally admitted, should be of a nutritious
character, yet plain and digestible, and, unless specially required to
meet certain indications, should not include heavy wines or fermented
liquors.However, Garrod affirms that uncomplicated rheumatoid
arthritis is not aggravated by the use of porter, ale, or sound wines;
and his rule is to give sufficient of these alcoholic beverages to
support the tone of the whole system, but not enough to excite the
circulation and thereby produce subsequent reaction.Finally, the above system of treatment must be persisted in year by
year with the object of securing arrest when cure has not been
effected.Gonorrhoeal Rheumatism, or Gonorrhoeal Arthritis.SYNONYMS.--Arthrite ou Arthropathie blennorrhagique,
Tripper-rheumatismus, Gonocele, Urethral Rheumatism, Urethral
Synovitis.ETIOLOGY.--As its name implies, the cause, par excellence, of the
disease is gonorrhoea, as was perhaps first indicated by Selle[265] and
Swediaur,[266] although, no doubt, an affection apparently identical is
rarely observed associated with non-contagious urethral discharge and
with the urethral irritation incident to catheterism and to stricture.I have seen it associated with a simple mucous urethral discharge in a
man of gouty habit, married and free from the suspicion of specific
infection.Such discharge has been attributed to gouty irritation, to
dietetic and venereal excesses, and to the contact of non-specific
vaginal secretion; and such origin is well established.More than one
observer has noticed a susceptibility to urethritis on the part of
persons who have had gonorrhoeal rheumatism.A gouty taint is
undoubtedly often present in urethral rheumatism.These non-gonorrhoeal
cases require more close investigation than they have received.[267]
Fournier has not met with them.[268]

[Footnote 265: Chr.Selle, _Medicina Clinica, oder Handbuch der
Medicin_, Berlin, 1781.][Footnote 266: Swediaur, _London Med.[Footnote 267: See Elliotson, "Non-contagious Urethral Rheum.," _Med.[Footnote 268: Fournier, _Nouv.et de Chir._, t. v. p.The stage of the gonorrhoea at which the articular affection may appear
varies very much.It frequently sets in from the sixth to the sixteenth
day of the discharge; it is common enough between the third and sixth
or twelfth weeks, and may be delayed as late as the twelfth month.There {103} is no constant relation between the severity of the
urethral inflammation and the frequency with which, or the time at
which, the articular symptoms arise; and these, once established,
appear to be largely independent of the state of the urethra.On the
advent of the joint affection the discharge usually continues as it
was, although it often abates somewhat.Fresh attacks of gonorrhoea,
even when very mild, often develop new invasions of the articular
affection, as though an idiosyncrasy existed.While the ordinary exciting causes of simple acute articular rheumatism
are not necessary to the production of gonorrhoeal rheumatism, they do
now and then act as adjuvants.Such are cold, fatigue, and injuries of
the joints, and a severe acute arthritis is not infrequently developed
during gonorrhoea under such circumstances.Other predisposing
influences probably exist, the absence of which in some measure
explains the infrequency of gonorrhoeal rheumatism as compared with the
prevalence of gonorrhoea.Besnier holds that constitutional rheumatism,
the arthritic habit, or l'heredite arthritique, is not infrequently
present in the victims of gonorrhoeal rheumatism as a predisposition;
Nolen[269] found an inherited rheumatic predisposition in 6 out of 88
cases, and that 4 others had had rheumatism before contracting
gonorrhoea; and Hutchinson maintains that it is the existence of the
arthritic diathesis which enables urethral inflammation to produce
gonorrhoeal rheumatism.He says: "From statistics that I have carefully
collected I have no hesitation in believing that the predisposing cause
of it usually is the inheritance of arthritic tendencies;" and adds,
"Very often the subject of gonorrhoeal rheumatism will give a family
history of gout."However, the disease often occurs in the absence of
any discoverable tendency, hereditary or acquired, to simple articular
rheumatism.On the other hand, persons have had one or several attacks
of gonorrhoea previously that did not give rise to rheumatism.Nolen's
table of 88 cases contains 12 instances of this kind.It is probable
that by reducing the resisting force of the organism, scrofula, the
so-called lymphatic diathesis, anaemia, and debility favor the
development of the disease.[Footnote 269: "Rheumatismus gonorrhoicus," _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.Gonorrhoeal rheumatism, like gonorrhoea, is proportionally as well as
actually much more frequent in men than in women (111 men, 7 women,
Nolen); and the greater proclivity of the former has been attributed to
the greater delicacy, sensibility, and complexity of the structures
involved in them than in women by gonorrhoea.MORBID ANATOMY.--The lesions of gonorrhoeal rheumatism in the early
stage resemble closely those of acute articular rheumatism; and it is
probable, for opportunities of ascertaining by actual dissection are
very rare, that the synovial membrane chiefly suffers.In more advanced
stages the joints contain serous fluid in which fibrinous flakes and
numerous leucocytes are found; the cartilages may be eroded and
softened; and in some protracted cases even the bones may participate
in the inflammation, and the changes found in polyarticular rheumatoid
arthritis may be developed.Ultimately fibrous adhesions, resulting in
ankylosis, may occur.Suppuration very rarely takes place, and it is
probable that in such cases pyaemia is added to gonorrhoeal arthritis.{104} SYMPTOMS.--Gonorrhoeal rheumatism may attack any of the joints;
it most commonly invades the larger at first, more especially the knee;
the ankle is next in order of frequency, and then succeeds the
shoulder, closely followed by the smaller joints of the hands and feet,
which are very seldom affected primarily and antecedently to the larger
joints.The temporo-maxillary, the sacro-iliac, the sterno-clavicular,
the intervertebral, do not escape gonorrhoeal rheumatism more than they
do rheumatoid or pyaemic arthritis.[270] The disease most frequently
invades several joints simultaneously or successively, but, soon
declining in many of them, it finally becomes localized in a few or
rarely in a single articulation.It is monoarticular from the first in
about 20 per cent.[Footnote 270: Vide Fournier, _Nouv.Prat._,
t. v. p.230: in 119 cases, knee, 83; ankle, 32; fingers and toes, 23;
hip, 16; wrist, 14; shoulder, 12; elbow, 11; temp.-maxillary, 6; etc.]Gonorrhoeal rheumatism presents several clinical forms: First,
Arthralgic: pains of greater or less severity, sometimes increased by
movement, but unaccompanied by redness or swelling, affect one or
frequently several joints; they wander from joint to joint, are liable
to exacerbations, and sometimes resist treatment.This form occurs
either in a chronic state in the course of an old gonorrhoea, and
without other rheumatic symptoms, or as an acute affection along with
other rheumatic symptoms, as in the second form.Second: Rheumatic: in
this the symptoms are almost identical with those of subacute articular
rheumatism or the more active forms of polyarticular rheumatoid
arthritis.Several joints are usually implicated, perhaps suddenly,
either quite spontaneously or after chill, exertion, or strain, or
rheumatic-like pains having been felt for two or three days in the
soles, ankles, or loins, the painful joints become moderately swollen,
tender, and hot; pyrexia supervenes with its early chilliness, malaise,
and anorexia; the temperature is not high; the profuse acid sweating
and the very acid, high- urine of acute articular rheumatism are
not observed or but transiently and to a very slight degree.In a few
days the moderate febrile disturbance subsides, but the local
inflammation persists, and extends to other joints, without promptly
leaving those first invaded; while lingering in all it often fixes
itself in one or more joints, and is apt to produce a copious and
rebellious intra-articular effusion.Still, it very rarely involves as
many articulations as primary acute rheumatism.The periarticular
tissues usually are more involved than in subacute or even chronic
primary articular rheumatism.Hence the considerable swelling from
oedema on the back of the hand or foot, around the knee, behind the
elbow, and the copious effusion into the adjoining bursae and tendinous
sheaths, and in the case more especially of the small joints of the
fingers and toes the fusiform enlargement and deformities resulting
from periostitis of the articular extremities.The pain, deformity,
pseudo-ankylosis, etc.Sandra went back to the kitchen.produced by these periarticular processes are
very persistent and rebellious, and, although they do usually disappear
at last, occasionally the inflammatory irritation extends to the
cartilaginous and osseous structures, and rheumatoid arthritis with its
permanent deformities results.It is perhaps chiefly in this
polyarticular form of gonorrhoeal rheumatism that cerebral, spinal,
cardiac, pleural, and ocular complications most frequently occur.{105}
In the Third form, or Acute Gonorrhoeal Arthritis, after two or three
days of pain wandering from joint to joint, a single articulation
suddenly, and frequently about the middle of the night, becomes the
seat of atrocious and abiding pain, followed in a few hours by very
considerable swelling of the articulation, not due chiefly to articular
effusion, but to periarticular oedema and enlargement of the bones.The
pain and tenderness are most severe at the line of junction of the
articular surface; the swelling begins at that point, and extends
widely, especially over the dorsal aspects of the wrists and elbows,
the joints most liable to this form, although any articulation may
suffer.The joint is also hot, it may be pale, but is usually more or
less red, and occasionally presents the appearances of severe
phlegmonous inflammation, and excites a sensation of
pseudo-fluctuation.[271] The affection may resolve, or fibrous
ankylosis may ensue, or very rarely suppurative destruction of the
articulation may occur, although such issue has been denied (by
Fournier, Rollet, Voelker).It is remarkable that, like the other forms
of gonorrhoeal rheumatism, the acute inflammatory form is not
accompanied by a general febrile disturbance at all proportionate to
the severity of the local disease.A Fourth form occurs as a Chronic
Hydrarthrosis.Although occasionally accompanying the polyarticular
variety, it is frequently observed independently, and is then often
monoarticular, and affects especially the knee; however, both knees
sometimes are involved.The ankle- and elbow-joints suffer much less
commonly than the knee.The effusion into the articulation takes place
insidiously, although rapidly producing considerable enlargement of and
fluctuation in the joint, without local heat, redness, or tenderness,
and often with but little or no pain or pyrexia.It is not as often
associated with inflammation of the tendinous sheaths and bursae or of
the eye as the polyarticular form, but it is apt to be very slow in
resolving, and may last for two or three months, a year, or several
years, and in scrofulous patients may degenerate into white swelling.The formation of pus in the joint is very rare.It occurred twice in 96
cases tabulated by Nolen; hydrarthrosis obtained 12 times; and serous
synovitis 64 times; chronic rheumatism or arthritis deformans 5 times;
tumor albus once.[272] A Fifth form of gonorrhoeal rheumatism, like
other varieties of so-called secondary rheumatism, involves
predominantly the tendons and tendinous sheaths, the bursae and
periosteum, sometimes without, but far more frequently in association
with, affection of the joints.Pain, sometimes severe and increased by
movement and pressure and aggravated at night, with local swelling and
tenderness, are the symptoms.In their fixity and persistence, their
tendency to relapse, and their chronic course these periarticular
affections resemble gonorrhoeal inflammation of the joints.Gonorrhoeal
bursitis is often severe enough to resemble phlegmon, but it does not
end in suppuration; it is most common in the bursae covering the
patella, the olecranon, and especially in that under the tendo Achillis
and the deep one covering the inferior tuberosity of the os calcis; but
any of the bursae may suffer from gonorrhoeal rheumatism.The
periosteum in the vicinity of the affected articulation and over the
most prominent parts of the bones is sometimes the seat of small
circumscribed firm nodes which {106} are painful and tender, and may
either resolve rapidly or very slowly (Fournier).[Footnote 271: _De l'Arthrite aigue d'origine blennorrhagique_, par le
Dr.Andre Felix Bieur, Paris, 1881.]Along chiefly with the third form of gonorrhoeal rheumatism, or
independently, the various muscles and nerves may be the seat of
myalgia and neuralgia.In the
same form are often met those ocular affections observed not
infrequently in rheumatoid arthritis and very rarely in acute articular
rheumatism--viz.conjunctivitis and iritis.Aqua capsulitis is more
common than the others, according to Fournier.The ocular affections
may precede, accompany, or alternate with the articular, and, not being
due to direct introduction of the urethral contagium into the eye, are
regarded as manifestations or localizations of gonorrhoeal rheumatism.The varieties of erythema sometimes present in primary acute articular
rheumatism have been observed in gonorrhoeal rheumatism.Much difference of opinion obtains as to whether inflammations of the
heart, lungs, and serous membranes occur as manifestations or
localizations of true gonorrhoeal rheumatism.Even those who, like
Besnier, contend for the rheumatic nature of gonorrhoeal rheumatism
admit that they are quite exceptional in that affection.Endocarditis
is probably more frequent than pericarditis, and the aortic are more
liable than the other valves to suffer.Gonorrhoeal endocarditis has
been observed without the articular affection, although it is
especially when several joints are involved and the pyrexia is well
marked in gonorrhoeal rheumatism that the above visceral complications
occur.While admitting that Morel,[273] Marty,[274] Pfuhl,[275] and
others have reported what appear to have been authentic cases of
gonorrhoeal endocarditis, I would remark that it must be almost
impossible at times to distinguish a polyarticular acute gonorrhoeal
rheumatism from ordinary acute articular rheumatism, and that in other
instances the possibility of pyaemia developing in gonorrhoea, and
producing both the articular and the visceral lesions, or the latter
only, cannot be denied.And the same remarks are applicable to the
cerebral and spinal disturbances that Vidart and others have recorded
as occurring in gonorrhoeal rheumatism.des Sciences Med._]

[Footnote 274: _Archives generales de Med._, Dec., 1876.][Footnote 275: _Deutsche Zeitschrift fur pract.The course, termination, duration, and prognosis need not be insisted
upon after what has gone before.Many
recover in four to eight weeks, many not for three to six months and
longer; relapses are of frequent occurrence; complete and tolerably
prompt recovery is not uncommon in first attacks and in young and
healthy subjects; rebellious persistency, and even deformity, with
impairment of the articular movements, and not infrequently even
fibrous ankylosis of one or many joints, sometimes including the
vertebral, may be observed.Indeed, the most formidable examples of
spondylitis are associated with gonorrhoeal rheumatism as its exciting
cause.[276] These unfavorable issues are most apt to follow repeated
attacks in unhealthy and especially scrofulous persons.Both rheumatoid
arthritis and strumous articular disease have appeared as sequels of
gonorrhoeal rheumatism.Life is not endangered, except in very rare
instances in which cardiac or cerebral {107} complications obtain; and
to stiffened enlarged joints the functions may often be restored by
efficient treatment.[Footnote 276: Brodfurst cites two such cases: Reynolds's _System of
Med._, i.So does Nolen in an elaborate article upon rheumatismus
gonorrhoicus in _Deutsches Archiv fur klin.I
had not seen it before this paper was written.]DIAGNOSIS.--In some instances no doubt what appears to be ordinary
gonorrhoeal rheumatism, owing to the coexistence of urethral discharge
and articular inflammation, is really pyaemic arthritis.The
intermediate link in the causation may be suppuration in the prostate
or its veins or in the testicle or the penis or in its dorsal vein, or
the urethral pus may undergo changes and become septic and be absorbed.In other instances it is highly probable that true primary acute
articular rheumatism sometimes occurs coincidentally with gonorrhoea.If in addition to the presence or recent existence of gonorrhoea the
case present several of the following features, gonorrhoeal rheumatism
may be said to exist: moderate or mild pyrexia and articular pain; the
number of joints attacked being few, with a tendency to concentration
in one, either from the first or secondarily; no migration from one
joint to another; no delitescence, but marked chronicity and indolence,
with a tendency to hydrarthrosis and to implication of the synovial
sheaths and bursae; an absence of cardiac complications; the frequent
and often early coincidence of special ophthalmic affections.TREATMENT.--The patient should be confined to bed, so as to secure rest
to the inflamed articulations, and when severe arthritis (third form)
exists an efficient splint is peremptorily required, and its
application is often followed by prompt relief to the pain.It should
be retained until not only all pain, but all tenderness on pressing the
articulation, has disappeared.In short, the principles and details of
local treatment suited to gonorrhoeal rheumatism are the same as those
recommended for rheumatoid arthritis, which it so closely resembles;
and the reader is referred to that article for information.Although
there is a greater proclivity to copious effusion into the joints in
gonorrhoeal rheumatism than in rheumatoid arthritis, there is less to
those deeper lesions which affect the bones, and complete recovery is
usually more certain and more prompt in the former than in the latter.Measures to prevent stiffness and even ankylosis of the articulations
are often an urgent indication.In the general treatment, also, almost
the same remedies are indicated as have been recommended for rheumatoid
arthritis.The salicylate of sodium, given freely, is sometimes
signally useful, more especially when several joints are acutely
inflamed.In the more chronic stages, when much articular effusion
exists, a prolonged course of potassium iodide is occasionally
beneficial.The local measures, however, simultaneously employed,
doubtless co-operate efficiently.Iron and quinia will frequently be
demanded by general debility, anaemia, and impaired nutrition; and the
same may be said of cod-liver oil, extract of malt, etc.The
circumstances under which the various baths are likely to be useful
have been mentioned in connection with the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis.The gonorrhoea should be treated in the same way that it ought to be if
no arthritis existed.The rest, the moderate diet, and even the
salicylate of sodium, favor its removal, but the frequent employment of
mild astringent injections should not be omitted.BY W. H. DRAPER, M.D.DEFINITION.--Gout, as a disease, in the traditional acceptation of the
term, is a specific arthritis, characterized by the deposit of the
salts of uric acid in the affected joints.Gout, as a diathesis, is a
blood crasis in which there is an accumulation in the blood serum of
the uric acid salts, the consequence either of the increased formation
or of the defective excretion of these products of proteid
metamorphosis.The manifold irritations of the different tissues, and
the accompanying subjective and objective symptoms provoked by this
dyscrasia, are termed gouty.SYNONYMS.--(_a_) _Eng._, Gout; _Lat._, Gutta; _Fr._, Goutte; _Sp._,
Gota; _Ger._, Gicht--derived from the nomenclature of humoral pathology
and descriptive of the distillation (goutte a goutte) of the poisonous
humor into the joints--arthritis uratica.(_b_) Gouty diathesis;
constitutional gout; irregular gout.CLASSIFICATION.--(_a_) Gout as a specific form of articular
inflammation is classified according to its location--cheiragra,
onagra, podagra, gonagra, etc.(_b_) Gout as a constitutional disease
is classified, 1st, according to the structures affected--_e.g._
articular gout; tegumentary gout, embracing mucous as well as cutaneous
affections of gouty origin; nervous gout; parenchymatous or visceral
gout; 2d, according to the degree of the inflammatory process--acute,
subacute, and chronic; 3d, according to certain irregularities
manifested in the development and progress of gouty lesions as
metastatic, retrocedent, and suppressed gout.This classification of
constitutional gout is based upon the well-recognized clinical
observation in the history of gouty persons and gouty families, that
the characteristic lesions of the joint-structures are often correlated
with lesions of the skin, mucous and serous membranes, vessels, nerves,
and parenchymatous organs, which are marked by the same blood dyscrasia
that exists in articular gout, and which are most successfully treated
by the same measures which experience has suggested in the management
of the arthritic disease.Musgrave in his work[1] treats of a great number of varieties of gout,
as follows: De arthritide anomala; de colica arthritica; de diarrhoea
arthritica; de dysenteria arthritica; de abscesse intestinorum
arthritica; de melancholia arthritica; de syncope arthritica; de
calculo renum arthritico; de asthmate arthritico; de catarrho, tussi,
et peripneumonia arthritica; de phthise arthritica; de angina
arthritica; de capito dolore et {109} vertigine arthritica; de
apoplexia arthritica; de paralysi arthritica; de doloribus in corpore
vagis, fixis; de ophthalmia, de erysipelate et achoribus arthriticis;
etc.[Footnote 1: _De Arthritide Anomala, sive Interna, Dissertatio_,
Geneva, 1715.]HISTORY.--The records of medicine furnish simple evidence of the
prevalence of gout in all ancient as well as in modern civilized
communities.Its origin in the perversion of physiological functions
was as clearly recognized by the prophets of the old testament of the
medical art as it is by the founders of the gospel of modern science.The refined processes of animal chemistry have simply revealed the
materies morbi which was foreshadowed in the "peccant matters" of the
humoralists, which were supposed to be distilled into the joints and
other structures, provoking inflammation and tophous deposits.This is
the most notable and interesting fact in the history of gout, that it
has from the earliest times been regarded as a specific form of
arthritis and dependent upon the circulation in the blood of peccant
matter.It was not, however, until the latter part of the eighteenth
century, when Murray Forbes, and a few years later Wollaston, called
attention to the fact that uric acid was the chief ingredient in
urinary calculi and in tophous deposits, that our knowledge of the
pathology of gout may be said to have had its beginning.The
demonstration by Garrod, in 1848, of the presence of lithate of soda in
the blood of gouty persons, also marks an era in the history of the
pathology of gout.While the humoralistic theory of gout has prevailed almost to the
exclusion of all others, it is historically interesting to note that
the views of the solidists, as represented by Cullen, who maintained
that "gout was an affection of the nervous system in which the primary
moving powers of the whole system are lodged," have been recently
revived and are attracting considerable attention.ETIOLOGY: PREDISPOSING CAUSES.--Heredity may be regarded as the most
prominent of the predisposing causes of gout.Statistics of arthritic
gout show this tendency in a varying but always large proportion of
cases.Scudamore observed it in nearly 60 per cent.of his cases;
Garrod, in 50 per cent.of his hospital cases and, in a much larger
proportion, in his private practice; Gairdner found it in 140 out of
156 cases.If all the manifestations of the gouty vice were taken into
consideration in determining the influence of heredity, it would
doubtless be shown in a still larger percentage of cases.It is generally supposed that there is a greater frequency of
inheritance from the male ancestors and in the male descendants.This
may be explained by the fact that men are more exposed to the other
predisposing and to the exciting causes of gout.My own experience
leads me to suspect that if we took into consideration the irregular
manifestations of this morbid inheritance, we should find it as
frequently in the female, both in the ascending and descending line; of
the greater frequency of acute articular gout, however, in the male,
there can be no question.While it is true that acute attacks are
comparatively rare in women, both before and after the menopause, it is
undeniable that the subacute and chronic forms of gouty arthritis are
by no means rare in them, both before and after the cessation of
menstruation.The Hippocratic proposition that women enjoy immunity
from gout by reason of the menstrual flux can hardly be entitled to
much consideration in view {110} of the fact that they are commonly
less exposed to the exciting causes of the disease, and that when they
subject themselves to the same vicious habits which entail the disease
in men they suffer like men.Statistics as to the age at which articular gout is most often
developed show that the larger proportion of cases occurs in the decade
from thirty or forty.It is rare before twenty, and the frequency
diminishes rapidly after sixty.Some well-authenticated cases have been
observed before puberty in children in whom the hereditary taint was
strongly developed.Gairdner claims to have seen several cases in
infants at the breast.Trousseau saw a case in a boy aged six, and
Garrod in a youth of sixteen.At the other extreme Garrod reports a
first attack at the age of eighty, and another in the ninetieth year.The cases at the extremes of age are certainly rare, and other causes
of arthritic inflammation might easily be invoked to explain them.It
is a significant fact that the largest proportion of attacks of acute
articular gout occurs after the period of complete development is ended
and before the period of degenerative changes has begun, when the
necessities of growth have ceased and food is required only for the
nutrition of the tissues, the maintenance of vital energies, and the
demands of work.Much stress was laid by the earlier writers on the effect of
temperament as a predisposing cause of gout.The vague ideas involved
in the classification of mankind according to temperament may be said
to have lost their influence in the scientific conceptions of modern
pathology.Gout is observed in persons exhibiting the most diverse
peculiarities in physical conformation and physical disposition.The
true interpretation of the facts in regard to the relations of
temperament to gout, so far as those relations exist, would seem to be
that the conditions which give rise to gout are responsible also for
the physical and moral idiosyncrasies of gouty subjects.A vicious hygiene may be regarded as one of the chief predisposing
causes of gout.The disease is essentially one of advanced
civilization, and is alike the product of the luxury and the misery
which a high civilization entails.It is a common error to suppose that
gout is the consequence only of luxurious living.If the essential
cause of the disease is the circulation of imperfectly oxidized plasma,
then there are two ways in which this defective oxidation may be
brought about: either there is an excess of food ingested beyond the
capacity of the individual, under the most favorable conditions, to
consume, or the conditions of oxidation may be so impaired that the
complete combustion of even a moderate supply of food is impossible.Perfect oxidation requires an even balance between the amount of food
ingested and the oxygen inhaled.A consideration of this axiom explains
several circumstances in the history of gout.As has been remarked, the
disease is rare during the period of growth and development, when the
processes of nutrition are active and the consumption of food in
excessive quantities is rendered possible by the large demands for the
needs of the growing body and for the development of active energy.It
is common in adult life when the processes of nutrition are less
active, when growth is complete, and when the supply of food must be
regulated according to the amount of energy to be developed.It must
also be observed that while the disease is most frequently caused by
excesses in the consumption of {111} food, it is also often the
consequence of an insufficient supply of pure air; hence we find it
often among those who cannot be accused of gluttony, but whose
occupations or poverty compel them to live and work in a vitiated
atmosphere.The influence of alcoholic liquors in the production of gouty dyscrasia
is generally acknowledged.There seems to be a striking difference,
however, in the effects of the distilled and fermented preparations of
alcohol in this respect.Gout is certainly more prevalent in countries
where large amounts of fermented liquors are used than in those where
distilled spirits are chiefly consumed.The disease is more prevalent,
for example, in England than in Scotland or Ireland, especially among
the lower classes; it is said also that it is rare in Russia and
Poland, where spirits are more exclusively used.There is a difference
also in the predisposing influence of the different varieties of
fermented liquors in the production of gouty dyscrasia.The heavier
wines, sherry, madeira, and port, are known to be more mischievous in
this respect than the lighter wines of France and Germany, though there
is abundant clinical evidence of the fact that even these wines, and
especially the richer clarets.Burgundies, and Rhine wines, frequently
give rise to acute gout and the gouty habit.There can be no question
as to the pernicious effects of the malt liquors as gout-producers.The
great frequency of gouty diseases particularly among the lower classes
who consume these beverages in large quantities is undeniable.This is
true especially of the stronger English and Scotch ales, and to a less
degree of the lighter English, American, and German beers.The effect
of cider and perry as gout-producers is also well recognized.It has
been observed in certain districts of England where cider is largely
consumed, and, though acute articular gout is said not to be a common
disease in New England, where cider has always been much used, there
can be no question that it often leads to the development of the
irregular forms of gout.As one of the forms of fermented alcoholic
beverages containing, in its fresh state especially, a large amount of
sugar, it favors the production of the acid dyspepsia which is a common
antecedent in the formation of a gouty dyscrasia.In 1854, Garrod called attention to the fact that a considerable
proportion of the gouty patients in hospital practice--at least 30 per
cent.--was represented by painters and other workers in lead.This
statement has since been confirmed by other observers, and the
association of the characteristic symptoms of this form of metallic
poisoning, such as the blue line on the gums, colic, and the different
forms of paralysis, with both articular and visceral gout, especially
the contracted kidney, is certainly frequent.The relation, however, of
saturnine poisoning to gout in this association is not easy to
determine, Garrod himself pointing out that while the women in the
lead-works frequently had the colic, they but rarely had gout.The
difference in susceptibility of different individuals to all forms of
metallic poisoning is well recognized.It is more strikingly observed
perhaps in mercurial and arsenical poisoning than in that of lead.It
is well known that the internal use of lead as an astringent in cases
of hemorrhage and intestinal catarrh is occasionally, though very
rarely, followed by the evidences of lead-poisoning.This difference in
susceptibility is perhaps explicable on the theory that persons
inclined to gout have less power in eliminating the {112} metal than
those who are not gouty, so that it is possible that plumbism is the
effect rather than the cause of gout, as has been commonly supposed.Tanquerel des Planches found none of those changes in the kidneys as
the result of plumbism such as are frequently met with in gout, and
Rosenstein, who was able to produce saturnine epilepsy in dogs, found
no renal changes to have occurred.Charcot and Gombault in recent
experiments of feeding guinea-pigs with lead found changes in the
kidneys similar to those produced by tying the ureters.EXCITING CAUSES.--Paroxysms of acute or subacute gouty inflammation of
the joints, skin, or mucous membranes, as well as the neuroses of gouty
origin, are excited by a variety of causes: errors in diet, both as to
quantity and as to specific articles; excesses in the use of fermented
liquors--even moderate indulgence, in persons with strong gouty
tendencies--are perhaps the most common exciting causes.Sudden changes
in temperature, and especially sudden changes in barometrical pressure,
sometimes excite and often aggravate the sufferings of gouty persons.Blows, contusions, and mechanical strain frequently determine arthritic
attacks; the large proportion of paroxysms affecting the
metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great toe is explained by the fact
that this joint is more exposed than any other to strain and injury.Finally, nervous exhaustion, from any cause, from overwork or sexual
excesses, from grief, anger, or shock, may provoke any of the
inflammatory or neurotic consequences of this disease.PATHOLOGY.--It would be impossible in the limits of this article to
review the many theories that have prevailed in regard to the pathology
of gout, or even to discuss fully those that may be said to divide
professional opinion at the present day.Since the discovery, by
Garrod, of the salts of uric acid in the blood-serum of gouty patients,
the humoral pathology of gout has certainly had the largest number of
adherents.The lithaemic pathology may be said to be based primarily upon the
chemical theory of digestion or food-transformation.This theory
proceeds upon the idea that every atom of albuminous or carbonaceous
food that enters the body, whether it goes to the construction of
tissue or is destined for the direct conversion of potential into
active energy, is finally eliminated, for the most part, as urea,
carbonic acid, and water.This transformation, of course, is supposed
to be effected by a process of oxidation, but neither the exact mode of
transformation nor the share which the different organs and tissues
take in its accomplishment can be said to be certainly known.Recent
investigations seem to indicate that the liver is chiefly concerned,
not only in the metamorphosis of the carbohydrates, but also in the
formation of urea, so that the arrest in the conversion of starches and
sugars which results in glycosuria, and the check in the metabolism of
the proteids which give rise to lithaemia, may both have their origin
in hepatic derangement.The not infrequent association of glycosuria
and lithaemia in the same patient, and the frequent alternation of gout
and saccharine diabetes in gouty families, are significant facts in
support of the common origin of these diseases.The purely chemical theory of gout and diabetes, that they are diseases
of suboxidation--a theory most ably advocated by Bence Jones[2]--has
{113} much to commend it from the valuable suggestions which it affords
in the clinical management of these maladies; but it must be
acknowledged that while a defective oxidation seems to be an essential
factor in the production of gout and diabetes, it is impossible to
reduce the process to the simplicity of a chemical equation.It cannot
be claimed that the complex chain of transformations which organic
chemistry has demonstrated in the destructive metamorphosis of albumen
and starch in the laboratory is represented in the vital chemistry of
the body.All that can be said in the present state of knowledge is,
that the metabolism of food is in its nature a chemical analysis,
modified and regulated by vital force, and resulting in the building up
of tissues and in the conversion of potential into active energy.Imperfect blood-elaboration must depend upon much besides a disturbance
of the balance between the amount of food ingested and the oxygen
inhaled, though this must unquestionably be an important factor in its
production.Heredity and the mysterious influence of the nervous system
complicate the problem of the malnutrition which leads to gout, in such
a way that while the general proposition may be maintained that gout is
a disease in which suboxidation occurs, it is not possible to affirm
whether suboxidation is the essence of the disease or only one of its
phenomena.[Footnote 2: _Lectures on Some of the Applications of Chemistry and
Mechanics to Pathology and Therapeutics_, H. Bence Jones, London,
1867.]It is probable, however, that the pathogenesis of the gouty dyscrasia
involves a much more complex process than the simple accumulation of
uric acid salts in the blood.Uric acid, like urea, is one of the
normal results of the metamorphosis of the albuminous foods and
tissues.In birds and reptiles it takes the place of urea as the final
issue of this metabolism.It has been supposed, as one atom of uric
acid can be split by oxidation into two atoms of urea and one of
mesoxalic acid, that uric acid was the penultimate of urea, the result
of a lower degree of oxidation.It is by no means certain, however,
that it is a necessary antecedent of urea.In birds, who consume by
their rapid breathing an enormous proportion of oxygen, as well as in
the slow-breathing reptilia, the nitrogenous excrements are in the form
of urates; and under such divergent conditions it is impossible to
explain the variations in the proteid metabolism by varying degrees of
oxidation.The only reason that can be assigned for the elimination of
the nitrogenous waste in some animals in the form of urea and in others
in that of urates is the teleological one that the urea is destined for
a fluid and the urates for a solid excretion.But apart from these physiological objections to the theory that uric
acid is necessarily the offending substance in gout, it is well known
that uric acid salts accumulate in the blood in febrile diseases, in
disorders of digestion, and in anaemia--notably in splenic anaemia--and
do not produce either the symptoms or lesions of gout.Todd maintained
that gout might occur without an excess of uric acid in the blood; and
it is certain that in the atonic and irregular forms of the disease
uric acid may not be found in excess in the blood or appear in excess
in the urine.Another significant circumstance in the history of gouty
persons tending to show that uric acid may be, after all, only an
epiphenomenon in the disease, and not its exciting cause, is that the
power of digesting farinaceous and saccharine foods in this disease is
markedly diminished.To such a degree is this true that sufferers from
the gouty dyscrasia are most {114} promptly relieved of their symptoms
of primary indigestion by restricting their diet very largely to
albuminous foods; and not only does such a diet diminish the dyspeptic
symptoms, but I am persuaded by a considerable experience that it is
one of the surest prophylactics against the recurrence of gouty
lesions.It is well known that the fermented preparations of alcohol
are among the most frequent exciting causes of acute gout, and cases
are by no means infrequent in which indulgence in sweet foods and in
fruits will provoke many of the well-recognized local lesions of the
disease.The explanation of this anomaly in the uric acid pathology of gout may
possibly be found in the suggestion of Garrod, that the deposition of
the urates is caused by their insolubility, and, as this insolubility
is increased by the diminished alkalinity of the serum, that the
evolution of the acids in the digestion of the carbohydrates so
diminishes the normal alkaline state of the blood that the uric acid
salts are more readily precipitated.But even if we accept this
explanation, the fact remains that as efficient factors in the
production of the gouty diathesis the carbonaceous foods may play as
large and perhaps a larger part than the albuminous foods.It would
seem, therefore, in view of the conflicting evidence in regard to the
theory of the uric acid origin of gout, that the chemical pathology of
this dyscrasia is still involved in considerable obscurity.The recent advances in neuropathology have revived of late years the
views of Cullen on the pathology of gout.Dyce Duckworth[3] has lately
advocated the theory that gout is a trophoneurosis.This theory grows
out of the recognition of the protean manifestations of this disease,
and especially of the neurotic element which is so prominently
developed in its evolution.The frequency of purely nervous symptoms in
gouty persons is a fact which is daily brought to the notice of those
who have much opportunity to study the disease.These symptoms may be
said to affect all the functions of the nervous system; among these we
may mention psychical disturbances, such as hypochondriasis and
hysteria; derangements of sensation, such as neuralgias and
dysaesthesias of every variety; and spasms of voluntary and involuntary
muscles, such as cramps, grinding of the teeth, asthma, and vesical
tenesmus.Another fact which arrests attention in the history of gouty
persons is the frequency with which purely nervous influences determine
attacks of gout; the effect of nervous exhaustion, whether provoked by
overwork or mental anxiety, or the more explosive discharges of
nerve-force in rage and great emotional excitement of any kind, is well
recognized as a frequent precursor of gouty lesions.The influence of
certain diseases of the nervous centres also, such as cerebro-spinal
meningitis, Pott's disease, and tabes dorsalis, in determining
arthropathies and lesions of the skin and mucous membranes, furnishes a
striking analogical argument in favor of the possible nervous origin of
the lesions in gout.The recognition of these facts, however, does not
necessarily militate against the commonly accepted humoral pathology of
gout.The healthy action of the nervous centres must depend primarily
upon a normal nutrition, and a normal nutrition depends on healthy
blood-elaboration.That perverted innervation may be an important
factor {115} in the development of malnutrition through the accident of
inheritance is doubtless true, but in the acquired disease it seems
more probable that the lithaemic condition is the primary source of
disturbed innervation.It may be that gouty lesions are determined as
reflex phenomena through the medium of the trophic centres--if such
centres there be--rather than by the direct irritation of the affected
tissues by the gouty blood; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that
nervous exhaustion from any cause may produce in these centres greater
reflex excitability.[4]

[Footnote 3: _Brit.Jour._, March 26, 1881.][Footnote 4: Edward Liveing, in his work _On Megrim, Sick Headache, and
Some Allied Disorders_, p.404, thus expresses his conviction as to the
neurotic theory of gout: "The view which is commonly entertained is,
that the excessive generation or retention of uric acid in the system,
which is regarded as the fundamental fact in the pathology of gout,
exerts a toxic influence upon the nervous centres, while the particular
character of the disorder is determined by the territory involved.This
limited operation of a cause so general in its nature is a real
obstacle to this view; on the other hand, there is much in the history
of gout--its hereditary character, limitation to particular ages and
sexes, periodicity, explosive character, sudden translations, and
remarkable metamorphic relations with nervous disorders--which seems to
stamp the malady as a pure neurosis; and even the fit itself, with its
sudden nocturnal invasion, the late Dr.Todd was accustomed to compare
to one of epilepsy or of asthma."]PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.--Blood-Changes.--Garrod's demonstration of the
excess of uric acid in the blood of gouty persons constitutes the chief
recognized haemic change in this disease.That this is a constant
change, and one that is essential to the existence of gout, cannot be
said to be proved.The presence of uric acid in the blood is not always
productive of gout, since it has often been found in the blood of
healthy persons, and its temporary excess during pyrexia, and
especially in the fevers and other morbid states in which spleen is
congested, has already been noted.The excess of uric acid, however, in
gouty blood may reach, according to Garrod, as much as 0.11 grain in
1000 grains of serum.It is probable that other excrementitious
substances exist in the blood in gout which bear a closer etiological
relation to this disease than uric acid, but they have not been
demonstrated.The other blood-changes which are noted by Garrod--the
diminished specific gravity of the serum from loss of albumen, the
diminished alkalinity, and the increase of the fibrin in the
inflammatory forms of the disease--are probably inconstant.In chronic
gout the objective signs of anaemia which are often present would
indicate a marked diminution in the red blood-corpuscles.The tissues which are the chief seat of gouty lesions are the
connective tissues.In the evolution of the disease the joints, where
the connective tissue is most dense and the least vascular, suffer
earliest; at a later period the connective tissue of the blood-vessels,
nerves, and viscera becomes subject to gouty changes.According to Garrod, the exudations in articular gout are rich in the
urates of soda, lime, magnesia, and ammonia; they also contain some
phosphate of lime and traces of organic matter.The watery portion is
absorbed and the salts are deposited in crystalline forms.The location
of these deposits varies: they are found on the synovial surfaces, in
the cartilage-cells, and in the intercellular substance; in the
tendons, ligaments, and bursae, and in the subcutaneous connective
tissue.The urate of soda occurs not on the free surface of the
cartilage, and replacing {116} the latter, as was formerly generally
supposed, but as an infiltration into the substance of that tissue; and
Garrod found that there is always a thin layer of unaffected cartilage
lying between the deposit and the free articular surface--an
observation which has been confirmed by Budd and quite recently by
Ebstein.[5]

[Footnote 5: W. Ebstein, _Die Natur und Behandlung der Gicht_,
Wiesbaden, 1882.]Very important are the recent investigations of the latter.After
making numerous observations on the cartilages and other affected
tissues of gouty subjects, besides studying the disease artificially
produced in fowls, he has shown that those portions of cartilage and
other tissues in which the deposit occurs are in a state of necrosis,
as is evident from the fact that when the urates are dissolved out by
warm water the area in which the deposit occurred, though apparently
normal to the eye, refuses to be stained with aniline dyes, and lies
plainly visible as a light spot in the midst of stained tissue.Since
the work of Weigert we know that this is a sure sign of that peculiar
form of death of a tissue to which the name of coagulation necrosis has
been given.Ebstein regards this necrosis as primary and the deposition
of the uratic salt as secondary.According to him, the urates
circulating in the blood give rise to necrosis in parts where the
circulation is sluggish (as the articular cartilages, the ears, and the
extremities generally), and where, consequently, they remain a greater
length of time in contact with the tissues.The necrotic portion has,
however, an acid reaction, which causes a deposition, from the soluble
neutral salt, of an acid urate in a crystalline form.Ebstein claims
that this necrotic area, in which there is deposited a crystalline
urate of soda, and around which there is a secondary inflammatory zone,
is characteristic solely of gout."I have never seen," he says, "in
gout a crystalline deposit of urates occurring in normal tissue."In addition to these so-called specific changes we find a hyperplasia
of the connective tissue in the fibrous structures of the affected
joints.The thickening thus induced, with the contraction of the new
tissue and the atrophic changes resulting from pressure and disuse, are
the causes of the deformities, subluxations, and impaired movements of
gouty joints.Occasionally, the local irritation provoked by the
pressure of the tophous deposits results in abscesses from which a
mixture of pus and pasty urates may be discharged.These abscesses in
feeble and anaemic subjects are sometimes difficult to heal.More
frequently the skin undergoes gradual absorption and the chalk-like
deposits are exposed.The frequency with which the metatarso-phalangeal joint of the great
toes is affected in gouty persons has always been noted.In Scudamore's
tables the proportion of the first attacks in this joint was 72 per
cent., and in 66 per cent.one or both great joints were affected to
the exclusion of other joints.This frequency is due to the fact that
this joint is the most vulnerable one in the body, bearing as it does
the weight of the body and being exposed to most frequent shock.The
phalangeal joints of the hands and the wrist-joints are also often the
seat of acute gout, though these joints are more frequently affected by
the subacute form of the disease.The larger joints may also be the
seat of true gouty inflammation; indeed, no joint, not even the
intervertebral, can be said to enjoy immunity, and the hip and shoulder
are occasionally attacked to {117} the exclusion of others.The
cartilages of the ear and the arytenoid cartilages are sometimes the
seat of gouty deposits.The great frequency of arterial sclerosis, and the subsequent fatty and
chalky metamorphosis in persons who have suffered from chronic gout,
are well recognized.Next to syphilis, gout seems to be the most common
cause of these arterial changes.The influence of these lesions in the
arteries and capillaries in determining cardiac hypertrophy and
cerebral hemorrhage is often seen in the accidents which terminate the
lives of gouty patients.In the heart a gouty endocarditis is of not uncommon occurrence,
according to Ebstein, who cites Lancereaux as having found uric acid in
concretions on the valves.Garrod, however, after examining a number of
cases in which cardiac disease existed with gout, states that in his
opinion the valvular changes are not due to a gouty deposit, he never
having been able to demonstrate the presence of uric acid in them.Some years ago Sir James Paget called attention to the frequency of
adhesive phlebitis as a gouty lesion.This is observed in connection
with articular gout, but may also occur independently of joint-lesion.It is observed most frequently in the lower limbs, is generally
symmetrical, and shows a disposition to metastasis.Neuritis and sclerotic lesions of the nerve-centres are not uncommon in
the history of acquired and inherited gout.The neuralgias and other
temporary dysaesthesias which constitute a considerable category in the
symptoms of gouty persons are doubtless due to transient central and
peripheral lesions.The so-called gouty kidney is the most striking illustration of the
effect of the gouty dyscrasia in the production of a characteristic
visceral lesion.The changes which occur in the kidney as a result of
gout are--a contraction of the organ, the result of interstitial
inflammatory processes, and a deposition of uratic salts, occurring
mainly in the papillary portion.The views as to the exact locality
where these deposits occur still differ considerably.Garrod is of
opinion that it occurs in the fibrous interstitial tissue.Virchow, on
the other hand, regards the lumen of the tubuli as the seat of the
deposit, and in this he is supported by Charcot and Cornil and Ranvier,
Lancereaux and Wagner.Dickinson inclines to the view of Garrod, and
believes that it is the deposition of the urates in the interstitial
tissue which gives rise to the chronic inflammation which results in
cirrhosis of the kidney--the granular kidney of gout.Ebstein seems to
think that the interstitial connective tissue, having previously
undergone a state of necrosis, as in cartilage and other connective
tissues, is the seat of the deposit.As in cartilage, he regards this
necrotic state as typical of gouty deposits.About the necrotic area in
which the deposit has occurred a secondary inflammation takes place,
leading ultimately to contraction of the new fibrous tissue formed.He
calls attention to the fact that (1) the kidneys may be perfectly sound
in gout; (2) the kidneys may be the seat of chronic interstitial
inflammatory changes, with cirrhosis, without any urate deposits of any
kind being demonstrable; (3) there may be chronic interstitial
nephritis, with crystallized urates in the urinary tubules.As regards changes in the liver, few satisfactory accounts exist.{118}
Portal originally called attention to the fact that in gout and
rheumatism indurations of the liver caused by the deposit of a
phosphatic earth occurred, and Charcot has recently referred to the
fact.Ebstein cites a case in which in a gouty patient he was able to
make a diagnosis of moderate hypertrophic hepatic cirrhosis, but so far
he had not been able to confirm it by post-mortem examination.[6]

[Footnote 6: Gout in Animals.--Of the occurrence of gout in animals not
many reliable reports exist; Ebstein has collected a few.Thus, he
cites a case where in an old hunting-dog uratic concretions were found
in the articular ligaments and in the periosteum of the epiphyses of
many joints, but especially those connecting the ribs with their
cartilages.In the toes of falcons and of parrots kept in confinement
deposits of urates have been observed, and in an alligator dying in
captivity deposits were found in the muscles as well as the joints
which consisted of free uric acid together with sodium urate.Experimentally, Ebstein was able to produce gouty lesions having all
the characteristics of those occurring spontaneously in man by
injecting subcutaneously small quantities of the neutral chromate of
potash into the blood of cocks for a considerable period of time.By
this method changes in the epithelial elements of the kidney were
produced, preventing the elimination of the urates from the blood and
causing their consequent accumulation in the system.He obtained in
this way typical deposits of urates in the joints, tendons, muscular
sheaths, heart, and other organs, while the birds emaciated and finally
died.But these experiments, which are extremely valuable and
interesting, still need confirmation.The experiment of tying the ureters of fowls is an old one.Galvani who
was perhaps the first to perform it, employed it in his investigations
on the kidney, and since then Zalesky, Pawlinoff, Von Schroeder,
Colosanti, and others have made use of it in their experimented studies
on the site of origin of uric acid.As a result of this operation
deposits of urates occur in various organs.Ebstein, however, does not
regard them as analogous to the gouty deposit in human beings, as they
lack the feature of necrosis, which, as mentioned above, he considers
as alone characteristic of the true gouty lesion.]SYMPTOMATOLOGY.--The development of true gouty lesions, whether of the
acute or subacute form, is usually preceded by a period, more or less
protracted, in which characteristic derangements of the health present
themselves.These derangements may be conveniently classified as
disturbances of primary digestion and as manifestations of
malnutrition.The disturbances of primary digestion are repeated attacks of flatulent
dyspepsia, with pyrosis, colicky pains, alternate constipation and
diarrhoea, and a scanty, high-, and heavy urine with uratic
sediments.This dyspepsia may be accompanied with a variety of reflex
nervous symptoms, such as pain in the nape of the neck and occiput,
insomnia, palpitation, sighing respiration, singultus, and nausea.These symptoms are commonly described as due to biliousness, and are
provoked by excesses in diet, and not unfrequently by moderate
indulgence in certain common articles of food, such as sweets, fruits,
farinaceous foods, and the fermented preparations of alcohol.Derangements of nutrition are shown by a disposition to erythematous
and catarrhal affections of the skin and mucous membranes, to
affections of the sebaceous glands, and to premature falling of the
hair.There is often a more or less marked tendency to obesity.Accompanying these derangements there may be a loss of energy, both
physical and mental, manifesting itself in indolence and fatigue on
slight exertion, in irritability of temper, with diminished
intellectual activity and hypochondriasis.Neither the primary
indigestion nor the nutritive derangements invariably precede the
development of acute gouty lesions, nor are they necessarily followed
when they exist by the articular signs {119} of gout; but they are so
commonly associated with the evolution of what are regarded as the
specific lesions of gout that they may fairly be described as
constituting its prodromal period.ACUTE ARTICULAR GOUT.--A typical attack of acute gout is usually
sudden.It seizes its victim without warning, and often rouses him from
sleep with a vicious agonizing pain in the joint assailed.Examination
will reveal a slight redness, heat, and puffiness of the part affected
altogether disproportioned to the intensity of the pain; the tenderness
is exquisite, and the torture is often aggravated by the occurrence of
reflex spasms of neighboring muscles.There is usually moderate fever,
and if the surface be exposed there may be a chill.Sleep is impossible
and the restlessness uncontrollable.As the morning advances slight
perspiration occurs, and sleep may become possible.With the abatement
of pain there is coincident increase in the signs of inflammation: the
joint swells, the skin becomes red and oedematous around the joint, and
the superficial veins are distended.But, though the pain subsides with
the occurrence of swelling, and usually in proportion to its degree,
the tenderness and pain on any attempt to move the joint continue to be
extreme.The day is passed in comparative ease, but the evening
generally brings an exacerbation of pain and fever, and the night
another paroxysm of agony--not as severe as the first, but severe
enough to make the daylight a benison.The progress of the disease
after the second day, provided it is confined to one joint, is usually
marked by a steady and regular decline in the severity of the symptoms.If the attack is confined to a single joint, a week may elapse before
the inflammatory signs subside, and it may be a fortnight before
pressure can be borne or the mobility of the joint is restored.Occasionally the sufferings of an acute attack of gout may be
protracted by successive seizures for several weeks.The fever during
the attack is distinctly remittent, the evening exacerbation rarely
exceeding 103 degrees F.

The urinary symptoms before, during, and after an acute paroxysm of
gout are interesting and important in their bearing upon the uric-acid
theory of the disease.Garrod's statements upon this point are
generally accepted, and have been confirmed by other observers.He says
that previous to the attack the amount of uric acid in the urine is
below the average--that during the paroxysm the proportion grows
smaller, and only rises to the normal standard with the termination of
the seizure.The reaction of the urine is strongly acid during the
paroxysm.This is due probably to the increased excretion of acid
phosphates.The quantity of the urine is generally diminished, the
specific gravity increased, and the color deepened.Attacks of acute gout are generally followed by improved health and
capacity for physical and mental work and enjoyment.The blood seems to
be purified, the processes of digestion and assimilation are once more
normally performed, the equilibrium of the nervous centres is restored,
and the evolution of all the vital energies proceeds with ease and
vigor.This state of well-being may continue for a year or two years,
or even a longer period, after the first attack, the immunity varying
according to the intensity of the inheritance or the habits of life.The subsequent attacks are apt to occur at increasingly shorter
intervals, and, as a rule, the acuteness of them tends to diminish.Gradually the dyscrasia becomes more {120} profound, and the
constitutional symptoms and structural changes which belong to the
atonic and irregular forms of the disease are developed.ATONIC GOUT.--Though subacute, irregular, or atonic gout is often the
sequence of repeated attacks of the acute disease, it is not
necessarily preceded by them, nor is acute gout invariably followed by
a marked gouty dyscrasia.It is not uncommon for a well-characterized
gouty habit to exist, manifesting itself by many and varied gouty
phenomena, without the occurrence of any acute lesions, and repeated
attacks of acute articular gout may occur without the development of
the progressive impairment of health and the tissue-changes which
distinguish the chronic malady.The recognition of this fact is
important, inasmuch as the occurrence of acute gout is commonly
regarded as an essential element in the diagnosis of the gouty
dyscrasia.Acute articular attacks, as already noted, are very rare in
women, in whom the subacute and irregular forms of the disease are by
no means infrequent.So far as acute articular gout is of value in the
diagnosis of the constitutional vice, it is perhaps as significant if
established in the history of a near relative as in the individual in
whom the disease is suspected.The general symptoms of atonic gout--or, as it may more properly be
called, the gouty dyscrasia--are similar to those which sometimes
precede the development of the acute form.The difference lies in their
persistence, in the subacute character of the local lesions, and in the
absence of the relief to the constitutional symptoms which follows
acute attacks.The dyspeptic symptoms are perhaps the most pronounced and uniform in
the history of the evolution of chronic gout.These symptoms have been
already described, but the fact which seems especially to distinguish
them is that they are chiefly provoked by the acid fermentation of the
carbohydric elements of the food, the sugar and starches, and
especially by the fermented preparations of alcohol; the ability to
digest these articles of diet appears to be deficient in the gouty
dyspeptic.The changes in the urine in the gouty dyscrasia are especially
important.In the formative stages of the gouty vice the amount of
urine may not vary much from the normal quantity, but the proportion of
solid constituents, especially of the urea, is increased, so that the
specific gravity may rise to 1.030 or 1.035.The acid reaction is
intensified by the excess of the acid urates and phosphates upon which
the normal acidity depends.Sometimes crystalline deposits of uric
acid, urates, and oxalates take place in the tubuli of the kidney and
in the bladder, and lead to the nephritic and vesical irritations which
are often the source of much inconvenience and pain.Where the urine is
free from these crystalline constituents as it comes from the bladder
it may deposit them within a few hours after its passage.At a later
stage in the development of the gouty dyscrasia the quantity and
quality of the urine undergo marked changes.The quantity is increased;
the color is pale, partly in consequence of dilution and partly through
a diminution in the amount of coloring-matter.The quantity may be so
considerable as to constitute a polyuria.The reaction is neutral or
only feebly acid; crystalline sediments of uric acid and calcium
oxalate may occasionally appear, and the specific gravity may be so low
as to indicate not only a relative but an absolute diminution in the
daily excretion of urinary solids.Traces of albumen and of sugar are
not infrequently observed.{121} The articular symptoms of chronic gout are subacute.They affect
the joints, as a rule, which are most exposed to strain and injury, and
hence are most common in the hands and feet, but they may involve the
knee and the hips, the elbow and the shoulder, and even the
intervertebral joints.The pain is less severe, because the tension is
never so considerable; the tenderness is often a source of great
discomfort; the swelling varies with the acuteness of the inflammatory
process, the joints being more or less permanently enlarged by
hypertrophic changes affecting the articular structures and by tophous
deposits.The deformities are increased by ankylosis, by contractions,
by absorption of the cartilages, by partial luxations, and by the
atrophy of disused muscles.Crepitations are often observed in the
affected joints.Exacerbations of the local symptoms are often provoked
by movements, by imprudence in diet, by changes in temperature or in
barometric and hygrometric conditions, and not infrequently by
psychical disturbances.The frequency with which tegumentary affections, mucous as well as
cutaneous, are observed as correlative phenomena of arthritic lesions
in gouty persons and in gouty families justifies the inference that the
same lithaemic vice which determines articular inflammations is often
responsible for derangements of nutrition in the skin and mucous
membranes.The French school of dermatology, which has always
maintained the humoral origin of many cutaneous diseases, has long
recognized the arthritic nature of a large class of affections of the
skin.Bazin[7] has given the most precise description of the
arthritides, as he terms them.He insists upon certain functional
derangements of the skin as characteristic of the gouty diathesis, such
as excessive perspiration, especially in certain regions, as the head,
the axillae, the hands and feet, and the sexual organs, and also
affections of the sebaceous glands, causing the different forms of
seborrhoea and the premature falling of the hair.He notes the
liability in gouty persons to certain neurotic affections, such as
pruritus, general or localized, about the arms and genital organs.Erythematous affections, especially urticaria, erythema nodosum, and
the fugitive erythema which occurs about the face, causing sudden and
evanescent swelling of the eyelids, cheeks, lips, and even the tongue
and soft palate, are recognized by him and other observers as arthritic
in their origin.Among the erythemata which are observed in gouty
persons the peliosis rheumatica should be mentioned.[Footnote 7: _Affections generiques de la Peau_, Paris, 1862.]The more persistent inflammatory lesions of the skin, such as eczema
and psoriasis, which are characterized by long-continued hyperaemia
with hyperplasia, are now recognized as among the possible
transformations of gout.They are certainly often observed alternating
with arthritic lesions, and associated with all the characteristic
derangements of nutrition which belong to the gouty habit.The
frequency of the various forms of acne, the inflammatory, as well as
those which result from excessive function of the glands, in persons
having a strong gouty inheritance, is recognized by many
dermatologists.I have noticed these lesions especially in young women
belonging to gouty families.They are generally accompanied by marked
dyspeptic symptoms, and not infrequently by neurotic derangements.Garrod, in a paper read at the International Medical Congress in 1881
{122} on "Eczema and Albuminuria in Relation to Gout," affirms that
each year strengthens his conviction that gout and eczema are most
closely allied.Since his attention was first called to this relation
in 1860, he has found a gradually increasing percentage of eczema in
the cases of gout that have come under his observation.Dividing all
the cases from 1860 to 1881 into ten groups, he found the percentage
rose from 10 in the first group to 47 in the tenth.He accounts for
this rapid increase in the percentage in the fact that in the first few
years the eczema was only observed when it was very patent; during the
past two or three years he has had made more careful inquiries as to
the presence of eczema or other skin eruption in every case of gout,
and by these means has frequently discovered its presence when it might
otherwise have been overlooked.Garrod believes that eczema is the
special skin-lesion of gouty subjects, and does not regard psoriasis as
having anything more than an accidental connection with gout.He admits
that the latter is often associated with rheumatoid arthritis.It must
be remembered, however, that Garrod does not admit that gout ever
exists without lithatic deposits.In regard to the location of gouty eczema, it appears to affect by
preference the more tender and vascular regions of the skin.The
eyelids, ears, the scalp, and back of the neck, the fingers and toes,
particularly the dorsal and lateral surfaces, and in old people the
legs, are especially liable to be attacked.The subjective symptoms of
gouty eczema are often the source of great suffering; the burning and
itching are sometimes intolerable.This is especially true of persons
of highly neurotic constitution.It is not possible to affirm that there are lesions of the mucous
membranes which are strictly analogous in their transient character to
the erythematous affections of the skin, but it is not unreasonable to
suppose that many of the temporary disturbances of indigestion to which
gouty patients are subject are caused by an evanescent hyperaemia
corresponding to the vaso-motor derangements which are observed in the
external integument.In regard, however, to the more persistent
catarrhal lesions, there can be no question as to their analogy with
those which affect the skin.The continuity of these lesions at the
orifices of the mucous tracts, and the frequent association of external
eczemas with catarrhs of mucous membranes, are facts of common
experience.Greenhow[8] of London first called attention to the
frequency with which chronic bronchitis is associated with the gouty
dyscrasia.In an analysis of 96 cases of chronic bronchitis he elicited
the fact that in 34 out of the 96 a distinct gouty history attached
either to the patients themselves or to some of their immediate
relatives.In 14 of the cases the patients were subject to attacks of
acute regular gout as well as to bronchitis.He also noted the
association in a number of cases of bronchitis and psoriasis with
gravel and gout.My own experience confirms these observations, and
also the alternations of catarrhal and parenchymatous tonsillitis, of
pharyngeal and laryngeal catarrh, and of asthma and chronic bronchitis,
with the more common manifestations of regular and irregular gout.[Footnote 8: _On Chronic Bronchitis_, E. Headlam Greenhow, M.D.,
London, 1869.]The occurrence of subacute gastro-duodenal and intestinal catarrhs
{123} with hemorrhoidal complications is even more common that the
catarrhal affections of the respiratory tract.The lesion, in fact,
which gives rise to the manifold dyspeptic symptoms in gouty subjects
is doubtless a catarrhal one.The genito-urinary tract exhibits also the tendency to catarrhal
affections in sufferers from the gouty dyscrasia.It is certain that
gouty persons are especially liable to vesical catarrh, and it is
generally admitted that rheumatic and gouty persons are particularly
susceptible to gonorrhoea.My own experience leads me to suspect that
chronic urethral discharge resulting from acute urethritis is more
common in rheumatic persons than in those not having this taint.The
etiological relations of gonorrhoeal rheumatism and kerato-iritis are
still involved in obscurity, though I am inclined to believe that a
careful examination of the personal and family history in cases of
these diseases would establish the opinion that has been maintained as
to their gouty origin.The presence of albumen in the urine of persons suffering from acute
gout is occasionally observed.Under these circumstances it is
transient, and has probably no more significance than is usually
attached to this symptom in the course of any acute febrile disease.In
chronic gout it is by no means infrequently observed as a more or less
persistent symptom.It is associated under these circumstances with a
copious discharge of urine of pale color and low density, and with the
general signs of what Rayer first described as the nephrite goutteuse.The importance of this symptom is very great when we consider the
insidious development of this form of disease and the difficulty of its
early diagnosis.Recent investigations point to the value of the
changes in the urine in the progress of the gouty dyscrasia as bearing
upon this question.It has already been noted that in the early history
of gouty persons the urine is often scanty, high-, excessively
acid, of high specific gravity, occasionally albuminous and saccharine,
and frequently depositing sediments of urates and calcium oxalate.McBride of New York[9] has recently called attention to this condition
of the urine and its association with high arterial tension as the
functional stage of the granular kidney--as the stage, that is to say,
during which the necessity of eliminating large amounts of imperfectly
oxidized nitrogenous material maintains a constant state of renal
hyperaemia, which finally induces the changes in the tubular and
intertubular structures which constitute the anatomical features of
this form of disease.[Footnote 9: _The Early Diagnosis of Chronic Bright's Disease_, T. A.
McBride, M.D., New York, 1882.]The occasional presence of sugar in the urine of gouty persons has
already been noted.I have repeatedly observed this symptom in the
urine of gouty dyspepsia.It occurs more commonly in obese subjects,
and is usually intermittent and easily controlled by dietetic
restrictions.In these cases it is not necessarily associated with a
very large amount of urine.In chronic gout and in connection with the
granular kidney a more serious form of glycosuria is occasionally
observed.Under these circumstances it increases largely the polyuria
which is characteristic of gouty nephritis, and is sometimes overlooked
because it occurs in a urine of a low density, often not more than
1.010.It is not controlled by diet {124} to the same extent that it is
in the cases previously described, and is in my experience a prognostic
sign of bad import.Some of the most distressing symptoms to which gouty persons are
especially liable are those connected with the passage of gravel from
the kidney to the bladder.Where gravel alone passes, it may cause
little uneasiness, and the fact is only recognized through the
discovery of blood in the urine in connection with uric acid or calcium
oxalate crystals.When, however, the sand forms concretions in the
pelvis of the kidney, their dislodgment and passage through the ureter
are accompanied by the well-known agonies of renal colic.Dysuria is a symptom from which gouty persons often experience much
inconvenience and suffering.It is usually associated with extremely
acid urine of high density containing crystalline sediments.It may
manifest itself only in frequent and painful micturition, or it may be
associated with such a degree of vesical tenesmus as to cause retention
and necessitate the use of the catheter.DIAGNOSIS.--If the term gout be restricted to that form of arthritis in
which an excess of urates is found in the blood with tophous deposits
in the affected joints, the cartilages of the ear and nose, and in the
subcutaneous connective tissue, then the diagnosis of this disease is a
simple one.It is a disease with a pathognomonic sign.But if the
pathology of gout consists rather in a more complex morbid condition of
the blood, of which an excess of urates in the serum is only one of a
number of phenomena, and not necessarily the sole and essential cause
of the local lesions, then the question of diagnosis involves a
consideration of all the correlated morbid conditions which are so
frequently associated in gouty persons and gouty families as to justify
the inference that they have a common origin in a perverted nutrition,
the essential nature of which is imperfectly understood.The very existence of the terms gouty rheumatism and rheumatic gout
which are in common use shows that what is regarded by many excellent
authorities as the confounding of distinct entities must have some
foundation in clinical experience.If we consider gout, in its
strictest pathological sense, acute inflammatory rheumatism, rheumatoid
arthritis, or gouty rheumatism, and senile arthritis or the arthritis
deformans and gonorrhoeal rheumatism as separate and distinct diseases,
we shall find ourselves compelled to ignore certain common clinical
facts which indicate a bond of union between them.Heredity, for
example, is common to them all, and more than this, there appears to be
a tendency to a differentiation of the taint in families.It is well
known, for instance, that the children of gouty parents are especially
liable to acute rheumatism, and acute rheumatism in youth is often
followed by gout in later years.It is also a fact of common experience
that while the men in gouty families are the victims of true gout, the
women are apt to be the subjects of rheumatoid arthritis.The arthritis
deformans which develops with the degenerations of advancing years is
not infrequently associated with a family history of genuine gout.Gonorrhoeal rheumatism also, according to the experience of many
trustworthy observers, often recognizes an inheritance to gouty
lesions.But it is not alone in heredity and the differentiation of the
type of the disease in families that the unity of these affections
displays itself.The same disturbances of digestion which {125}
characterize the history of true gout are observed in those who are
liable to acute rheumatism, to rheumatoid arthritis, and to arthritis
deformans.It is true that excesses in food and fermented liquors do
not determine, as in gout, attacks of acute rheumatism nor of the
chronic forms of arthritis, for these latter diseases are commonly due
to causes operating upon the nervous system, as exposure to cold and
dampness or to physical or emotional shock of some kind; still, there
is in the subjects of these diseases a more or less marked tendency to
the same dyspeptic disorders, and especially to the diminished capacity
in digesting the carbohydrates, which the subjects of true gout
exhibit.In the diagnosis of gout, therefore, it would seem that the
question of differentiating this disease from those which simulate it
is not one in which we are called upon to distinguish one morbid entity
from another, as typhus from typhoid fever or syphilis from cancer, but
rather to determine, first, the presence of a recognized constitutional
vice; and, secondly, to differentiate the variety of the lesions by
which this vice manifests itself.In the diagnosis of the gouty dyscrasia the first point to determine is
that of heredity.This requires a careful inquiry into collateral as
well as direct descent, and does not necessarily involve the discovery
of arthritic diseases in the ancestors, though these are doubtless the
most striking and trustworthy proofs; but the tradition in the family
of persistent dyspepsia, or what is commonly called biliousness, of
chronic catarrhal affections of the skin and mucous membranes, and of
the chronic forms of renal disease, are significant indications of this
dyscrasia.In the personal history the evidences of the lithaemic
tendency, as indicated by the characteristic dyspeptic symptoms which
have been described, and especially by the feeble capacity for the
digestion of carbohydrates, are of great diagnostic value.The diagnosis of gouty joint-lesions, whether acute or chronic, depends
partly upon the determination of the gouty dyscrasia, and partly upon
the differential distinctions which separate gouty inflammations from
acute rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, and from the arthropathies
which result from traumatism and from lesions of nerves and
nerve-centres.Gouty arthritis may be distinguished from acute rheumatism by the fact
that it is more often hereditary--that it occurs in older subjects,
attacking generally the smaller joints, and, as a rule, in the acute
form, localizing itself in one or two joints.It is also noteworthy
that the constitutional symptoms are not as severe as in rheumatism.Gout deforms the joints, while acute rheumatism leaves no traces of the
inflammatory process.In addition to these distinctions there is,
according to Garrod, the crucial test of an excess of urates in the
blood-serum.From rheumatoid arthritis or rheumatic gout, gout in its acute and
regular form is distinguished by the more acute local and
constitutional symptoms.Gout is periodical in its attacks, while
rheumatoid arthritis is progressive.It attacks the smaller joints or
those most exposed to strain, while rheumatoid arthritis occurs in the
large as well as the small joints, and appears to be more independent
of traumatism as an exciting cause.Gout is more common in men,
rheumatoid arthritis in women.According to Garrod and other excellent
authorities, deposits of urates are never found in the joints in
rheumatoid arthritis, and there is no excess {126} of urates in the
blood.Ulcerations of
cartilages, contractions of tendons, atrophies of muscles with
subluxations of joints, are more common in rheumatoid arthritis than in
gout.While these local distinctions are undeniable, it is proper to observe
that in rheumatoid arthritis the constitutional symptoms of the gouty
dyscrasia, especially the dyspeptic derangements and the nervous
disturbances, are often well marked; and it should also be noted that
the principal distinction, the absence of urates in the blood and in
the diseased joints, is one that is based on the exclusive theory that
uric acid is the materies morbi of true gout.If, as is still
maintained by some excellent authorities, uric acid is not essential to
gout, then it must be confessed that the other distinctions are purely
lesional, and that the common constitutional symptoms suggest that
these diseases are divergent branches of a single trunk.Gouty arthritis is not always easily distinguishable from traumatic
inflammation of the joints, inasmuch as traumatism plays so important a
part as an exciting cause of gouty attacks.The history of previous
seizures and the presence of predisposing causes of gout are the points
upon which the determination of the gouty nature of the inflammation
would depend.A termination in suppuration would exclude the idea of
the gouty nature of an arthritis.With the arthropathies of purely nervous origin, such as occur in
paralyzed limbs, in Pott's disease, and in tabes dorsalis, gout can
hardly be confounded, although the arthritic complications in these
diseases have been used to illustrate the neurotic theory of both gout
and rheumatism.The diagnosis of irregular gout--_i.e._ of gouty affections of the skin
and mucous membranes, of the structures of the eye, and of the
parenchymatous organs--must be based more upon the hereditary history
and upon the correlated phenomena recognized in the personal history
than upon any specific character in the lesions themselves.In the
gouty form of nephritis there are, it is true, in the urinary symptoms,
in the anaemia, in the arterial fibrosis, and in the cardiac
hypertrophy, diagnostic signs of great value.PROGNOSIS.--Acute, regular, articular gout is probably never a fatal
disease where it occurs in a robust person without visceral
complications.In rare instances the first attack may never be
repeated, or only two or three attacks may occur in the course of a
long life.In the majority of instances, however, frequent repetitions
are the rule, the intervals between the attacks growing progressively
shorter; occasionally repeated seizures go on through a long life, the
attacks becoming milder with advancing years, and, save the crippling
effects of the disease, the patient may enjoy in the intervals a fair
degree of health.With the increased
frequency of the arthritic attacks the signs of the constitutional vice
become more marked.The dyspeptic disorders become more persistent and
rebellious to treatment, various transformations of the disease
manifest themselves, and tissue-changes make insidious and inevitable
progress.When this stage of the gouty disease is reached, the
prognosis becomes more grave because of the complications and accidents
to which the sufferer is liable.These complications and accidents are
the result of the nervous, vascular, and visceral lesions which have
been {127} described.Vaso-motor instability gives rise to a great
variety of painful functional derangements resulting from serious
cerebral, pulmonary, gastric, and renal congestions.Glycosuria is not
an uncommon complication in chronic gout, and seriously affects the
question of prognosis.Arterial degenerations may cause thrombotic
accidents, and the formation of miliary aneurisms in the brain may
determine a fatal issue by softening or hemorrhage.Anginal attacks due
to cardiac muscular degeneration may also imperil life.The principal visceral lesion which leads directly or indirectly to a
fatal issue in gout is that of the kidney.This involves danger either
through the induction of a hopeless anaemia and its consequences in
dropsical effusions, or by determining inflammatory accidents of the
gravest nature.That gout shortens life in the majority of cases is unquestionable--a
fact which is sufficiently attested by the care with which
life-insurance companies exclude risks in which a well-pronounced
inherited tendency or existing manifestation of the disease can be
substantiated.The prognosis varies of course with the rapidity with which the
constitutional dyscrasia is developed, and this rapidity will depend on
the intensity of the inheritance and the mode of life.Some gouty
subjects escape the vascular and visceral complications of the disease
for a long period, although crippled and deformed by its articular
ravages, and attain advanced age; others may succumb in comparative
youth to its most profound lesions.It is a happy circumstance that
under wise hygienic management and judicious medication acquired gout
may be checked in its progress, and even a strong inherited tendency
may be largely controlled.TREATMENT.--A logical consideration of the treatment of gout embraces,
first, the treatment of the constitutional vice, based, as far as
possible, on the nature and causes of the disease; and, secondly, the
treatment of the lesions which the disease determines.If we regard the
accumulation in the blood-serum of the salts of uric acid as the
essential cause of the gouty lesions, then the origin of the
constitutional vice is in the conditions which bring about this
accumulation.As we have urged, none of the theories of the production
of the lithaemic state harmonize all its phenomena.It is impossible to
represent the complex processes of nutrition by chemical formulae, and
equally impossible to divorce chemical reactions from a share in their
production.We can trace the metabolism of the azotized and
carbonaceous foods through many changes to their ultimate
disintegration into urea, carbonic acid, and water, but we do not know
all the steps by which this conversion is effected, nor the organs or
tissues in which it is accomplished.We may reasonably assume that the
agent through which the potential energy of the food is evolved is
oxygen, and that the process of nutrition is hence partly, at least, a
process of oxidation.This chemical view of the digestion and
assimilation of food may be said to be the rational basis of the
treatment of the lithaemic state.To control the accumulation of
azotized matters in the blood, and to secure their thorough combustion
and conversion into urea, carbonic acid, and water are the recognized
aims of the treatment of the vice upon which gout depends.DIET.--The prevention of the accumulation of azotized matters in the
{128} blood involves, first, a consideration of the question of the
diet appropriate to the gouty dyscrasia.The almost uniform counsel
upon this point of all the authorities from Sydenham to the present
time is, that albuminous foods should be sparingly allowed in the diet
of the gouty patient, and that vegetable foods, especially the
farinaceous, should constitute the principal aliment.This counsel is
based upon the theory that uric acid is the offending substance, and,
this being the outcome of a nitrogenous diet, the nitrogenous element
in diet must be reduced.My own observation has led me to believe that
while this may be a legitimate deduction from the uric-acid theory of
gout, it is not supported by the results of clinical experience.If
there is one signal peculiarity in the digestive derangements of gouty
persons, it is their limited power to digest the carbohydrates, the
sugars and starches.In whatever form these foods are used, they are
more commonly the source of the dyspeptic troubles of sufferers from
gout than the albuminous foods.They provoke the acid and flatulent
dyspepsia which so generally precedes the explosion of the gouty
paroxysm; and it must have attracted the attention of every observer
who has studied the dyspeptic disorders of sufferers from inherited
gout, who have sought to control their unhappy heritage by abstemious
habits, that these disorders are especially provoked by over-indulgence
in saccharine and amylaceous foods.It is not possible to explain satisfactorily why the lithaemic
condition should be induced by the carbonaceous aliments, but we
believe there can be no question as to the fact.If, as modern
physiological investigations tend to show, the liver is the organ in
which urea as well as glycogen is formed, it may be that the overtaxing
of its functions manifests itself more readily in the conversion of the
albuminous than in that of the carbonaceous foods; or it is possible
that the carbonaceous foods are destined chiefly for the evolution of
mechanical energy, and that when this destiny is not fulfilled through
indolence and imperfect oxygen-supply, they escape complete combustion,
and so vitiate the blood.But whatever may be the cause of this
anomaly, the clinical fact remains that in gouty persons the conversion
of the azotized foods is more complete with a minimum of carbohydrates
than it is with an excess of them--in other words, that one of the best
means of avoiding an accumulation of lithates in the blood is to
diminish the carbohydrates rather than the azotized foods.The diet which a considerable experience has led me to adopt in the
treatment of the gouty dyscrasia is very similar to that which
glycosuria requires.The exclusion of the carbohydrates is of course
not so strict.Abstinence from all the fermented preparations of
alcohol is perhaps the most important restriction, on account of the
unfermented dextrin and sugar which they contain.This restriction
accords with the common experience respecting the part which wine and
beer play as predisposing causes of the gouty disease and as occasional
exciting causes of gouty lesions.Next to the fermented liquors, the use of saccharine food in the diet
of gouty persons needs to be restricted.This limitation also is one
which common experience confirms.Sweet foods cannot be said to be as
provocative of the dyspeptic derangements of the lithaemic subjects as
wine and beer, but they are certainly often responsible for the
formation of {129} the dyscrasia and for perpetuating many most
distressing ailments.Their more or less strict prohibition may
constitute the essential point of treatment not only in controlling the
progress of the constitutional vice, but in subduing some of the most
rebellious lesions.It is important to observe that this prohibition
sometimes involves abstinence from sweet and subacid fruits, in the raw
as well as in the preserved state.Paroxysms of articular gout have
been known to follow indulgence in strawberries, apples, watermelons,
and grapes, and the cutaneous and mucous irritations which follow even
the most moderate use of these fruits in some gouty persons are
certainly not uncommon.Next in order to the saccharine foods as the source of indigestion in
gouty persons come the amylaceous aliments.These constitute,
necessarily, so large an element in ordinary diet that the limitation
of them in the dietary of gouty persons applies, in the majority of
cases, only to their excessive use.This excessive use, however, is
often observed.There is a popular prejudice in favor of this class of
foods, and a corresponding prejudice against the too free indulgence in
animal foods.The purely starchy aliments, such as potatoes and the
preparations of corn and rice, and even those which contain a
considerable portion of gluten, like wheat, oatmeal, and barley, often
provoke in gouty subjects a great deal of mischievous and painful
indigestion.This feeble capacity for the digestion of farinaceous
foods is most frequently observed in the children of gouty parents, and
especially in persons inclined to obesity, and in those whose
occupations are sedentary and whose lives are passed for the most part
in-doors, and they are least common in those whom necessity or pleasure
leads to much active muscular exercise in the open air.The fats are as a rule easily digested by gouty dyspeptics.This is a
fortunate circumstance, for the reason that in the anaemia which is
frequently one of the consequences of chronic gout the fatty foods are
of inestimable value.In cases of persistent and rebellious lithaemia
an exclusively milk diet constitutes a precious resource.The succulent vegetables, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, cauliflower,
cabbage, and the different varieties of salads, constitute for the
gouty as well as the diabetic subject agreeable and wholesome additions
to a diet from which the starchy and saccharine vegetables have to be
largely excluded.The quantity of food proper for gouty persons to consume can only be
determined in individual cases by the age, the habits, and the
occupation.It is fair to assume that in adults, in whom there is no
longer any provision to be made for growth, the daily quantity of food
must be regulated according to the amount of energy which is expended.In this energy must be reckoned the amount necessary for the
maintenance of animal heat and the other vital functions, and the
amount which is necessary for the operation of every variety of nervous
force.In other words, the potential energy latent in the food must
correspond to the active energy exhibited in the daily evolution of
vital, intellectual, and mechanical work.The more nearly this balance
is maintained the more closely the physiological standard of health is
preserved.That an excess of food is a most frequent cause of the gouty
dyscrasia among the well-to-do classes is undeniable, and it is
possible that regulation of the quantity according to the rule above
mentioned {130} may, after all, be the most important point in the
management of many gouty patients.It may be, also, that the reason why
the withdrawal of the carbohydrates produces its good effects upon
these patients is that we thereby exclude a large amount of
force-producing foods which do mischief because they are imperfectly
consumed.EXERCISE.--Next in importance to diet as a hygienic regulation in the
management of gouty patients is enforced exercise.The axiom of
Abernethy, "to live on a shilling a day, and earn it," comprises the
philosophy of the true relations of food to work, and of both to the
highest development of physical health.Exercise is to be enforced not
simply as a means of securing an active respiration, and thereby an
abundant supply of oxygen, but also as a means of converting the
potential energy of the food consumed into vital energy.The essential
condition, moreover, of healthy nutrition in every organ and in every
tissue is the maintenance of a vigorous functional activity.Over-use
is not more productive of tissue-degeneration than disuse.Hence the
question of exercise in its largest sense involves not only muscular
work, but work of all kinds, which tends to promote a healthy activity
of the psychical as well as the physical functions.Muscular exercise
in the open air has a special value for the victims of this gouty
dyscrasia by equalizing the circulation, quickening the respiratory
movements, and stimulating the elimination of effete matters from the
skin and lungs, but mental work and wholesome diversions are not less
important as antagonizing the evil effects of indolence and
over-feeding, which are among the common predisposing causes of
acquired gout.In persons who are incapacitated by neuraesthenia or by
excessive corpulence, the result of long indulgence in indolent and
luxurious habits, it may be necessary to resort to passive exercise by
rubbing, massage, and electrical excitation in order to secure the good
effects of voluntary work.BATHING.--Another hygienic regulation of great value in the treatment
of gouty dyscrasia is the promotion by bathing and friction of the
eliminative function of the skin.Daily sponging with cold water, where
it is not contraindicated by a feeble circulation and a slow reaction
from the shock, is a practice to be commended.Where, for the reasons
mentioned, it is not practicable, tepid baths and frictions may be
substituted.In cases where the arthritic lesions are progressive and
advanced much benefit may be derived from hot baths.It is doubtful
whether the thermal alkaline and sulphur spas owe their renown in the
treatment of chronic gout so much to the mineral ingredients of their
springs as to their high temperature.The Russian and Turkish baths
furnish most efficient means for increasing the functional activity of
the skin, but they often have a depressing effect on the action of the
heart, producing faintness and dyspnoea, and should always be advised
with caution.CLIMATE.--In rebellious forms of the gouty dyscrasia a warm climate is
unquestionably a hygienic condition of great value.The geographical
distribution of gout, which shows that the disease is much less common
in warm than in temperate and cold climates, while it may not perhaps
be wholly explained by temperature alone, is very certainly largely due
to it.The possibility of out-door life and the increased functional
activity of the skin which warm climates favor are circumstances more
or less antagonistic to the development of the gouty diathesis.{131} MEDICINAL TREATMENT.--The objects to be aimed at in medicinal
treatment of the gouty dyscrasia are--

1st, the improvement of the primary digestion.2d, the relief of the gastro-intestinal catarrh, which is the cause of
the direct and reflex dyspeptic symptoms which belong to this
diathesis.3d, the augmentation of food-oxidation, so as to secure its thorough
combustion.4th, the promotion of the elimination of the waste products of
nutrition.The improvement of primary digestion--or, as it has been aptly
called, exterior digestion--often requires very strict attention beyond
the proper selection of alimentary substances.The distressing symptoms
that indicate primary gastric and intestinal indigestion are certainly
often relieved by the rigid exclusion of certain articles of diet, but
in many cases it is necessary to assist the preparatory processes which
are essential to perfect food-absorption by artificial methods based
upon the knowledge derived from physiological experiment.To no one is
the knowledge of these methods more largely due than to Roberts of
Manchester.Preparations of pepsin and pancreatin, by which the
proteids and starches are peptonized and the fats emulsified, are often
of inestimable value in the treatment of gouty dyspepsia.Pancreatin,
especially, which by means of its trypsin, diastase, and emulsive
ferment possesses the threefold property of aiding the digestion of the
azotized, amylaceous, and fatty elements of food, is certainly the most
valuable of the artificial means for augmenting the efficiency of
primary digestion.The relief of the gastro-intestinal catarrh in gouty dyspeptics may
often be accomplished solely by dietetic restrictions and by the aid
which may be given to primary digestion.It is often necessary,
however, to direct some special medication toward the relief of the
catarrhal lesion.The circumstances which demand this special
medication are the existence of portal congestion, the result of
functional derangement, or of chronic atrophy of the liver, or of
chronic diffuse or interstitial nephritis, or of cardiac disease.The
hydragogues, such as calomel, podophyllin, colocynth, and other
vegetable cathartics, with the salts of sodium and magnesium,
constitute the most common and efficient means of relieving portal
congestion, whether it arise from temporary functional derangement or
from organic disease.The renown of some of the more famous mineral
springs in relieving the miseries of gouty sufferers is due mainly to
the relief of portal congestion and the washing away of the catarrhal
mucus which obstructs the process of primary food transformation and
absorption.This is especially true of the sulphate of sodium waters,
like those of Carlsbad, Marienbad, Friedrichshall, Pullna, and Hunyadi
Janos.While the value of these waters in chronic gout is
unquestionable where their use is properly regulated, there is good
reason to believe that their long-continued employment is often harmful
by relaxing the mucous membrane, and thereby tending to aggravate the
condition they are given to relieve.This is markedly true of their use
in weak and anaemic persons.For these the milder magnesian waters,
such as those of Kissengen, Hombourg, Wiesbaden, and Saratoga, are to
be preferred.The augmentation of food-oxidation may be accomplished in a large
degree by regulation of the diet and by out-door exercise.The {132}
regulation of the diet according to the occupation and habits of life
is a point of primary importance in securing proper blood-elaboration.My experience leads me to believe that the evil consequences of in-door
occupations and sedentary habits are most common in those who live upon
a diet composed largely of starchy and saccharine foods, and that a
diet in which animal foods and fats predominate is best suited to
indoor workers, whether they be engaged in mechanical or intellectual
labor.The medicines which help to promote the oxidation of the food-elements,
especially the carbohydrates, are alkalies and iron.Clinical
observation establishes this fact as strongly in the treatment of gout
as in that of glycosuria.The relative power of the salts of potassium
and sodium in augmenting oxidation is not clearly determined.The salts
of sodium appear to be most useful in aiding the process of primary
digestion, and the potassium salts in improving the process of
sanguification.It is well known that potash predominates in the
corpuscles and soda in the serum of the blood.The efficacy of the
combinations of iron with the salts of potassium, as in Blaud's pills
and in the citrate and tartrate of iron and potassium, in the treatment
of anaemia, is well known.In the most renowned ferruginous springs,
however, such as those of Schwalbach, Spa, Pyrmont, and St.Moritz, the
iron is combined with salts of sodium, calcium, and magnesium.It would
appear, therefore, that the increased energy of iron in augmenting
haematosis, when combined with alkalies, is not relatively greater with
potash than with either of the other alkaline bases.The promotion of the elimination of the waste products of nutrition
is to be accomplished by remedies which act as solvents of uric acid
and as diuretics.As solvents of uric acid the salts of lithia and
potash have been shown to be superior to those of soda.The urate of
lithia is the most soluble of the uric-acid salts, and the low chemical
equivalent of the metal lithium makes the neutralizing power of the
oxide much greater than that of equal proportions of the other
alkalies.It is used in the forms of carbonate and citrate, and is
generally combined with potash and soda.It exists in some of the
mineral springs of Europe and of this country, but in such minute
proportion as probably to be of little value.In administering the
salts of potash and soda it is generally admitted that the carbonates
and the neutral salts of the organic acids are to be preferred to
solutions of the caustic alkalies.They have less power in neutralizing
the acid of the gastric juice, and enter the circulation as neutral
salts, where they are decomposed into alkaline carbonates by the
oxidation of the organic acids, increasing the alkalinity of the serum
and acting as diuretics.The combinations of the alkalies with sulphur,
with iodine, and with mineral acids, as in the alkaline springs, are
frequently used in the treatment of gouty lesions of the subacute
variety.The sulphur salts probably owe their chief value to their
alkaline bases when they are used internally; and in sulphuretted
baths, as before remarked, the good effects are probably due to the
high temperature at which the bath is usually administered.The salts of iodine are generally supposed to have a special action in
removing the consequences of chronic fibrous inflammation in gout and
rheumatism.They often disturb the digestion and provoke troublesome
irritations of the skin and mucous membranes.In removing the sclerotic
{133} effects of gouty inflammation they do not exhibit the same
sorbefacient power which they show in their action upon the granulation
tissue of syphilitic origin.It must be admitted, however, that in
certain catarrhal affections of a gouty nature the iodides of potassium
and sodium are almost specific in their good effects.In the
pharyngeal, laryngeal, and bronchial catarrhs from which some gouty
persons suffer, where there is a dryness and irritability of the mucous
membrane, the administration of these salts produces the most prompt
and beneficial result.As solvents of uric acid they do not appear to
equal the salts of the organic acids.As to the mode of administering salines in the treatment of the gouty
dyscrasia, it is hardly necessary to observe that it must vary with the
effect desired.As antacids in acid dyspepsia they should be given soon
after meals, and for this purpose the salts of soda are to be
preferred, for the reason that they not only neutralize excessive
acidity, but they increase the efficiency of the peptonizing process.Where it is desired to introduce these salts into the circulation for
their solvent action, as diuretics or to assist the process of
sanguification, they should be given three or four hours after meals
and largely diluted with water.Before concluding the consideration of the treatment of the gouty
dyscrasia it should be remarked that the ability of water as a solvent,
as a means of stimulating tissue-changes and eliminating waste, is not
generally estimated at its true value.The use of copious libations of
hot water in the treatment of gout, recommended by Cadet de Vaux in
1825, has been revived from time to time, and is at present attracting
considerable attention.TREATMENT OF ACUTE ARTICULAR GOUT.--There are three distinct methods of
managing an attack of acute gout--the antiphlogistic, the expectant,
and the abortive.The antiphlogistic method, in the strict application of the term, is
practically obsolete.Bloodletting, both general and local, brisk
catharsis and diaphoresis, with low diet, were formerly advocated as
the natural and imperative antagonists of gout as well as of all other
acute inflammatory affections.Carried to its extreme degree, this
method was deprecated by Sydenham and his disciples as tending often to
prolong the attack and precipitate the manifestations of atonic gout.The natural reaction from the vigorous antiphlogistic practice was what
has been termed the expectant method.The expectant method may be said to be founded upon the aphorism of
Mead that "gout is the cure of gout."The discovery of the salts of
uric acid in the blood-serum and in the affected tissues gave a
scientific basis to the humoral pathology of gout and led to the
formulation of definite principles in the application of the expectant
method of treatment.These principles are the prevention of the further
accumulation of the urates in the blood and the promotion of their
oxidation and elimination.The first principle involves restriction to
a rigid diet during the attack, excluding albuminous foods and the
fermented preparations of alcohol, and allowing only milk and
farinaceous gruels.The oxidation of the urates is encouraged by the
administration of alkalies and by an abundant supply of air, the
inhalation of oxygen even having been recommended.The elimination of
the urates is accomplished chiefly {134} by diuretics and moderate
catharsis.The local treatment commonly used with this medication
consists in the application of alkaline and anodyne fomentations or of
dry flannel or cotton.Local bloodletting and blistering are now rarely
commended.Under this treatment the intensity of the inflammatory
process is abated, the suffering is allayed, but the progress and
duration of the disease are not materially modified.The recovery,
however, is satisfactory, and it is claimed that the chances of early
recurrence of the attack are diminished.This method has many
advocates, though it cannot be said to represent the common practice of
the present day.It is becoming traditional, and may be said to be
gradually giving place to the specific or abortive method.The abortive method consists in cutting short the attack by the
administration of colchicum, veratria, or the salicin compounds.The value of colchicum in joint affections is a tradition of the
earliest records of medicine.It shares its curative effects in acute
gout with veratria, and, though the active principle of the meadow
saffron and the veratrum album are not isomeric, their effects are
similar.They constitute the basis of the famous nostrums so
extensively patronized by sufferers from gout.Colchicum is the active
agent in the eau medicinale de Husson, in Wilson's and Reynolds's
specifics, and in the pills of Lartigue and Blair, while veratria is
supposed to be that of Laville's remedy.The action of these substances
is not understood.The physiological action of colchicum is that of a
local irritant and a cardiac depressant of great energy.It purges
violently when given in large doses, causes nausea and vomiting, and
may produce collapse.In therapeutical doses in a gouty paroxysm it
acts as a diuretic and an antipyretic, and allays, sometimes in a most
magical manner, the objective and subjective symptoms of the disease.As simple purging by other cathartics does not abort the gouty seizure,
the value of colchicum cannot be ascribed to its purging effect, and,
besides, purging is by no means necessary to its efficiency.Nor can
its utility be ascribed to its diuretic property.There is some
question in regard to its claims as a diuretic, and there seems to be
no doubt that it often does good where this effect is not observed.Its
influence upon the heart does not explain its marvellous action upon
the local process, for the same influence obtained by other drugs has
no such result.We are driven, therefore, to the conclusion that
colchicum has a specific action in gout as certain and as inexplicable
as that of quinia in malarial fever, or iodide of potassium in
constitutional syphilis.For those who accept the theory that gout is a
tropho-neurosis the therapeutical action of colchicum is a strong
confirmation of its neurotic origin, for the reasons that colchicum has
no influence upon arthritic lesions which are not gouty, and that its
physiological effects point to its action on the nervous system.It is useless, however, to speculate on the way in which colchicum and
allied substances affect gouty inflammation; the practical question to
be determined is: Are they the best and safest remedies to control it?Upon this point there is a wide diversity of opinion.The objections to
the colchicum treatment are based upon humoral pathology, and upon the
idea that the attack is an effort of nature to cast out the poison and
purify the blood.Colchicum, it is claimed, arrests this process; the
poison is retained, diffuses itself through the tissues, and lays the
{135} foundation of vascular and visceral lesions.It shortens the
intervals between the attacks, and tempts the patient to continued
indulgence in the habits which perpetuate and exaggerate the disease.The advocates of the abortive treatment, on the other hand, claim that
these arguments have no real force as applied to its therapeutical
value.The cure accomplished is, to all appearances, complete, and the
patient is saved the suffering and exhaustion which result from the
expectant method.The fact that he is so easily and speedily cured, and
that he resumes his vicious habits and suffers recurring attacks in
consequence, proves only that the treatment lacks the quality of moral
discipline which belongs to prolonged suffering and the penance of
vigorous medication.It is an acknowledged fact that the great majority
of sufferers from acute gout decide sooner or later in favor of the
abortive treatment; and as professional opinion has heretofore
generally advocated the expectant or eliminative treatment, they
commonly resort to the use of some one of the quack remedies which
contain colchicum or veratria.In view of the present uncertainty of our knowledge of the true
pathology of the acute gouty arthritis, as to whether it is a
tropho-neurosis or the result of the local irritation caused by the
salts of uric acid, the specific treatment seems to be justified by a
regard for the comfort of the patient and as a means of protecting him
against falling into the reckless use of quack remedies.A speedy
relief of the acute symptoms, followed by the treatment appropriate to
the gouty habit, would seem to be the most rational and safest mode of
managing the acute articular attacks of gout.The selection of the preparation of colchicum in the treatment of an
acute paroxysm is a matter of individual experience and preference.The
acetous extract and the wine of the seeds are most commonly used, and
many practitioners are not scrupulous in prescribing the proprietary
preparations of Reynolds, Laville, and Blair.The wine of colchicum may
be given in doses varying from 20 to 40 minims, alone or combined with
Epsom salts in drachm doses, with small quantities of opium, every six
or eight hours.Under this medication the pain, tenderness, and
swelling rapidly abate, and sometimes with an abruptness that is
magical.As soon as the acute symptoms subside, the colchicum should be
continued in smaller and less frequent doses until the fever and local
tenderness subside.The use of quinia with small doses of colocynth
after the colchicum has been discontinued helps to re-establish the
strength and regulate the digestive functions.The patient should
always be warned against the possible demoralizing effects of a speedy
recovery from a serious disease.Recurrence after the colchicum
treatment is certainly more common than after the expectant method, but
this should not be ascribed so much to a defective cure as to the
temptation which the antidote offers to trifling with the poison.The
accidents which have been ascribed to colchicum through its causing
heart-failure are probably to be explained by its injudicious
administration in large doses where acute gout is complicated with
cardiac or renal degeneration.Next in importance and value to colchicum in the abortive treatment of
gout are salicin, salicylic acid, the sodium salicylate, and the oil of
wintergreen.Unlike colchicum, which has no marked effect upon acute
rheumatism, these medicines appear to act with similar energy on {136}
gout and rheumatism.The rapidity and the almost uniform way with which
they allay the inflammatory symptoms in rheumatic fever are well known;
their value as specific remedies in both acute and subacute gout is not
so generally appreciated.Whether the specific action of colchicum in
gout differentiates this disease from rheumatism, or whether the
similar action of the salicin compounds indicates that these diseases
are allied in their etiology, are questions yet to be solved.The good
effects of salicin and the sodium salicylate in many of the forms of
irregular gout, and notably in the dyspeptic disorders and the
erythematous tegumentary lesions, are especially worthy of notice.In
acute attacks of articular gout the salicylic acid or the sodium
salicylate, in 15 or 20 grain doses repeated every three or four hours,
will often cut short the attack, and will very certainly allay within
twenty-four hours the acuteness of the symptoms.As in rheumatism, the
medicine should be continued in smaller doses after the acute symptoms
have subsided for several days, the tendency to relapse being marked if
the drug be discontinued too soon.In subacute articular gout and in
the irregular forms of the disease, where the medicine has to be
continued for some time, salicin and the oil of wintergreen are to be
preferred to salicylic acid and the sodium salicylate.They are less
liable to disturb the stomach and to produce toxic effects.It is unnecessary to describe the treatment of the different forms of
irregular gout, inasmuch as the general principles described in the
treatment of the gouty dyscrasia involve the most important
considerations in the management of these affections.{137}

RACHITIS.[1]

BY A. JACOBI, M.D.[Footnote 1: There is a difference of opinion as to the correct
spelling of this word, and strong reasons exist to regard the form
_rhachitis_ as the proper one.It is true that this spelling of the
word has been remarked upon as unorthographical by many, mostly modern,
authors.Even Virchow writes "Rachitis," claiming that Glisson took the
term from "the then popular _rickets_."This is a mistake, as H.
Rohlffs points out (_Deutsches Arch.d. Med._, 1883, p.Rachitis is a Greek word, and was used in the classical time of
Hellenism.It has, however, seemed best to preserve here the usual
spelling, rachitis, which has become sanctioned by general usage.]DEFINITION.--Rachitis is a general nutritive disorder, almost always of
long duration, usually with an introductory stage of weeks or months
and a course mostly extending over months or years.Its beginning is
mostly gradual, its final recovery slow.It is complicated with or
dependent on disorders of the digestive or respiratory apparatuses,
which are preceded by a disposition probably created by an undue width
of the arteries.It exhibits amongst its prominent symptoms muscular
debility; perspiration; anomalies of the subcutaneous tissue, which is
either very much infiltrated with fat or deprived of it; disturbances
of the intellectual and moral functions, and of those of the large
thoracic and abdominal viscera and lymphatic glands; changes in the
latter may outlive all others.Its most perceptible symptom, however,
consists in an inflammatory disease of the primordial cartilage of the
epiphyses, a copious deposit in that region and also under the
periosteum of the bones; curvature of the diaphyses, and, while
absorption remains intact, softening and retarded ossification of the
bone.Without these affections of the osseous system the diagnosis of
rachitis is not complete.ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY.--The nature of rachitis has been considered to
be inflammatory by F. A.[2] Renard looked for that inflammation
in the periosteum.Guerin emphasizes the vascular increase in
periosteum, bone, and marrow; Trousseau and Lasegue the congestive
character of the local tumefaction, besides fever and pain.Virchow
also[3] inclines to the opinion that the rachitical process is of an
inflammatory nature, though it be impossible to state the exact cause
of the process.Still, he claims that we are no better off in regard to
other inflammations of unknown character--for instance, those of the
skin--and that we have to look for a future increase of our knowledge
of such constitutional predisposition of the organism and of such
specific qualities of the blood as will produce the local irritation of
the osseous tissue in rachitis.Last, and mainly, it is Kassowitz who
seeks the {138} essence of the rachitical process in a chronic
inflammation originating in the points of apposition of the growing
bones of the foetus or infant.During the chronic inflammation
blood-vessels are formed in large numbers, and a morbid congestion
takes place in all blood-vessels, but mainly in those of the localities
in which new bone is forming; thus in the chondro-epiphyses, in the
perichondrium and periosteum, and the sutural substances.Faulty
introduction or elimination of lime has nothing to do with this
process.It cannot be deposited in the current of a copious
circulation; in fact, it is not deposited in the immediate neighborhood
of blood-vessels to any extent.Even in otherwise normal bone
hyperaemia produced by the experimenter softens the bone, which was
fully formed before.If the relative percentage of lime were of any
account in the etiology of rachitis, the periosteal and cartilaginous
proliferations would find no explanation.But why is it that this
peculiar process takes place at an early age only?Kassowitz urges the fact that the growth of the bone differs in
this from the development of all other tissues: that the latter grow
uniformly through their whole mass; that the circulation in them is
more uniform and carries material through and into every particle
simultaneously, while in the bones the only places in which the whole
circulation can contribute to their growth--the few blood-vessels
distributed in the interior not adding to their growth at all--are the
periosteum and the places of apposition between epiphysis and
diaphysis.Every morbid irritation, whether resulting from bad air,
habitation, and food, or from either chronic or acute ailment, acts on
the whole mass of other tissues and organs, but in the bones only on
the growing ends or surface.Museum_, Berlin, 1796, vol.The results of the pathologists and experimenters are confirmed by
chemical analyses.Fat has been generally found somewhat increased in
the rachitical bones, and water largely so; chondrin is diminished
according to Marchand and Lehmann, but was found unaltered in the later
analyses of A. Baginsky.The latter found, after having deprived the
bone of fat, the organic and inorganic material to be in a proportion
of 100 to 563 in the normal, and of 100 to 160 in the rachitical
osseous tissue; and in 100 parts of dry bone, Gorup-Besanez found in
the

  Infant of six months  34.9         27          35        0.5

Defective calcification of the forming bone is one of the principal
characteristics of rachitis.In it lime cannot either enter into the
composition of the osseous tissue or remain in it.Its elimination must
take place either through the kidneys or the intestinal tract.Baginsky, and many before him, have found an abnormal
quantity.In regard to the urine, modern investigations do not agree
with former analyses.Thus, Baginsky concludes that there is no
increase of lime in the urine of rachitical as compared with that of
healthy children; Seemann found even a diminution of the percentage of
lime.Amongst modern writers only Rehn found an occasional increase of
lime in the urine of rachitis.{139} In regard to the elimination of phosphoric acid, the analyses of
different periods do not agree any better.The conclusions of previous
researches, pointing to a quadruple elimination of phosphoric acid in
the urine of rachitis, are refuted by Seemann, who found no increase,
and by Baginsky, according to whose researches the phosphoric acid of
the healthy urine compares with that of rachitical urine as 40:12-37.As far as the elimination of nitrogen is concerned, there appears to be
but little difference between normal and rachitical urine.Chlorine was
found to be diminished in rachitis by Baginsky.Lehmann and Von Gorup
found lactic acid several times.Several times albumen was met with; in
a case of Ritchie's, blood; in one of Von Gorup's, fat.[4]

[Footnote 4: E. Salkowski und W. Leube, _Die Lehre vom Harn_, 1882, p.The etiology of rachitis must be studied from two points of view.It
has its predisposition and its direct and proximate causes.The former
has been studied by F. W. Beneke[5] upon an anatomical basis.He finds
that the arteries of rachitical patients are large all through the
body.This is so particularly in the carotids; it seems probable that
the changes taking place in the head are due to this anomaly in the
size of the arteries.Three cases in which the width of the arteries of
the neck was unusually large terminated fatally--one by hydrocephalus,
one with a very large skull, and one suddenly.This width of the
arteries is most marked, under ordinary circumstances, from the second
to the fourth year; that is, the exact time in which (except the cases
of early rachitis) the rachitical process is at its height.It is
considered by Beneke to be the cause of the local increase of vascular
irritation, particularly in the epiphyses with their retarded
circulation; and also of the increase of nutritive development which is
so often noticed during recovery from rachitis; and, finally, of the
many pulmonary complications of an inflammatory nature.[Footnote 5: _Die Anatomischen Grundlagen der Constitutions Anomalien
des Menschen_, 1878, p.There is another interesting consideration in regard to the effect of
wide arteries on the relations between the blood and tissues.A great
many more blood-cells are required to fill the arteries when wide than
when narrow.Now, the formation of blood-cells is hindered by any
disease of the digestive and blood-preparing organs, so that the
tissues are liable to show the relative increase in the percentage of
water, which is uniformly confirmed for rachitis by the biochemists.The pulmonary artery of the healthy infant is larger than the aorta by
not more than four millimeters.In the majority of cases of rachitis
examined by Beneke this difference in size was very much more favorable
to the pulmonary artery; it is abnormally large in rachitis.This
anatomical fact is suggestive of the pathological processes so
frequently found in the lungs and in the neighboring lymphatic and
large abdominal glands.For, while the amount of blood introduced into
the lungs through its wide artery is unusually large, particularly so
in a chest which is contracted in consequence of the rachitical process
in the bones, the exit from the lungs is relatively impeded.Not only,
however, the narrowness of the chest is a cause of this disproportion.For even in rather normal chests the lungs of rachitical children are
relatively small.The liver of almost all rachitical children is large.In but one-half
{140} of the cases this enlargement is accompanied with a large heart.In pure cases of scrofula, on the contrary, Beneke found a small heart,
rather narrow arteries, and usually a small liver, the size of the
lungs offering but few anomalies.The spleen also is large in the majority of cases.Its size is not
dependent on the large size of the liver or the small size of the
lungs.For these conditions are found in the majority of cases only,
not in all of them, and the large spleen is not always found with a
large liver and small lungs.The variability of the anatomical
conditions permits of various degrees of combination; so that varying
combinations of rachitis with other constitutional disorders may
correspond with the different sizes of the principal organs.After all,
as there is a great deal of independence of these organs, as to size,
of each other, the conclusion is justified that those differences are
not the result of the disease, but that they are congenital and stand
in some causal relation with it.The kidneys are large in the majority of cases, like the spleen and
liver, while the lungs are small.This disproportion is apt to result
in a hyperaemic condition of all the organs of the abdominal cavity,
and especially of the kidneys.To what extent this undue amount of
volume interferes with, or increases, renal secretion, it is difficult
to say.The amount of urine secreted by rachitical children is about
normal, though, as already stated, the percentage of lime in it is
rather diminished, contrary to the opinions held formerly.For the direct cause of rachitis Glisson looked to the inequality of
nutrition by the arterial blood, and for that of the curvature of the
long bones to their superabundant vascularization.He found the disease
mainly amongst the well-to-do classes, not unlike a modern American
writer, who declares infantile paralysis to be the result of the
nervousness of the better classes of the American people!John Mayow
(1761) held a disturbance of the innervation responsible; Zeviani (in
the same year), improper food in general, and particularly prolonged
lactation; and Selle (1791), a peculiar diathesis (acrimonia
rachitica).About that time a defective nutrition with abnormal
function of the lymph-ducts was looked upon as the cause of rachitis by
many--by others, an undue production of acid, and the softening of the
osseous tissue thereby.This result was attributed by some to the
influence of milk (Veirac, De Krzowitz).Attention was directed at an
early time to phosphoric acid and lime, with the view that variations
in the elimination of these substances might explain the occurrence of
rachitis.A large quantity of both was found in some urines (Malfatti);
a superabundance of phosphoric acid was presumed to prevail in the
whole system (Wendt, Fourcroy); while symptoms resembling rachitis were
found in animals fed upon small doses of phosphoric acid by Caspari
(1824).Chossat fed young animals on food deprived of lime, and claimed
to produce softening of the bones and death, a result which was denied
by Friedleben.Guerin claimed to produce rachitis by feeding young
animals on meat in place of their mother's milk, a result equally
denied by Tripier, who, like Friedleben, found the bones under such
circumstances more liable to fractures, but not rachitical.Wildt and
Weiske found the bones uninfluenced by withholding lime from food;
Forster, however, and Roloff claimed to notice a marked influence, and
the latter {141} stated that animals, after having been rendered sick
by depriving them of lime, recovered when they were again supplied with
it.Wegner, in his numerous experiments with phosphorus, found that in
growing animals it increases the growth and firmness of both long and
flat bones; after the growth of the animal has been completed it
renders epiphyses and vertebrae denser.There is no change, however, in
the relative chemical composition of those parts.He found at the same
time that results similar to those caused by the administration of
phosphorus were obtained when food deprived of its phosphate of lime
was given.But he met with no rachitical changes proper during these
several procedures.Teissier having found an increase in the urine of
rachitis after the administration of lactic acid, and lactic acid
having been frequently found in the urine of rachitical patients by
Ragsky, Morehead, Simon, and Lehmann, C. Heitzmann fed with lactic acid
both carnivorous and herbivorous animals, found the cortical layer of
the bones softened and the medullary substance hyperaemic, and claimed
to produce rachitis in the former and osteomalacia in the latter.Both
of these assertions were denied by Tripier and Toussaint, who insist
upon Heitzmann's having selected animals which have a peculiar
disposition to suffer from rachitis.Again, Milne Edwards and
Boussaingault found the bones softened when they withdrew both
phosphoric acid and lime from the food, without restoring the bone's
consistency by administering powdered bone.Baginsky
states that he produced rachitis by withholding lime, and increased the
effect by introducing lactic acid.By so doing, however, he changed
only the relation of the mineral to the organic substances, without
interfering with the normal proportions to each other of the
constituents of the ashes.Beneke, finding oxalic acid in the urine in
many cases of rachitis, attributes to it the want of calcification in
rachitis, and Senator suggests that what impedes the deposition of bone
might be formic, acetic, and lactic acids, which are also found in the
young osseous tissue.[6]

[Footnote 6: L. Furth, _Path u. Ther.d. Rachitis_, Wiener Klinik,
1882.]Of these statements many are uniform, others contradictory.Thus far,
they are not convincing except in one way--viz.that both withholding
and introducing certain ingredients, mainly lime, influence the growth
of the bone considerably.This may prove nothing else but that lime is
of paramount importance in the building up of bone, and that bone in
the period of rapid development is amenable to a great many influences.It is in the period of rapid development that rachitis is observed.Thus it occurs in every stage of intra-uterine and infant life.It is
met with in the foetus in very early intra-uterine life; it is found as
a congenital affection, continuing to develop after birth when it has
originated in the latter half of foetal existence; there is, thirdly,
the rachitis of early infancy; and, lastly, that of advanced infancy
and childhood.Of 624 cases of rachitis enumerated by A. Baginsky,
there were 256 less than a year old, 313 in the second, and 63 in the
third year.After this time rachitis is rare, as far as the active
symptoms of the disease are concerned.But still, a retarded form of
rachitis (r. tardiva) has been described by some authors.It is said to
occur about puberty, and to exhibit local changes in the bones of
genuine rachitical character, but to be wanting in all the other
symptoms required for the diagnosis of general rachitis.Such cases
have been described {142} by C.[7] He found it complicated, now
and then, with albuminuria.The occurrence of the latter at that time
of life had been referred to by Moxon.[8] The principal symptoms
described by Lucas are scoliosis, talipes valgus, and genu valgum.The
epiphyses were slightly thickened; there were pain in the limbs,
languor, and pallor.In some of the cases there were also rachitical
deformities dating from infancy.He believes rachitis of adolescence to
exhibit more symptoms belonging to relaxation of the ligaments than to
softening of the bones.[Footnote 7: _Lancet_, June 9, 1883.]A case of rachitis of undoubtedly congenital nature has been reported
by Chiari.There were no other alveoli,
nor was there any intimation of the formation of alveoli in the shape
of the jaw, which resembled very much the usual senile form of
retrograde metamorphosis.Twenty years ago I described the lesions in part of a rachitical
cranium removed from an infant who lived up to her eleventh day.She
was born at full term with hernia of the brain, about one-sixth of
which protruded through the small fontanel.Only the cranium could be
studied with regard to rachitis, and but small portions of the frontal
and the anterior half of the parietal bones surrounding the large
fontanel could be removed.In these few square inches of bone there
were between twenty-five and thirty openings of the usual craniotabic
nature, nothing but a transparent membrane being left.The bony edges
of these thin portions were partly sloping off gradually, partly very
steeply, and somewhat thickened.They were distributed over the whole
part of the skull removed; some were found in the immediate
neighborhood of the points of ossification.No recent deposits of soft
rachitical bone had taken place under the periosteum.Thus, evidently,
the process was of rather an early date of intra-uterine life, and had
at birth run the full course of its usual development without having
had an opportunity to terminate in the restitution of the normal
bone.[9]

[Footnote 9: _Amer.F. A. Burrall[10] the infant (female) was
cyanosed at birth, and had a small head and feeble general development.The respiration was shrill and piping from birth, as though from
congenital laryngismus; in a few days it became raucous.The
post-mortem examination proved the larynx normal, with no obstructive
growths.She was pigeon-breasted, and the last phalanx of her right
finger wanting.In the meeting of June 27, 1883, of the Societe de Chirurgie of Paris,
Gueniot presented a newly-born baby with well-pronounced rachitis of
the extremities which had healed at the time of birth.The bones had
recovered their firmness, and the characteristic deformities remained.In the meeting of December 19th he could report that the child had
exhibited neither symptoms of rachitis nor of syphilis since.In regard
to the latter, a very rigorous examination of the baby's whole family,
made by Gueniot and Fournier, resulted in the existence of no trace of
syphilis.[11]

[Footnote 11: _Rev.de l'Enfance_, Janv., 1884.]Kassowitz has examined many still-born infants, and also children dying
at an early age, at the foundling hospital of Vienna.In a large
majority of the cases he found rachitical changes in the ends of the
bones.In {143} many of those who lived several weeks he found rachitis
developed to such an extent that the presumption of its intra-uterine
origin became conclusive.Here nothing is left but the conclusion that
the cause of congenital rachitis has to be looked for in the condition
of the maternal blood.Thus, the foetal and congenital occurrence of rachitis cannot be
doubted.Neither requires the
presence of rachitis in one or both of the parents.But the cause of
the intra-uterine disease has not been found.Perhaps a disease of the
mother with considerable nutritive disorders or a defective placentar
supply may be found responsible.The foetal form runs its course long
before the normal termination of pregnancy; the congenital may have run
its full course at birth or complete it afterward.The bones are found
of characteristic nature, the diaphyses suffering more than the
epiphyses; even a rachitical pelvis has been met with by Fischer.Early
foetal rachitis is probably dependent upon a defective development of
the very first cartilaginous deposits and the first osseous nuclei;
thus, many of the congenital synostoses find a ready explanation.For periosteal
proliferation at that early period contracts the foramina carrying the
blood-vessels, and, while interfering with the size of the bones, the
foramen magnum also.Thus, a certain class of cretinism appears to be
due to foetal rachitis, mainly of the base of the cranium, which
results in early ossification of the synchondroses, particularly of the
sphenoid bone.But lately I have seen a case of this description,
which, however, had not terminated at the time of birth.For after
birth the rachitical process developed further, and in addition to the
rachitical deformity of the base of the cranium there were afterward
thickening of the epiphyses, pigeon breast, and thoracic grooving and
flattening.Rachitis is found in city and country, less on mountains than in
valleys.Still, it is met with at elevations of two thousand feet.In
the tropical regions it is almost unknown.Why it should have been
considered quite a new disease in England but a few centuries ago, or
whether it did not exist before that time, it is difficult to say.It
is certain, however, that deformities have been described in antiquity
which we are accustomed to attribute to rachitis.As the disease is one that occurs during the period of rapid growth,
and is a developmental disease, everything that interferes with normal
growth and development is apt to change physiological functions into
pathological conditions and to produce rachitis.In the pregnant mother
her ill-nutrition and the defective cell-material used in the building
up of the embryo and foetus, or a defective placenta, may come in for
the explanation of foetal and congenital rachitis, although the case of
Klein's, who reports twins, of which one was normal and one rachitic,
is rather difficult to explain on that basis only.Even rachitis of
early infancy is not easily accounted for otherwise, for its first
symptoms show themselves at a very early period; thus constipation,
adiposity, and afterward craniotabes and thoracic grooving.The common form, and that which is the usual subject of the text-books
and monographs, has, however, in most cases a well-marked preparatory
stage in the shape of diseases or ailments reducing sanguification
{144} and nutrition.Some cases are ushered in by, or follow the course
of, acute exanthems or acute gastric disorders or the presence of
entozoa.A larger number appear to result from insufficient oxygenation
resulting from lung diseases, with a long chronic ailment following the
acute stage.Even acute pneumonia, with its direct influence on general
nutrition, stands often for the proximate cause of rachitis.Bad air
alone, even swamp air, does not appear to be a sufficient cause.When
it seems so, it is complicated with the main cause of rachitis; that
is, bad, insufficient, improper food, with its immediate result--viz.Cow's milk, particularly when acid, starchy food
administered too early or in too large quantity or too exclusively,
early weaning followed by improper artificial food, insufficient
mother's milk or such as is either too thin or too caseinous, lactation
protracted beyond the normal limit,--may all alike be causes of
intestinal disturbances and rachitis.A number of women who were rachitical
themselves have been known to have rachitical children.But it has been
said that the process runs its full course during infancy, and that
therefore a direct inheritance of rachitis from mother to child is an
impossibility.Still, we must not forget that the consecutive
conditions of the parents may, or will, influence the general condition
of the infant and result in similar disturbances.Dyscrasic parents may have healthy children, and healthy
parents sickly or dyscrasic ones.But the probability is greater that
diseased children should come from dyscrasic parents than from healthy
ones.Tuberculosis in the parents has frequently been accused of being
the cause of rachitis in the infant--not directly, but in consequence
of general impairment of the tissues.Gout has also been accused of
being the cause of rachitis, but it is a peculiar fact that the poor
have but little gout and a great deal of rachitis.In all of these
cases it is better to look upon rachitis as only one of the forms of
general mal-nutrition, and to speak of inheritance of the disposition
rather than of the disease.Thus it was that about the end of the
eighteenth century Portal spoke of scrofulous, syphilitic, scorbutic,
rheumatic, arthritic, and exanthematic rachitis.Particularly has
syphilis been accused of being the main cause of rachitis by some, and
even the only cause by others.Thus it was looked upon by Boerhaave.In
modern times Parrot maintained, from 1872 up to the time of his death,
which occurred recently, that every case of rachitis is of syphilitic
origin.As his proof he relied mainly on the condition of the teeth and
the bones.But those appearances in the teeth, the thin and ragged
edges, the friability and the grooving, either horizontal or vertical,
which have been considered characteristic of syphilis by Hutchinson and
others, have no such dignity, and moreover they are not observed in the
temporary teeth at all, but in the permanent only; the rachitical
softening of the bones also is not found in syphilis at all.Particularly are there no curvatures in syphilis and no infractions.It
is true that marasmus is found in both rachitis and syphilis, but it is
met with in all sorts of diseases.The changes in the bones of syphilis
are found at birth; in rachitis they usually develop in later months.When a baby is syphilitic and rachitic at the same time, the syphilis
may last very much longer than the rachitis, which meanwhile has
healed.The internal organs in rachitis do not exhibit any such {145}
changes as are known to occur in very many cases of syphilis.No
gummata are ever found in rachitis, and the interstitial inflammation
of the internal organs in syphilis is not met with to the same degree
in rachitis.What Parrot claimed as a desquamative syphilide of the
tongue--that is, red insulated spots, denuded of their epithelium,
small in the beginning, later extending backward and increasing in
size--is by no means always syphilitic, but is found in a great many
cases where there is no suspicion of syphilis.It is mainly Kassowitz
and Bouchut who have taken the stand against Parrot.The former, taking
rachitis for a peculiar inflammatory process, admits that syphilis can
be one of the causes.The latter directs attention mainly to the fact
that by changing food in certain ways rachitis may be produced in dogs,
but that they cannot be made syphilitic.There is no doubt, however,
that syphilis may give rise to rachitis by its general influence on
nutrition, and in this fact lies the key to the connection of great
nutritive disorders with each other.Syphilis will undoubtedly change
nutrition to such an extent as to result in rachitis.Rachitis will
affect the glands; the caseous and suppurative degeneration of the
glands will lead to metastatic processes, to acute tuberculosis, and so
on.Malaria been claimed as the main cause of rachitis by Z.
Oppenheimer,[12] or, rather, rachitis is presumed by him to be the form
in which malaria makes its appearance in young infants.After disposing
of other alleged causes of rachitis, none of which is proved to give
rise to every case, and referring to the anatomical belief that the
peculiar hyperaemia and inflammation of rachitical bones is created by
the embryonic condition of the growing osseous tissue, he points to the
prodromi, amongst which he emphasizes chronic diarrhoea and the
nocturnal crying.The latter, with its perspiration and subsequent
sleep, he claims as evidence of malaria, and as a substitute for the
intermittent neuralgia of adults, the more so as he believes he finds
the spleen tumefied.The persistent diarrhoea of these infants is said
to be paroxysmal--to take place in the morning, contrary to what is
seen in the usual form of intestinal catarrh; the discharges are said
to be serous, not tinged with bile; the appetite to be good through the
rest of the day; the weight of the body not to be lessened, but anaemia
to develop gradually, and fever to occur occasionally.In other cases
infants have cold hands and feet and blue lips toward evening; the skin
is pale, the spleen enlarged; otherwise there are perhaps no symptoms,
but the infants try to get uncovered, and have an increase of
temperature of from 1 degree to nearly 3 degrees F., and a perspiring
head in the morning.After a while the rachitical symptoms belonging to
the bones and the general system become apparent.After all of the
author's ingenious and emphatic assertions and deductions, it becomes
evident that malaria--in the severe forms in which it has been found by
Arnstein, Browicz, and Henck to cause bone diseases--may give rise to
rachitis, but it is also clear that he tries to prove too much.The
long series of attempts at proving that every form and case of rachitis
depends upon a single and uniform cause have proved futile.The
physiological hyperaemia of the bones and the rapid growth of all the
infant tissues are shaped into the complex ailment which we call
rachitis by more than a single disease or a single nutritive
disturbance.{146} SYMPTOMS.--Before entering upon a more accurate and elaborate
enumeration of the symptoms of rachitis, I mean to dwell upon peculiar
differences which take place according to the age in which the disease
makes its appearance.Very young babies--that is, infants of a month or
two--develop rachitis in such a manner that many cases are overlooked
until it is too late to relieve them in time.This occurrence takes
place when there are no prominent causes, such as diarrhoea or other
nutritive disorders, nor any premonitory symptoms.Such infants appear
to be perfectly well; they have the average weight, and even more; they
have plenty of adipose tissue, and look well.The only anomaly appears
to be an undue degree of paleness.Without pain or flatulency they are
constipated.This constipation is not congenital, as it always is when
the colon is unusually long even for an infant, and when the sigmoid
flexure is of double or even treble length, but makes its first
appearance about the end of the first or the beginning of the second
month.It is relieved only when the increasing muscular power of the
intestine results in more effective peristalsis.The second symptom is
the thoracic groove, to which I shall allude later, and a gradual
thickening of the costo-cartilaginous junctures, with or without
periosteal pain on pressure.About the same time the cranial softening,
craniotabes, with its hyperaemia and perspiration of the entire scalp,
and baldness, and the first symptoms of maxillary rachitis, become
perceptible.During all this time the epiphysial swellings and the
diaphysial curvatures develop but very slowly; but at a very early time
chronic bronchial catarrh, with a loose cough, begins to be
troublesome.When rachitis begins at a late period--say, about the
sixth or eighth month--the aspect of the case is different.The infant
has suffered before either from bronchitis and broncho-pneumonia, or in
most cases from indigestion and intestinal catarrh.There is some
degree of emaciation; the skin does not fit the limbs, as it were--is
loose, thin, flabby, and rather dry.The tendency to diarrhoea
continues to prevail.The epiphyses, particularly of the lower
extremities, are thickened at an early time, curvatures of the tibiae
become apparent, and all the rest of the bones participate in the
process, with the exception, sometimes, of those of the head.The head, however, is liable to exhibit symptoms of rachitis at a very
early period of life.It is large, or appears to be so,[13] mostly for
the reason that the face is proportionately small.The forehead is
large, the frontal protuberances very prominent, as are also those of
the parietal bones.Thus, the head is more or less square.Dilated
veins are visible in and through the pale skin; there is but little
hair, on the occiput less than on the rest of the head.Sometimes the
occiput is quite bald, the hair having been rubbed off on the pillow.The scalp feels warm, except during perspiration.The latter is very
copious, particularly on the occiput--to such an extent, indeed, that
the pillow is drenched--and will remain so for months.The sebaceous
follicles are often still larger and more numerous than they normally
are at that age, and seborrhoea is {147} often, though not always, met
with.The sutures are wide, sometimes one or two centimeters; the
posterior fontanel remains open; the large anterior fontanel is very
large, being sometimes several inches long and wide.The pulse is felt
very distinctly through it.The systolic cerebral murmur, which was
first found by Fisher of Boston in 1833, and considered to be a
positive symptom of rachitis (which certainly it is not, as it is found
in almost every healthy baby with a patent fontanel), is very audible.The fontanel and sutures remain open for a long period.Instead of
closing, as they do normally at the fourteenth or fifteenth month, the
former ossifies about the end of the second or third year, or later.Gerhardt reports a case in which it persisted to the ninth year.The
cranial bones appear to be thin, and give way under the pressure of the
finger.Ordinarily, it is true, the cranial bones of every baby, even
if perfectly healthy, are movable under pressure, but they are so only
along the sutures, where they may retain this mobility, in some
instances, a long time.Indeed, it appears that sometimes about the
middle of the first year the occipital bone becomes thinned out in
apparently quite healthy children.Moreover, even in the skulls of
infants who were taken to be in good health small defects in the bones
were found (Friedleben), with no uncomfortable symptoms at all.Therefore it is rather difficult to draw the exact boundary-line
between the healthy and the morbid condition; thus it is possible that
some of those cases which exhibited apparently morbid local changes
without morbid symptoms may not have been diseased after all.In those,
however, in which rachitis is really developed in the cranium a
peculiar condition is found.In the posterior half or third of the
parietal bones, either the right or the left side being more marked,
there are in the tissue of the bone distinct spots in which the osseous
material is not only thinned out, but has entirely disappeared.In
fact, the bone is perforated, the edges of the holes being rather
steep, sometimes slightly thickened, and the scalp separated from the
brain only by a thin, transparent membrane, the remnant of the
periosteum.These holes can be easily found through the integument.The
finger, though ever so gently pressing down upon it, moves the cranium,
if any be left, before it; the bone feels like paper, and the sensation
as if it could be easily broken through is quite distinct and
embarrassing.Such perforations are usually quite numerous; from five
to twenty or more can often be counted.They are surrounded by normally
hard bone, and thereby can be recognized from the flexible part of the
cranium extending along the sagittal and lambdoid sutures.Where these
results of rachitical softening, craniotabes, are most prominent--that
is, on the part on which the infant is mostly reclining--the bone is
flattened, and may remain so for life, though in the majority of cases
the asymmetry will disappear.The flattening and perforations result
from the same causes--viz.softening of the bones and pressure upon the
bone between the pillow outside and the brain inside.With it go, hand
in hand, thick rachitical deposits under the hyperaemic periosteum of
other portions of the skull.Where craniotabes is largely developed on
the occipital portion, the frontal and the parietal bones (in their
anterior halves) are usually thus thickened.A cross-section with a
knife will reveal a diameter of the new osteoid material between the
periosteum and bone of one-half to one centimeter in thickness.It is
very hyperaemic--even more so than the bone itself, {148} which, when
cut into, exhibits an unusual amount of blood.Sometimes the deposits
are still larger, and are apt to change the appearance and weight of
the skull considerably after recovery has taken place and eburnation
and sclerosis have taken the place of the normal osseous tissue.[Footnote 13: Bootius (1649), quoted by Haller (_Bibl.pract._,
1779): "Infantibus caput grandescit, reliquum corpus contabescit, ossa
in articulis tument, dextrum hypochondrium tumore aequali prominet; hoc
malum multis millibus infantum molestum est" ("The infant head grows
large, the rest of the body emaciates, the articular bones swell, the
right hypochondrium is raised by a uniform tumor; this malady is a sore
affection in many thousands of infants").]Such a case of rachitical cranial sclerosis I have described in the
_Amer.It was, however, by no means a mate of
the case related by E. Huschke.The latter skull was that of a girl of
seventeen years, and weighed 4117 grammes instead of the normal weight
of 600 grammes.The medullary (Havers') canaliculi were large and very
numerous on the surface, narrow and very few in the interior of the
sclerotic bones, and the osseous canaliculi were more spherical and
irregular in site and shape.The chemical composition was also
abnormal, phosphate of lime being 65.59, carbonate of lime 11.12,
sulphate of magnesia 1.14, cartilage and fat (very little), etc.Most of the bones were
exceedingly hard, but fragile when tried in small pieces; very white
inside, yellowish on the surface, the latter color being the remnant of
extravasated blood or other pigmentous matter.Another skull, in
Huschke's possession, and moderately sclerotic, weighed (lower jaw
excluded) 1075 grammes; a third, in the museum of the University of
Jena, is that of a young baboon,[14] in which all the bones covering
the hemispheres had become sclerotic.[Footnote 14: Baboons suffer from rachitis very extensively.In the
_Transactions of the Pathological Society of London_ (xxxiv., 1883, pp.310, 312) I. B. Sutton gives the description of two baboons, one of
which was six months, the other one year and six months old, when they
died.The careful description of the specimens exhibited leaves no
doubt as to the rachitical nature of the changes in both the periosteum
and the tissue of all the bones of the body.]Of undoubted total cranio-sclerosis Huschke reports but ten
cases--those of Malpighi (1697), Cuvier (1822), Ribalt (1828), J.
Forster and Bojanus (1826), Ilg (1822), Kilian (1822), Otto (1822),
Vrolik (1848), Albers (1851), Huschke (1858).The disease does not
affect the auditory bones, the condyles of the maxillary and occipital
bones, nor the styloid process of the temporal bone.It is recognizable
in the posterior part of the cranium and basis cranii, but affects
mostly the bones of the face and the frontal, parietal, and cribroid
bones.Thus, the disease takes its origin in the anterior portion of
the skull, particularly in the superior maxilla, and proceeds upward
and backward, terminating in the basis cranii in the neighborhood of
the infundibulum and appendices.But two of all the cases were observed
during life.In all the disease was traced back to early life.The
chemical composition of the bones was greatly changed in all.Instead
of the normal proportion of earthy to organic material = 2.1 (or
1.5):1, it was from 3.5 to 4.4:1.Particularly the carbonate of lime
was greatly increased.The brain and its meninges participate, in many respects, in the
changes worked by rachitis, and mainly in the abnormal vascularization
of the bones.They are very much congested, and succulent.A section
through the brain shows a great many large and small blood-points.This
hyperaemia may give rise to over-nutrition, which assumes the character
of real hypertrophy of the brain.When that hyperaemia, however,
becomes excessive, effusion will take place into the cavities, the
tissue of the arachnoid, and the substance of the cerebrum, which
latter looks {149} peculiarly brilliant, elastic, and sometimes white,
in consequence of the blood-vessels being emptied by the pressure on
the part of the enlarged mass of the cerebrum upon the blood-vessels.Thus, instead of cerebral hyperaemia there may be anaemia.Every form
of hydrocephalus may follow the rachitical process.Afterward, when the
craniotabes has healed, the secondary effusions will generally also
disappear, but not a few cases of hydrocephalus may be traced to
rachitis occurring during the first half year of life.When that
occurs, the intellectual faculties may suffer, while, on the contrary,
complete recovery not infrequently exhibits an unusual degree of mental
development, for the same reason which improves the chances of the
development of the bone.The degrees of physiological and pathological
nutrition and over-nutrition are very variable in their nature and
results.This condition of the cranial contents is not the only one brought
about by rachitis.The softness of the cranial bones permits a direct
pressure on the brain.The side on which the infant for the most part
reposes gets flattened, and the brain is also compressed.The skull
consequently bulges out in the opposite direction.This anomaly, as
stated above, is sometimes visible through life, though in the large
majority of cases after recovery from rachitis has taken place this
asymmetry will gradually disappear.Before that can occur, however, the
infant is liable to suffer from the rachitical changes.Convulsions are
by no means rare.Vogel has, however, been able to produce an attack of
convulsions by pressing upon the softened spots of the cranium.Permanent or temporary contractures of the fingers and toes I have seen
in several instances.Gerhardt looks upon rachitis as one of the causes
of tetany.A frequent symptom of the cerebral changes which take place during, and
in consequence of, craniotabes is the crowing inspiration, or
laryngismus stridulus, of infants.The mild
form is very frequent, and consists in the occurrence of a shrill
inspiratory sound while the baby is either quite placid or excited or
crying.It is frequently overlooked entirely, is usually overcome after
a number of months, and gives rise to serious trouble in but very few
instances.While the baby is
awake or asleep, without any premonitory symptoms, while playing or
crying, placid or excited, all at once respiration will cease.This
will take place, usually, after expiration.The limbs are hanging down,
as it were lifeless, the face turns pale, then purple, and slight
convulsive twitching may set in for ten or twenty seconds.There
appears to be a complete paralysis, and death from apnoea seems to be
imminent.All at once, a long, deep crowing inspiration will be heard,
respiration will commence again, and the whole terrible attack is
overcome.It may return a number of times every day, or sometimes not
for several days, during a period of many weeks or several months.The
attacks which set in after inspiration are apt to be more dangerous.In
such an one, but also in the other kind which sets in after the
expiratory movement, death may occur suddenly, or the attack may be
followed by a convulsion which may terminate fatally like any other
eclamptic seizure.In this manner it is that the majority of cases of
rachitis perish which terminate fatally during the active progress of
the morbid process.In this connection, however, it may be well to add
that craniotabes is not the only cause of laryngismus, particularly
when the {150} latter is found in the second year of life, or even
later.But almost every case, without any exception, which is observed
during the first eight or nine months is due to that very cause; and a
good many cases occurring later, when the craniotabic bones have become
normal, arise from the effects, either meningeal or encephalic, of the
rachitic process.Still, complications of craniotabes with a large size
of the thymus gland may occur, and enlargements of the tracheal and
bronchial lymphatic glands are quite frequent, as we shall see
below.[15]

[Footnote 15: Z. Oppenheimer prefers the name rachitic asthma in place
of laryngismus, and suggests an explanation of the symptoms from a
strictly anatomical point of view.If not correct, it is at all events
interesting, as everything this ingenious writer proposes.He points to
the ligament situated between the spinae intrajugulares of the temporal
and occipital bones, which, as long as it is of normal consistency,
separates the jugular vein from the pneumogastric nerve.As it is
covered with periosteum and dura, it is apt to ossify, and forms an
osseous partition in the foramen jugulare, which participates in all
the changes taking place in the periosteum.As this becomes softened
and succulent, so will the ligament, either on both sides or on either.Its influence on the neighborhood depends on its size or succulence (as
also on the difference in width of the foramen jugulare or lacerum,
which corresponds with the difference in size of the transverse
sinuses).The irritation of the pneumogastric is perhaps easily
explained thereby, but in very exceptional cases only the accessory
nerve would be affected.As, however, the latter controls the
sterno-cleido mastoid and trapezius, and also the laryngeal muscles,
and is apt to provoke cardiac paralysis during diastole, the occurrence
of sudden death would be best accounted for.]While the size of the cranium is normal, or sometimes more than normal,
the face undergoes some changes which result in absolute or relative
diminution of size.These depend mostly on a reduction in the volume of
the jaws.Glisson knew of it, and therefore looked for the cause of
rachitis in the process of dentition.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Now, both maxillae are liable to
become rachitical at an early date, as early indeed as the bones of the
cranium.Rachitical deposits and softening take place in them very
generally.The lower maxilla is flat anteriorly, it loses its rounded
outline, is shorter in longitudinal direction, while the rami are thick
and clumsy; the whole bone is shorter than normal, and sometimes
asymmetric.Its changed appearance is greatly due to the effect the
muscles, with their powerful insertions, produce on the softened bone;
mainly the masseter, also the mylohyoid, which draws the lateral
portions inward, and the geniohyoid, which pulls at the central
portion.Of the latter, the lower portion is drawn out, the inner and
the alveolar part inward.Thus, the teeth, mainly the incisors, of the
lower jaw are turned inward to such an extent that, as those of the
upper look outward, the two rows of teeth do not touch but cover each
other.Besides, the periosteal proliferation around the alveoli is
excessive, sometimes so much so as not only to crowd the teeth into
irregular positions, but even to absorb and annihilate alveolar
processes in the course of the morbid changes.The cases in which the
number of teeth are actually diminished by rachitis are not at all
rare.In the superior maxilla the last-described anomaly is also
observed.Periosteal thickening is mainly noticed about the
intermaxillary bone--sometimes to such an extent that above and behind
it a considerable impression takes place.The shape of the upper jaw is
more spherical than normal, and the cheek-bones become very prominent.The belief that maxillary rachitis is now and then met without any
other symptom of rachitis I do not share.What I said of craniotabes is
also valid in regard to this form.{151} Irregular teething is a constant companion of maxillary rachitis,
but is also present where the latter is not well, or not at all,
marked.As a rule, the first teeth protrude late, about the ninth or
tenth or twelfth month.That the first year and more should elapse
without any tooth is of frequent occurrence in rachitis.Cases in which
the first teeth do not come before the second year is completed are not
very uncommon; in some there are none even when the child is much
older.In most cases the retardation of dentition goes hand in hand
with very marked retardation in the development of the rest of the
bones and in the closure of the cranial fontanel.But not in every case
of rachitis is there a retardation in the process of teething.In some
a few teeth appear at the regular period (at the completion of the
seventh or eighth month), or even at a very early age (in the fourth or
fifth month); after which there is an interruption in the protrusion of
teeth for an indefinite period.Evidently, the period in which rachitis
is developed exerts its influence on the teething process.When it
exists at a very early age, it will <DW44> teething until recovery
takes place.Still, it is possible that a moderate amount of periosteal
and osteal hyperaemia and over-irritation matures the teeth abnormally.In all those cases, however, in which rachitis does not occur before
the second half of the first year, the first teeth will appear at the
normal time, and a long period will follow in which no teeth at all
will make their appearance.Then, again, when the whole process comes
to a standstill, and recovery takes place with solidification of the
bones, and even eburnation, the teeth will come in rapid succession.Whether they will, as is frequent, decay almost as soon as formed, or
whether they will be unusually hard, solid, and yellowish, depends on
the stage of the disease in which they made their appearance, and on
the complications aggravating the case.Of very grave import in this
respect are digestive disorders before and during the course of the
disease.In the normal infant it is straight,
but in the rachitic it exhibits a kyphotic deformity very soon.When
such a baby of three or six months is sitting up, the middle portion of
the back is protruding, as in Pott's disease.In almost every case,
however, this kyphosis is but apparent and the result of muscular
debility.In order to arrive at a diagnosis at once, it is sufficient
to place the patient on his face and support the head, and raise the
lower extremities and pelvis in the air.If the kyphosis is but
functional, the prominence disappears at once.By nothing can the
muscular insufficiency of early rachitis be better demonstrated than by
this little experiment.But actual deformity is also found in rachitis.It softens both the vertebrae and intervertebral cartilages, and either
their anterior or posterior portion may be irregularly developed, and
be either too high or too low.Besides, the articulating surfaces are
sometimes too convex.Thus the causes of both kyphosis and scoliosis
are amply furnished, and complications of the two are quite frequent,
and the deformities resulting therefrom quite formidable.Scoliosis is
mostly to the left; kyphosis generally complicated with lordosis, and
sometimes the vertebral column exhibits a spiral shape.The ribs of the convex half are prominent and divergent, those of the
concave side flattened and parallel.The two halves of the chest are
therefore very unequal indeed.Muscular traction, atmospheric pressure,
{152} the elastic traction of the lungs, the presence of pulmonary
complications, and the pressure from below on the part of the enlarged
viscera of the abdominal cavity, come also in for a considerable share
in the completion of the deformity.The ribs and the sternum aggravate it considerably.Even without any
affection of the vertebral column they suffer seriously from the
general affection.The manubrium is thickened and drawn inward, the
ensiform process protuberant, the sternum often swelled and painful to
the touch.The ribs are sensitive to the touch on one or both sides.The child cries when taken up or when fearing to be taken up.The
costo-cartilaginous junctures are thickened, mainly so from the fourth
to the eighth ribs.The insertion of the diaphragm becomes soon
perceptible by a deep groove around the chest.The anterior portion of
the ribs is flattened, posteriorly they are inserted at acute angles.Thus the intrathoracic space becomes narrow, the sternum with the
costal cartilages is pressed forward (pigeon breast, pectus carinatum),
the thorax is deprived of its elliptical shape and becomes triangular,
the dorsal aspect being flattened, and the distance between the
vertebral column and the sternum increased.Below the diaphragmatic
groove the thorax expands, the liver and other abdominal organs
crowding the ribs outward.All sorts of changes are experienced by the
ribs in these conditions.Parts of them are flattened, parts undergo
infraction, parts are even concave; they are bent and twisted, now and
then to such an extent as to turn the concave side out, the convex
surface in.In addition to all this, the scapula is big and clumsy and
protuberant, the clavicle considerably bent and frequently infracted,
and not rarely covered with genuine callus.That the respiratory and circulatory organs must suffer from such
anomalies, though they be not excessive, is certain.The heart is
crowded by the flattening of the ribs and the contraction of the
thoracic cavity.Its beat is visible over a large surface, and its
percussion dulness is extended over its normal space, though no
enlargement have taken place.This, however, is very apt to occur after
some time by overexertion.The latter is increased by the condition of
the respiratory organs.The ribs being flexible, the chest contracted
and compressed, the diaphragm raised, the respiratory muscles feeble,
respiration is insufficient, even without the presence of any further
complications; thus dyspnoea and a certain amount of cyanosis are
frequently met with in consequence of the anatomical changes only.In
addition to this, there is from the beginning a tendency to catarrhal
and inflammatory conditions.Even without any deformity the rachitical
process is accompanied from an early time with bronchial and tracheal
catarrh.A chronic cough in an infant, with very little or no fever,
disappearing and returning, mostly with copious secretion--which,
however, is swallowed as soon as it reaches the pharynx--rouses the
suspicion of general rachitis.It is often complicated with extensive
dulness over the manubrium sterni, due (to rachitical thickening of
this bone and) mostly to the persistence of a large size of the thymus
gland; and also with enlargement of the bronchial and tracheal glands,
the latter of which are often accessible to recognition by percussion.They are to be looked upon as a frequent occurrence in rachitis, though
no associated diseases leading to their enlargement have been noticed.They and the chronic tracheo-bronchial {153} catarrh are closely
dependent upon each other.They are each other's both cause and effect.Neither of them, however, remain uncomplicated.Catarrh grows into
broncho-pneumonia, with frequent returns.Atelectasis, interstitial
pneumonia, dilatation of bronchi, and pulmonary consumption are often
traceable to such apparently slight catarrhs, which, when not
recognized as depending on their constitutional cause, cannot be
removed.Nor are the cases of miliary tuberculosis, resulting from
caseous degeneration of rachitical glands, very exceptional.The anatomical changes in the abdominal viscera may be due to the
preparatory diseases or the complications of rachitis; but, at all
events, the abdomen yields a number of changes visible through the
whole duration of rachitis.It is very large; its size is due to the
contraction of the thoracic cavity and the downward pressure of the
chest-wall upon the contents of the abdominal cavity.It is also due to
the changes wrought by rachitis in the pelvis.Softening of bones and
synchondroses, torsion, the weight of the trunk, and the pressure of
the femora from below produce the change of the pelvis so well known
and much feared in the parturient female.The promontory and sacrum are
pushed in, the arcus pubis is large, the pelvis asymmetric; the small
pelvis is contracted, the large pelvis broader.Thus, the small pelvis
has no room for viscera, which, then, are crowded upward.The digestive
disorders which gave rise to, or formed the first stage of, rachitis
result in the accumulation of gas; the scrobiculus cordis is greatly
expanded.The liver[16] is large, congested, and in fatty degeneration.The latter is the more frequent the more a certain degree of fatty
condition is a normal attribute of every infant liver.When the liver
is found but small in post-mortem examination, it is so because of the
general anaemia and emaciation.Sometimes it is amyloid, as are also
the spleen (mostly hyperplastic only), the kidneys, and the arteries of
the intestines in many instances.Norman Moore presented a cast and drawing to the
Pathological Society of London (_Trans._, vol.185)
showing how considerable may be the digressions of the diaphragm and
local pressure upon the liver in a case of rickets.Three large beads
caused as many projections from the under side of the diaphragm, and
corresponded with local thickenings of the capsule of the liver,
probably produced by the continued pressure through the diaphragm of
the beads, which were on the seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, and the
largest of which was equal in size to a hazel-nut.]The alimentary tract is the seat of many changes recognizable during
life.The tongue is seldom coated to an
unusual degree.On it are found little islands, red, marginated,
deprived of epithelium.They will increase in size and number and
extend backward.They are by no means
syphilitic, as Parrot would have it, and correspond exactly with the
erosions near the solitary glands and those of Lieberkuhn in the
intestinal part, which mean nothing else but a nutritive disorder of
the epithelia, and give rise to nothing worse than incompetency of
absorption in that locality and abnormal secretion.The stomach is in a
condition of chronic catarrh, sometimes dilated.Acid dyspepsia is
frequent.Anorexia and bulimia will alternate.Feces contain an
abnormally large amount of lime.Diarrhoea and constipation will follow
each other in short intervals.The former owes its origin to faulty
ingesta or chronic catarrh; the latter, sometimes to improper food, but
more generally to muscular insufficiency.{154} This condition has not
been estimated at its proper value.Besides myself,[17] nobody but Bohn
has paid the attention to it which it deserves.Here, again, I have to
insist that rachitis is a disease of the whole system, and not
exclusively of the bones.Indeed, the muscular system is amongst the
first to suffer.In the same way in which the voluntary muscles are not
competent to raise and support the head or to allow a baby to sit up
without a functional kyphosis, the involuntary muscles of the intestine
are too feeble for normal peristalsis.The infant of a month or two
months of age may have had normal and sufficiently numerous
evacuations; gradually, however, constipation sets in; the feces become
dry, but are perhaps not much changed otherwise.If no other cause be
apparent, the suspicion of rachitical constipation is justified.Seldom, however, after it has lasted some time--and only after some
time has elapsed relief will be sought--it will remain alone.Other
symptoms of rachitis will turn up and the case be easily recognized.This constipation is an early symptom, as early as thoracic grooving or
craniotabes.Very often it precedes both--is, in fact, the very first
symptom--and ought therefore be known and recognized in time.Obst., etc._, Aug., 1869.]Though the fact has been alluded to before, I will here again
state that it has always been the general impression that the amount of
lime eliminated in the urine of rachitic children is excessive.Seemann and Lander have proved beyond dispute
that in most stages of rachitis there is less than the normal amount of
lime in the urine.Thus, the theory that lime is eliminated by an
excess of acids in the blood is proven to be incorrect.But it is a
fact that the rachitical bone contains a proportionately small amount
of lime.The conclusion is, then, that its introduction must have been
diminished.On the other hand, every article of food contains a large
amount of lime, which might be introduced into the circulation if
digestion be not at fault.The fact is, that a large amount of lime
introduced is not utilized, and is eliminated with the feces.In connection with these facts the following will be found very
interesting.It has been found by Bunge that when potassium, with the
exception of chloride of potassium, meets chloride of sodium, the two
will exchange their acids, so as to form chloride of potassium and
phosphate of sodium.They will be found in the blood also, will be
eliminated as such, and result in a comparative absence of chloride of
sodium from the serum of the blood.Now, comparative absence of
chloride of sodium diminishes the possibility of the development of
hydrochloric acid.Thus, it is not a surplus of acid, but a lack of
hydrochloric acid, which results from such chemical combinations.If
such be the case, calcium salts are not absorbed sufficiently.Thus,
they will appear in the feces, and not even be absorbed in the
intestines, because of the alkalinity of the intestinal secretion, by
which the lime cannot be dissolved.The more lime, then, is introduced
under these circumstances, the greater the incumbrance to digestion.The correct proportion between chlorine, phosphorus, potassium, and
sodium is certainly exhibited in woman's milk.There is lime enough in
even the poorest article of that kind.But indigestion brought on by
{155} woman's milk in a disordered condition or by any other cause will
prevent the absorption of lime when a superabundance of phosphorus and
potassium disturbs the formation of hydrochloric acid.In these cases
not only the development of the bones, but also that of the muscles, is
disturbed.The latter is of great importance in regard to circulation,
because a large part of the circulation depends on the pressure on the
part of the muscular fibres exerted on the small blood-vessels.These
facts have been the reason why I insist upon the addition of chloride
of sodium to the food of infants and children, particularly those who
are fed on cow's milk; for cow's milk and vegetables contain a relative
superabundance of potassium compared with sodium.Even adults will find
cow's milk very much more digestible by adding table-salt to it.The extremities begin to suffer at a later period than the ribs and
cranium.The opinion of Guerin, that the rachitical process begins in
the lower extremities and ascends gradually, is erroneous.It cannot
even be stated that the lower extremities are affected sooner than the
upper.There is no regularity at all; it is not even necessary that all
the osseous tissue should fall sick.But this can be taken as a fact,
that hands and feet, and particularly the phalanges, are the latest to
undergo the rachitical change.First in the line of morbid alteration
of the bones are the epiphyses, mainly of the tibia, fibula, radius,
and ulna.Their integument appears to be thin; now and then the
cutaneous veins are dilated.The periosteum of the diaphysis becomes
thick, softened, and painful to the touch and pressure, its compact
layer thin, the medullary space large, the whole bone flexible, at the
same time that the ligamentous apparatus of the joint becomes softened
and flabby.At this time babies are greatly admired and applauded for
the facility with which they introduce their feet into their mouths.For at the same time the bones begin to curve under the influence of
the flexor muscles, which are always stronger, as they do in later
months under the weight of the body when the child begins to walk.The
curvature is not always a mere arching, but sometimes the result of
infraction (green-stick fracture), a complete fracture not being
accomplished because both of the softness of the osseous tissue and the
resistance on the part of the thickened and softened periosteum.Both
the legs and forearm bend on the external side, the resulting concavity
looking inward.The humerus bends in a direction opposite to that of
the forearm; the thigh, usually outward and forward.The attempts at locomotion are often the causes of quite preposterous
anomalies; creeping, sliding, walking, turn the extremities in such
unexpected directions that talipes valgus, genu valgum, and now and
then double curvatures, are the results.These, however, may not always
be very marked, but there is one change in the rachitical bone which is
constant--viz.In every case the
diaphyses remain abnormally short, and the proportion of the several
parts of the body are thereby disturbed.Chiari measured parts of the
skeleton of a rachitical woman of twenty-six years who was nine years
old before she could walk.Her height was 116 centimeters, the length
of the lower extremities 42, femur 23, tibia 15, fibula 20, humerus 16,
right radius 12.5, left radius 11, right ulna 15, left ulna 14
centimeters.In a second case the parts of the skeleton were measured
after they had {156} been extended with great care.The right arm from
the acromion to the middle finger (incl.)was 39 centimeters, the left
38; the right lower extremity from the trochanter to large toe (incl.)The skin participates in the general nutritive disorder.In those infants who become rachitical gradually while proving
their malnutrition by the accumulation of large quantities of fat, it
exhibits a certain degree of consistency.When rachitis develops in the
second half of the first year or later, with the general emaciation the
skin appears very thin, flabby, unelastic.Complications with eczema and impetigo are very frequent; where
they are found the glandular swellings of the neck and below are still
more marked than in uncomplicated cases.Circumscribed alopecia is
sometimes found (not to speak of the extensive baldness of the
occiput).It is not attended with or depending on the microsporon
Audouini, but the result of a tropho-neurosis.In the hair Rindfleisch
found fat-globules between its inferior and central third.Then it
would break, the axial evolution would cease, and the end become
bulbous by the new formation of cells.There is a form of rachitis which may be, and has been, called multiple
epiphysitis or multiple periostitis of the articular ends of the long
bones.The changes which in the usual form of rachitis require months
to develop take place in a very short time.Not infrequently the
children were quite well before they were taken with this peculiar
affection.Cases have been known to occur between the fourth and
twenty-fourth months of life, and to last from two to six weeks, or
just as many months.They have been known to get well, or a few of them
terminate fatally.They are accompanied with fever and rapid pulse,
perspiration, now and then with diarrhoea, with eager or reduced
appetites.At the same time the epiphyses swell very rapidly, and are
painful.The same is true of the diaphyses and the flat bones of the
head.Many authors do not recognize this form as an independent
variety.Some call it an acute initial stage of certain cases of
rachitis, as they are not infrequently found in infants which exhibit a
very rapid growth.Some have taken it as an independent disease,
developed on the basis of a constitutional disposition; some look upon
it as a very intense acute form of rachitis; others, as an intense
growth of the osseous tissue only.Others call it an inflammation of
the bone.Some refer it to hereditary syphilis, and a few to the
influence of malaria.That the disease is epiphysitis and periostitis
there is no doubt.I do not hesitate to claim it as rachitis, for
epiphysitis and periostitis of early age not of rachitical basis are
not apt to run such a favorable course as this form frequently does.The cases complicated with subperiosteal hemorrhages are claimed as
scurvy by Th.The differences of opinion would probably not have been so great if
every author had seen all the cases of the other observers.It will not
do to judge of unobserved cases by the light shed by a single case
under one's own observation.I have seen cases of acute rachitis which
were {157} the initial stages of general rachitis, and have observed
those of local or multiple epiphysitis, mainly after infectious fevers,
which were diagnosticated as such.But even without a preceding infectious fever, such as scarlatina or
more frequently typhoid fever, there are unexplained cases of rachitis
and deformity.Thus, R. Barwell had some before the Pathological
Society of London,[18] which are positive proofs that some forms of
ostitis may occur and result in the most formidable deformities without
being rachitical.A girl of seventeen years was perfectly well formed
up to the age of two and a half or three years.After that time the
deformities began to develop, and did not change after she was
thirteen, at which time the author saw her the first time.Her left humerus measured 7-3/4 inches from shoulder to elbow;
    distance 6-1/4
  Her right humerus measured 7-1/2 inches from shoulder to elbow;
    distance 4-1/4
  Her left tibia measured 10 inches from knee to ankle; distance 7-1/4
  Her right tibia measured 9-1/2 inches from knee to ankle;
    distance 4-1/2

Her bones were always very brittle.When she was between nine and
thirteen she broke her arms four times and her lower limbs on several
occasions.A male patient of twenty-two years, who was born healthy and
well formed, continued thus until five years of age, when he was
attacked with a fever, after which his bones became soft and bent.Osteotomy was performed on him, and the femora were found to be mere
thin shells of bones surrounding cavities containing great quantities
of medulla, which flowed out of the wound as oil; five ounces were
discharged at once.In both cases there appeared to be a hypertrophy of
the medulla at the expense of the bone-substance--a condition which
Barwell proposes to call eccentric atrophy."While these subjects are
still youthful very little bone-earth is deposited, or at least remains
in the very thin layer of osseous tissue that subsists.The
relationship between infantile ostitis and extreme development of the
intraosseous fat, though well known, is still occult; neither should we
lose sight of the possibility that the softening process of ostitis may
be due to a fatty acid.Now, fatty ostitis usually occurs in epiphyses.[Footnote 18: _Trans._, xxxiv., 1883, pp.PROGNOSIS.--The course and the prognosis of rachitis are, as a rule,
favorable, but they change according to the degree and locality of the
affection and the age of the patient.Generally there is neither fever
nor rapid exhaustion.But the process lasts for months and even years.In favorable cases, when recovery takes place the teeth will grow
faster, the bones become firmer, the epiphyses will diminish in
relative size, the bowels become regular.But the length of the bones
is, and remains, reduced, and the head remains large as compared with
the length of the body.Not only are the bones of normal firmness, but
the compact substance undergoes a process of hardening called
eburnation by Guerin.The internal organs also become very active,
perhaps because the total amount of blood has to supply only a body
less extended in length.Nor does the brain suffer after complete
recovery has taken place.On the contrary, it appears that the somewhat
more than normal vascular dilatation, which under unfavorable
circumstances leads to effusion, is {158} frequently apt to nourish the
organ of intellect up to a higher standard.In all cases of rachitis,
however, the curvatures of the extremities will not disappear
altogether, while mild ones, it is true, are hardly recognizable in
advanced age.Curvature of the ribs and of the vertebral column,
however, will remain, and interfere with the expansion and the normal
functions of the lungs and heart.In regard to the lungs, it appears
that in many cases they do not find sufficient space to expand.As far
as the heart is concerned, it touches the flattened, no longer
elliptic, chest-wall over a larger surface, and is very apt to give
rise to the suspicion of enlargement in consequence of extended dulness
on percussion.The rachitic pelvis is well known to the obstetrician
for the difficulties it gives rise to during parturition.Thus, the prognosis would, as a general thing, be sufficiently
favorable if it were not for the number of complications or severe
symptoms.The chronic catarrh of the lungs accompanying rachitis, the
enlargement of the tracheal and bronchial glands and the lymphatic
glands in general, are apt to lead to inflammatory disease of the
lungs, which, after having returned several times, leads to
infiltration of the lungs with caseous deposits, and not infrequently
results in phthisis.The nervous symptoms accompanying craniotabes may
prove very dangerous.Spasm of the larynx and laryngismus stridulus may
prove fatal in a single attack by suffocation, or general convulsion
may set in during an attack of laryngismus or without it, in which the
child may perish.Therefore the prognosis in every case of laryngismus
and in every case of craniotabes has to be very guarded.It is my rule
to wait from six to eight weeks before giving expression to a decided
prognosis, because during that time medicinal and dietetic treatment
will probably have resulted in such an improvement of the symptoms and
condition as to render the prognosis more favorable.Under no
circumstances, however, ought we to lose sight of the fact that, though
rachitis may disappear, the causes leading to it may still linger on.Defective nutrition, diseases of the lungs, and intestinal affections
which gave rise to or accompanied rachitis will complicate the
prognosis, though rachitis itself, as far as the bones were concerned,
be no longer in existence.TREATMENT.--To meet the cause of a disease by preventive measures is
the main object and duty of the physician.He thus either obviates a
malady or relieves and shortens it.Now, if the original disposition to
rachitis, as has been suggested, is to be looked for in early
intra-uterine life, when the blood-vessels begin to form and to
develop, we know of no treatment directed to the pregnant woman or
uterus which promises any favorable result.But the more we recognize
an anatomical cause of the chronic disorder, the more we can appreciate
the influence upon the child of previous rachitis in the mother, and
are justified in emphasizing the necessity on the part of the woman to
be healthy when she gets married, and to remain so while she is
pregnant.After the child is born the most frequent cause of rachitis
is found within the diet or the digestion of the patient.To attend to
the former is in almost every instance equal to preventing disorders of
the latter; for most of the digestive disturbances during infancy and
childhood are the direct consequences of errors in diet.It is,
however, impossible to write an essay on infant diet in connection with
our subject.I have elaborated the subject in my {159} _Infant Diet_
(2d ed.1876), in the first volume of Buck's _Hygiene_, and of C.
Gerhardt's _Handbuch d. Kinderk._ (2d ed.Still, the importance
of the subject requires that some points should be given, be they ever
so aphoristic.The best food for an infant, under ordinary circumstances, is the milk
of its mother.The best substitute for the mother is a wet-nurse.Woman's milk ought not to be dispensed with when there is the slightest
opportunity to obtain it, particularly when the family history is not
good and nutritive disorders are known to exist, or to have existed, in
any of its members.When it cannot be had, artificial food must take
its place, and it is in the selection of it where most mistakes are
constantly made.This much is certain, that without animal's milk no
infant can or ought to be brought up; as ass's milk can be had only
exceptionally, and dog's milk, which has been said to cure rachitis, is
still less available, the milk of either goat or cow must be utilized.The former ought not to be selected if the latter is within reach,
mainly for the reason that it contains, besides other objectionable
features which it possesses in common with cow's milk, an enormous
percentage of fat.Cow's milk differs in this from woman's milk, that
it contains more fat, more casein, more potassium, and less sugar than
the latter, and that its very casein is not only different in quantity,
but also in chemical properties.Even the reaction of the two milks is
not the same, woman's milk being always alkaline, cow's milk often
either neutral or amphoteric, and liable to acidulate within a short
time.Thus, the dilution of cow's milk with water alone yields no
equivalent at all of woman's milk, though the dilution be large enough
to reduce the amount of casein in the mixture to the requisite
percentage of one, and one only, in a hundred.The addition of sugar
(loaf-sugar) and of table-salt, and sometimes alkali (bicarbonate of
sodium or lime-water, according to special circumstances), is the least
that can be insisted upon.Besides, the cow's milk must be boiled to
prevent its turning sour too rapidly, and this process may be repeated
to advantage several times in the course of the day.Instead of water,
some glutinous substance must be used for the purpose of diluting cow's
milk.As its casein coagulates in hard, bulky curds, while woman's milk
coagulates in small and soft flakes, some substance ought to be
selected which keeps its casein in suspension and prevents it from
curdling in firm and large masses.Such substances are gum-arabic,
gelatin, and the farinacea.Of the latter, all such must be avoided
which contain a large percentage of amylum.The younger the baby, the
less is it in a fit condition to digest starch; thus arrowroot, rice,
and potatoes ought to be shunned.The very best of all farinacea to be
used in diluting cow's milk are barley and oatmeal.A thin decoction of
either contains a great deal of both nutritious and glutinous elements,
the former to be employed under ordinary circumstances, the latter to
take its place where there is, on the part of the baby, an unusual
tendency to constipation.The decoction may be made of from one to
three teaspoonfuls of either in a pint of water; boil with a little
salt, and stir, from twelve to twenty minutes, and strain through a
coarse cloth.Then mix with cow's
milk in different proportions according to the age of the baby.Four
parts of the decoction, quite thin, and one of milk (always with
loaf-sugar), for a newly-born, equal parts for an infant of six months,
{160} and gradual changes between these two periods, will be found
satisfactory.Whenever there is a prevalence of curd in the passage the
percentage in the food of cow's milk must be reduced, and now and then
such medicinal correctives resorted to as will improve a disturbed
digestion.Care ought to be taken lest for the newly-born or quite
young the preparations of barley offered for sale contain too much
starch.The whiter they are, the more unfit for the use of the very
young, for the centre of the grain contains the white and soft amylum
in preference to the nitrogenous substances which are found near the
husk.Thus, it is safest to grind, on one's own coffee-grinder, the
whole barley, but little deprived of its husk, and thus secure the most
nutritious part of the grain, which is thrown out by the manufacturer
of the ornamental and tidy packages offered for sale.But very few
cases will ever occur in which the mixtures I recommend will not be
tolerated.In a few of them, in very young infants, the composition
recommended by Meigs[19] has proved successful.It consists of three
parts of a solution of milk-sugar (drachm xvij-3/4 in pint j of water),
two parts of cream, two of lime-water, and one part of milk.For each
feeding he recommends three tablespoonfuls of the sugar solution, two
of lime-water, two of cream, and one of milk: mix and warm.The baby
may take all of it, or one-half, or three-fourths.The recommendations given above are based on a long experience, and the
simplicity, cheapness, and facility of preparation of the articles.The
substitutes offered for sale under the title of infant foods are in
part worthless, all of them expensive when compared with the simple
articles recommended by me, and not recognizable as to their uniformity
and compounds.But no matter how appropriate my mixture may be, it is
always for the young infant to be considered as a makeshift.It is to
be used as a representative of mother's milk only when this cannot be
had.Sandra moved to the office.Therefore it is better to alternate with breast-milk when this is
secreted in but an insufficient quantity.Some good breast-milk is
better than none at all; but with this proviso, that it _is_ good.There are some milks either too watery or too dense and white.The
former will produce diarrhoea, the latter hard and dense curd.The
former may be improved by feeding and strengthening an anaemic and
overworked mother; the latter, by giving the baby, before each nursing,
a tablespoonful of a mixture of barley-water and lime-water, or, when
it produces constipation, lime-water and thoroughly sweetened
oatmeal-water.The cases in which breast-milk, such as can be had, is
not digested by the infant are rare, but they will occur.In them the
proper substitute will yield a better result than mother's milk; for
mother's milk will not always be a boon, and must then be dispensed
with.Particularly is this so when it is too old.Weaning ought to take
place when the first group or the first two groups of teeth have made
their appearance.After that time mother's milk is no longer the proper
food, and instead of preventing indigestion and sickness it is a
frequent cause of them and of rachitis.Instead of muscle, it will then
give fat, and the large fontanels and big head, the paleness of the
rotund cheeks, the flabbiness of the soft abdomen and thighs, will tell
the story of rachitical disease slowly engendered by the persistent
employment of an improper article of food.I cannot insist too often on
this, that rachitis may develop with increasing weight, {161} and that
the use of the scales alone is no means of ascertaining the healthy
condition of a baby.As much harm, therefore, can be done by weaning
too late as by so doing too early or too abruptly.At that early age we treat of here, digestive disorders are more
frequently the results of improper diet than of a primary gastric
disturbance.But when the latter is once established it furnishes its
own indications.A frequent occurrence, together with a general gastric
catarrh, is the presence of fat acids in the stomach, such as an
improper amount of lactic, acetic, butyric, etc.Before
digestion can be anything like normal they must be neutralized.For
that purpose calcined magnesia, carbonate and bicarbonate of sodium,
prepared chalk, and lime-water have been found useful.The latter, as
it contains but a trifle of lime, in order to neutralize must be given
in larger doses than is usually done; a tablespoonful contains but a
quarter of a grain of lime.And all of the alkalies must not be given
in the food only, but also between meals.For when given in the former
way alone it neutralizes the abnormal and injurious acids, together
with the normal digestive secretion, the lactic and muriatic.Not
infrequently, when the infants have suffered for some time, general
anaemia will set in, and result in diminishing the normal secretions of
the mucous membranes (and glands).In those cases which do not produce
their own gastric juice in sufficient quantity or quality pepsin and
muriatic acid may be given to advantage.In these cases the plan
suggested by me is particularly favorable--viz.to add a fair amount of
chloride of sodium (one-half to one drachm daily) to the infant's food.Also that of I. Rudisch referred to by me previously,[20] who mixes one
part of dilute muriatic acid with two hundred and fifty of water and
five hundred of milk, and then boils (one-half teaspoonful of dil.acid, one pint of water, one quart of milk).Again, there are the cases
in which wine and the bitter tinctures, which are known to increase the
secretion of gastric juice, render valuable service.The addition of
bismuth to any of the proposed plans is quite welcome.As a
disinfectant and a mild cover on sore and eroded mucous membranes it
has an equally good effect.Obstet._, July, 1879.]Under the head of roborants we subsume such substances, either dietetic
or remedial, which are known or believed to add to the ingredients of
the organism in a form not requiring a great deal of change.Rachitical
infants require them at an early period.Meat-soups, mainly of beef,
and of mutton in complications with diarrhoea, ought to be given at
once when the diagnosis of rachitis becomes clear or probable.Any mode
of preparation will prove beneficial; the best way, however, is to
utilize the method used by Liebig in making what he called beef-tea.A
quarter of a pound of beef or more, tender and lean, cut up finely, is
mixed with a cup or a tumbler of water and from five to seven drops of
dilute muriatic acid.Allow it to stand two hours and macerate, while
stirring up now and then.This beef-tea can be much improved upon by
boiling it a few minutes.It may be given by itself or mixed with
sweetened and salted barley-water or the usual mess of barley-water and
milk which the infant has been taking before.Older infants,
particularly those suffering from diarrhoea, take a teaspoonful of raw
beef, cut very fine, several times a day.It ought not to be forgotten,
however, {162} that the danger of developing taenia medio-canellata
from eating raw beef is rather great.Peptonized beef preparations are
valuable in urgent cases.Iron must not be given during any attack of catarrhal or inflammatory
fever.The carbonate (cum saccharo) combines very well with bismuth; a
grain three times a day, or less, will answer well.The citrate of iron
and quinine (a few grains daily) can be given a long time in
succession.The syrup of the iodide of iron (three times a day as many
drops as the baby has months up to eight or ten), in sweetened water or
in sherry or malaga, or in cod-liver oil, acts very favorably when the
case is, as so frequently, complicated with glandular swelling.Cod-liver oil, one-half to one teaspoonful or more, three times a day,
is a trusted roborant in rachitis, and will remain so.Animal oils are
so much more homogeneous to the animal mucous membrane than vegetable
oil that they have but little of the purgative effect observed when the
latter are given.The former are readily absorbed, and thus permit the
nitrogenous ingesta to remain in store for the formation of new tissue,
but still affect the intestinal canal sufficiently to counteract
constipation.As the latter is an early symptom in a peculiarly
dangerous form of rachitis, cod-liver oil ought to be given in time (in
craniotabes).Diarrhoea is but seldom produced by it; if so, the
addition of a grain or two of bismuth or a few doses of phosphate of
lime (one to four grains each) daily, may suffice to render the
movements more normal.There are but few cases which will not tolerate
cod-liver oil at all.The pure cod-liver oil--no mixtures, no
emulsions--ought to be given; the large quantities of lime added to it
in the nostrums of the wholesale apothecaries embarrass digestion and
bring on distressing cases of constipation.These mixtures have been
prepared and are eulogized on the plea of their furnishing to the bones
the wanting phosphate of lime.The bones, however, as we have seen
before, are not grateful enough to accept the service offered.But only
a certain amount of phosphate of lime is useful in rachitis and in
digestive disturbances.In small doses it neutralizes acids like other
alkalies; its phosphoric acid combines with sodium very easily, and
gives rise to the formation of glyco-phosphoric acid, which is of very
great importance in the digestive qualities of the upper portion of the
small intestines.Plain malt extracts will be well tolerated by some older children.The
preparations which are mixed with a goodly part of the pharmacopoeia by
generous manufacturers are to be condemned.Craniotabes requires some special care in regard to the head.The
pillow ought to be soft, but not hot; no feather pillow is permitted.The copious perspiration of the scalp requires that it should be kept
cool, the perspiration wiped off frequently to avoid its condensing
into water, and the flattening side of the head may be imbedded in a
pillow with a corresponding depression.Copious perspiration indicates
the frequent washing with vinegar and water (1:5-6).The baby must not be carried on the
arm, but on a pillow which supports both back and head, or in a little
carriage.No sitting must be allowed until the back will no longer bend
to an unusual degree.The
patients will walk when their time has come.The bones are so fragile
that great care {163} is needed sometimes not to fracture or to infract
them and to avoid periosteal pain in lifting.The skin must undergo
some training by gradually accustoming the little patient to cool
water.It can be readily, but gradually, reduced to 70 degrees for a
bath at any season.The addition of rock- or table-salt to the bath is
a welcome stimulant.Laryngismus stridulus shares the indications for treatment furnished by
craniotabes.Prominent symptoms
and complications ought to be treated besides; constipation requires
the more attention the more convulsive attacks of any description may
arise from reflex action.The general nervous irritability may be
relieved by bromide of potassium, sodium, or ammonium.One gramme daily
(15 grains) of either, in three doses, is well tolerated for a long
period.When there are symptoms of an imminent convulsion, or to soothe
the convulsibility which may break out any moment, chloral hydrate,
eight or ten grains in from one hour to four hours, two grains in a
dose, will be convenient.If the stomach refuses or is to be spared,
from four to eight grains may be given in an enema of warm water.A
severe attack of convulsions ought to be checked with inhalations of
chloroform.When a warm bath is to be had, care should be taken that
the child be not tossed about.Hold the baby in a small sheet or a
large napkin, and immerge it thus into the water, raising the head and
cooling it with cold cloths or an ice-bag.Genuine attacks of
laryngismus with well-developed stages--the first paralytic, the second
spasmodic--give but little time for any treatment.The proposition to
apply the electrical current is well meant, but the attack has passed
by, or terminated fatally, or resulted in a general convulsion, before
the apparatus can possibly be in operation.I can imagine, however,
that a Leyden flask kept ready might be used to advantage during the
stage of apnoea for the purpose of bringing on inspiration.Sprinkling
with cold water, beating with a wet towel, shaking by the shoulders,
may certainly contribute to awake respiratory movements.The advice to
wait quietly until the attack has passed by is more easily given than
carried out.Marshall Hall's direction to perform tracheotomy will, I
hope, soon be forgotten.Nothing is more gratefully appreciated by the little patients than air.May it never be forgotten that night-air is better than foul air, and
that furnace-air means air greatly modified by injurious additions.More than twenty years ago I was in occasional attendance upon a male
baby--now a medical man of some promise--with craniotabes and a number
of general convulsions.No treatment would remove, or even relieve, the
attacks, until, without the physician's advice, the father took the
baby into the street in the hardest winter weather.After the first
long absence from his furnace the baby was well of his convulsions, and
the physicians profited by their involuntary experience.In the same way that salt-bathing is beneficial, so is sea-air.A
summer at the seaside is a great blessing to rachitical children.Sea-baths have been arranged for them in France (Berx-sur-mer), in
Italy (San Ilario di Nervi, Viarreggio, Livorno, Volti, Fano), in
England (Margate), in Germany (German Sea, by Prof.Beneke), and for
some little time past in the neighborhood of our own large cities.{164} Complications command great attention in rachitis, particularly
where there is danger from the affection of the nerve-centres, for the
slightest irritation in some distant part of the body may give rise to
an outbreak.Thus, in craniotabes it is desirable to watch even the
gums.Not sharing the etiological superstition which attributes so many
diseases of infancy to dentition, I still know that a slight irritation
of the gums may suffice to exhaust the slim resisting power of the
infant.If there be local swelling and congestion of the gums over a
growing tooth, it may become necessary, or at least advisable, to
lance.An otitis which under ordinary circumstances would give rise to
no symptoms at all besides some inconvenience or slight pain will prove
the source of great danger in a rachitical (craniotabic) infant.The
chronic bronchial catarrh and frequent broncho-pneumonia of such
patients require early attention, for they and the neighboring
lymphatic glands stand too much in the relation of a vicious circle of
cause and effect.Rachitical constipation, depending on incompetency of the intestinal
muscle, must not be treated with purgative medicines.Now and then,
when a great deal of abnormal acid is formed in the stomach, calcined
magnesia, a grain or two given before each meal, will control that
disorder and at the same time keep the bowels open.But, as a rule,
every purgative after it has taken effect will leave the intestinal
muscular layer less fitted to perform its functions than before.Its
place may be taken by a daily enema of tepid water.Further indications
are--such a change in the food as will contribute to keep the bowels
moist and slippery, but principally such a modification of food and
such medical treatment as are known to prove beneficial when all the
symptoms of rachitis are fully developed.When the cause of the
infant's rachitis can be traced back to the mother or to an
insufficient quality of her milk, she must give way to a wet-nurse, or
the nurse must be changed for similar reasons.When neither mother nor
wet-nurse prove competent, or either be dangerous, artificial food will
take their place to advantage in the manner I have stated above.Beef-soup or beef-peptone is to be added to the baby's food daily.Of
the two best farinacea, barley- and oat-meal, the latter is preferable
as an addition to cow's milk, because of its greatly laxative effect.The percentage of cow's milk in the food ought to be more carefully
watched than in other conditions.Pure cow's milk or cow's milk mixed
with water only is borne worse in no other condition.Half a drachm or
more of table-salt and a few drachms of sugar ought to be added to the
daily mess.The general indications require the administration of iron,
which has no constipating effect in this ailment.Particularly is that
the case with the iodide of iron.Cod-liver oil, in three
half-teaspoonful or teaspoonful doses daily, acts very satisfactorily
both for its general rachitical and for its local effect on the mucous
membranes.Now and then massage, repeated many times a day a few
minutes each time, practised with the palm of the hand only, or gentle
friction, with the dry or oiled hand, of the abdominal surface, will
prove effective in bringing about peristalsis and strengthening the
intestinal muscle.An obstinate case may also require two daily doses
of one one-hundred-and-fiftieth or one one-hundred-and-twentieth of a
grain of strychnia for the same purpose, or such other improvements on
the above detailed plan as the judgment of the attending physician may
direct.At all events, the diagnosis of {165} any case, and the
appreciation of the cause of any ailment, are, to a well-balanced and
educated mind, of infinitely greater value than any number of specified
rules and prescriptions.[21]

[Footnote 21: _Jour.Obstetr._, Aug., 1869.]It is not impossible that phosphorus, in substance, not in any of its
compounds, may prove of great utility in the treatment of rachitis.Minimal doses of phosphorus render the newly-formed tissue at the
points of apposition of the bones more compact in a very brief time.The new formation of blood-vessels in the osteogenous tissue gets
retarded by it.Larger doses of phosphorus, however, increase
vascularization, and osseous tissue is either less rapidly formed or
even softened.When the doses are still larger, vascularization and
softening may rise to such a point as to separate the epiphysis from
the diaphysis.Thus the administration of the drug results in an
irritation which, according to the doses employed, may give rise either
to normal condensation or to inflammatory disintegration.This
experience, arrived at by Wegner in a great many experiments made on
animals, Kassowitz has confirmed.For its therapeutic effect he tried
phosphorus in 560 cases of rachitis.Employing doses of one-half
milligramme (one one-hundred-and-twentieth of a grain) several times
daily (less will suffice), he soon found the skull to become harder,
the fontanel smaller, the softening of the bones of the thorax and
extremities to disappear, and all the other symptoms of rachitis to
improve.This result was obtained though no particular change in the
feeding of the patients was resorted to.To what extent this experience
will be verified by others we shall soon learn.My own is already
sufficiently extensive to base upon it a strong recommendation of the
plan of treatment I have detailed.My therapeutical results in other
diseases of the bones also encourage me to believe that phosphorus will
accomplish much in the treatment of rachitis.Ever since Wegner's
publications--viz.these thirteen or fourteen years--I have utilized
phosphorus in cases of chronic and subacute inflammations of the bones,
mainly of the vertebral column and the ankle-joint and tarsus.After
having taught the method for many years in my clinic and otherwise, I
made a brief communication on the subject to the Medical Society of the
State of New York.[22] Since that time, again, I have followed the same
plan in many cases of the same description, and feel sure that the
prognosis in this serious class of bone diseases has become more
favorable and recovery speedier.Infants of a year or more were given a
dose of one-eightieth or one one-hundredth of a grain of phosphorus
daily.One grain, dissolved in an ounce of oil or cod-liver oil, is a
convenient mixture, four or six drops of which may be administered
daily in two or three doses.[Footnote 22: _Trans._, 1880.]From what I have seen of phosphorus in bone disease, and what is thus
far known by experience in rachitis, it appears to me that it will be
of decided advantage in that form of acute rachitis which is apt to
destroy rapidly with the symptoms of acute epiphysitis, rapid pulse,
diarrhoea, rapid diminution of strength, and scorbutic gum.In the few
cases I have seen these last years it appeared to me to act
satisfactorily, together with immobilization of the whole body.Rachitical curvatures are very apt to become less marked while growth
is increasing and the limbs extending.But many of them are so marked
{166} that they remain for life.Many of these might have been
benefited by timely orthopaedic interference.That the application of
Sayre's jacket is indicated in every form and stage of spondylitis,
though it be not equally valuable in all forms, goes without saying;
and that infractions ought to be straightened and supported by splints
when observed and when practicable, is self-evident.But, as a rule,
while the chronic rachitical process is developing in the long bones
the use of mechanical apparatuses is of doubtful merit; they ought not
to be resorted to before the healing has at least commenced.Nor is it
advisable to postpone mechanical interference so long that eburnation
of the bones has time to take place.Surgical operations for the
purpose of removing the curvature are of different nature according to
the different types to be treated.Mere straightening of the curvatures
is indicated, and successful with children under two years.Osteoklasy--that is, fracturing of the curvature while the periosteum
is left intact--is successful in children of three (or four, according
to Volkmann) years.The fracture does not injure the periosteum, and is
always transverse.In later years osteotomy has proved successful to an
almost unexpected degree, and is one of the happiest achievements of
modern surgery.Partly as a preventive, partly as a curative measure, Gramba of Turin
and Pini of Milan point to well-directed gymnastics as a requisite in
the treatment of rachitis.For older children they have established
schools in which systematic exercises are brought to bear on chronic
deformities.{167}

SCURVY.BY PHILIP S. WALES, M.D.SYNONYMS.--_French_, Scorbut; _Spanish_, Escorbuto; _Italian_,
Scorbuto, are the various terms in the Romance languages used to
designate this disease, derived from the Middle-Latin word scorbutus,
which is evidently an offspring of one of the early Gotho-Teutonic
dialects, perhaps of the Low German word Scharbunk, Danish Scorbuck, or
the Old Dutch Scheurbuyck, from _scheren_, to separate or tear, and
_bunk_, the belly.These terms originally denoted rupture of the belly,
and afterward scurvy, or scorvy, as it is found in the English dialect.It has also been traced to the Sclavonic word scorb, disease.The first
is now believed to be the true etymology.DEFINITION.--Scurvy is an acquired condition of the body whose
essential feature is a perversion of nutrition, which gradually arises
from prolonged employment of food deficient in succulent or fresh
vegetable matter, and progresses uniformly to a fatal issue, in a
longer or shorter time, if the dietetic errors remain uncorrected.This
condition becomes manifest by a change in the complexion to a dull
yellowish or earthy tint, lassitude, marked decrease in the muscular
power, depression of spirits and mental hebetude, breathlessness on the
slightest exertion, minute flecks at the roots of the hairs, especially
those of the legs; and, later, hemorrhagic effusion into the skin,
forming blotches and spots of varying sizes and aspects, which may
finally slough and lead to obstinate ulceration; sponginess of the
gums, which bleed easily and break down into a detritus that impresses
a malodorous taint upon the breath; ecchymotic staining of mucous and
serous surfaces, and, in advanced stages of the disease, effusions of
bloody serum or of blood into the cavities and tissues of the body.HISTORY.--Obscure passages in certain of the ancient medical classics
(Hippocrates, Celsus) and historical works (Pliny, Strabo) have been
considered as descriptive of scurvy, but the earliest trustworthy
accounts are to be found in the writings of the thirteenth century.Jacob de Vitry describes an epidemic which occurred among the troops of
Count Saarbrucken besieging Damietta in 1218, and Sire de Joinville
another epidemic among the troops of Louis IX.lying before the same
town in 1249.On both occasions the sufferings of the men were
inexpressible and the mortality fearful.The disease was directly
traceable to defective supplies of fresh vegetable food, aided by
exposure to wet and cold weather, fatigue, and mental depression.{168} The almost total neglect of horticulture in Europe during the
Middle Ages, especially in its more sterile northern portions, the
habitual diet of salted, smoked, and dried flesh and fish, and the
prolonged spells of cold and damp weather of this region, were
conditions most favorable to the development of scurvy, and these
regions were the very first in which its devastating effects were early
observed and recorded.In the first half of the fifteenth century it
prevailed epidemically in the north of Europe and almost everywhere
endemically, more especially in the countries bordering on the Baltic
and North Seas, although the largest and richest cities were frequently
afflicted in the severest manner in consequence of imperfect
food-supplies and the wretched sanitary conditions under which the
inhabitants lived (Fabricius).The long voyages and imperfect diet of
crews of ships furnished a large quota of harrowing nautical
experiences with the scurvy, commencing with Vasco da Gama's voyage to
India in 1497, and running up to 1812.In this interval it was all but
universal on long voyages, both on single ships and in fleets, in the
mercantile marine and in the navy.In 1798, through the better insight into the causes of the disease, and
especially through the exertions of Dr.James Lind in ameliorating the
dietary of British sailors, it was practically stamped out of the navy
or restricted to isolated occurrences.The influence of the success
thus achieved was not lost upon the navies of other nations nor upon
the growing fleets engaged in commerce, as the disease has become less
and less frequent, constituting at present but a very trifling
proportion of the diseases incident to seafaring people.This
remarkable result is in part attributable to the fact that the chief
maritime nations have enacted beneficent laws intended to compel the
owners and masters of merchant vessels to observe certain sanitary and
hygienic measures that protect the crews from scurvy.The number of
cases returned in the English navy for 1881, in an aggregate of 52,487
cases of all diseases, was 4; in the Prussian navy, 3 in 8659; in the
Austrian navy, 27 in 8096; in the U.S.Thus, in a
grand total of all diseases in the chief naval services of the world of
82,629 there were only 34 cases of scurvy--a ratio of.41 per 1000.In
the mercantile marine 62 cases occurred in 32,613 cases of all
diseases, of which 43 were on the Pacific coast: this gives a ratio of
1.9 per 1000.Altogether, the 115,242 cases produced only 96 of
scurvy--a ratio of.83 per 1000.The difference in favor of the naval
over the marine service is accounted for by the greater attention paid
to the health and comfort of the men in the former.steamer Jeannette spent two winters in the Arctic region, and
had a single case of scurvy.steamer Rodgers was wrecked, and
the crew, during its sojourn of six months among the Siberian tribes,
suffered severely.The operations of armies in recent times have not furnished the
frightful mortality which, from neglect of sanitary precautions,
formerly afflicted them.During the rebellion of 1861-64, out of
807,000 cases there were but 47,000 of scurvy, or 5.8 per cent., with a
death-rate of 16 per cent.The French army[1] of 103,770 men during the
Crimean struggle had 27,000 cases of scurvy, or 26.0 per cent., with a
death-rate of 1.5 per {169} cent.In the Bulgarian campaign of 1877-78,
in an army of 300,000 strong, there were, according to Pirigoff,[2]
87,989 cases of disease, of which 4234, or 4.8 per cent., were
frankly-expressed cases of scurvy.This gave a proportion of only 1.4
per cent.of the entire force--a result entirely due to the
maintenance, both before and during the war, of a high standard of
health.[Footnote 1: Scrive, _Relation Medico-Chirurgicale de la Campagne de
l'Orient_, Paris, 1857.][Footnote 2: _Krieg Sanitats-Wesen_, Leipzig, 1882.]ETIOLOGY.--Perhaps no disease has furnished a more fertile field for
etiological conjectures than scurvy.The father of medicine ranked the
disease in one place among those presenting enlarged spleens, and in
another with the twisted bowels.He recognized a putrescence of the
humors as the underlying factor--a theory that held sway until the
beginning of the nineteenth century.The disease attracted wide
attention in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries from its frequent
epidemic and endemic occurrence in various parts of the north of
Europe, and was believed to be restricted to cold and particularly wet
districts--a view that has been long since abandoned with a better
knowledge of its habitats.It has been encountered alike in high
latitudes north and south, amidst sterile wastes covered with eternal
snows and ice, in the temperate zones and in the burning plains of the
equatorial regions of America and Africa.Sex has no predisposing influence, and the fact that more males than
females are affected during an epidemic simply indicates that the
former are more exposed to the ordinary determining causes.During the
siege of Paris, according to the tables of Lasegue and Legroux, there
was a very large excess of male cases, and Hayem's figures show only 6
women in 26 cases.Scurvy has been observed at all ages from infancy to advanced periods
of life; it is believed by certain writers that adolescence is less
predisposed than adult age.The epidemic feature of the disease led many to the opinion that it was
contagious--a view that retained its hold for many years.It was also
considered to be of a miasmatic character, which, with the previous
feature, seemed to assimilate it in nature with typhus fever and other
diseases of the miasmatic contagious group.This view had a vigorous
advocate in Villemin, who in 1874 read a lengthy paper before the Royal
Academy of Medicine in its support.His arguments were specious,
inconclusive, and inaccurate, the weight both of facts and authority
being decisively against his view.Its occurrence among members of the
same family led a few to regard it as hereditary, and it was thought to
be transmissible from the mother to the recently-born as well as to
nursing infants.The depressing influence of certain emotions, fear,
anxiety, and nostalgia, upon the functions of nutrition has, as might
have been anticipated, been noted as contributing indirectly to the
manifestation of epidemics of scurvy in the presence of the essential
determining dietetic causes.Scurvy cannot be regarded, as Lheridon-Cremorne[3] has argued, as the
last term of nostalgia, the other alleged causes being secondary; nor
as the immediate result of mental depression, as Gueit[4] believed from
his experience in the ship Henry IV.during his service on the blockade
in the Black {170} Sea in 1858, because the disease first invaded those
laboring under nostalgia.The currency of such opinions may be readily
explained by the fact that ordinarily depressing mental influences
occur under the same conditions as those associated with scurvy--viz.during sieges, after defeat, in prisons, and in workhouses; and,
further, the mental phenomena ordinarily occur as prodromes of the
disease long before the pathognomonic phenomena present themselves.Out
of these facts grew the mistake of regarding the mental change as
causative instead of consecutive.Murray went farther and regarded
mental despondency as at once cause and effect, and long ago scurvy was
compared to hypochondriacal diseases.[5] It may be concluded from the
recorded epidemics that no degree of mental exhilaration could ward off
the disease in presence of the determining causes, nor any degree of
mental despondency induce it with proper alimentation.[Footnote 3: _These de Paris_.][Footnote 4: _These de Montpellier_, 1858.][Footnote 5: Dolee, 1684.]The various qualities or changes in the atmosphere were regarded
individually or collectively at various times as the determining
causes.It was supposed that the air might become impregnated with
putrid exhalations from various sources, as the holds of ships, or
rendered impure by the vapors of the sea.The foul air of crowded
habitations, vessels, or cities was appealed to, or the common cause
was sought either in its temperature or humidity, or in both.The
earlier observers gave prominence to cold as a determining cause of
scurvy, and especially when combined with dampness, and hence its
frequency in the north of Holland, Brabant, Belgium, Russia, and
Germany.This was the current view in the seventeenth century.On the
other hand, with equal confidence the disease has been supposed to be
determined by excessively high temperatures, and its occurrence in
India, South Africa, and the equatorial regions has been alleged in
support.Personal habits have been in the eyes of earlier observers an
all-sufficient cause, and thus excessive exertion attended with fatigue
and exhaustion has been considered the cause of several severe
outbreaks on shore and at sea.In contrast with this opinion we find
the English physicians placing great stress upon indolent habits and
lack of exercise as a predisposing if not a powerfully determining
cause.The use of tobacco was inveighed against by Maynwaring and Harvey as a
powerfully morbific cause, while to the lack of the same narcotic its
occurrence was ascribed by Van der Mye.More recently it has been
referred by Fabre[6] to vaso-motor disturbance due to a miasm.[Footnote 6: _Des Relations Pathogeniques des Troubles Nerveux, etc._,
Paris, 1880.]In the drink and food, however, most observers have sought the exciting
causes of scurvy.Instances have been reported where the disease seems
to have depended upon the use of impure water, etc.The imagination has
been tortured to seek in some quality or sort of food the specific
origin of scurvy.With regard to quantity, it may be stated that in
severe famines scurvy may or may not occur according as the food,
though scant, is in due proportions of animal and vegetable, though it
is true that the ordinary conditions of a famine preclude the
procurement of succulent vegetables.The quality of the food has
nothing further to do with the production of scurvy than by impairing
the general health, for it has often happened that putrid food has been
long used without scorbutic symptoms arising.The kind of food is
equally {171} innocent, although various special articles have been
charged with specific activity.The frequency of scurvy in Brabant was
attributed by Ronseus to the use of aquatic birds; Sherwin and Nitsch
assigned the same peculiarity to a free use of fish; and Henry Ellis to
the too free use of spirits.Even the generally widespread and
much-esteemed article of diet sugar was in disrepute with Willis.The
too free use of salted meats has been often accused of causing the
trouble.The fat rising on water in which salt provisions were boiled
was considered by Cook and Vancouver to be of particular pernicious
effect, and even the copper vessels in which they were cooked were
condemned by Travis as able to communicate the scorbutic poison to the
food.To the milk of animals browsing on verdure upon which pernicious
dew had fallen was referred an epidemic which occurred in Silesia in
1591.Diseased potatoes were considered sufficient to determine scurvy
in Ireland and Scotland by O'Brien.The scurvy occurring on land was deemed to be different from that
occurring at sea, and its frequency afloat brought into unmerited
disrepute the sailor's salt diet, and its saline materials were even
considered the chief offending cause.This idea was rejected by
numerous observers, who assigned as the chief causative role in scurvy
deficiency in vegetable food, especially of the fresh, succulent
variety.The particular constituent of this sort of food, so powerful
in warding off scurvy and of curing it when prevention has failed, has
baffled discovery.Aldridge attributed it to mineral elements
generally.Garrod singled out the potassic salts as the particular
one to which the specific action must be attributed; but neither of
these views has gained in credit.From all the facts, both positive and
negative, we may reasonably assume that the essential dietetic error
leading to the development of scurvy, in the immense majority if not in
all cases, consists in a deficiency in the variety of food; that is to
say, there is not the requisite proportion of animal matter with a
diversity of vegetable substances.No single natural order contains
plants that supply all the elements essential to the nutrition of the
body and the right composition of the blood.The graminaceous and
leguminous articles of food, for instance, are numerous, but not
various; they all afford the same or analogous albuminous elements,
which have about the same nutrient value as the corresponding
substances in animal food, and hence health and vigor cannot be
sustained on a diet of flesh, combined with wheat, rice, and oatmeal or
with beans and peas, or with all of them together.Outbreaks of scurvy
have occurred on shipboard, where the ration is made up principally of
these articles; as in Anson's ship, when supplied with an abundance of
fresh animal, farinaceous, and leguminous foods.It is clear,
therefore, that in order to obtain a variety of materials required in
nutrition, we must resort to several of the natural groups, those
particularly which comprise the succulent vegetables and fruits.MORBID ANATOMY.--The bodies of persons dead of scurvy are, in most
cases, much emaciated, because the quantity as well as the quality of
the food has usually been defective.When the food-supply is abundant
and only lacking in the elements indispensable in warding off scurvy,
the bodily weight is not noticeably decreased, although the
characteristic tissue-changes of scurvy are present.This was
noticeable in the cases recorded by Trotter of <DW64> slaves dying of
scurvy while their bodies {172} presented a fat and sleek appearance.Rigor mortis usually sets in early, and chemical decomposition invades
the tissues speedily.The skin presents the discolorations and
blotchings observed during life.The subcutaneous connective tissues
are soaked with serous exudations, especially in the lower extremities,
and in various localities are infiltrated with bloody or fibrinous
extravasations.The same changes occasionally affect the muscles, the
infiltration occurring beneath the fibrous sheaths and into the
intermuscular spaces, and the fibres are more or less torn.These
effusions occur most frequently about the knees, the elbows, and the
pterygoid muscles of the jaw.The bones are sometimes necrosed by the mechanical influence of copious
effusion beneath the periosteum, forming nodes of varying sizes and
obstructing the supply of blood.The joints are occupied by serous or
bloody transudations; their synovial investment is destroyed in part,
so that the cartilage is exposed; and the latter not infrequently is
softened, and even separated from the subjacent osseous connections.Sometimes the morbid changes occurring in the joints are the results of
disease in the subcutaneous connective tissues surrounding them.The muscles undergo fatty
degeneration in a remarkable degree.The changes begin first in the
lumbar muscles, the fibres losing their striations and sarcolemma, and
finally being replaced by granular and fatty matter.The brain has been found in rare instances the seat of softening and
infiltration, and the ventricles may contain serous or bloody fluid.Similar effusions have also been noted in the arachnoid.Most
frequently, however, the brain and its membranes present an anaemic
appearance, there is less blood than natural in the vessels, and the
tissues are pale.The heart is smaller than normal, relaxed, and flabby, its fibres
easily broken, and a cut surface presents the yellowish aspect of fatty
degeneration in certain parts, with occasional extravasations located
in the cardiac walls.The valves of the heart are relaxed and illy
adapted to accurate closure.In certain recent cases soft coagula or
dark fluid blood, and in others firmly coagulated blood, are found in
the cavities; in those which have been prolonged the blood is more
likely to be found fluid and the coagula diffluent.The endocardium is
often blotched to a greater or less extent by sanguineous imbibition.The pericardium often contains serum, and in the worst cases is
inflamed, lacerable, and contains bloody effusions.The inner surface
of the great vessels at the base of the heart is stained by imbibition.The mucous membrane
lining the nose, larynx, and trachea is generally pale and flecked with
extravasations of a dark-red color; more or less frothy fluid, tinged
with blood, is present in these passages, and occasionally oedema of
the glottis is encountered.The lungs are, as a rule, infiltrated with
a bloody serosity, particularly in those cases with renal complication,
or with a fibrinous or bloody exudation.The posterior portions of the
lobes often present evidences of hypostatic congestion, or even of
gangrene, and in the latter case the tissue is easily friable and emits
a disagreeable odor.Their surfaces are mottled with superficial
discolored patches of varying size and outline.The lungs may, on the
other hand, be found pale, {173} with empty collapsed vessels and with
little or no effusion.The pleural cavities commonly contain a serous
fluid, or, in rare cases, a copious effusion of blood.Traces of
inflammation and discoloration by sanguineous staining are traceable on
the pleural surfaces.The mouth
presents the most constant scorbutic feature, a stomatitis in which the
gums are infiltrated, spongy, livid, and the seat of fatty
degeneration; the teeth are loosened or have already fallen out.The
stomach and small intestines are thin-walled, and the mucous membrane
is often softened, and in places ulcerated; similar changes have been
noted in the solitary glands.Follicular ulceration of the large
intestine occurs, with softening and infiltration of the mucous
membrane.Hemorrhagic effusions into the mucous membrane, forming
stippling, flecks, or patches, occur in various degrees along the whole
extent of the alimentary canal.The pancreas is occasionally found
softened and containing hemorrhagic effusions.The kidneys are, as a rule, found in the normal condition in cases in
which albumen has been observed in the urine.Occasionally they are
engorged, with infarction of the cortical substance, and the mucous
lining softened and thickened and covered with blood-tinged mucus, or
they may present various degrees of parenchymatous degeneration.The
ureters and bladder sometimes present ecchymotic spots, and the
contained urine is mingled with blood.The liver is always more or less altered by fatty degeneration, and at
times replete with blood and softened, and its surface ecchymotic.The
spleen is occasionally greatly enlarged, and its tissues very
lacerable, laden with blood, and infarcted.PATHOLOGY.--The essential character of scurvy consists in perverted
nutrition, in which the blood undergoes such peculiar and profound
changes that its fitness for the maintenance and renewal of the various
tissues and organs is impaired; hence the nervous depression, loss of
muscular power and tonicity of tissues, and the transudation of the
blood or of its constituent parts.The processes of secondary assimilation are chiefly at fault, leading
to the blood-changes, and through these to the textural lesions.Primary assimilation remains intact, as the bodily weight is little
altered as long as the food is in sufficient quantity.This loss of
nutritive balance between the blood and tissue is due to the absence of
certain elements furnished by fresh vegetable matter.What these are,
and how their absence acts in inducing this disturbance, have not yet
been determined; we only know that the mysterious harmony of the vital,
chemical, and physical relations which exist between the blood and
tissues in health is deranged by their absence.Endless explanatory surmises and assumptions have been proffered.The
earlier explanations involve either the Galenical theory of
putrefaction of the fluids and humors, a breaking down of the
blood-corpuscles, or the later chemical theories of superabundance or
absence of certain salts, sulphur, etc., and hence there were an acid
scurvy, an alkaline scurvy, a muriatic scurvy, etc.The frequent effusions of blood in scurvy led Andral to suspect that
the chief peculiarity in scorbutic blood was the decrease of fibrin;
which was {174} in perfect accord with a theory that he had formed that
this change was the uniform cause of passive hemorrhage.Magendie had
already given experimental support to this conjecture by inducing in
animals phenomena analogous to those of scurvy by the injection into
the veins of defibrinated blood or of alkaline solutions.Andral[7]
believed his views confirmed when in 1841 he analyzed on two occasions
the blood of scorbutic patients and found the fibrin reduced to 1.6
parts per 1000.Similar results were obtained by Eckstein and Fremy.On
the other hand, the blood was analyzed by Busk, about the same time, in
three well-marked cases of scurvy that occurred on the Dreadnaught
hospital-ship, and in all of them the fibrin was in excess of the
normal amount, the least being 4.5 and the greatest 6.5 parts per 1000.In perfect accord with Busk's results were the analyses of the blood of
five scorbutic females, communicated in a note to the Academy of
Sciences in 1847 by Becquerel and Rodier.In no case was the fibrin
diminished, but in some it was sensibly increased.In a subsequent case
Andral found that the fibrin, instead of being less, exceeded the
physiological mean, reaching 4.4 parts, and he concluded that a
diminution of this element was not a necessary and common occurrence,
but only an effect--a result of prior morbid modifications, and a
consequence which was produced more or less frequently according to the
severity and duration of the disease.Parmentier and Deyeux found the
blood of three scorbutics to resemble inflammatory blood in respect to
fibrin, while Frick obtained in one analysis 7.6 parts of fibrin and
Leven 4.3 parts.[Footnote 7: _Essai d'hematologie pathologique_.]In mild cases of scurvy neither the color, the alkalinity, nor the
coagulability of the blood differs from that of blood in health, though
Wood alleges that the clot is loose and cotton-like, and Canstatt that
its coagulability, in consequence of the large proportion of saline
matters, is diminished.In Busk's cases the separation of the clot and
serum was as perfect, and took place as rapidly, as in healthy blood,
and in two of them the blood was both buffed and cupped, as it was also
in Leven's cases.In two of the most severe of Becquerel's cases the
blood coagulated firmly, and in a slight case the clot was dark and
loose.The albumen of the blood shows no marked change as regards its
quantity.The five analyses of Becquerel and Rodier showed the average
amount of organic matters of the serum to be 64.3 parts in 1000, the
smallest being 56.2 and the largest 69.2 parts.1000 parts of the serum
of the same cases gave an average of 72.1 parts of organic matter.Frick's single case gave 87.045 parts per 1000, and the average of
Busk's was 78.2 parts, while Chotin and Bouvier obtained only 62.3
parts.The last-mentioned writers have recorded a fact in connection
with the physical characters of scorbutic blood that deserves notice:
the blood in one case did not coagulate at the usual temperature (about
158 degrees F.), but required a temperature some degrees higher for
that purpose.The red corpuscles in all the foregoing cases were
notably diminished, the largest amount given being 117.078 parts per
1000, while the lowest was 47.8 parts.In Andral's second case the
globules had decreased to 44.4 parts per 1000, the lowest amount yet
recorded.The alkalinity of the blood seems not to be changed, although Chotin
and Bouvier noticed a slight increase.The saline constituents do not
{175} vary greatly from the normal standard.The average amount in the
cases of Becquerel and Rodier and Busk was 8.1 per 1000, the smallest
being 5.5 parts and the largest 11.5.In Ritchie's two analyses the
proportion of saline matters is given as 6.44 and 6.82 parts per 1000.Opitz and Schneider have found less than the physiological mean.In
Frick's case the amount was 8.8, the iron being 0.721 parts per 1000,
and 0.782 to 127 parts of globules; lime 0.110, chlorides 6.846, and
phosphates 1.116 parts per 1000.The iron was in excess of that in the
normal blood, but in Becquerel's cases the mean was 0.381--less than
the normal.The proportion of iron in Duchet's cases was respectively
0.393, 0.402, and 0.476 parts, giving a mean of 0.423 parts per 1000,
which nearly approximates the normal.Garrod in one analysis of the
blood found a deficiency of the potassium salts, upon which he erected
his well-known theory of the etiology of the disease.It is an
interesting fact that in the physiological state the quantity of sodium
chloride is not subject to variation, any excess introduced with the
food being thrown off by the kidneys.The quantity in the urine bears a
relation to the amount introduced as food, but the proportion in the
blood is constant.The quantity of water in the blood has been found to be increased in
all the analyses which have been made.Chotin and Bouvier estimated
water and loss at 831.1; in Frick's case it was 791.69 parts per 1000;
and in Becquerel's five cases it was put at 807.7, 810.9, 811, 813.7,
and 854.0 parts per 1000, respectively.In Busk's three cases the
lowest amount was 835.9 and the highest 849.9 parts per 1000.Mary went back to the office.The
specific gravity of the defibrinated blood was in all cases low in
comparison with the normal standard (1057), the average in Becquerel
and Rodier's cases being 1047.2, the lowest 1083.3, and the highest
1051.7.In the single observation of Chotin and Bouvier it was 1060.The specific gravity of the serum was also less than normal (1027), the
average of four of Becquerel's analyses giving 1023.8, the lowest
1020.8, and the highest 1025.5.Busk gives 1025 in one case and 1028 in
another.The results of the most recent analyses, those of Chalvet, are shown in
the following table, in which scorbutic blood is contrasted with that
of a healthy, robust female:

  Potassium of globules                      0.329           0.625

From the conflicting statements of various observers the following
conclusions may be drawn: that in scorbutic blood water is in excess;
that there is, on the one hand, a marked increase of the fibrin, and in
a less degree of the albumen and extractive matters, while on the other
hand there is a marked decrease of the globules and in a less degree of
the mineral matters.On the authority of Chalvet it may be also stated
{176} that demineralization of the muscular tissue is a notable
chemical feature in scurvy.So far, microscopic examination has been entirely negative.Hayem[8]
found no appreciable alteration from healthy blood, and in this view
Leven[9] concurs; while Laboulbene[10] notes the occurrence of an
unusual number of white globules.de la Societe de Biologie_.][Footnote 9: _Communication to the Academie des Sciences_, 1871.][Footnote 10: _Epidemie de Scorbut_.]Petrone Luigi[11] injected scorbutic blood into the connective tissue
of rabbits.In three instances the animals died, presenting on the ears
distinct evidences of the formation of petechial extravasations.The
viscera revealed everywhere bloody effusions of larger or smaller size.The spleen was enlarged and its parenchyma and capsule distended.In
the blood were found oval, shining, spontaneously-moving corpuscles,
which he regarded as the bearers of the specific poison of scurvy.c. Chir._, 10, 1880.]SYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of scurvy are insidiously and usually slowly
developed under the influence of the efficient causes, and the disease
runs a chronic course, often extending over five or six months,
especially in cases in which the hygienic surroundings of the patient
have been imperfectly or not at all rectified.In light cases the
course is much shorter.A gradual alteration of the nutritive processes
first occurs, until what might be called a scorbutic cachexia is
established in a period varying from a few weeks to several months.The
initial symptoms consist in the skin losing its color and tone and
assuming a yellowish or earthy hue: it is relaxed, dry, unperspiring,
and rough; in the legs particularly this roughness is very marked, and
the skin, when rubbed, sheds an abundance of furfuraceous scales.The
cutaneous follicles, markedly on the extensor aspect of the lower
extremities, are prominent, similar in appearance and feel to the
condition known as goose-flesh.Rouppe[12] calls this the signum primum
pathognomonicum.Dark-red or brownish flecks, of a circular outline and
of varying but small size, not unlike flea-bites, appear on the face
and limbs.The cutaneous circulation is feeble and the superficial
warmth less than natural; slight depression of the atmospheric
temperature produces a sensation of chilliness, and the feet and hands
are cold.On assuming the erect posture the patient complains of
headache and dizziness.The muscles are relaxed and soft to the feel,
and a corresponding loss of vigor and strength is experienced by the
patient, who is indisposed to exert himself in the performance of his
customary duties and seeks repose and freedom from feelings of fatigue
and languor in recumbency.This prostration is occasionally so extreme
that the slightest efforts in attempting to stand or walk are attended
with rapid action of the heart, accelerated respiratory movements, and
a sense of suffocation and breathlessness.The general circulation is
impaired; the heart acts feebly; the arteries are contracted; and the
pulse is slow, small, and compressible.[Footnote 12: _De morbis navigantium_.]The face wears a haggard
appearance and depressed expression; gloomy forebodings of evil and
disinclination to turn the attention to the usual mental pursuits are
markedly present--a disinclination that may subsequently merge into
complete apathy or indifference to passing events, or even into
somnolency.{177} Pains in the legs, joints, and loins are early manifestations:
they closely resemble those of rheumatism, for which they are often
mistaken.The pains are not exacerbated at night, but, on the contrary,
are often more severe by day.Not unfrequently lancinating pains in the
muscles of the chest are complained of.The sleep is not disturbed
until the disease has made some advance, when it becomes broken and is
no longer refreshing.The appetite is usually unimpaired in the early periods of the disease,
and even throughout its course the condition of the mouth alone
prevents the patient from indulging his desire for food, even, as is
occasionally noticed, to voracity.There may be a yearning for certain
articles of diet, principally those of an acid character; but, on the
other hand, some cases present exactly the reverse condition--a disgust
for food in general or for particular varieties; or the appetite may be
vacillating, at one time craving and at another repelling nourishment.There is no noticeable change in the normal thirst, except on the
occurrence of febrile complications, when it is increased.The gums do
not, at this stage of the disease, present the livid, swollen
appearance of fully-developed scurvy, but, on the contrary, are
generally paler than usual, with a slight tumid or everted line on
their free margins, and are slightly tender on pressure.The breath is
commonly offensive, and the patient complains of a bad taste in the
mouth.The tongue is flabby and large, though clean and pale, and the
bowels are inclined to be sluggish.This preliminary stage is followed, after varying intervals of time, by
certain local phenomena which are quite characteristic of the disease.There is a marked tendency to extravasation of blood into the tissues,
either causelessly or upon the infliction of slight injuries or wounds.Fibrinous exudations occur sooner or later into the gums, which become
darkened in color, inflamed, swollen, spongy, and bleed upon the
slightest touch or even spontaneously, and finally separate from the
teeth.These results are due, in part, to the considerable amount of
pressure to which these parts are subject in mastication, and it is a
conspicuous fact that the gums of edentulous jaws remain free from
these changes.In a few cases the gums are but slightly altered,
perhaps oedematous only or pitting upon pressure, or they become the
site of bloody extravasations.In severer examples, in later stages of
the disease, these various alterations progress to an extreme degree,
and the extravasation is so voluminous that the gums present great,
fungous, lacerable excrescences, which may finally break down into a
suppurating, brownish, and very fetid mass, communicating to the breath
an odor of a most offensive character.In certain epidemics of scurvy,
notably in that of Florence described by Cipriani, the lesions of the
gums were absent.The rest of the mucous membrane of the mouth remains
unaltered, or at most slightly ecchymotic.Samson and Charpentier[13]
in a large number of cases saw this but once, and in one of Leven's[14]
cases the fungous growth invaded the palatal mucous membrane, extending
to the anterior pillars of the fauces.The salivary glands are enlarged
and swollen; the tongue is imprinted with the form of the teeth, while
the latter become encrusted with tartar and more or less concealed by
the exuberant gums, or, becoming gradually loosened from the alveoli,
finally drop out.The morbid process may extend to the bone itself, and
necrosis and extensive {178} exfoliation follow.Mastication is more or
less painful, and often impossible, so that the patient is reduced to
the necessity of prolonging life by the use of fluid or semi-solid
food.Under the influence of appropriate treatment it is remarkable how
rapidly (in from two to four weeks) these marked changes recede and the
parts resume their normal condition, yet it occasionally occurs that
permanent, callous thickening of the gums results.[Footnote 13: _Etude sur le Scorbut_, 1871.][Footnote 14: _Une epidemie de Scorbut_, p.In the progress of the disease effusions of blood under the skin are of
early occurrence.They are at first located in the superficial stratum
of the cutis or just beneath the epidermis, especially around the roots
of the hair, and present themselves as roundish, bluish-red flecks,
varying in size from that of a pin's head to that of a split pea, not
effaceable by pressure with the tip of the finger, but slightly, if at
all, elevated above the surface, and enduring for weeks together.The
nutrition of the hair-follicles is impaired, so that the hairs are
often either lost, broken, or distorted.These petechiae fade in color
with progressive improvement in the case, and finally disappear,
leaving brownish-yellow discolorations.They first appear on the
extremities, particularly the lower limbs, then on the face, and lastly
on the trunk.At a later period extravasations of a larger size and
more irregular form occur in the deeper layers of the derma.They vary
in size from that of a finger-nail to blotches two or three inches in
diameter; at first reddish in color and subsequently of a bluish red.When recession occurs under appropriate treatment, the color passes
through various shades of violet, blue, green, and yellow, as in
ordinary traumatic ecchymosis.Outpourings of blood also occur into the
subcutaneous connective tissue, notably that of the legs, and in
localities where connective tissue is particularly abundant and loose,
as in the ham and axilla.The dispersion of blood in this tissue may be
so considerable as to cause the legs from the knees down to present a
uniform dark-blue coloration that in form may not inaptly be compared
to a stocking.The upper extremities also suffer, usually on their
inner side from the armpit down, the extravasation rarely reaching,
however, to the hand.These extravasations may take place after the
infliction of very slight injuries, as from blows or the pressure of
hard bodies, or even from the mechanical effects of prolonged
dependency of the limbs, as in riding on horseback.Extravasations of a
similar nature are occasionally present in the connective tissues of
the muscles themselves or between them, giving rise to swellings of
various forms and dimensions.Nearly always along with the sanguineous
effusions there is more or less oedema, usually beginning at the ankles
and gradually extending upward; in some cases there are puffiness of
the face and general anasarca, so that deep pits remain on pressure.This profound impairment of nutrition of the skin continuing, in the
worst cases blood is effused beneath the cuticle, forming blebs of
varying size, which finally break and leave superficial ulcerated
surfaces, that ultimately become covered with flabby, exuberant
granulations, pouring out a purulent often offensive sanies and
bleeding upon the slightest touch.In some cases the ulceration begins in the petechiae at the hair-roots,
and a number of these, running together, form a large ulcer.The
destruction of tissue by ulceration is disposed to spread more widely
and deeply, and is often of a most intractable character.Old
cicatrices {179} are the first tissues in these cases to take on the
ulcerative action.Certain muscles, chiefly those of the legs, and
notably the gastrocnemii, the abdominal and pectoral muscles, the psoas
magnus, and pterygoids, may become the seat of fibrinous
extravasations, which finally change, by lapse of time, into hard, firm
tumors, impairing the functions of those parts and leading to
contractions of the limbs.The symptoms in certain epidemics of extraordinary severity have
displayed alterations in still deeper structures.Effusions occur
between the periosteum and the bone, forming painful, hard, and
resisting nodes of varying dimensions, especially along the course of
the tibiae, upon the scapulae, and upon the maxillae.In young persons
the epiphyses are separated from the shaft of the long bones, and in
other cases the ribs become necrosed and disarticulated from the
sternum, producing a creaking noise during respiratory movements, as
related by Poupart.[15] This occurs mostly on one side and about the
middle of the series, yet it has been noted to occur on both sides, so
that the sternum and attached cartilages, deprived of support, were
perceptibly sunken.Oserctzkowski[16] reports two fatal cases of scurvy
attended with spontaneous fracture of the ribs.There was extravasation
into and beneath the periosteum, and subsequent destruction of the
continuity of the bone.In one case the ribs on both sides were
affected, so that the anterior wall of the thorax sunk in and
embarrassed the respiration, which was chiefly maintained by the
diaphragm.Inflammation of the lungs succeeded, and the patient died in
agony.[Footnote 15: _Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences_, p.237, 1699, and
_Philosophical Transactions_, vol.[Footnote 16: _Wratsel_, No.Recently-repaired fractures have been known to recur under the
influence of scurvy from the destruction of the callus.[17]

[Footnote 17: Anson's _Voyage Around the World_, edited by Walter.]The articulations as well as the bones in very severe cases of scurvy
present evidences of disease, consisting in periostitic effusions which
involve the surrounding soft parts, producing impairment of motion,
enlargement, and false ankylosis, and even destroying the normal
anatomical relation of the osseous surfaces, so as to determine
deformities.These changes are usually attended with severe pain, and
most commonly occur in the ankle-, knee-, shoulder-, and hip-joints,
and disappear tardily, requiring perhaps months for their recession, if
indeed this takes place at all.The symptoms manifested by the circulatory organs are prominent from an
early period of the disease.The pulsations of the heart are slower,
feebler, irregular, and often intermittent; its impulse is decreased or
becomes quite imperceptible; and when the associated anaemia has
progressed to a certain extent a systolic murmur may be audible.The
arterial and venous channels are of diminished calibre; the pulse
becomes soft, of less volume, and tardier; and a venous murmur may
sometimes be heard in the cervical veins.The remarkable nutritive
changes in the capillary walls in part account for the numerous
hemorrhages which occur both by rhexis and diapedesis.The most
frequent is epistaxis; the slightest blows, sneezing, or blowing the
nose will often determine it, or it may occur spontaneously, and in
severer cases with such profuseness as to threaten impending
dissolution, requiring nothing less than timeous introduction of the
tampon to rescue the victim.Hemorrhage from the {180} lungs is of rare
occurrence, and when it does happen is rather indicative of
pre-existing pulmonary disease, such as phthisis, or of the approach of
a complication, such as infarction or gangrene, than a constituent
feature of scurvy.Haematemesis is less uncommon, but is by no means
frequent; the blood ejected from the stomach is usually small in
quantity, but in isolated examples the bleeding is profuse, producing
great exhaustion and a sense of cardiac depression which preludes
speedy death.Hemorrhage from the bowels is also an ill-omened feature,
completely blanching the patient and presaging early exhaustion and
death.Blood may also appear as a product of a complicating dysentery
which determines abundant, offensive discharges that may run on for
several weeks before the patient is finally exhausted.Haematuria
sometimes occurs, especially in broken-down and cachectic subjects and
in an advanced stage of scurvy.All of these forms of hemorrhagic
effusion, now mentioned as localized in the mucous membranes, are to be
deprecated as exercising a pernicious influence, seriously aggravating
ordinary cases and fatally jeopardizing the issue of severe ones.Effusive and inflammatory complications are also encountered in the
serous structures, and usually in cases of great severity, though they
occasionally present themselves when the more common localized
phenomena of scurvy are not particularly prominent.These complications
may be marked by a gradual accession, or they may rapidly arise and
involve the patient, just before in apparent security, in the greatest
peril.These incursions are almost always attended by febrile
exacerbations and the usual grouping of clinical characters denotive of
the same pathological conditions arising under ordinary circumstances.The local complications may either affect the pleura or pericardium, or
both.In Karairajew's[18] 60 autopsic examinations pericardial
effusions were noticed in 30, pleural in 30, pericardial and pleural in
6, peritoneal in 7, and arachnoidal in only 1.The exudations are
sero-sanguinolent or fibrinous in character, and sometimes reach the
inordinate quantity of four or five pounds, occasioning the patient the
utmost distress and embarrassing the respiratory and circulatory
functions.Although these augment in a high degree the risk to life,
yet under prompt and appropriate treatment recovery may take place and
the effusions vanish with surprising rapidity.[Footnote 18: Himmelstiern, _Beobachtungen uber den Scorbut_, S.Hemorrhagic extravasation into the nervous centres is a very rare
occurrence.It has not been as yet recorded as having occurred in the
brain-substance itself, but has in several instances been noted between
the meninges, producing headache, dizziness, vertigo, and sometimes
somnolence, delirium, and coma.Opitz[19] relates an interesting case
in which convulsions suddenly occurred with unconsciousness, followed
by hemiplegia of the left side of the body and the corresponding side
of the face.After twenty-four hours consciousness returned and the
paralysis disappeared.There were, however, headache and hyperaesthesia
of the upper extremities present; twelve days later these also receded,
and the patient finally recovered.The same author records paralysis as
occurring in one case from extravasation into the spinal meninges.Samson observed an instance in which a fibrinous effusion formed upon
the sciatic nerve, with consequent pain.Vierteljahrschrift_, S.{181} In the circulatory system symptoms always of threatening and
often of fatal import may arise: embolism may occur at various points,
particularly in the lungs and spleen, occasioning hemorrhagic
infarctions, which have undoubtedly been the occasion of the sudden
deaths sometimes observed in scorbutic cases not apparently of a very
dangerous form nor attended with an excessive degree of exhaustion.The urinary system supplies no prominent symptoms; the statements as to
the condition of the kidneys and the composition of the urine are
contradictory.The urine not infrequently contains albumen,
particularly in severe cases, but this is by no means indicative of
corresponding changes in the renal structure: on the contrary, this may
be found after death to be apparently free from disease.The conclusions that would seem to be authorized by the statements of
various authorities are that the quantity of urine passed is decreased,
as well as that of the urea, while the amounts of the albuminoid and
mineral matters are increased.Physical examination will reveal the frequent occurrence of enlargement
of the spleen, independent of malarial influences, and Krebel has
encountered one case in which the liver was involved in inflammation.Some derangement of the visual organs is present in many cases.Foltz,
in the epidemic on the Raritan, reported four cases of nyctalopia and
two of hemeralopia, and other affections of the eye, such as
conjunctivitis, induration and irritation of the ciliary margins of the
lids, with a copious and acrimonious discharge, these conditions being
obviously due to the scorbutic diathesis.Medical Director J. Y.
Taylor, U.S.Navy, in a private communication to me states that
hemeralopia was a frequent premonitory symptom of scurvy that occurred
in the U.S.sloop-of-war Decatur in 1854 during a laborious and tedious
passage of three months through the Straits of Magellan.The men were
overworked and much exposed to cold and wet, and part of the time were
on diminished rations.The hemeralopia was at first erroneously
attributed to the reflection from the snow and glaciers--a species of
snow-blindness--but other phenomena speedily appeared in a majority of
the causes: a subacute inflammation, with considerable pain and
swelling of the small joints, especially those of the toes; sore and
tender gums, although only a few progressed so far as to exhibit
sponginess or bleeding; and debility, depression, anxiety, and
insomnia.In a few cases the blindness was so complete as to render
their subjects almost helpless after sunset.This was the most
pronounced and remarkable symptom and the one most complained of.These
incipient scorbutic symptoms were promptly arrested by the free use of
wild celery (Apium graveolens), which was found growing abundantly in
sheltered places.The short rations were also supplemented
advantageously by mussels (Mytilus edulis) whenever they could be
obtained.A few weeks later the crew appeared to be in ordinary health.Hemorrhage may occur under the conjunctiva, raising it into small
pouches; into the anterior chamber, causing iritis and adhesions; and,
finally, into the choroid and vitreous humor, exciting a general
inflammation of the entire organ.Dulness of hearing and buzzing in the ears have also been signalized as
occasional symptoms of scurvy.{182} The phenomena of fever are always absent during the course of
uncomplicated scurvy, the temperature of the mouth sometimes falling as
low as 92 degrees F., and being always one or two degrees lower than
normal.It is only in the later periods of the disease, when
pathological processes most often supervene in the internal organs,
that an elevated temperature and the other ordinary symptoms of fever
are manifested.The lowered vital resistance of scorbutic subjects
particularly disposes them to the incursions of fevers, especially
those of malarial and typhoid types: hence in the low, marshy districts
of Northern Europe and in sections of country afflicted by famine and
overcrowded dwellings these complications are very common.DIAGNOSIS.--Little or no difficulty will be encountered in
discriminating scurvy from other diseases under the circumstances that
usually surround its development and prevalence.These circumstances
are altogether peculiar and characteristic, and involve the absence of
succulent vegetable food as the prime factor, and exposure to cold,
fatigue, mental despondency, or other depressing influences as
accessory in its production.This combination of causes has been
usually witnessed in all the outbreaks of scurvy in camps, besieged
towns, on shipboard, particularly on ships in Arctic service.Sporadic cases may escape immediate identification in the absence of
some of these circumstances, but a close attention to the symptoms will
surely lead to a correct conclusion.The scorbutic cachexia denoted by
the sallow or earthy hue of the skin; the spongy gums; the
discoloration of the surface; pains in the limbs and joints; the sense
of weariness, and, later, the exhaustion, dyspnoea on the slightest
exertion; the bloody and fibrinous effusions into the connective
tissues and muscles about the joints, and into the pleurae,
pericardium, and peritoneum; the stiffness and contraction of the
legs,--furnish a complexus of phenomena not met with in any other
disease than scurvy.The discoloration of the skin in purpura,
leucocythaemia, anaemia, chlorosis, and haematophilia, or other
conditions involving hemorrhagic extravasation, are easily
discriminated from those of scurvy when taken in connection with the
other symptoms and the history of those diseases.In the beginning of
scurvy the pains in the back and limbs might divert the attention to
rheumatism, but an examination at this early stage will, in all
likelihood, disclose the peculiar gingival and cutaneous lesions of
scurvy.The rapid improvement of scorbutic cases under a fruit and vegetable
diet is also a noticeable feature not witnessed in any of the foregoing
diseases.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis of scurvy is always favorable in the early
stages, and even in the very worst recovery occurs under improved
hygienic surroundings with remarkable promptness and certainty.It must
not be overlooked, however, that sudden death may occur in seemingly
light cases from failure of the heart's action or from embolism.There
is a ready disposition to the recurrence of the disease under slight
causes, and it may so impair the health as to lead to the development
of other fatal maladies.The gravity of the case is to be gauged not so
much by its seeming severity as by the accessibility of proper
food-supplies, for without these the worst results may be expected.Where the case is embarrassed with complications of the respiratory and
circulatory {183} organs, involvement of the bones, and intercurrent
diseases, the outlook becomes correspondingly grave.Throughout the world, in recent times, greater areas of territory are
devoted to agriculture and horticulture, and the products are
distributed over wide extents of country by the increased facilities of
communication by the highways and railroads, so that it would now be
impossible for an epidemic of scurvy to devastate a region of country
so provided as it did a century ago, or might do and has done in
regions of country where tillage is neglected and communications are
cut off by an absence of roads from more productive centres, as in
Southern and Eastern Russia.Hygienic improvements that have almost stamped out scurvy on shore have
also done good service for mariners, and thousands of ships now cross
the ocean on long cruises with perfect security from the disease.In
the naval services of the world, as has been already shown, the disease
is rarely encountered, and it is greatly diminished in the merchant
marine, from which, it is hoped, in a few years, by a more rigid
enforcement of existing laws for the protection of sailors, it may also
entirely disappear.Even in exceptionally long and arduous cruises, as
in the Arctic regions, the disease may be arrested, as was the case
with the Jeannette, which was drifted about, locked up in ice, for
sixteen months, yet only a single case of scurvy appeared.It is of the first importance to enlist a healthy crew for long
voyages, free from previous syphilitic, scorbutic, or other
constitutional taint; then, by observing proper hygienic precautions,
to maintain their health.One of the prime factors in securing this
result is a suitable dietary.The improved methods of preserving food
afford facilities for storing up adequate quantities of both kinds,
animal and vegetable, to last the cruise.To economize these stores it
will be well to start with a stock of live animals and recent
vegetables, such as can be now had in almost any quantity in any
considerable maritime city, and not until these are consumed are the
canned and preserved supplies to be opened.All the ordinary meats, as
beef, mutton, veal, and lamb; most vegetable products, as asparagus,
beans, peas, potatoes, and a great variety of fruits, as peaches,
plums, berries, etc., are obtainable at moderate expense, and should
form an integral portion of the ration.Eggs can be easily preserved so
as to keep for months by simply packing them in plaster or in salt, and
they furnish a valuable and acceptable article of diet.Among articles
of great nutritive value milk takes high rank, and it can be preserved
sweet and pure indefinitely.Sauer-<DW62> is an antiscorbutic of
considerable virtue, and should not be overlooked in laying in stores
for a distant cruise.Cheese and oatmeal will be found useful additions
to the ordinary ration.It may be proper to state in the event of the occurrence of scurvy and
the exhaustion of the fresh vegetable stores that various
quickly-growing vegetables, such as mustard, radishes, turnips, and
cresses, could be cultivated on shipboard if seeds are provided.With such a varied dietary, comprehended in the above enumeration, it
would be impossible for scurvy to invade the ship's company, especially
when aided by other wholesome agencies, as cleanliness, well-ventilated
and dry sleeping rooms, and clothing adapted to the weather.The
antiscorbutic virtues of lime-juice were known long ago, being
mentioned by {184} Albertus in 1593, but it was not until many years
later that it became an integral part of the English navy-ration.The
law requires it to be carried on board all merchant vessels, and to be
served out ten days after the crew has been living on salt rations.The
juice keeps well if properly prepared and preserved from contact with
air, especially when fortified with a small quantity of alcohol, the
usual strength being about 10 per cent.It should be carried in vessels
containing just enough to furnish a few days' rations to the whole
crew, by which plan only a small amount need be exposed to the
decomposing influence of the air.The juice can be reduced by
evaporation to a very small bulk.This method was adopted in supplying
the Arctic cruiser Rodgers.[20] The juice was reduced to a paste, each
pound of which represented one gallon of the solution of the ordinary
strength.It has also been used in the form of lozenges and biscuit.It
may be stated that great reliance has been placed upon malt, the acid
wines, and cider as good antiscorbutics.[Footnote 20: _Report of the Surgeon-General of the Navy for 1880_.]In connection with the food-supplies it is proper to mention those
influences of a depressing character which have a tendency to favor the
development of scurvy.The first is dampness in the sleeping apartments
of the men.This should be prevented by ventilation, drying stoves, and
taking care that no wet garments are permitted to remain in the
apartments.They should be taken off immediately and hung outside to
dry, and under no circumstances should the men be permitted to sleep in
them, as is sometimes done.Exposure to cold is unavoidable under certain conditions, and the men
should then be protected by proper clothing adapted to the weather.Protracted fatigue is a third favoring circumstance, and the crew
should be spared all the strain of hard work possible, especially in
high latitudes.The apartments should also be kept well ventilated and
scrupulously clean; and, lastly, depressing mental emotions, which are
so apt to arise from exposure to danger and want, should be dispelled
by cheering assurances, constant occupation, and whatever amusements
can be had.These are the chief influences which are to be considered
in adopting measures to prevent the occurrence of scurvy in
communities, armies, on shipboard, or in persons confined in houses of
detention.The therapeusis of scurvy presents no intricate problems for solution.Its origin in dietetic errors is admitted by almost common consent, and
it is surprising with what rapidity patients apparently beyond hope of
recovery gather health and strength with a change in the character of
the food.This is indispensable in the treatment, as drugs have little
or no curative influence without it; and, therefore, the first object
should be to supply the patient with lemon-juice or acescent fruits and
fresh vegetables, as garlic, mustard, cresses, sorrel, nasturtium,
taraxacum among the wild plants, and potatoes, onions, turnips, beets,
radishes, etc.And in conjunction with
these fresh meats, in the form of soups if the solids cannot be
masticated, may be used with advantage.Ordinarily, the dietetic
treatment alone will suffice to re-establish the health.Should,
however, convalescence be delayed, the vegetable bitters with the
mineral acids and ferruginous tonics and quinia will furnish useful
adjuvants.These are the standard remedies; others have been
recommended at various times, as the juice {185} of the maguey, a
Mexican plant, potassium nitrate alone or combined with vinegar,
tincture of cantharides, etc.Attention will often be required to the various scorbutic
complications, especially stomatitis, which is always a source of
discomfort and suffering.One of the best local applications for this
is pencilling the parts with a solution of nitrate of silver, which
often affords marked relief.Mouth-washes, composed of solutions of
chlorinated lime, potassium permanganate, carbolic acid, are beneficial
by suppressing foul odors, exercising local stimulative action upon the
gums, and promoting healing.Should ulceration attack the legs, as is
often the case, the application of mild astringents and stimulative
ointments will be all that is required.The parts should, of course, be
kept clean and protected from irritation by protective dressings.Hemorrhages from the nose, gums, stomach, bowels, or into the serous
cavities should be treated upon the general principles applicable to
their character, as the local use of cold, astringents, and the
internal administration of haemostatic agents--lead acetate, ergot,
tincture of iron, and other remedies, vegetable and mineral, of this
class.In desperate cases effusions into the chest, threatening death
by interfering with the respiratory and circulatory organs, may render
operation necessary as the last resort for their removal.During the treatment it is important to obviate any sudden or severe
strain upon the heart by premature movements or exercises, as this is
fraught with danger.{186}

PURPURA.BY I. E. ATKINSON, M.D.It has been customary with authors to describe under the general
heading Purpura a number of affections presenting as a common symptom
the extravasation of blood into the tissues, more especially of the
skin and mucous membranes, quite irrespective of etiological or
pathological considerations.Thus, the tiny ecchymoses caused by the
bites of fleas have been denominated purpura pulicosa; the larger
bruises resulting from external violence, purpura traumatica; the
extravasations occurring in the course of scurvy, purpura scorbutica;
those encountered in malignant small-pox, purpura variolosa; and so on.These affections, differing widely in nature, possess as a common
symptom the escape of blood from the vessels into the tissues.It is
evident, therefore, that in the sense often employed the term purpura
is used to describe a symptom or symptoms common to a variety of
non-related maladies.If there be a peculiar morbid process having for its constant and
characteristic symptom the spontaneous escape of the blood from the
blood-vessels, it is plain that interstitial hemorrhage from external
violence or from the action of a definite poison circulating in the
blood and disorganizing it and its containing vessels, as in
phosphorus-poisoning, or from the influence of certain zymotic
diseases, should not be designated by the title properly belonging to a
substantive malady.The question, therefore, is: Are there groups of
symptoms indicating morbid action of definite character, but of varying
intensity, to which the name purpura may with propriety be applied?In the present light of pathological science it is impossible to answer
this question in the affirmative without considerable qualification.It
must be confessed that we do not possess a knowledge of any definite
chain of morbid processes constituting a distinct disease that may be
designated as purpura.And yet we are able to recognize a set of
symptoms varying greatly in intensity, from the most trivial petechial
eruption to profuse and fatal hemorrhages, accompanied by a train of
manifestations which we are unable to connect with any of the causes
already spoken of, and which, indeed, depend upon no fixed exciting
cause with which we are acquainted.It may be eventually proven that
purpura, even as we understand it, is merely a set of phenomena due to
widely-differing influences acting upon the blood and blood-vessels,
and that the term will disappear from our nomenclature as indicating a
disease, but will be preserved as denoting a symptom.For the present,
{187} purpura is understood to be a group of symptoms characterized by
the effusion of blood into the tissues of the body, or upon its free
surfaces, or into its serous cavities, which seem to arise
spontaneously, and for which we are unable to assign a definite cause.With this view of the nature of purpura it becomes necessary to exclude
from present consideration blood-extravasations from internal or
external violence, the action of the specific principles of contagious
or infectious fevers, the dyscrasia of scurvy, the influence of
poisonous substances, and, in a word, any of those affections of which
the escape of blood from the vessels constitutes an epi-phenomenon.Purpura may be conveniently considered as presenting three varieties:
1, purpura simplex; 2, purpura haemorrhagica; 3, purpura rheumatica.These three forms of the disease are not distinguished by
sharply-outlined differences, but merge the one into the other, now
one, now another set of symptoms predominating.To these may be added,
likewise for convenience, three sub-varieties--purpura urticans,
purpura papulosa, and purpura nervosa.The difference between these
forms of purpura should not be considered as of more than clinical
import.Whatever variations present themselves may with probable
propriety be ascribed to complicating influences.PURPURA SIMPLEX.--This is the mildest form of purpura, and may in many
cases readily escape observation.It may begin abruptly, in the midst
of health, without the slightest subjective symptom, or the
extravasations may be preceded for several days by some discomfort,
aching of limbs, sluggishness, anorexia, even a small amount of fever.The eruption usually appears first upon the lower extremities,
preferably the flexor surfaces of the thighs (Duhring), but frequently
upon the legs.It extends from these points to the upper extremities
and trunk, usually sparing the face.The lesions vary in size from that
of a pin-head to that of a fingernail (petechiae), or they may be
linear (vibices).They remain discrete, and do not increase in size
throughout their course.Each spot of hemorrhage will endure for from
one to two weeks.At first the lesions are of a livid red color, and
declare their extra-vascular nature by remaining unaltered when
subjected to pressure.The color of these spots changes, as in ordinary
ecchymosis, in consequence of the metamorphoses of the haematin
preparatory to its final absorption, from crimson to purple, to blue,
to green, to yellow, and finally fades away.When recent, the spots
appear sharply outlined, with sometimes a faint encircling zone of
hyperaemia, but as they become older their margins grow indistinct.While the early lesions slowly disappear, others continue to develop,
and the affection may thus be protracted for weeks.At times the
petechiae appear in crops, recurring every few days, the patient at one
time apparently nearly well, at another time worse than ever.Finally,
the symptoms definitely disappear, to return no more, or they pass into
those of other forms of purpura.During the course of purpura simplex
the blood-vessels of the skin alone are affected, the deeper tissues
and mucous membranes probably remaining unchanged.Throughout the attack the general health may--usually does--remain
good.As an occasional symptom there will be observed a few vesicles or
blebs, containing blood, upon the skin.The extent of the general
eruption may vary from a few scattered petechiae to a copious and
startling {188} number of purpuric spots.The maintenance of the
upright position tends to perpetuate the evolution of the lesions.In elderly persons purpura simplex is sometimes observed, and has been
described by many writers as purpura senilis.Hillier, following
Bateman, describes it as occurring in old women "upon the outside of
the forearms in successive dark, purple blotches of an irregular form
and various magnitude."[1] Aged men as well as women are liable to the
affection, which may quite as well appear upon the lower extremities of
either sex.It is altogether likely, however, that in such cases
degenerations of the vascular walls alone may cause the extravasations.[Footnote 1: Reynolds's _System of Medicine_, vol.PURPURA HAEMORRHAGICA (MORBUS MACULOSUS WERLHOFII).--In this form of
purpura there are added to the symptoms of purpura simplex hemorrhages
into and from the various mucous tracts, the nasal, faucial,
pharyngeal, gastric, intestinal, renal, uterine, rarely the pulmonary
mucous membranes, and exceptionally into the various serous membranes
and cavities.It may begin abruptly, in the midst of apparently
vigorous health, or after premonitory symptoms extending over several
days, vague sensations of discomfort--headache, pains, anorexia,
indisposition to exertion, and the like--or it may occur as a
transition from other forms of purpura.The hemorrhagic spots upon the skin appear much as in purpura simplex,
though the lesions are larger, acquiring the size of coins or even of
the palm of the hand.Spots soon appear upon the visible mucous
membranes, and free hemorrhages occur; indeed, the latter may be the
first symptom observed.Epistaxis is of most common occurrence, but
bleeding from the mouth, stomach, and intestines almost as frequently
results.The gums are almost constantly affected, and upon inspection
these may be found covered with blackish scabs, upon removal of which
the mucous membrane will be found pale and not swollen--an important
point in diagnosticating this affection from scurvy.Vesicles and blebs
filled with blood form both on the skin and mucous membranes.They
quickly rupture and discharge their contents.Bleeding from the stomach
and intestines is revealed--in the former case by the vomiting of a
brownish material resembling coffee-grounds; in the latter case by the
passage of black, tar-like evacuations.Pulmonary hemorrhage is to be
distinguished from haematemesis by the frothy and arterial character of
the blood.Haematuria may proceed from any part of the urinary tract.Bleeding from several parts may occur at the same time, and may be very
copious.In the mucous membranes extravasations of greater or less extent may
occur, as in the derma.Into the serous membranes they may take place
with or without effusion into serous cavities.It is only, however, in
cases that will almost certainly end fatally that the effusions into
these cavities are encountered.Hemorrhages into the substance of the
lungs, into the brain and other viscera, as well as into the tissues
generally, are occasionally observed.At the outset of these bleedings the general health of the patient may
appear unimpaired, and if they be few in number and moderate in extent
but slight evidences of debility may be shown throughout the attack;
but it is often the case that the loss of blood is excessive and long
continued, and symptoms of profound anaemia supervene.The {189}
patient becomes greatly exhausted; intense pallor is developed, shortly
followed by general oedema.Attacks of syncope appear, and in fatal
cases--which are not common--death results from asthenia.This result
may occur after a few days from the profuseness of the hemorrhage;
usually, however, only after several weeks.Throughout the attack the
cutaneous lesions continue to develop, either irregularly or in
successive outbreaks, scattered over the general surface, involving the
face less frequently than other parts.These spots undergo the
color-changes peculiar to extravasated blood, and may be seen in all
the stages of involution in the same patient.Fever, usually absent
throughout the attack, may appear at the height of the affection, but
does not run high.In
favorable cases recovery follows the gradual mitigation and
disappearance of the symptoms, but relapses frequently occur, and
convalescence may be retarded for months.PURPURA RHEUMATICA (PELIOSIS RHEUMATICA).--Schoenlein in 1829 described
as peliosis rheumatica an affection in which the symptoms of purpura
simplex were associated with pain and often with effusion into the
joints, especially those of the knee and ankle.He considered it as an
independent malady.This opinion has been shared by Fuchs, Hebra,
Kaposi, Neumann, and many others.Kaposi[2] regards it as related to
erythema nodosum, with which affection, indeed, it possesses some
features in common.It probably, however, constitutes a complication of
ordinary purpura.That it is not primarily rheumatic is shown by the
almost invariable absence of many of the symptoms characteristic of
rheumatism; that it cannot be an independent affection appears from its
intimate relations with other forms of purpura.[Footnote 2: _Hautkrankheiten_, 1880, p.Purpura rheumatica commonly begins with malaise, anorexia, debility,
sometimes with mild fever.The patient is soon attacked with pains, of
a more or less acute character, in the joints, especially the knees and
ankles.There may be some effusion into the joint and cutaneous oedema.After a few days the nature of the complaint will be revealed by an
eruption of petechiae, first near the painful joints, but soon
extending, involving in many cases even the head and trunk.The
eruption may be at first slightly elevated and surrounded by a fine
halo of hyperaemic injection.The pains usually subside upon the appearance of the eruption, and the
malady may be completed after a single outbreak.More commonly new
joint-pains are experienced, fresh crops of petechiae appear, and the
trouble may be prolonged for weeks, even months, the patient meanwhile
suffering not very greatly in general health.The lesions may be
cutaneous only; rarely bleeding from mucous surfaces will occur
(Scheby-Buch).Albuminuria may be present (Kaposi).An annual type is
said by Kaposi, Neumann, and others to be sometimes observed, the
spring and autumn being the usual seasons for the outbreaks.This is
supposed to indicate a relationship with erythema nodosum and
multiforme.Cardiac murmurs have been detected in the course of purpura
rheumatica,[3] but these were probably anaemic or antedated the
purpuric symptoms.Purpura rheumatica never seems to result in endo- or
pericarditis.[Footnote 3: Kinnicutt, _Archives of Dermatology_, i. p.193; Molliere,
_Ann.de Dermatol._, v. p.SUB-VARIETIES.--Henoch[4] and Couty[5] have described a form of {190}
purpura mostly observed in children, in whom rheumatoid pains occur
along with colic and vomiting of greenish or bilious matter, tenesmus,
and sometimes with loss of blood from the bowels.The disease may be
protracted throughout months by relapses.Cutaneous oedema frequently
occurs.Couty regards it as a form whose peculiarities justify its
assignment to a position of its own.The cause of the associated train
of symptoms is supposed (Couty) to reside in the sympathetic system,
and the name purpura nervosa is proposed for it.So many features of
ordinary purpura are manifested in these cases that it seems better to
consider them as examples of ordinary purpura complicated with
gastro-intestinal derangement.It has been suggested that the nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pains may result from extravasation of blood
into the peritoneal tissue.[6]

[Footnote 4: _Berl.Wochenschr._, 51, 1874.]Hebd._, 36 _et seq._, 1876.][Footnote 6: Immermann, _Ziemssen's Cyclopaed._, vol.In the course of purpura there is frequently observed, more especially
in purpura simplex, a wheal-like arrangement of the eruption--such,
indeed, as occurs in urticaria.The term purpura urticans has been
given to this sub-variety, which may or may not be accompanied by
itching.Scheby-Buch has suggested that the urticaria may, with more
propriety, be attributed to the gastric disturbances that so often
accompany the forms of purpura presenting it.[7] The wheals are usually
seen upon the lower extremities, but may appear elsewhere.A
considerable degree of oedema may be present, particularly in lax
tissue, such as that of the scrotum, eyelids, etc.Purpura papulosa (lichen lividus, Willan) is a form of purpura where,
in the midst of ecchymoses, livid papules appear.These probably depend
upon a large amount of hemorrhage occurring within a limited space,
most often surrounding the orifices of hair-follicles, because these
are supplied with a capillary network that comes directly from the
deeper layer.[8] They are formed most abundantly on the legs of
scrofulous, cachectic persons who have purpura.Care must be taken to
distinguish this form of purpura from erythema multiforme and erythema
nodosum, where blood is usually extravasated secondarily into the
tissues.Those cases only where the purpura is primary should be
recognized as purpura papulosa.[Footnote 8: Hebra, _Skin Diseases_, New Syd.The purpuric effusion appears to act as an irritant upon the tissues,
and to excite inflammation.Gangrene of the mucous coat of the
intestines has resulted from extensive hemorrhagic extravasations, and
from a similar cause cutaneous gangrene has been known.Mary moved to the kitchen.These
complications, however, are rare.ETIOLOGY.--The immediate causes of purpura are quite unknown.Both
sexes and persons of every age are affected by it.While it is most
often seen in debilitated subjects, those in vigorous health possess no
immunity.It has often been observed during convalescence from other
maladies.It cannot be said that those who are miserably clothed, fed,
and lodged are especially predisposed to attacks of purpura.Between
purpura and haemophilia, etiologically, there are many points of
difference.Purpura is not hereditary, nor is there a purpuric
diathesis in the strict sense of the term.Some persons, indeed, seem
to possess a {191} predisposition to the disease, and some authors
claim for purpura rheumatica a distinct annual type.This, however, is
not at all certain.Recently it has been claimed that purpura haemorrhagica depends upon
the presence of a minute organism in the blood.Petrone[9] injected
blood drawn from patients with this disease under the skin of rabbits,
producing widely-distributed hemorrhages.In the blood of these
individuals and of the injected rabbits micrococci and bacilli were
detected.Watson Cheyne[10] also describes a plugging of the
capillaries with bacilli.These were 1/7700 of an inch in length and
1/20000 of an inch in diameter, and were arranged in colonies.In
another case there were found micrococci arranged in chains.These
swarmed in the capillaries and some larger vessels, and sometimes
completely blocked them.Although an origin in infection has thus been
claimed for purpura haemorrhagica, the fact that more than one variety
of micro-organism was observed cannot fail to excite suspicion of,
possibly, erroneous observation.[Footnote 9: _Lo Sperimentale_, 51, 1883.][Footnote 10: _Lancet_, i., 1884, 344.]PATHOLOGY.--In the foregoing description those extravasations of blood
due to simple mechanical violence, as from flea-bite, and sudden
increase of blood-pressure, as in the effort of coughing in whooping
cough, also from the deleterious influence exerted upon the
blood-vessels and blood by certain drugs, the specific fevers, Bright's
disease, and the like, have been excluded.Only those have been
considered where the effusion of blood seemed to occur spontaneously,
and the symptoms to result from some peculiar but not understood morbid
process.The hemorrhage is but a symptom; the process by which it is
brought about depends upon some change in the blood or blood-vessels.We do not know what these subtle changes are.The blood of purpuric
patients has been carefully examined, but, with the exception above
mentioned, no definite changes have been discovered.Immermann[11]
found during the first stage of the disease the blood-corpuscles
perfectly normal in appearance, the white corpuscles subsequently
slightly exceeding the red in number--a simple result of copious
hemorrhage.No stated chemical changes in the blood are known in
purpura, nor is it known how the blood escapes from the vessels.It
undoubtedly escapes through alterations in the vascular wall, but it is
also true that red blood-corpuscles, as well as the pale ones, may find
their way in considerable numbers through the unruptured wall of the
vessels, per diapedesin, as was first suggested by Velpeau, but
definitely determined by Stricker.The causes of this migration are
obscure.Immermann[12] asserts that a fatty degeneration of the
vascular tissues and of the muscles takes place.This, however, is
manifestly a result of the loss of blood, and not its cause.Wilson
Fox[13] found extensive albuminoid disease of the muscles and
capillaries of the skin; but the albuminoid degeneration involved
several organs of a patient with syphilis, and the purpura was
certainly secondary to the morbid conditions.Rigal and Cornil[14]
think that the hemorrhages are a result either of sympathetic
irritation or of diminished action of the vaso-motor centre.It is
indeed altogether likely that the cause will ultimately be found to
reside in the vaso-motor system.[Footnote 11: _Ziemssen's Cyclop._, xvii.cit._]

[Footnote 13: _Brit.[Footnote 14: _L'Union Med._, 5, 6, 7, 1880.]{192} DIAGNOSIS.--The affection bearing the closest resemblance to
spontaneous purpura is scurvy; indeed, its supposed relationship to
this disease has given purpura one of its synonyms, land scurvy.The
two affections, however, are probably without the slightest
relationship.They possess in common the hemorrhagic symptoms, both in
the tissues and from free surfaces, but the resemblance does not extend
much beyond this.Scurvy depends upon deprivation of fresh vegetable
food and the use of unsuitable and insufficient food generally, and
upon bad hygienic surroundings.Purpura may--frequently does--appear in
broken-down constitutions, but it equally attacks the strong and
vigorous, while the character of food exerts no special influence on
its production.Scurvy only follows long-continued privations and as a
culmination of a train of distressing symptoms.Purpura appears in the
midst of health, or after brief premonition, or during convalescence
from totally unrelated diseases.In scurvy there is a decided tendency
toward ulceration, which is absent in purpura.In scurvy the mouth and
gums inflame and ulcerate, the latter becoming swollen, spongy, and of
a bluish-red color.In purpura, ulceration of the buccal mucous
membrane does not occur, and the gums are pale and intact.The curative
influence of fresh vegetables, lime-juice, etc.in the treatment of
scurvy is not observed in purpura.It has been claimed that purpura is
but a mild degree of scurvy: this cannot be so, for we may have a mild
scurvy or a severe, even fatal, purpura.The hemorrhagic diathesis, or haemophilia, presents points of analogy
with purpura.Here, however, is found the almost constant history of
heredity and the implication only of persons of the male sex.The
disposition to bleed at all times upon the receipt of the smallest
injury is quite unlike the suddenly-developed and transitory
hemorrhages of purpura, which are also more generally distributed.With the secondary hemorrhagic effusions and ecchymoses that occur in
conditions of profound alterations of the blood and blood-vessels in
cases of malignant small-pox, scarlatina, typhus fever, etc., and in
some cases of poisoning, as from phosphorus, spontaneous purpura
presents identities, but the history of the complaint and the condition
of the patient will prevent error.A knowledge of the circumstances
will serve to distinguish purpura simplex from the petechiae and small
ecchymoses produced by fleas, by diminished atmospheric pressure, by
coughing, in the course of Bright's disease, etc.Purpura rheumatica presents, as has been shown, many points of
resemblance to erythema multiforme and erythema nodosum.The mild
fever, the joint-pains, the extravasations of the latter affections,
are much like the symptoms of this form of purpura.The nodular,
inflamed, tender condition of the lesions, their location--frequently
upon the extensor surfaces of the extremities--their course and
duration, usually serve to identify erythema nodosum, while with
erythema multiforme it is usually not difficult to observe its
essentially inflammatory character.Scheby-Buch has shown the
difficulties often opposed to the differentiation of purpuric lesions
and ecchymoses due to violence.[15] Where the petechial eruption of
purpura simplex is well marked, where the internal hemorrhages of
purpura haemorrhagica are copious, the inquiries of the observer will
usually lead him to correct conclusions.Where the {193} ecchymoses are
larger and upon exposed parts of the body, the diagnosis from the
lesions alone becomes impossible, and due consideration of all
concomitant circumstances is essential.It should be remembered that in
purpura very slight violence may call forth extensive ecchymosis.This
circumstance has important medico-legal bearings.[Footnote 15: _Viertelj.und Syph._, 1879, p.PROGNOSIS.--Purpura usually terminates favorably.Its course runs from
two to six weeks, rarely longer.Purpura simplex is of very little gravity, and need excite little
apprehension.Purpura rheumatica almost always ends in recovery; fatal
terminations, however, have been known.Purpura haemorrhagica is of
much more serious import.Even here, however, though the patient may
fall into profound debility from loss of blood, recovery is the rule,
the symptoms gradually diminishing in severity until health becomes
re-established.In fatal cases death ensues after prolonged and profuse
losses of blood.Purpura may subside after a single outbreak or many
relapses, and recrudescences may occur extending through months.Anaemia may persist long after the disappearance of purpuric symptoms.A tendency to purpura may be shown at irregular intervals for years,
and even throughout life.TREATMENT.--Very mild cases of purpura simplex require no treatment,
not even confinement within doors.The patient is often first made
aware of his disease by accident; doubtless it frequently escapes
detection altogether.It has been observed that purpura often appears
upon the lower limbs of convalescents from other diseases when they
first essay the upright position.Relapses of purpura also frequently
appear as the patient leaves his bed.We have here an important
indication for treatment--viz.the maintenance of the recumbent posture
in cases of any degree of severity.Fresh vegetables and vegetable
acids do not have the same happy influence as in scurvy.It is
manifestly important that appropriate food should be administered in
sufficient quantity, both to improve the general health and to repair
the exhausting losses of blood.Milk is an exceedingly valuable article
of diet in these cases, being but little apt to irritate the mucous
membrane of the alimentary canal.Injuries that may be of
no consequence to healthy persons may excite in the purpuric profuse
hemorrhage, free or interstitial.Violent emotions and physical efforts
should be avoided, as in stimulating the heart's action a condition of
increased blood-pressure ensues that may readily result in
extravasation.There are no remedies that exert a specific influence over purpura, and
yet quite a number have enjoyed, and still enjoy, high reputation in
controlling the symptoms.Probably the most frequently employed remedy
against purpura is sulphuric acid, preferably the aromatic sulphuric
acid, in doses of from 15 to 20 drops, diluted well with water and
administered every third or fourth hour.It is certainly an agent of
value, though some authors maintain that it has no efficacy
(Immermann).Acetate of lead undoubtedly exercises an influence over
the course of the disease.Its
use has been highly extolled by Buckley and others.The hypodermic use of ergotin has been followed by
results most gratifying to those employing it.Oil of turpentine has
enjoyed considerable reputation.A remedy that undoubtedly has a good
effect is iron, both as {194} exercising a controlling action over the
bleeding and as assisting to repair the resulting anaemia.The tincture
of the chloride is the most suitable preparation, and may be given in
large doses (from minim xx to fluidrachm ss), well diluted, every
fourth hour.Care must be exercised to avoid irritating the digestive
organs with it.Formerly, venesection was employed to prevent the
occurrence of hemorrhage, but its efficacy in this direction is at
least doubtful, and cannot but help to intensify the disastrous
consequences of severe and protracted attacks.The various complications that may arise, as well as the general
results of purpura, must be treated symptomatically.For the mucous
membranes astringent washes should be used, and in favorable situations
the tampon may sometimes be employed with profit.In purpura rheumatica
the arthritic pains will be alleviated by anodyne liniments and
plasters, and the often accompanying abdominal pains and colic by
anodynes internally administered.Haematemesis, haematuria, etc.The results of profuse hemorrhage
must be combated with stimulants.Transfusion of blood has been
proposed and practised for the extreme anaemia that sometimes occurs,
but without encouraging results.If necessary, the bowels may be kept
free by mild aperients.In severe cases rest in bed should be rigidly
enforced until after the establishment of convalescence.Quinia, iron,
and nux vomica are indicated above all other remedies for the anaemia
resulting from an attack of purpura.{195}

DIABETES MELLITUS.BY JAMES TYSON, A.M., M.D.Diabetes mellitus is a term applied to a group of symptoms more or less
complex, of which the most conspicuous is an increased flow of
saccharine urine--whence the symptomatic title.It is associated with a
derangement of the sugar-assimilating office of the liver, as the
result of which an abnormally large quantity of glucose is passed into
the hepatic vein and thence into the systemic blood, from which it is
secreted by the kidneys.The condition is sometimes associated with
alterations in the nervous system, at others with changes in the liver
or pancreas, while at others, still, it is impossible to discover any
structural alterations accompanying it.To show the position of the punctures required
to produce glycosuria, the lobes of the cerebellum are separated.Below
are seen the restiform bodies, the divergence of which circumscribes
the apex of the calamus scriptorius and the fourth ventricle.The
puncture _p'_ produces glycosuria; the puncture _p_, glycosuria with
polyuria; and a puncture a little higher up than _p_, albuminuria.]PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS.--Notwithstanding that this disease has been
recognized for two centuries and a half, that abundant opportunity has
been furnished for its post-mortem investigation, and that experimental
physiology has contributed much information bearing upon the subject,
its pathology is still undetermined.Experiment has, however, rendered
it very likely that all cases of essential glycosuria--that is, all
cases in which saccharine urine is not the direct result of
over-ingestion of sugar or sugar-producing food--are accompanied by a
hyperaemia of the liver.This hyperaemia, with its consequent
glycosuria, can be induced by puncturing or irritating the so-called
diabetic area[1] in the medulla oblongata.This area corresponds with
the vaso-motor centre, and with the roots of the pneumogastric or vagus
nerve in the floor of the fourth ventricle; whence it was at first
inferred that this nerve is the excitor nerve of glycosuria.It was
soon ascertained, however, that when the pneumogastric was cut,
glycosuria ensued only when the central end was stimulated, while {196}
stimulation of the peripheral portion was without effect.Whence it
became evident that this nerve is not the excitor, but the sensory
nerve concerned in glycogenesis.[Footnote 1: The diabetic area, as marked out by Eckhard, and which
corresponds with the vaso-motor area, as defined by Owsjannikow
(_Ludwig's Arbeiten_, 1871, p.21), is bounded by a line drawn four or
five mm.above the nib of the calamus scriptorius, and another about
four mm.It was also learned in the course of continued experiment that
glycosuria resulted upon transverse section of the medulla oblongata,
of the spinal cord above the second dorsal vertebra, of the filaments
of the sympathetic accompanying the vertebral artery, upon destruction
or extirpation of the superior cervical ganglion, and sometimes, but
not always, after division of the sympathetic in the chest (Pavy); also
after section or careful extirpation of the last cervical ganglion,
section of the two nerve-filaments passing from the lower cervical to
the upper thoracic ganglion around the subclavian artery, forming thus
the annulus of Vieussens,[2] and after section or removal of the upper
thoracic ganglion.[Footnote 2: Cyon and Aladoff, reprint from the _Melanges biolgiques_
and _Bulletin de l'Academie Imperiale de Petersbourg_, vol.Brunton in the Lectures named in note on p.198; also

Vieussens.thor._, the thoracic sympathetic chain; _n.This is joined in its course by a branch from the
lower cervical ganglion, there being a small ganglion at their
junction, from which proceed nerves to form a plexus over the arch of
the aorta.It is this branch from the lower cervical ganglion which
possesses accelerator properties, hence the course of the accelerator
fibre is indicated in the figure by the arrows.(Modified from Foster's
_Physiology_.)]All these operations paralyze the vaso-motor nerves by which, in
health, the blood-vessels of the liver are kept in a state of tonic
contraction; hence these vessels dilate when the nerves are cut.From
the facts named we also learn the path of the glycogenic influence,
which must be from the medulla oblongata into the spinal cord, thence
by the filaments of the {197} sympathetic which accompany the vertebral
artery into the lower cervical ganglion; thence through the annulus of
Vieussens into the first dorsal ganglion; and thence through the
prevertebral cord of the sympathetic, and branches not precisely
determined, to the hepatic blood-vessels as shown by the dotted line in
Fig.Diagram showing the course of the vaso-motor
nerves of the liver, according to Cyon and Aladoff.These nerves are
indicated by the dotted line which accompanies them: _a_, vaso-motor
centre; _b_, trunk of the vagus; _c_, passage of the hepatic vaso-motor
nerves from the cord along the vertebral artery; _d_, fibres going on
each side of the subclavian artery and forming the annulus of
Vieussens; _e_, first dorsal ganglion; _f_, ganglionated cord of the
sympathetic; _g_, the spinal cord; _h_, the splanchnic nerves; _i_,
coeliac ganglion, from which vaso-motor nerves pass to the hepatic and
intestinal vessels; _k_, the lungs, to which fibres of the vagus are
seen distributed; _l_, the liver; _m_, the intestine; _n_, the arch of
the aorta.]I say, by branches of the sympathetic not precisely determined, because
our power to produce artificial diabetes fails below the first thoracic
ganglion; for section of the sympathetic between the tenth and twelfth
ribs, and of the splanchnics, is not followed by glycosuria, although
the vaso-motor nerves to the liver are known to pass through them.According to Eckhard,[3] the phenomena of artificial glycosuria are
irritative and not paralytic.This view he believes sustained by his
own experiments, according to which if the splanchnics, through which
{198} the vaso-motor nerves of the liver pass, are cut prior to the
diabetic puncture, not only does this operation fail to produce
glycosuria, but it even renders ineffectual the puncture itself as well
as the section higher up.But Cyon and Aladoff remind us that it is not
mere dilatation of the hepatic vessels, but increased velocity in the
movement of the blood, which deranges the sugar-assimilating function
and causes glucose to appear in the urine.The vaso-motor nerves of the
intestinal blood-vessels also pass through the lower part of the
sympathetic and the splanchnics, and section of the latter must cause
these blood-vessels to dilate.Now, in rabbits, in which this
experiment is usually performed, the digestive canal is very long, and
the blood-vessels so capacious that when dilated they hold as much
blood as all the rest of the vascular system together, so that when the
lower sympathetic and splanchnics are cut, so much blood goes into the
intestines that the increased velocity required in the blood-vessels of
the liver to produce glycosuria is impossible.But if the vessels of
the liver be first dilated by puncturing the floor of the fourth
ventricle, section of the sympathetic or of the splanchnics may then be
made without arresting the formation of sugar; whence it would appear
that the glycogenic influence may still pass through the lower
sympathetic and splanchnics.[Footnote 3: _Beitrage zur Anat.und Physiologie_, iv., 1859, p.In view of the fact that Eckhard[4] has failed to confirm the results
of Cyon and Aladoff, but has traced the glycogenic influence down the
spinal cord as far as the fourth dorsal vertebra in rabbits, and even a
little lower, and that Schiff[5] has shown that diabetes sometimes
results after section of the anterior columns of the cord between the
medulla and the fourth cervical vertebra, Dr.Brunton[6] suggests that
the vaso-motor nerves of the liver may not always leave the spinal cord
to join the sympathetic by the branches accompanying the vertebral
artery, but sometimes pass farther down the cord, leaving it by the
communicating branches to some of the dorsal ganglia, as indicated in
Fig.[Footnote 4: _Beitrage zur Anat.u. Physiologie_, viii., 1877, p.[Footnote 5: _Untersuchungen uber Zuckerbildung in der Leber_, 1859, S.[Footnote 6: _Lectures on the Pathology and Treatment of Diabetes
Mellitus_; reprinted from the _British Medical Journal_, 1874, p.Diagram showing another course which the
vaso-motor nerves of the liver may take.The letters indicate the same
parts as in Fig.The hepatic vaso-motor nerves are here represented
as passing lower down the cord than in Fig.3, and leaving it by
communicating branches to the second dorsal ganglion.It is possible
that they may sometimes leave by the branches to the first, and
sometimes by those going to a lower, ganglion.In such cases any
irritation to the third or one of the other cervical ganglia may cause
diabetes by being conveyed along the vertebral artery and up the cord,
as indicated by the dark line, to the vaso-motor centre, where it may
cause reflex inhibition in the same way as any irritation to the
vagus.]It is evident that an agency involving any part of this tract in such a
way as to paralyze the vaso-motor nerves of the liver is capable of
producing glycosuria.Such cause may operate upon the central ganglia
whence the nerves emanate, as the vicinity of the oblongata and upper
parts of the spinal cord or the coeliac ganglion and its branches,
including those to the pancreas.Or the irritation may be peripheral
and its effects reflex.We have seen that irritation of the central end
of the cut vagus will produce glycosuria.Any irritation, therefore,
involving the peripheral distribution of this nerve may produce it.Hence embarrassed respiration, whether due to disease of the
respiratory passages, strangulation, or inhalation of irrespirable
gases and anaesthetics, produces glycosuria in dogs and rabbits; and
this symptom has been known to attend these conditions in the human
subject.So, too, glycosuria may be produced by such substances as
woorara, strychnia, morphia, and phosphoric acid, introduced into the
blood and irritating the terminal filaments of the pneumogastrics, or
it may be brought about secondarily through the embarrassed respiration
these drugs produce.Such peripheral {199} irritation may reside also
in the stomach, intestines, liver, or any organ to which the
pneumogastric is distributed.It is not unlikely that irritation of the extremities of sensory nerves
other than the pneumogastric may become the cause of reflex glycosuria.Even puncture of the floor of the fourth ventricle itself may be reflex
in its operation, the roots of the pneumogastric being thus irritated.The effect of the irritation conveyed to the glycogenic centre is to
inhibit the usual tonic influence of the vaso-motor nerve upon the
vessel walls.Among the experimental irritations, in addition to
puncture of the floor of the fourth ventricle, which produce glycosuria
by reflex action, are injuries of the cerebral lobes and cerebellum,
optic thalami, cerebral peduncles, pons varolii, middle cerebellar
peduncles, and even of the sciatic nerve and brachial plexus; whence it
may be inferred that pathological irritation in the same situations may
result in a glycosuria, which is temporary or permanent according as
the irritation is temporary or permanent.Finally, there is no reason why an inhibitory reflex action should not
originate in the sympathetic itself.When we remember that this nerve
is both sensory and motor in function, and that the inhibitory
influence to which the heart's action is subject is accomplished
through the sympathetic as a sensory nerve and the pneumogastric as a
motor, there is no reason why similar results may not be brought about
by the sympathetic alone.This being the case, we need not ascribe
glycogenic phenomena to irritation in Eckhard's sense--that is, to a
direct stimulant action of the irritant upon the vaso-motor nerves of
the liver--but may suppose a sensory influence to ascend one set of
sympathetic filaments and an inhibitory influence to descend through
another.Pavy has recently put forward some chemical theories which explain
the action of the hyperaemia in producing glycosuria, but they do not
account for the hyperaemia itself.In healthy digestion the
carbohydrates (starch and sugar) are converted, not into glucose, but
into maltose, C_{12}H_{22}O_{11}, dextrin being intermediate in
composition.Maltose is absorbed and assimilated, converted into
glycogen.So, too, when glucose is ingested as such, it is converted by
the glucose ferment into maltose in the stomach and intestines.For the
proper production of maltose and its assimilation a good venous blood,
producing a maltose-forming ferment, is necessary.In diabetes, in
consequence of the dilatation of the arteries of the chylopoetic
viscera, the blood enters the liver too little deoxygenated, and a
glucose-forming ferment is produced.The glucose thus formed is not
assimilable, but passes off into the circulation and the urine.MORBID ANATOMY.--Such are some of the facts bearing upon the pathology
of diabetes mellitus.Throwing out the milder type of cases, in which
glycosuria is the result of an over-ingestion of saccharine and
sugar-producing food--and these can scarcely be called instances of
essential diabetes--it is evident that glycosuria may be produced in a
variety of ways operating through the nervous system; and accordingly
we may infer that there is scarcely an organ in close relation with the
sympathetic system derangement of which is not capable of producing it.Among these we would naturally expect to find conspicuous alterations
in the nervous centres, and yet I have never found changes in these
centres after death.At the same time, others have noted meningitis,
tubercular {200} and traumatic, apoplectic effusions, and tumors of the
brain, especially in the neighborhood of the medulla oblongata.The
alterations in the nerve-centres described by Dickinson as the
essential morbid anatomy of diabetes I have looked for in vain.These
changes are described as a cribriform or porous condition of the white
nervous matter, said to be visible to the naked eye.The spaces thus
produced are partially occupied by dilated blood-vessels, which, in
turn, are surrounded by dilated perivascular sheaths and broken-down
nervous matter, into which extravasations of blood have taken place, as
evidenced by the presence of pigment-granules.The changes are found in
the white matter of the convolutions of the brain, but fewer and larger
in the central portions.The corpora striata, optic thalami, pons,
medulla, and cerebellum are favorite seats for the largest and most
striking holes.In rapidly-fatal cases the cavities are sometimes
filled with a translucent, gelatinous substance, containing, besides
vascular elements, the globular products of nervous disintegration.In
the more chronic forms of the disease, as it occurs in elderly persons,
the excavations are usually empty, although the elements of nervous
decay are still to be found fringing the margins or collected as an
irregular sheath upon the dilated or shrunken artery.There are changes
in the cord similar to those in the brain, but less decided.But the
most striking alteration in the cord, according to Dickinson, although
not always present, is dilatation of the central canal, which in the
dorsal and lumbar regions is sometimes expanded to many times its
normal diameter, and forms a conspicuous object immediately after the
cord is divided.These alterations have eluded the vigilance of other pathologists who
have sought for them in well-determined cases of diabetes mellitus,
while they have been found, on the other hand, in the nervous centres
when no diabetes was present.In the recent discussion on diabetes at
the Pathological Society of London, Douglas Powell[7] seemed to be the
only one who was convinced that most of Dickinson's specimens were
examples of positive lesions.[Footnote 7: _London Lancet_, May 5, 1883, p.A hyaloid thickening of the blood-vessels of the brain has been noted
by Stephen Mackenzie[8] and Seymour Taylor[9] in some cases, and
miliary aneurisms of the retina in one.[Footnote 8: Discussion on Diabetes, Path.of London, _London
Lancet_, April 7, 1883, p.[Footnote 9: Ibid., _Lancet_, May 5, 1883, p.Of other organs, one of the most frequently found diseased is the
pancreas, and, according to Senator, it is fair to assume that disease
of the pancreas is present in about one-half of all cases of diabetes.As the result of increased experience, I am inclined to attach much
more importance to pancreatic disease as a cause of diabetes than I did
a few years ago.Among the changes found is a pseudo-hypertrophy, which
consists chiefly in a hyperplasia of the connective tissue, fatty
degeneration of the gland-cells, and atrophy of the glandular
structure; cancerous disease; calculous concretions in the ducts with
or without obstruction; and cystic dilatation.Facts bearing upon the relation of pancreatic disease to diabetes have
been accumulating since Cowley first discovered calculi in the pancreas
of a diabetic, and Bright pancreatic cancer in a similar case.Since
then {201} instances have multiplied to such extent that it would be
unprofitable to enumerate them.But in 1877, Lancereaux[10]
communicated to the French Academy of Medicine specimens of profound
lesion of the pancreas from cases dying of diabetes mellitus.This, he
alleged, constitutes a special and distinctive variety of diabetes,
characterized by sudden onset, emaciation, polydipsia, polyphagia, and
peculiar alvine dejections.More recently, Depierre[11] has confirmed
these observations, apparently establishing this variety of diabetes
mellitus, of which a very rapid course--six months to three years--and
the habitual presence of diarrhoea are characteristic; while the
presence of greasy or creamy stools, and the appearance in them of
undigested nitrogenous substances, may aid in the diagnosis.Precisely
such a case, running the same rapid course--less than one year--with
emaciation, uncontrollable diarrhoea, creamy stools, jaundice, and
pancreatic disease, came under the writer's care in 1882.At the
autopsy the pancreas was found enlarged, and numerous gritty particles
were disseminated through it.[Footnote 10: "Notes et reflexions a propos de deux cas de diabete
sucre avec alteration du pancreas," _Bull.de Med._, Paris, 1877,
2d Serie, vi.xxxix., June, 1881, p.Supposing such pancreatic disease to be primary, it is evident that it
must operate through the coeliac plexus, which, with its ganglion, is
gradually encroached upon.On the other hand, it is also possible that
the disease of the coeliac plexus may be primary, and the coexisting
pancreatic disease and diabetes mellitus both secondarily dependent
upon it.This can only be settled by more careful study of the coeliac
plexus after death from diabetes, but up to the present time facts
would seem to support the view of primary pancreatic disease.The liver is frequently enlarged--sometimes but slightly, at others
decidedly.It has been known to reach three times the size of the
normal organ.Again, it may be darker and harder--hyperaemic.By minute
examination the acini are found enlarged, the capillaries dilated and
distended; the liver-cells are enlarged, distinctly nucleated, rounded,
and indistinct as to their outline, appearing to fuse into each other.A weak solution of iodine strikes a wine-red color, which, according to
Rindfleisch, is confined to the nucleus, but, according to Senator, may
extend to the whole cell.This reaction Klebs ascribes to post-mortem
changes in the glycogenic substance.They are more striking in the
portal or peripheral zone of the lobule, while the intermediate or
hepatic artery zone is often fatty, and the central part, surrounded by
the rootlets of the hepatic vein, is nearly normal.Stockvis and
Frerichs ascribe the enlargement of the liver partially to a new
formation of liver-cells--in other words, to a true hypertrophy.At
other times the organ has been found reduced in size.Dickinson, Trousseau, and Budd describe an overgrowth of connective
tissue, as well as of the cells of the liver, producing a hypertrophic
cirrhosis.According to Beale, Frerichs, and Folwarczny, the fat which is found in
small proportion in the liver-cells in health is often diminished, and
even absent, and quantitative[12] analysis by the last-named observer
{202} confirms this view.Such diminution may be the forerunner of an
atrophy of liver-cells which has been noted, and which, as the disease
continues, leads to the atrophy referred to as occasionally present.On
the other hand, intense fatty degeneration of the entire organ, similar
to that found in phosphorus-poisoning, has been met by Gamgee,
associated with a lipaemic state of the blood and symptoms of acute
acetonaemia.[Footnote 12: Folwarczny, "Leberanalysen bei Diabetes Mellitus,"
_Wiener Zeitschr._, N. F., 1859, ii.The kidneys, in cases which have continued some time, are apt to be
hyperaemic and enlarged, although primarily they are uninvolved.It
would seem that the long-continued hyperaemia which is a necessary
condition of the copious secretion of urine, results, sooner or later,
in an over-nutrition of the renal epithelium, a widening of the
tubules, and consequent enlargement of the whole organ.The changes are
mainly of a parenchymatous or catarrhal rather than an interstitial
nature, the epithelium being disposed to shed.These changes may reach
a more advanced stage of cellular degeneration, and may be attended by
albuminuria.The cells may become very large, present a yellowish-brown
color, their nuclei indistinct and non-responsive to ordinary staining
solutions, but may take a red stain with a weak solution of iodine,
similar to that described in the case of the liver-cells.Mackenzie
describes a hyaline degeneration of the intima of the arterioles and a
skeleton condition of the epithelium of the collecting tubes.[13] There
may also be a catarrh of the pelves of the kidneys and ureters, due to
irritation of the saccharine urine.cit._]

Atrophy of the testes has been noted by Romberg and Seegen in young
men, and recently Hofmeier[14] has reported the case of a young
diabetic woman, aged twenty, who came under observation for pruritus
vulvae, in whom the uterus was found small, scarcely 5 cm.(2 inches)
long, and the ovaries very much atrophied.As this young woman had no
other ailment, the atrophy was ascribed to the diabetes.[Footnote 14: _Berliner klin.Wochenschr._, 1883, No.Among the most constant secondary lesions is the aggregate of changes
known as those of pulmonary phthisis.But a few years ago, when our
ideas on this subject were more definite than they are to-day, and when
it was thought we had three distinct varieties of phthisis--the
tubercular, the catarrhal, and the fibroid--the phthisis of diabetes
was regarded as typically catarrhal.[15] At the present time, however,
when the tendency at least is to regard all phthisis as tubercular,
diabetic phthisis must be consigned to the same category.At the same
time, if the tubercle bacillus is to be regarded as the essential
criterion of tuberculosis, it must be stated that the diabetic patient
is subject to two different lung processes--at least if the
observations of Riegel of Giessen[16] are to be regarded as correct.In
two cases of diabetic phthisis studied at his clinic, the sputum of one
contained numerous bacilli, while the other, although the case
presented the most distinct signs of infiltration of the apex, and
although more than fifty preparations were investigated, revealed none.The sputum was also said to present some unusual physical characters.So far as I know, no autopsies of cases showing these clinical
differences have been reported, although there have been found in
diabetes, distinct from the usual cheesy foci, fibroid changes with
small smooth-walled cavities.In such cases {203} tubercle bacilli
would be absent, while the physical signs of consolidation would be
present.[Footnote 15: See the writer's work on _Bright's Disease and Diabetes_,
Philada., 1881, p.[Footnote 16: _Medical News_, Philada., May 19, 1883, from
_Centralblatt f. klin.As a part of the phthisical process in diabetes, cavities of various
sizes are found and gangrene of the lungs has been observed.ETIOLOGY.--The problem of the etiology of diabetes mellitus is as
unsatisfactorily solved as is that of its pathogenesis.Certainly, a
majority of cases of diabetes cannot be accounted for.A certain number
may be ascribed to nervous shock, emotion, or mental anxiety; a few to
overwork; some to injury and disease of the nervous system; others to
abuses in eating and drinking.Among the injuries said to have caused
diabetes are blows upon the skull and concussions communicated to the
brain, spinal cord, or vaso-motor centres through other parts of the
body.Hereditation is held responsible for a certain number of cases.Malarial and continued fevers, gout, rheumatism, cold, and sexual
indulgence have all been charged with producing diabetes.Diabetes mellitus is most common in adult life, although Dickinson
reports a case at six years which was fatal, Bence Jones a case aged
three and a half, and Roberts another three years old; and in the
reports of the Registrar-General of England for the years 1851-60 ten
deaths under the age of one and thirty-two under the age of three are
included.This statement, in view of the experience of the difficulties
of diagnosis in children so young, seems almost incredible.I have
never myself met a case in a child under twelve years.At this age I
have known two, of which one, a boy, passed from under my notice, while
the second, a girl, recovered completely.The disease is most common
between the ages of thirty and sixty.The oldest patient I have ever
had died of the disease at seventy-two years, having been under my
observation for three and a half years.It is decidedly more frequent in men than in women, carefully prepared
statistics of deaths in Philadelphia during the eleven years from 1870
to 1880, inclusive, giving a total of 206 deaths, of which 124, or
three-fifths, were males, and 82, or two-fifths, females.Up to April, 1881,
I had never met a case in a woman.Of 18 cases outside of hospital
practice which I have noted since that date, 9 were men and 9 women.But I still do not recall an instance of a woman in hospital practice,
although I have constantly cases among men.Not much that is accurate can be said of the geographical distribution
of the disease.It seems to be more common in England and Scotland than
in this country, at least if the statistics of New York and
Philadelphia are considered.In the former city, statistics extending
over three and a fourth years show that out of 1379 deaths, 1 was
caused by diabetes; in Philadelphia, in eleven years, 1 out of 875; in
England and Wales, according to Dickinson from observations extending
over ten years, 1 out of 632; and in Scotland, 1 out of 916.According
to the same authority, the disease is more prevalent in the
agricultural counties of England, and of these the cooler ones,
Norfolk, Suffolk, Berkshire, and Huntingdon.According to Senator, it
is more common in Normandy in France; rare, statistically, in Holland,
Russia, Brazil, and the West Indies, while it is common in India,
especially in Ceylon, and relatively very frequent in modern times in
Wurtemberg and Thuringia.Seegen says it is more {204} frequent among
Jews than among Christians, but I have never seen a case in a Hebrew.SYMPTOMS, COURSE, AND DURATION.--The earliest symptom commonly noted by
the diabetic is a frequency of micturition and the passage of larger
amounts of urine than is natural.Coincident with or immediately
succeeding this is an undue thirst and dryness of the mouth, which soon
becomes the most annoying symptom the patient has, the freest draughts
of water giving but partial or temporary relief.To this succeeds
dryness, and sometimes itching, of the skin and absence of
perspiration.A good appetite with fair digestion accompanies this
stage of the disease, but notwithstanding this the patient loses in
weight.If a male, his attention is sometimes called to his urine by
the white spot left after the evaporation of a drop of urine on his
boot or clothing or by the stiffness of his linen due to the same
cause.To these symptoms are sometimes added an intolerable itching of
the end of the urethra in males and of the vulva in females, probably
due to the irritation caused by the saccharine urine in passing over
and drying upon these parts.As the disease progresses muscular weakness supervenes.This, however,
comes on at varying periods after the incipient symptoms make their
appearance.The muscular weakness
gradually increases, if the disease is not checked, until the patient
can barely walk: he totters in his gait, and reminds one of a case of
Duchenne's disease.Even before this he sometimes gives up and goes to
bed.Often harassing cough ensues, adding its exhausting effect to that
of the essential disease.Percussion and auscultation discover
consolidation at one apex or over larger areas of the lungs.Dyspepsia
and indigestion replace the good appetite which attended the onset of
the symptoms, and all efforts to increase the latter are unavailing.The heart begins to flag, and its action is irregular.It finally
ceases to act, and the patient dies suddenly, sometimes unexpectedly.This coma, known as diabetic coma,
is generally ascribed to the accumulation of acetone or
acetone-producing substance in the blood.It is supposed to be a
product of the decomposition of the sugar in the blood, and the
phenomena resulting from its presence are known as those of
acetonaemia.Some further account of it will be given in the section on
changes in the urine.It is sometimes recognizable by a fruity odor of
the breath, which may even pervade the atmosphere of the room in which
the patient lies, and may be recognized on entering.It has been
compared to the odor of a room in which apples have been kept, again to
sour beer, and again to chloroform.During all this time the thirst and discomfort arising therefrom,
continue, although it sometimes happens that toward the end the
quantity of urine and its contained sugar diminish and the urine
becomes darker in hue.Such is the course of a typical case of diabetes mellitus.Other
symptoms, less conspicuous, are a lowered temperature of the body, from
1 degree to 2-1/2 degrees F. or even more; cataract, dilatation of the
retinal vessels, intraocular lipaemia, functional derangements of
vision, including amblyopia, presbyopia, and loss of accommodating
power; and occasionally total blindness from atrophy of the retina may
be present.I have known almost total blindness to appear very early in
the disease, and {205} subsequently to disappear.Derangements of the
other special senses, as impairment of hearing, roaring in the ears,
and disorders of smell and taste, also occur.Boils and carbuncles are
occasional symptoms; although usually late in occurrence, the former
are said to be sometimes the first symptoms recognized.Numerous skin
affections may occur.Ulcerated surfaces are slow to heal, and gangrene
supervenes sometimes spontaneously, but more often as the result of
some trifling injury.It may start from a blister produced by
cantharides, although such instances are scarcely frequent enough to
justify interference with treatment demanding blisters.Allied to this tendency is a spongy state
of the gums, with recession and excavation, resulting, in asthenic
cases, in absorption of the alveolar processes and falling out of the
teeth.Eczema of the labia and vicinity in females, and a similar
irritation about the meatus urinarius in males, are annoying symptoms.A purulent-looking discharge has been seen issuing from the urethra, in
which the spores of penicilium glaucum have been recognized by the
microscope.The term diabetic coma is applied to a form of coma which is apt to
occur late in the disease, indeed most frequently to terminate it;
while it is also used to indicate a train of nervous symptoms of which
coma is the terminal one.To this train of symptoms the word
acetonaemia is also applied, and should alone be used, while the term
diabetic coma should be restricted to the terminal symptom.The coma,
as well as the previous nervous symptoms, is considered due to the
accumulation in the blood of a product of the decomposition of sugar,
formerly believed to be acetone, but now thought to be an
acetone-producing substance, probably aceto-acetic acid.It is likely
that in all cases of diabetes a small quantity of this substance exists
in the blood, from which it is separated by the kidneys and lungs,
while it is only when these channels are insufficient for its removal
that it accumulates and produces the symptoms described.Usually, the coma comes on gradually, deepening until it terminates in
death.In other instances it is preceded by various symptoms, including
dizziness, drowsiness, cephalalgia, delirium, mania, muscular pains,
gastric and intestinal symptoms, including epigastric pain,
vomiting--sometimes of blood--and even purging; also dyspnoea, with
short, panting respiration like that of an animal with both vagi cut,
and a fluctuating pulse-rate which continues until coma is established,
after which it remains rapid and small.Both the breath and urine may
exhale the peculiar odor of acetone, or it may be absent, and the urine
strikes the peculiar burgundy-red reaction with perchloride of iron to
be again referred to.These symptoms may be sudden in their occurrence, whence acute
acetonaemia, or they may ensue slowly.Ralfe,[17] who has studied the
subject of acetonaemia very thoroughly, has called attention to the
parallelism between the phenomena of acute acetonaemia and those of
acute yellow atrophy of the liver and of phosphorus-poisoning.The
sudden, sharp epigastric pain, with gastric disturbance and vomiting,
often of blood; the peculiar panting dyspnoea referred to; the short,
{206} noisy delirium, followed almost suddenly by deep coma; the fall
in temperature as the nervous symptoms develop; the irregular, and
finally rapid, pulse,--are all symptoms common to the two conditions.[Footnote 17: _Clinical Chemistry_, 1883, p.98; also Discussion on
Diabetes before Pathological Society of London, _Lancet_, April 7,
1883, p.Although acknowledged to be a grave complication, and the most frequent
cause of death in diabetes,[18] yet it does not follow that a fatal
termination is inevitable when diabetic coma sets in.I have now a
patient, a woman, who considers herself in perfect health, but in whom
there remains a trifling glycosuria, who at one time was supposed to be
dying of diabetic coma.[Footnote 18: Of 400 cases of diabetes which passed under the
observation of Frerichs, the majority died of acetonaemia (Frerich's
"Ueber den plotzlichen Tod und uber das Coma bei Diabetes," _Zeitschr.Of 53 persons dying of diabetes at
Guy's Hospital, London, during the last ten years, 33 died comatose
(Dr.Taylor, Discussion on Diabetes, Pathological Society of
London, _Lancet_, May 5, 1883).In my own experience acetonaemia has
not been so frequent a cause of death as phthisis, acute pneumonia, and
heart-failure.]Crampy pains in the legs and facial paralysis are among the nervous
symptoms sometimes present, and the term diabetic neuralgia has been
applied to a special form of neuralgia peculiar to this disease.It is
characterized by its acuteness, stubbornness, and symmetry.Its
favorite seats are the inferior dental nerves and the sciatics.Greisinger referred to the frequency of sciatica in 1859, Braun again
in 1868, and others still later; but Worms in 1881 established the
close relation between the two conditions and the features described.Most recently (1884), Cornillon[19] collected 22 cases of diabetic
neuralgia, and has further elaborated the study.Believing that
diabetes affects particularly those persons who have had serious
attacks of rheumatism and gout, he is inclined to think the neuralgia
as much due to uricaemia as to hyperglycosuria, and that these
conditions cause, not neuritis, but transitory lesions in the
nerve-centres, but whether in the membranes or gray or white matter is
undetermined.[Footnote 19: "Des nevralgies diabetiques," _Revue de Medecine_, 1884,
iv.That the phenomena of acetonaemia are those of a toxic agent or agents
in the blood derived from the sugar there present is generally
conceded, although Sanders and Hamilton,[20] after a study of the
clinical histories and the result of autopsies in several cases, are
disposed to ascribe diabetic coma to slow carbonic-acid poisoning due
to fat embolism of the pulmonary vessels.So far as I know, these
conclusions have not been reached by any other observers.R. H.
Fitz[21] and Louis Starr[22] have each reported cases of diabetic coma
with lipaemia, carefully studied with this point in view, without
finding any facts to sustain the carbonic-acid theory.[Footnote 21: "Diabetic Coma; its relations to Acetonaemia and Fat
Embolism," _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, vol.[Footnote 22: "Lipaemia and Fat Embolism in Diabetes Mellitus," _New
York Medical Record_, vol.Alterations in the Blood.--The blood of diabetics is variously charged
with sugar, which may be in such quantity as to impart a viscidity and
higher specific gravity to the plasma, which has reached 1033, the
normal being 1028.On the other hand, analyses have sometimes failed to
discover sugar in the blood after death, the result, probably, of the
tendency of the sugar to rapid disintegration.Alcohol and acetone, or
{207} acetone-producing substance (aceto-acetic acid), are occasionally
present as the products of such decomposition, to which are ascribed
the symptoms of acetonaemia already discussed.The presence of fat in the blood of diabetics was noted by the earliest
students of the disease.It is sometimes sufficient in amount to
produce a milky appearance of the serum, while the analyses of Simon
revealed a quantity of 2 to 2.4 per cent., the normal being 1.6 to 1.9
per cent.The fat thus present is said to be sometimes sufficient to
cause fat embolism in the capillaries of the lungs, and cases of this
condition have been reported by Sanders and Hamilton,[23] Louis
Starr,[24] and Rickards.[25] Ralfe ascribes the lactescent appearance
of the blood to the action of the aceto-acetic acid, since acetic will
give a milky appearance when agitated with a dilute and slightly
alkaline mixture of fatty matter at 100 degrees, and the injection of
acids into the blood of animals leads to the increase of fatty matter
in the blood and fatty infiltration of tissues.cit._]

[Footnote 24: _Loc.cit._]

[Footnote 25: _Birmingham Med.It must be admitted that the mode in which this lipaemic state of the
blood is brought about is imperfectly understood, and whether it be by
some chemical agency of the kind described by Ralfe, or by rapid
absorption of the subcutaneous fat, or from an imperfect oxidation of
absorbed fat, is undetermined.Albert G. Heyl[26] has described an altered appearance of the retinal
vessels recognizable by the ophthalmoscope, which he ascribes to the
fatty blood-plasma at the periphery of the blood-current, the normal
plasma being invisible on account of its transparency.[Footnote 26: For a detailed description of this appearance, with a
 lithograph depicting it, see the author's work on _Bright's
Disease and Diabetes_, p.The red blood-discs are diminished and their ratio to the white
corpuscles altered.In a count by F. P. Henry, in Louis Starr's case,
the number of red discs was 4,205,000 to a cubic millimeter, the normal
being at least 5,000,000; the white were 50,000 to a cubic millimeter,
or 1 white to 84 red, instead of 1 to 350 or 500.Changes in the Urine.--The most important changes in the urine are its
increase in quantity and the presence of sugar.The variations in the
former are extreme, being from an amount which but slightly exceeds the
normal to as much as 50 pints (23.65 liters) in twenty-four hours, and
even more.The quantity is of course limited by the fluid ingested, and
although it may exceed this amount for a day or more, it cannot do so
for any length of time.The more usual
quantity in the twenty-four hours is from 70 to 100 ounces (210 to 300
cc.).The quantity of sugar varies greatly in different cases and at
different times in the same case.The maximum quantity reported by
Dickinson was 50 ounces, or 1500 grammes, in twenty-four hours.The
proportion may reach as much as 15 per cent., but the more usual
amounts are from 1 to 8 per cent., or from 5 to 50 grains (.324 to 3.24
grams) to the fluidounce, or from 300 to 4000 grains (19.44 to 260
grams) in the twenty-four hours.It is important to know that intercurrent febrile disease may produce a
decided diminution in the daily quantity of urine, and of the sugar
contained in it.A similar decrease, and even disappearance, is said to
take place sometimes toward the fatal termination of a case.{208} The effect of exercise upon the sugar secretion is not uniform.Bouchardat and Kuelz have noted a diminution, and even disappearance,
of sugar from urine as its result, and it is reasonable to suppose that
judicious exercise is at least without harmful effect, while it is
certain too that muscular exercise, if excessive, will increase
glycosuria.Changes in diet of course modify the secretion of sugar, starches and
saccharine foods increasing it, while nitrogenous and oily foods
diminish it.So, too, the urine secreted on rising in the morning has
almost always less sugar in it than that passed on retiring; and it is
not rare to find no sugar in urine passed on rising, when that passed
on retiring at night may contain a small amount of sugar--from 1/4 to 1
per cent.On the other hand, I have found a small amount of sugar in
the morning urine when the evening urine contained none.Anxiety and
excitement both increase the proportion of sugar.Inosite, or muscle-sugar, is sometimes associated in urine with
diabetic sugar, and occasionally replaces it.So, too, in experiments
upon animals puncture of the fourth ventricle is sometimes followed by
inosuria instead of glycosuria, and in corresponding organic disease of
the brain the same thing is observed.The substitution of grape-sugar
by inosite in the course of diabetes is considered by Laboulbene[27] a
favorable change.[Footnote 27: "Note sur l'Inosurie, succedant au diabete glycosurique,
et paraissant avoir une action favorable," _L'Union Medicale_, Oct.As would be expected, the specific gravity of saccharine urine is
usually high--most frequently from 1025 to 1040--and Bouchardat noted a
specific gravity of 1074 in one instance.On the other hand, I have
found sugar easily detectable in urine with a specific gravity as low
as 1010.Pavy records an instance of the same specific gravity, and
Dickinson one in which the specific gravity was as low as 1008.It is
to be remembered that the sugar is rapidly destroyed when fermentation
sets in.A coincident diminution in the urea and other solids of the
urine will reduce the specific gravity of a saccharine urine otherwise
heavier.The depth of color of diabetic urine is inversely as the quantity
passed.Hence, when this is very large the urine is pale, and even
almost colorless, but it may still contain considerable amounts of
sugar and possess a decided color, quite as deep as that of urine
passed in smaller quantity.When exposed to the air, diabetic urine
becomes rapidly turbid from the growth of fungi, including the yeast
fungus and penicilium glaucum.The odor of diabetic urine just passed is usually in no way peculiar,
but as fermentation progresses an acetous odor is developed, which is
ascribed to acetic acid.At other times the odor is quite peculiar,
being spoken of as vinous or compared to that of sour beer, stale
fruit, alcohol, chloroform, or, as by one of my patients, to
sweetbrier.Diabetic urine has almost invariably an acid reaction, which becomes
more decided as fermentation progresses.As a consequence of this
increased acidity, and sometimes independent of fermentation-changes,
the urine deposits a sediment of uric acid, but with this exception
diabetic urine is generally free from sediment.Diabetic patients on a
meat diet sometimes have a good deal of uric acid from this source.Albuminuria may coexist with glycosuria, but is not generally found
until late in the disease, after changes in the kidney begin to make
their {209} appearance, unless, as may happen, glycosuria supervenes
upon primary renal disease.Alcohol and acetone, or an acetone-yielding substance--aceto-acetic
acid--are sometimes found in diabetic urine.They are products of the
breaking up of sugar, but chemists do not explicitly agree as to the
exact method in which acetone originates in the organism.First
recognized in the distillate of urine and blood of a diabetic patient
by Petters[28] through its physical properties, odor, combustibility,
etc., rather than by actual isolation, it was further investigated by
Kaulich,[29] Gerhardt,[30] Rupstein,[31] and Markownikoff,[32] who
obtained it in an impure state from urine; by Deichmuller and
Tollens,[33] whose isolated substance was pure, and finally most
recently by Jaksch[34] and Penzoldt.[35] The former found it not only
in diabetic urine, but also in that of fever, and even of carcinoma.The latter found it by the indigo test in but 18 out of 22 diabetics,
and by the iodoform test, either decidedly or feebly, in 20 out of 20;
in 3 out of 11 cases of typhoid fever, in 6 out of 7 cases of
pneumonia, in none of 6 cases of phthisis, in 1 out of 3 cases of
measles, and in 1 case of cerebro-spinal meningitis.Finally, v. Jaksch
has been led to believe, from his extensive investigations, that
acetone is a constant and normal product of tissue-change, although
Penzoldt considers such conclusion scarcely justified.[Footnote 28: _Prager Vierteljahrschrift_, xiv.[Footnote 29: _Ibid._, xvii.[Footnote 32: _Liebig's Annalen_, Bd.[Footnote 33: _Ibid._, Bd.[Footnote 34: _Zeitschrift fur physiol.[Footnote 35: "Beitrage zur Lehre von der Acetonurie und von verwandten
Erscheinungen," _Deutsch.Med._, xxxiv., 2 Oct., 1883,
S.Gerhardt early discovered a substance in the urine of diabetics and
habitual drinkers which struck a deep-red reaction with chloride of
iron.This he considered was the source of acetone, and was probably
ethyl diacetate or diacetic ether, which by decomposition yields equal
molecules of acetone and alcohol; thus:

  C_{4}H_{5}O_{3}C_{2}H_{5} + H_{2}O = C_{3}H_{6}O + CO_{2} +
                                                          C_{2}H_{6}O.

  Ethyl diacetate.This view is still held by some, but others, in view of the recent
discovery of Deichmuller and Tollens,[36] that diabetic urine when
distilled yields decidedly more acetone than alcohol, have suggested
that the substance is derived from aceto-acetic acid.cit._]

The first test suggested for acetone was Gerhardt's chloride-of-iron
test.A solution of chloride of iron added to urine containing acetone
strikes a burgundy-red color.But this reaction occurs with so many
substances that it cannot be considered entirely reliable.Ralfe's
modification of Lieben's iodoform test[37] is made as follows: About a
fluidrachm (3.7 c.c.)of liquor potassae, containing 20 grains (1.2
grams) of iodide of potassium, is placed in a test-tube and boiled; a
drachm (3.7 c.c.)of the suspected urine is then carefully floated upon
the surface.When the urine comes in contact with the hot alkaline
solution a ring of phosphates is formed, and after a few minutes, if
acetone or its allies are present, the ring will become yellow and
studded with yellow dots of iodoform, which, in turn, will sink through
the ring of phosphates and deposit itself at the bottom of the
test-tube.A number of other substances {210} produce the iodoform
reaction, but only one of these, lactic acid, is likely to be met in
urine.[Footnote 37: _Clinical Chemistry_, Philadelphia, 1884, p.The perspiration, saliva, exudations, and effusions in diabetic cases
have all been found, at times, to contain sugar.DURATION.--Diabetes is a disease of which the duration is measured by
months and years, and although cases are reported in which death
supervened in from six days to six weeks after the recognition of the
disease, it is evident that such periods do not necessarily measure its
actual duration.The disease may have existed some time before coming
under observation.On the other hand, a case is reported by Lebert
which lasted eighteen years; another, under the successive observation
of Prout and Bence Jones, sixteen years; and a third, under Bence Jones
and Dickinson, fifteen years.The younger the patient the shorter
usually is the course run and the earlier the fatal termination.Yet I
have known a girl of twelve recover completely.After middle age the
disease is usually so easily controlled by suitable dietetic measures,
if the patient is willing to submit to them, that its duration is only
limited by that of an ordinary life, while carelessness in this respect
is apt to be followed by early grave consequences.COMPLICATIONS.--The almost sole complication of diabetes mellitus is
the tubercular phthisis which so often terminates it.Indeed, it is
doubtful whether this complication should not be regarded as a
consequence, as should also the boils, gangrenous processes, and
ophthalmic conditions which have been mentioned under Symptomatology.Jaundice has occurred three times in my experience up to the present
time.Senator says that when not an accidental complication due to a
catarrh of the duodenum it may result from compression of the biliary
capillaries by the overloaded blood-vessels and enlarged gland-cells of
the liver.In one of my cases, in which jaundice appeared to be the
initial symptom, but which disappeared some months before death, the
autopsy revealed atrophy of the liver.It is well known that pancreatic
disease, especially cancer, is apt to be accompanied by jaundice, and
as pancreatic disease is often at the bottom of diabetes, it will
similarly account for the jaundice, while the presence of jaundice may
also suggest a pancreatic diabetes.DIAGNOSIS, INCLUDING THE TESTS FOR SUGAR IN THE URINE.--The diagnosis
of diabetes mellitus, the disease being once suspected, is easy.The
passage of large amounts of pale urine of high specific gravity, the
presence of thirst, dryness of the mouth, fauces, and skin, and
progressive emaciation even while the appetite is good, can scarcely be
misinterpreted.In the urine from such a case the application of any of
the tests for sugar will produce prompt response.The urine is not
always so much increased as to attract attention, while its color is
also sometimes but slightly changed; but the symptoms of thirst and
dryness or clamminess of the mouth are seldom wanting.On the other
hand, the discovery of a glycosuria without these symptoms is, as a
rule, accidental.It is a question how far such degrees of glycosuria
as do not produce the usual symptoms of diabetes in an appreciable
degree are signs of positive disease.At the same time, its detection
is important, in that there is always danger of the simple glycosuria
becoming a diabetes--a danger which its recognition and suitable
treatment may avert.Accordingly, the urine of all persons having
unusual appetites without evident cause, {211} and of those who are
fond of eating and drinking, should be tested for sugar.This should
also be done for those who have passed through severe mental or
physical strain, have suffered shock or concussion of the nervous
system, blows upon the abdomen, etc.Testing for Sugar.--Under the head of Diagnosis I prefer to include the
testing for sugar, which requires some detailed consideration.Unless
it be that the indigo test recently revived by George Oliver of London
prove more delicate, that form of cupric test known as Fehling's
solution is, with suitable precautions, all things considered, the most
satisfactory for general use.Fehling's volumetric solution, suitable for both qualitative and
quantitative purposes, is made as follows: Dissolve 34.639 grams of
pure crystallized cupric sulphate in about 200 cubic centimeters of
distilled water; 173 grams of chemically pure crystallized neutral
sodio-potassic tartrate and 80 grams of potassium hydrate in 500 or 600
c.c.To the latter add the copper solution slowly,
and dilute the clear mixed fluid to 1 liter.One cubic centimeter of
this solution will be decolorized by 0.005 grm.of sugar, or 200 grains
will be decolorized by 1 grain of sugar.Or the copper may be dissolved
in 1 liter of water, and the tartrate and potassium hydrate in another,
and a cubic centimeter of each mixed at the moment they are to be used.For qualitative testing, put a cubic centimeter of Fehling's solution
into a test-tube (or if the copper and the alkaline sodio-potassium
tartrate solutions are kept separate, a cubic centimeter of each), and
dilute with distilled water to 5 c.c.Boil, and if, after the lapse of
a couple of minutes, the solution remain unchanged, it is fit for
testing.If it becomes turbid or a red sediment falls, it is spoiled,
and a new solution should be obtained.[38] A cubic centimeter of the
suspected urine is then measured out and added drop by drop to the
solution kept hot.If there is much sugar, the first drop will throw
down a yellow precipitate of suboxide of copper, which becomes rapidly
red.If no reaction takes place after adding the entire cubic
centimeter of urine, the addition should be continued until 4 c.c.are
added, when, if, after the mixture has cooled, there be no response, it
may be concluded that the urine is free from sugar.By operating with a
cubic centimeter of the test-fluid and the same quantity of urine or
multiples thereof, we may roughly estimate the proportion of sugar.Thus, if the cubic centimeter of undiluted urine just decolorizes the
cubic centimeter of Fehling's solution, sugar is present in the
proportion of one-half of 1 per cent.; or if a half cubic centimeter of
the urine removes all the color, the quantity is 1 per cent.If the
urine is highly charged with sugar, it may be diluted, and the degree
of dilution being remembered, a rough quantitative estimation may be
similarly made.[Footnote 38: Should this not be possible, a little more soda may be
added and the fluid filtered, when it is again ready for use.]If the urine contains very minute quantities of sugar, the reaction is
less satisfactory.The copper is reduced, but the suboxide is so small
in quantity that it is obscured by the excess of copper solution, and a
mixture results which is greenish or greenish-yellow or yellow or
milky, and on standing a small yellow sediment falls to the bottom.Now, it dare not be said that it is sugar which produces such reaction.It may be {212} sugar, but it may also be uric acid.Uric acid is
really more frequently a source of error than is commonly supposed.I
have myself seen the reaction due to it so vivid that I did not suspect
it could be due to any reducing agent excepting sugar; but, noting the
next day a copious sediment of uric acid which had fallen during the
night, a testing of the supernatant fluid then revealed no reaction
whatever.Such a urine, after being treated by the lead process to get
rid of the uric acid, fails also to respond.But this process is very
tedious,[39] and cannot be conveniently carried out by the busy
practitioner.The same thing is, however, accomplished by treating the
urine with hydrochloric acid, which in twenty-four hours precipitates
all of the uric acid.Simple precipitation by lead acetate solution and
filtration does not answer, because all of the uric acid is not thus
removed.Other substances, as hippuric acid, urates, hypoxanthin, etc.,
are said to act similarly, but they produce no practical interference
with the test.On the other hand, a small amount of sugar may be
present and yet fail to show the reaction, because the cuprous oxide is
held in solution by certain substances.Such are ammonia and
nitrogenous matters, including albumen, creatinin, pepsin, peptones,
urinary coloring matters, etc.The latter probably produce their effect
through the ammonia which is given off while heating them in the
presence of an alkali.Hence all albumen should be precipitated and
filtered out of urines suspected to contain sugar, and the heat applied
should not be too great.Finally, excess of glucose will also hold in
solution cuprous oxide, so that the suspected urine should not be added
in too large a quantity at a time, but rather drop by drop.[Footnote 39: The details of this process will be found in the writer's
work on the _Practical Examination of Urine_, 5th ed., 1883, p.But qualitative testing is not sufficient during the treatment of a
case of diabetes.The percentage of sugar and the quantity discharged
in twenty-four hours should be determined occasionally.The process is
done as follows: Place 10 cubic centimeters of Fehling's solution in a
porcelain capsule, and dilute it with 40 c.c.Fill
a Mohr's burette with the urine, which, if it contain more than 1 per
cent.of sugar, should be diluted with nine times its bulk of distilled
water.Slowly heat the contents of the capsule to boiling, and then
allow a little of the diluted urine to run in from the burette;
continue the cautious addition of urine and the gentle heating until
the blue color is completely removed from the Fehling's solution.To
determine the exact moment at which this takes place requires a little
experience, but its recognition is facilitated by carefully tilting the
capsule after each addition and stirring, so that its clear white
surface may be seen through the edge of the fluid and contrasted with
the latter.The number of cubic centimeters of urine used should now be
read off from the burette, the number of c.c.of undiluted urine
calculated therefrom, and each c.c.The result
indicates the quantity of sugar in grams in the urine employed, whence
the percentage of sugar is determined, and also the twenty-four hours'
quantity, the amount of urine passed in that period being known.The Fermentation Test.--A very simple and easy method of determining
the proportion of sugar is by Roberts's fermentation method, which,
although not so precise as the volumetric process, is still {213}
sufficiently so for clinical purposes.A small piece of German yeast or
a teaspoonful of liquid yeast is added to about four ounces (120 c.c.)of the urine, which is kept lightly stopped, at a temperature of 20
degrees to 30 degrees C.), for about
twelve hours; at the end of this time the sugar will have been
converted into alcohol and carbonic acid.The latter will have passed
off, and the urine lost in weight because of the destruction of sugar;
while the difference between the specific gravity before and after the
fermentation indicates the number of grains of sugar per fluidounce.Thus, suppose the specific gravity before fermentation to have been
1040, and afterward 1025; there will have been 15 grains of sugar to
the fluidounce, whence, again, the twenty-four hours' quantity can be
calculated.If the metric system is used, each degree of specific
gravity lost will correspond to.2196 grams of sugar in every 100 c.c.The specific gravity of the fermented urine should be compared with
that of the urine soon after it is passed, because saccharine urine
under suitable circumstances undergoes fermentation without the
addition of yeast; and, the specific gravity being thus lowered
spontaneously, the reduction in the urine fermented by yeast would
appear less than it actually is.At the same time, care should be taken
that the urine is of the same temperature when the specific gravity is
taken before and after fermentation.The Picric Acid and Potash Test.--Although attention was called in 1865
by C. D. Braun,[40] a German chemist, to a reaction between grape-sugar
and picric acid, as the result of which the latter is converted into
picramic acid, very little attention seems to have been paid to this
announcement.Quite ignorant of it, George Johnson rediscovered this
reaction in 1882, and published it in 1883.[41] It is applicable to
both qualitative and quantitative purposes.In order to make use of it,
a standard comparison-solution is made as follows: Take 1 fluidrachm of
a solution of grape-sugar, 1 grain to the fluidounce; mix it in a long
test-tube with half a drachm of liquor potassae (U. S. P. or B.and
ten minims of a saturated solution of picric acid; dilute the mixture
to 4 fluidrachms with distilled water, to facilitate which a tube used
for the purpose may be marked at 4 fluidrachms.Raise the mixture to
the boiling-point, and continue the boiling for sixty seconds, to
ensure complete reaction between the sugar and picric acid.During the
boiling the pale-yellow color of the liquid is changed to a vivid
claret-red.Cool the liquid by cautiously immersing the tube in cold
water, and if it is not then at the level of the 4-drachm mark, raise
it to this by adding distilled water.The standard color thus obtained
is that which results from the decomposition of picric acid by a grain
of sugar to the ounce, four times diluted, or by a solution of sugar
containing one-quarter of a grain per ounce.But the picramic solution
rapidly becomes pale on exposure, so it becomes necessary to make a
more permanent solution to use as a standard.This may be accomplished
by combining liquor ferri perchloridi drachm j, liquor ammonii acetatis
drachms iv, acidum aceticum (glacial) drachms iv, and water enough to
make ounces iiss.The color of this is identical with that of the
picric acid reduced by a one-grain solution diluted four times, and,
{214} according to Johnson, it will retain its color unchanged for at
least six months.At the same time, whenever a new solution is made it
should be compared with that of the one-quarter grain per ounce
solution of sugar, boiled with picric acid and potash.[Footnote 40: "Ueber die Umwandlung der Pikrinsaure in Pikramminsaure,
und Ueber die Nachweisung der Traubenzucker," _Zeitschrift fur Chemie_,
1865.][Footnote 41: _British Medical Journal_, March, 1883.]For qualitative testing Johnson directs: To a drachm of urine in a
test-tube add a few drops, enough to give a distinct yellow color, of a
saturated solution of picric acid.Add about 10 drops of liquor
potassae and boil.If sugar is present, the mixture becomes promptly
red in hue._Johnson's Picro-Saccharimeter_.The shading of the side tube indicates the ferric-acetate standard.The
darker shading at the bottom of the graduated tube shows the saccharine
fluid, darkened by boiling with picric acid and potash, and occupying
ten divisions between dilution.]The quantitative estimation is based upon an accurate approximation, by
dilution, of the color of the tested fluid with that of the standard
solution.Johnson recommends the picro-saccharimeter figured in the
text.This is a stoppered tube twelve inches long and three-quarters of
an inch in diameter, graduated into ten, and each of these again into
ten other equal divisions.By the side of this tube, and held in
position by an S-shaped band of metal, is a stoppered tube of equal
diameter and about six inches long, containing the standard solution
corresponding to the reaction of the one grain of grape-sugar with
picric acid and potash diluted four times.It has been found that ten minims of a cold saturated solution of
picric acid are rather more than sufficient for decomposition by one
drachm of a solution of grape-sugar in the proportion of one grain to
the ounce.A drachm of the solution will therefore contain one-eighth
of a grain of sugar, which is the strength of the solution used in
making the standard-color liquid.In making the analysis, while the
quantity of liquor potassae used is always the same and the dilution is
always to four drachms, the picric acid must be added in proportion to
the amount of sugar present, so that if the urine contains as much as
six grains to the fluidounce, sixty drops or a fluidrachm of the
picric-acid solution would have to be used; and when the proportion of
sugar is higher than this, the urine should be diluted with distilled
water five or ten times before commencing the analysis, and the degree
of dilution remembered in the computation.If, now, a drachm of a solution of grape-sugar, containing two grains
to the ounce, be mixed with the same quantity of liquor potassae and
picric acid and increased by the addition of distilled water to four
drachms in the boiling tube, and boiled as before for sixty seconds,
the result will be a mixture of much darker color than will be produced
by the one-grain solution; but if the dark liquid be diluted with its
own volume of water, the color will be the same as that of the
one-grain solution or the standard.It is plain, then, that if a given quantity of the dark saccharine
fluid produced by boiling--say, enough to cover ten divisions of the
graduated tube, as shown in the figure--has to have added to it an
equal bulk of distilled water in order to produce {215} the color of
the standard solution, the tested fluid will be of the strength of two
grains to the ounce; if three times, three grains; and so on; while
fractional additions, as indicated by the graduated markings, would
show fractional additions to the proportion of sugar.[42]

[Footnote 42: A more exact comparison of the saccharine liquid with the
standard is made by pouring into a flat-bottomed colorless tube six
inches long and an inch in diameter as much of the standard solution as
will form a column about an inch in height, and an exactly equal column
of the saccharine fluid in a precisely similar tube.The operator then
looks down through the two tubes at once, one being held in each hand,
upon the surface of a white porcelain slab or piece of white paper.In
this way slight differences of tint are easily recognized; and if the
liquid to be analyzed is found darker than the standard, it is returned
to the graduated tube and diluted until the two liquids are found to be
identical in color, when the final reading is made.]The presence of albumen, even in considerable amount, has but little
effect upon the test, nor does the coloring matter of normal urine,
according to Johnson; but he says there is a coloring matter associated
with ser-albumen in albuminous urine, and with egg-albumen as well,
which has a reducing action on picric acid.This is partly separated by
filtering off the precipitated albumen, and entirely removed by
repeated filtration through animal charcoal.So, too, the albumen
removed by coagulation and filtration, if thoroughly washed, does not
give any red reaction if boiled with picric acid and potash diluted in
the same proportion as when testing for sugar.Neither do any other
unoxidized sulphur compounds found in urine decompose the picric acid
and render the test fallacious.Johnson and his son, G. Stillingfleet Johnson, claim that the
picric-acid test is as accurate as any other, and that it is even more
accurate than either Fehling's or Pavy's process, because the picric
acid is not acted upon by uric acid or urates, which do reduce the
oxide of copper.The method of analysis by the picro-saccharimeter,
they claim, is at least as speedy and as easy as any other.The
materials and apparatus required are easily prepared, inexpensive, and
not, like Fehling's copper solution, liable to undergo rapid changes.But while Johnson claims that neither coloring matters of normal urine
nor uric acid reduce the picric acid, he admits that he has tested with
picric acid and potash a large number of specimens of normal urine with
the almost uniform result of a depth of color indicating the proportion
of.6 of a grain of sugar to the fluidounce, the indication varying
between the limits of.5 to.7 grain.The ammonio-cupric method used at
the same time gave results of from.7 to.9 grain to the fluidounce, or
an excess of.1 to.3 grain.Now, if my own views, the grounds for
which are announced elsewhere,[43] are correct, strictly normal urine
contains no sugar, and any reducing action upon oxide of copper is due
to uric acid, either picric acid is reduced to a degree by uric acid or
by some other constituent of normal urine.This, in the light of
Oliver's[44] recent investigations, may be kreatinin.For he has shown
that kreatinin strikes in a few seconds a red color with the cold
alkaline picric solution, which is quickened by heat.From this it
would seem that the exact value of the picric-acid test has as yet to
be determined.[Footnote 43: Tyson, _Practical Examination of Urine_, 4th ed.,
Philadelphia, 1884.][Footnote 44: _On Bedside Urine-Testing, including Qualitative Albumen
and Sugar_, by Geo.Oliver, M.D., London, Member of the Royal College
of Physicians of Lond., etc., 2d ed., London, 1884.]{216} The Indigo-Carmine Test.--The fact that indigotine, the coloring
matter of commercial indigo, is converted into indigo when heated with
an alkali in the presence of glucose and certain carbohydrates, has
recently been applied by George Oliver of London in the construction of
a test-paper.Carmine of indigo is the sulph-indigotate of sodium, an
intensely blue salt, soluble in 120 parts of water.Sulph-indigotic
acid is made by heating indigo with sulphuric acid, and when combined
with a base, sodium, produces indigo-carmine.When sodium carbonate is
mixed with a solution of indigo-carmine, the latter is precipitated in
a minute state of division, but is redissolved on heating, when there
results a greenish-blue solution.A freshly-made mixture of the indigo
solution and sodium carbonate furnishes a fluid not unlike Fehling's
solution, which gives the reaction to be described with glucose.Unfortunately, such a mixture will not keep, and the reagent would be
useless but for the happy idea of Oliver of making the test-paper.In
doing this bibulous paper is immersed in a solution of indigo-carmine
with carbonate of sodium.[45] The paper is then cut into strips an inch
long and one-quarter of an inch wide.[Footnote 45: No more precise directions than this are given by Oliver,
either in his papers in the _Lancet_ for 1883 or in his little book
just published, _On Bedside Urine-Testing_.The sugar test-papers, as
well as the entire series of albumen test-papers, suggested by Oliver,
are now made by Parke, Davis & Co.of New York, and by Wilson & Son,
Harrogate, London.]Mode of Testing.--One of the test-papers and a sodium carbonate
paper[46] are dropped into a half-inch test-tube, and water added until
the upper end is just covered; a column of fluid one inch in height and
half an inch in diameter will thus be produced, so that the solution of
carmine obtained on boiling will always acquire the same concentration.Heat is now applied, the tube being gently shaken, and boiling kept up
for a second or two.The
test-paper may now be removed or allowed to remain.[Footnote 46: Test-papers of the same size, charged with a saturated
solution of sodium carbonate.]Not more than one drop of the suspected urine is let fall into the tube
from a pipette held in an upright position.Drops of equal size are
thus secured.The contents of the tube are again freely boiled for a
few seconds, after which the tube should be raised an inch or more from
the flame and held without shaking, while the solution is kept quite
hot, but not boiling, for exactly one minute.If glucose be present in
abnormal amount, the soft rich blue will be seen first of all to darken
into violet; then, according to the quantity of sugar, there will
appear in succession, purple, red, reddish-yellow, and finally
straw-yellow.When the last-named color has been developed the
slightest shaking of the tube will cause red streaks to fall from the
surface and mingle with the pale yellowness of the solution, while
further agitation will cause the return of purple and violet and the
restoration of the original blue.The time required for the commencement of the reaction after the
boiling of the test liquid is in inverse proportion to the amount of
glucose present.When the latter is large, over 20 grains to the ounce,
it will be but a few seconds; but when small, 2 or 3 grains, from
thirty to sixty seconds may elapse.If the urine do not contain more
than the normal amount of sugar[47]--_i.e._ under half a grain to the
ounce--the color of the solution {217} at the end of the heating for
one minute will be unchanged.The test is available by artificial light
as well as by daylight.[Footnote 47: It will be noted from this that Oliver accepts the view
that there is a small amount of sugar in normal urine.]Care should be taken during the testing not to shake
the tube or to permit free ebullition.While keeping the contents of
the tube hot, the latter should not be held up between the eye and the
sky, for then the early color-changes will probably escape observation.The tube should be kept below the eye-level and its contents viewed by
the reflected light of some bright object, such as a sheet of white
paper propped up an inch or two beyond the tube as a background.Oliver is not aware that the presence of earthy carbonates will prevent
the carmine reaction, but as a precautionary measure he suggests the
use of a soda-paper whenever the water is exceptionally hard.The
acids of the urine rob the carmine-paper of much alkali, so that the
addition of more than a certain number of drops of urine--varying of
course with the degree of acidity--will at first <DW44> and then
prevent the reaction.The addition of the soda-paper will prevent any
such interference, although Oliver says that by invariably submitting
only one drop of saccharine urine to the test-paper, and keeping up the
heating for not less than two minutes, he has never failed to obtain
the characteristic reaction without using a soda-paper.It is well to
remember, however, that an excessively acid urine may thus interfere,
and that the soda-paper will prevent it.The blue color of the
carmine is discharged by caustic alkali--liquor potassae or sodae.The
only chance of being misled by this reaction lies in using an
imperfectly cleansed test-tube which may have contained Fehling's
solution or the alkaline picric solution.The caustic alkali converts
the blue carmine into a green solution, which, on heating, disappears;
nor does it return by again shaking the contents of the tube.Critical comparison of this test with Fehling's solution and picric
acid by Oliver has shown that of sixty-four substances experimented
upon, normal and abnormal constituents of urine or medicines which
after ingestion are eliminated in the urine, Fehling's was reduced by
fifteen, picric acid by eleven, and indigo-carmine by eight.The only
substances producing the characteristic play of colors with
indigo-carmine test-papers reacted with both picric acid and Fehling's
solution.They were unoxidized phosphorus, ammonium sulphide,
milk-sugar, dextrin, inosit, gallic acid, tannic acid, and iron
sulphate.Both the carmine and picric acid were reduced by inosit,
which merely turned Fehling's solution green.On the other hand, uric
acid and urates, which reduce Fehling's solution, do not react with the
carmine test, while kreatinin, which reacts with picric acid also, does
not respond to the carmine.Albumen, if abundant, interferes with
Fehling, but not with the indigo-carmine.Detection of Inosit.--It has been said that inosit sometimes
accompanies, and even substitutes, grape-sugar in the course of
diabetes.It has been mentioned that it does not reduce Fehling's
solution, but turns it olive-green.It reduces the carmine and alkaline
picric acid solution, and is therefore not recognizable by these.The
methods recommended for its recognition in the books are troublesome,
and as its presence in the absence of sugar indicates a favorable
change, it is not likely that a more precise recognition than is
furnished by the olive-green reaction will be needed for clinical
purposes.PROGNOSIS.--The prognosis in diabetes depends upon the organ whose
{218} involvement is responsible for the symptoms, upon the stage at
which the condition comes under observation, and upon the age of the
patient.It has appeared to me that the cases of diabetes depending
upon pancreatic disease are the most intractable, that their progress
is scarcely checked by treatment, and that they are comparatively
rapidly fatal in their termination.In the others, where the symptom is
one of a central nervous lesion, it has always seemed to me to be of
secondary importance that the glycosuria is itself less marked, that it
is unattended by the other distinctive symptoms of diabetes, and that
its issue is that of the nervous malady.Again, it is well known that the later in life diabetes occurs the more
amenable it is to treatment, and that if a proper diabetic diet be
adhered to by the patient his life need scarcely be shortened.On the
other hand, diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the expectant plan
is dangerous.If it does not improve it usually gets worse; and many a
patient has fallen a victim to his own indifference and indisposition
to adhere to a regimen under which he could have lived his natural term
of life.This is especially the case when the disease appears after
middle life.If, on the other hand, the condition becomes thoroughly established
before twenty-five years of age, it is less amenable to treatment; but
even in such cases a promptly vigorous treatment is sometimes followed
by recovery.I have already mentioned the case of a child twelve years
old in which complete recovery took place.If tubercular phthisis supervenes, recovery is not to be expected,
while intercurrent disease, as pneumonia, which is rather prone to
occur, is very much more serious and apt to terminate fatally.TREATMENT.--The treatment of the aggregate of symptoms known as
diabetes mellitus is conveniently divided into the dietetic, the
medicinal, and the hygienic, of which the first is by far the most
important.The efficiency of this treatment depends upon the successful
elimination from the diet of all articles containing grape-sugar,
cane-sugar, beetroot-sugar, and starch, it being universally recognized
that in the early stages of the disease these foods are the sole source
of the glucose in the urine.The normal assimilative action of the
liver, by which the carbohydrates are first stored up as glycogen, and
then gradually given out as glucose or maltose to be oxidized, being
deranged, such foods not only become useless as aliments, but if
continued seem to aggravate the glycosuria, and the excretion of sugar
steadily increases.There is, therefore, a double reason for excluding
them from the food.This is easiest accomplished by an exclusive milk
diet.The exclusive milk treatment of diabetes was suggested by A.
Scott Donkin in 1868.That he is correct in his assertion that in the
early stages of diabetes lactin or sugar of milk is quite assimilable,
and does not in the slightest degree contribute to the production of
glycosuria, I cannot doubt; that it is in this respect even superior to
casein, as claimed by Donkin, I am not prepared to state from actual
knowledge; but that casein itself resists the sugar-forming progress
immeasurably greater than any other albuminous substance, so that in
all but the most sure and advanced or complicated cases its arrest is
complete, I am also satisfied.Certain it is that in a large number of
diabetics the use of a pure skim-milk regimen results in a total
disappearance of the sugar from the urine.That in a certain proportion
of these cases a {219} gradual substitution of the articles of a mixed
diet may be resumed without a return of the symptoms is also true.In
other more confirmed cases the use of skim-milk results in a decided
reduction in the amount of sugar, with an abatement of other symptoms,
which continues as long as the diet is rigidly observed.In still other
cases, while the skim-milk treatment makes a decided impression upon
the quantity of sugar, it still remains present in considerable amount,
while the disease progresses gradually to an unfavorable issue.These
three classes of cases represent, ordinarily, different stages of the
disease, so that it may be said that as a rule cases recognized
sufficiently early may be successfully treated with skim-milk, although
it may occasionally happen that cases pursue a downward course from the
very beginning despite all treatment.Yet I have never seen a case
which, when taken in hand when a few grains of sugar only to the ounce
were present, failed to yield to this treatment.As to the method of administration, my practice with adults is to give
eight ounces (an ordinary tumblerful) every two hours, beginning at
seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and continuing to the same hour
in the evening.Sometimes it is well to begin with half as much at
first, but rapidly to increase to the required amount.This method
ensures the ingestion of three to four quarts daily--a quantity
generally sufficient to maintain the body-weight of an adult person of
average size and taking moderate exercise, although a slight reduction
may take place at first.But if the individual is very active or of
large size, it will not be found sufficient.In such event the quantity
must be increased as demanded by a feeling of unsatisfied hunger.I
have known fourteen pints to be taken in twenty-four hours.But when
the quantity becomes thus large, the inconvenience in ingesting it is
very great, and it is much more convenient to coagulate the casein of a
part of the milk and use the curd thus obtained, while the second part
is drunk.Curd may be seasoned with salt to make it more palatable, and
should be thoroughly masticated before it is swallowed.The milk should not be taken too cold, especially if the amount
ingested is large, else it is likely to reduce the temperature of the
stomach below the point necessary for gastric digestion.The
temperature should not be less than 60 degrees F., nor much over 100
degrees.Something depends upon the idiosyncrasies of the patient,
which must be the guide as to temperatures intermediate between those
named.The chief advantage of the skim-milk over the unskimmed is simply that
it is more easy of digestion.Many persons who cannot take unskimmed
milk for any length of time without its deranging the digestion, or, as
is commonly said, making them bilious, can take with impunity milk from
which the cream is removed.Although Salomon[48] claims to have shown
that glycogen is produced in the liver of rabbits fed upon pure olive
oil, it is at least probable that fat is among the last of the
substances undergoing this conversion, and in ordinary cases of
diabetes it is rather its indigestible nature which renders it prudent
to remove from milk the greater proportion of fat by skimming it off.[Footnote 48: _Virchow's Archiv_, Bd.61, Heft 3, 1874, 18.]Still more easily assimilable is the peptonized milk, in which the
casein is at least partially digested, and it should be employed where
there is any {220} difficulty in the way of using the ordinary milks.Either skimmed or unskimmed milk may be used for peptonizing, the
latter peptonized being quite as easy of digestion as the former
unpeptonized.I have found the extractum pancreatis of Fairchild
Brothers & Foster most successful in the peptonizing of milk, and
according to the following directions: Into a clean quart bottle put 5
grains of extractum pancreatis, 15 of bicarbonate of sodium, and a gill
of cool water; shake, and add a pint of fresh cool milk.Place the
bottle in a pitcher of hot water or set the bottle aside in a warm
place, usually for three-quarters of an hour.When the milk has
acquired a slightly bitter taste, it has been completely
peptonized--that is, the casein has been completely converted into
peptone.After the process is complete the milk must be immediately put
on ice.It is not always necessary to completely peptonize the milk, and if the
bitter taste is unpleasant the process may be stopped short of this by
putting the milk on ice, the degree of digestion depending upon the
length of time the milk is kept warm.While I am confident that the promptest and most effectual method of
eliminating sugar from the urine is by a milk diet, it occasionally
happens that a patient cannot or will not submit to so strict a
regimen.In other instances, again, it is not necessary to resort to
it, because a less restricted diet answers every purpose.A suitable diabetic diet would also be obtained by eliminating from the
bill of fare all saccharine and amylaceous and other sugar-producing
substances.Such a diet is, strictly speaking, impossible.For, apart
from the fact just mentioned that even fats, as well as albuminous
substances to a degree, are capable of producing glycogen, the monotony
of a pure meat diet soon becomes unbearable, to say nothing of other
derangements it may produce.Fortunately, it is not necessary that such
an exclusive diet should be maintained, for certain saccharine foods
seem capable of resisting the conversion into sugar more than others.Sugar of milk, or lactin, has already been mentioned as one of these,
and to it may be added the sugar of some fruits, and probably also
inosit or muscle-sugar, mannite or sugar of manna, and inulin, a
starchy principle abundant in Iceland moss.It is found also that there
are many vegetable substances containing small quantities of sugar and
sugar-producing principles which may be used with impunity in at least
the milder forms of diabetes.This being the case, a bill of fare for
diabetics may be constructed quite liberal enough to satisfy the palate
of most reasonable persons by whom it is attainable.FOOD AND DRINK ADMISSIBLE.--Shell-fish.--Oysters and clams, raw and

before the American Medical Association at its meeting in Washington,
May, 1884, and published in the _Journal_ of the association July 12,
1884.I have so far modified the bill of fare as to permit the use of
milk, which Flint excludes.]One of the foods the omission of which is most illy borne by the
diabetic, however great his previous indifference to it, is wheaten
bread, while the substitutes which have been at different times
suggested for it very imperfectly supply its place.Perhaps the best
known of these is the bread made of gluten flour.It was suggested by
Bouchardat in 1841, and is made by washing the ordinary wheat flour to
free it from starch.[50]

[Footnote 50: The Health Food Company, of 74 Fourth Avenue, N.Y.,
prepare a gluten flour by first removing the five bran-coats,
pulverizing the cleaned berry by the cold-blast process, stirring the
powder into iced water, and precipitating the gluten, cellulose, and
mineral matters, siphoning off the water holding in suspension the
starch, and drying out the precipitate.In this manner the salts of the
wheat are retained.A purified gluten made by the Health Food Company
is deprived of the cellulose walls of the cells in which the gluten
granules are held.Directions for making gluten bread and cakes of
various kinds are furnished by the company on application.]Gluten flour, however prepared, contains some starch, as indeed it must
if bread is to be made out of it; and I confess to having been a good
deal disappointed in its use.I have known the sugar absent in a {223}
selected diet to return when gluten bread was permitted, and again
disappear on its withdrawal.Of course gluten flour contains less
starch than the ordinary wheat flour, and there may be cases where the
starch in the former can be assimilated when the quantity in the latter
cannot be.[51]

[Footnote 51: Gluten porridge is made by stirring the gluten into
boiling water until thick enough, and then keeping up the boiling
process for fifteen minutes.A little salt and butter are added at the
close to improve the flavor, and it may be eaten with milk or cream.]A method of getting rid of the starch and sugar in bread, suggested by
Liebig and tried by Vogel, consists in converting the starch into sugar
by the action of diastase and dissolving out the sugar thus produced.This is accomplished by treating thin slices of bread with an infusion
of malt.The bread is then washed, dried, and slightly toasted.Another substitute for wheaten flour is the bran flour whence the
starch is removed by washing.[52] The bran itself, according to
Parkes,[53] sometimes contains as much as 15 per cent.of nitrogenous
matter, 3.5 per cent.of fats, and 5.7 per cent.It is
therefore not wholly innutritious, although the salts are washed out in
removing the starch.It is considered especially useful when there is
constipation, the slightly irritant properties of the bran aiding in
maintaining a proper peristalsis and action of the bowels.These
irritant properties are, however, inversely as the degree of
comminution.The bran flour may be made with milk and eggs into a
variety of cakes, of which the best known are those made according to
Camplin's directions.[54]

[Footnote 52: A very carefully prepared bran flour, as well as a
wheat-gluten flour, is prepared by John W. Sheddon, pharmacist, corner
of Broadway and Thirty-fourth street, New York City.][Footnote 53: _Practical Hygiene_, 5th ed., Philadelphia, 1878, p.[Footnote 54: The following are Camplin's directions for making biscuit
of bran flour: To one quarter of a pound of flour add three or four
fresh eggs, one and a half ounces of butter, and half a pint of milk;
mix the eggs with a little of the milk, and warm the butter with the
other portion; then stir the whole together well; add a little nutmeg
or ginger or other agreeable flavoring, and bake in small forms or
patterns.The cake, when baked, should be about the thickness of an
ordinary captain's biscuit.Bake in
rather a quick oven for half an hour.These cakes or biscuits may be
eaten by the diabetic with meat or cheese for breakfast, dinner, or
supper; at tea they require rather a free allowance of butter, or they
may be eaten with curd or any soft cheese.]Where extreme restriction of diet is not required the ordinary bran
bread of the bakers may be used.The unbolted flour of which this is
made of course contains the starchy principles, but in consequence of
the retention of the bran the proportion of starch is less.The
cold-blast flour of the Health Food Company is said to contain the
nutritious, but not the innutritious, parts of the bran.[55]

[Footnote 55: It is made by pulverizing the carefully cleaned wheat by
a compressed, cold air blast, which strikes the wheat and dashes it to
atoms.]The almond food suggested by Pavy is another substitute for bread.The
almond is composed of 54 per cent.of nitrogenized
matter known as emulsin, 6 per cent.of gum,
but no starch enters into its composition.Theoretically, therefore,
the food should be everything that can be desired if the gum and sugar
can be removed.The latter is done by treating the powdered almonds
with boiling water slightly acidulated with tartaric acid, or soaking
the almonds in a boiling acidulated liquid which may form a part of the
process for blanching.The boiling and acid are necessary to
precipitate {224} the emulsin, which would otherwise emulsify the oil
of the almond.Pavy speaks well of biscuit made of almond flour and
eggs, which he says go very well with a little sherry or other wine,
although he admits they are found too rich by some for ordinary
consumption.One person only under my observation has used the almond
food, and found it unpalatable.Seegen recommends an almond food made as follows: Beat a quarter of a
pound of blanched sweet almonds in a stone mortar for about
three-quarters of an hour, making the flour as fine as possible; put
the flour thus obtained into a linen bag, which is then immersed for an
hour and a quarter in boiling water acidulated with a few drops of
vinegar.The mass is thoroughly mixed with three ounces of butter and
two eggs; the yolks of three eggs and a little salt are added, and the
whole is to be stirred briskly for a long time.A fine froth made by
beating the white of the three eggs is added.The whole paste is now
put into a form smeared with melted butter and baked by a gentle fire.Biscuits made of inulin, the starchy principle largely contained in
Iceland moss, were suggested by Kuelz.Although a starch, it is one of
the assimilable ones alluded to, of which small quantities at least may
be taken as food without appearing in the urine as sugar.The biscuits
are made with the addition of milk, eggs, and salt, and are
inexpensive.To some persons sugar is almost as imperative a necessity as bread,
although to many it is not a very great sacrifice to omit it from
ordinary cooking, if not from tea and coffee.For the latter it is just
as well to dispense with sugar altogether.But where patients feel that
they must have some substitute for sugar, glycerin has been suggested
for this purpose, at least for sweetening tea and coffee.But Pavy has
noted[56] that under the use of glycerin the urine increased from three
and three and three-fourth pints to between five and six pints, and the
sugar from 1100 grains to 3000 grains per diem, in the course of three
days.Its withdrawal was followed by a prompt fall in both the urine
and sugar, a return to it by a second increase, and subsequent
withdrawal by another decline.Along with the increase of urine and
sugar came also more thirst and discomfort.An examination of the
chemical composition of glycerin would seem to confirm these results of
experience.Glycerin is represented by C_{3}H_{8}O_{3}, sugar by
C_{6}H_{12}O_{3}, and glycogen by C_{6}H_{10}O_{5}; whence it is
evident that a conversion of glycerin into sugar may take place in the
liver.These facts seem to show conclusively that glycerin is no
suitable substitute for sugar.[Footnote 56: _On Diabetes_, London, 1869, p.From what has been said it may be inferred that sugar of milk, mannite,
and laevulose, or fruit-sugar, are admissible where sugar is demanded.They may be tried, but the urine should be carefully examined under
their use, and if glycosuria occur or be increased they should be
promptly omitted.Almost every purpose of sugar in the cooking of acid vegetables is
served by bicarbonate of sodium or potassium.As much bicarbonate of
potassium to the pound as will lie upon a quarter of a dollar will
neutralize the acidity of most fruits which require a large amount of
sugar to mask this property.In this manner cranberries, plums,
cherries, gooseberries, red currants, strawberries, apples, peaches,
and indeed {225} all fruits to which sugar is usually added in the
cooking, become available to the diabetic.In the matter of drinks, where the patient is not on a skim-milk diet,
which usually affords as much liquid as is required by the economy,
little restraint need be placed upon the consumption of water, which is
demanded to replace that secreted with the sugar.Instead of water,
Apollinaris water, Vichy, or the ordinary carbonated water may be used
if preferred, and to many they are much more refreshing by reason of
the carbonic acid they hold in suspension.Apollinaris water is
particularly so, and one of my patients, who recovered completely under
a suitable selected diet with which this mineral water was permitted,
insists that it was that which cured her.Where a simple selected diet is adopted, tea and coffee without sugar
are usually permitted.The propriety of the substitutes for sugar
already referred to must be determined by circumstances.Of distilled and fermented liquors, moderate quantities of whiskey and
brandy, dry sherry and madeira, the acid German and French wines--in
fact, any non-saccharine wines--may be permitted.A medical friend who
reports himself about cured of diabetes writes me that he has consumed
eighty gallons of Rhine wine since he began to adhere closely to a
diabetic diet.On the other hand, the free use of the stronger
alcoholic drinks has been charged with causing diabetes, and I have
known such use to produce a recurrence of sugar.No malt liquors,
except those in which the sugar has been completely converted into
carbonic acid and alcohol, should be used.Bass's ale may be allowed
where no especial stringency is required.HYGIENIC TREATMENT.--The patient should be surrounded by the most
favorable hygienic influences.He should sleep in well-ventilated
rooms; pass much time in the open air; bathe regularly, but not in
water that is very cold, and especially the body should not be long
submerged in cold water, as the liver must share the general internal
hyperaemia incident to prolonged cooling of the skin, and increased
glycosuria may result.I have known sugar to reappear after a prolonged
drenching of the skin of patients overtaken by a rainstorm.Perhaps the
most suitable time for the hot or tepid bath is on retiring in winter,
but in summer it may be taken on rising.Thorough friction of the
entire body should be practised after the bath or independently of it.An ounce or two of sodium carbonate may be added to it with advantage,
as it softens the skin and facilitates the removal of the effete
epithelium.The bowels should be kept regularly open, as the effect of
their confinement is to produce torpor and congestion of the liver.Certain natural mineral waters have always enjoyed a reputation for the
cure of diabetes, and notably those of Vichy and Carlsbad.The former
is an alkaline water with a slight laxative tendency, and the latter a
decided aperient alkaline-saline water; and it is not unlikely that
they owe a part of their good effects to an action upon the liver and
upper bowel.This seems the more likely because Carlsbad, which enjoys
the highest reputation, contains a far larger proportion of chlorides
and sulphates, which are purgative.Vichy water contains 35 grains of
carbonates to the pint, and Carlsbad 11, but the latter contains twice
the proportion of chlorides, or 8 grains to the pint, and ten times as
much sodium {226} sulphate, or 19 grains to the pint.They may be used
as adjuvants to the treatment, a pint of Vichy or half as much Carlsbad
in the morning.Being imported waters, they are comparatively
expensive, and I know of no American waters which closely approach them
in composition.Of American waters, the Saratoga Vichy contains twice as much chlorides
as the Carlsbad, 17.7 grains to the pint, but no sulphates.It contains
about the same amount of carbonates as Vichy.It is therefore a
saline-alkaline water, and may be expected to serve the purposes of
Vichy and some of those of Carlsbad, for which it may be substituted.Most of the American mineral waters vaunted as useful in diabetes will
be found, on comparison with these waters, to be chemically
indifferent, and therefore about as useful as so much ordinary
spring-water.Of the Crab Orchard Springs in Kentucky, the Sowder's
spring contains 25 grains of sulphate of sodium and magnesium and 7
grains of sodium chloride to the pint, therefore about the same
proportion of the two substances combined as Carlsbad; yet I am not
aware that these waters have any reputation in diabetes.The waters of
Bedford Springs, Pennsylvania, also approximate them in the proportion
of sulphates of sodium and magnesium.Other Saratoga waters have an undoubted action on the liver through
their chlorides, and may be used in lieu of the European waters above
referred to, and of the Saratoga Vichy, when these cannot be obtained;
such are the Geyser spring, which contains 70 grains of chlorides to
the pint, and the Hathorn, containing 63 grains.MEDICINAL TREATMENT.--While the dietetic treatment, and especially the
skim-milk treatment, of diabetes mellitus is much to be preferred for
its results over an exclusively medicinal treatment, and is of itself
sufficient to control, if not to cure, a large number of cases, yet
instances arise in which it is insufficient to complete the removal of
sugar from the urine, and there are others in which it is impossible
for various causes to carry out such treatment.In my book on _Bright's Disease and Diabetes_, published three years
ago, I gave the preference of drugs to ergot; but since then extended
opportunities have convinced me that codeia is a far more efficient
remedy.Repeated comparative trials of this drug in the wards of the
Philadelphia Hospital and elsewhere have satisfied me of this.The
trials have been made while the patients were upon a mixed diet, which
I hold to be the only fair way of arriving at a knowledge of the true
value of a drug in the disease.Codeia was first suggested by Pavy in
lieu of opium and morphia, which had long been used, his reason being
that it did not produce the same narcotic effect.Favorable reports
upon its use have been made by Foster, Image, Brunton, R. Shingleton
Smith, Cavafy, Austin Flint, Sr., Harvey L. Byrd, and others.It may be
given in pill or solution.One should begin with 1/4 of a grain three
times a day, increasing 1/4 of a grain daily until the sugar disappears
or the remedy ceases to have any effect, or until drowsiness is
produced.Thus gradually increasing, I have reached as high as 47
grains in a day.Cavafy has given 15 grains three times daily.Opium--which is said to have been used by Aetius for this disease--or
morphia might be used if codeia cannot be obtained, but they are less
efficient, more dangerous, and more apt to produce the troublesome
{227} symptom of constipation.MacGregor[57] gave in one case 60 grains
of opium, and in another 90 grains, in the twenty-four hours.[Footnote 57: _London Medical Gazette_, 1837.]While I have seen the most striking results upon the quantity both of
sugar and urine during the administration of codeia, and at the same
time have noted a gain in flesh and strength, I cannot say that I have
ever seen a case totally recover under its use.Such cases are,
however, reported by others.I have always used it in the very worst
cases, where dietetic measures had also failed to remove the sugar.As
to the mode of action of codeine, we can only speculate.It may be said
that it quiets the irritation of the vaso-motor centre, whence result
the glycosuria and other symptoms of diabetes.Next to codeine in efficiency, of drugs, is ergot.The favorable
results of its use are more easily explained by its physiological
action--contraction upon the muscular walls of blood-vessels--than
those of codeine, but it is not so efficient a remedy.It may be used
by beginning with half a drachm, and increasing to a drachm, four times
a day.Larger doses than this, as much as half an ounce four times a
day, have been given, but the stomach rarely permits their continuation
for any length of time.Bromide of potassium, an old remedy for diabetes, has recently been
revived and much lauded by the French physicians, but I have never
found any results from its use.I can understand, however, how in
certain cases of nervous origin it may be useful.Comparatively recently, Clemens of Frankfort-on-the-Main has
recommended the use of what he terms brom-arsen or bromide of arsenic.The dose is one-forty-eighth of a grain three times a day, gradually
increased by this same amount until one-sixth or one-fifth of a grain
is given daily.[58] Clemens, however, unites with its use a dietetic
treatment.I have used it in connection with an unselected diet, and
have not found the results claimed by Clemens.It is, however, both
tonic and sedative, and as such is to be recommended in conjunction
with other measures.R. F. Fairthorne, with Mr.James T. Shinn,
apothecary, cor.Broad and Spruce streets, Philadelphia, prepared for
me a solution of bromide of arsenic in the following manner: 77 grains
of metallic arsenic in powder are added in small portions to 240 grains
of bromine, the latter being placed in a long test-tube immersed in
ice-water to control the otherwise violent reaction.One hundred grains
of the tribromide thus obtained are dissolved in sufficient distilled
water to make ten fluidounces.One minim will then contain
one-forty-eighth of a grain.]Arsenic itself has some reputation in the treatment of diabetes, based
upon the observation of Salkowsky that glycogen diminishes in the
livers of animals poisoned with arsenic.It is at least a good adjuvant
tonic.Leube gave it in diabetes in doses of one-third of a grain three
times a day.Strychnia is also very useful as a tonic, and may be used either alone
or in the shape of the sulphate, or combined with arsenic and iron, or
it may be given, perhaps preferably, in solution in combination with an
acid.Given in combination with phosphoric acid, I believe it the most
valuable tonic available in this disease.To supply the phosphates, in which gluten bread is deficient, as well
as for their tonic effect, the various preparations of phosphates are
useful.{228} The well-known compound syrup of the phosphates, or
Parrish's chemical food, may be considered a type of these
preparations.Every fluidrachm, which is a dose, contains 2-1/2 grains
of calcium phosphate, 1 grain of ferric phosphate, with fractions of a
grain of sodium and potassium phosphate with free phosphoric acid.Similar is the solution of phosphates and phosphoric acid[59] known in
this country as solution of phosphoric acid with iron, or the latter
may be omitted.iij;

results, and may be expected to be useful where syphilitic disease of
the nervous system is suspected.Seegen has seen sugar disappear from the urine under a dosage of 20 to
30 drops of tincture of iodine daily, but the sugar reappeared after
the remedy was discontinued.Lactic acid was recommended by Cantani on theoretical grounds as a
substitute for sugar.He supposes that in health the sugar ingested is
converted by the liver into lactic acid, and he would furnish the
latter already formed, and thus spare the liver this function.Senator
also favors the use of this acid for a similar purpose, but reasons
that in health sugar is converted into lactic acid in the small
intestine, while in diabetes this conversion is interfered with.Hence,
too, it should be given fully formed.Patients under its use are said
to gain in weight and to become stronger, while it is not claimed that
it alone diminishes the glycosuria; this must be brought about by a
selected diet.The lactic acid is simply an important force-producer
not otherwise obtainable, because sugar fails to undergo its usual
conversion.Cantani recommends that from 75 to 150 grains of the acid
should be taken daily in from 8 to 10 fluidounces of water.Diarrhoea
and pains in the joints are said to follow the use of large quantities
of the drug, but these again disappear on its omission.My experience
is limited to a single case, which recovered while taking 30 drops
three times a day in conjunction with Carlsbad water and a pill of
iron, quinia, and arsenic.Senator suggested that the fatty acids--oleic, palmitic, stearic, and
butyric--be used on the same principle that lactic acid is given, that
their force-producing power may be availed of.To this end he
prescribed, with partially satisfactory results, soap in pills
containing 2-1/3 grains each, of which four were taken daily.Cod-liver oil is especially suitable as a food where debility is to be
combated.Even those who claim that fats are convertible into sugar in
the liver admit that it is only in the most advanced stages of diabetes
that such conversion takes place.Cod-liver oil, therefore, in common
with other fats, may form part of a diabetic diet, and is especially
indicated where phthisis is present, as it so often is, in the latter
stages of the disease, or indeed whenever a good tonic is indicated.In 1882, Moleschott[60] suggested the use of iodoform in diabetes.He
reported the effect of its use in five cases, giving.1 to.3 grm.(1.5
to {229} 4.5 grs.)in pill with extract of lactucarium and cumarin, the
purpose of the latter being to disguise the odor.His formula was as
follows: Iodoform, 1 gram (15 grs.sat.,.1 gram (15
grs.); cumarin,.1 gram (1.5 grs.In
one case the sugar disappeared in twelve days; in the second, at the
end of six months; in the third case it had diminished from 14.4 to 1.6
grams in three months; in the fourth, from 28 grams to 1.6 in four
months; and in the fifth case, from 9.2 to 6.1 grams.The use of the remedy in Moleschott's hands produced no unpleasant
results, but Drasch,[61] who used the same treatment after Moleschott's
method in three cases, with the effect of diminishing the thirst, the
quantity of urine, and the proportion of sugar, found excessive itching
of the skin, diminished appetite, and diarrhoea to result in such
degree as to demand its disuse in the majority of cases.Iodoform has
been used by the Italian physicians De Renzi,[62] Bozzolo,[63] and
Silvestrini,[64] and by Sara E. Post[65] of New York, with varying but
generally favorable results, except in Silvestrini's case.These
results included diminution in thirst, quantity of sugar and urea, with
increase in weight.The drug deserves a trial in doses of from 1 to 2
grams (15 to 30 grains) a day, but due regard should be had to possible
toxic effects; and to this end the administration should be interrupted
at the end of one or two weeks, and the interruption continued for a
like period.It may be given in pill or in capsule, and in divided
doses or in a single dose at bedtime.The latter course is recommended
by Post, and is said to avoid eructations and anorexia.Theories of its
action based upon experimental use of poisonous doses ascribe its
effect to a primary stimulating and ultimately fatally degenerative
effect upon the protoplasm of cells, and especially those of the liver
and nervous system.Presse_, 1882, xxiii.[Footnote 62: "Tre Storie di Diabete."med._,

approved of by Ralfe,[67] especially to combat the symptoms of
acetonaemia, which, if due to a toxic agent, as seems most likely,
should be met by altering the percentage composition of the blood with
relation to the toxic agent.[Footnote 66: "Etude sur la Transfusion du Sang dans le diabete sucre,"
_Bulletin et Mem.de Paris_, 1884, 4, S.[Footnote 67: "Discussion before the Path.of London," _Lancet_,
Apr.Diabetic neuralgia yields generally to the treatment of the disease in
general correspondingly to the reduction in the quantity of sugar, and
at times to salicylate of sodium, while it does not respond to morphia
or other remedies for ordinary neuralgia.The alkalies, which attained some reputation after Mialhe claimed for
them the power of destroying sugar in the blood and of neutralizing the
fatty acids which were thought to accumulate there in consequence of
the deficient action of the skin, are not often used at the present
day.Potassium carbonate was the favorite preparation, and in the hands
of Pavy its use seems to have been followed by good results.He gave it
in 10, 15, and 20 grain doses in combination with aromatic spirit of
{230} ammonia.Sodium bicarbonate was less satisfactory, as were also
potassium acetate, potassium citrate, and Rochelle salts.These were
given in doses of from four drachms to an ounce daily.In Germany, too,
the alkaline treatment has been used to some extent.As is the case with so many diseases which are incurable by any special
treatment, a large number of remedies have at different times been
suggested for diabetes, mostly on a foundation which does not admit of
close analysis.One of these was the nitrate of uranium, suggested by
Dale of Lemont, Pennsylvania, who gave it in doses of 1 grain three
times daily, increased to 3 if necessary, in pill, powder, or solution,
by aid of a few drops of nitric acid.He appears, however, to have used
it in connection with a selected diet.I have tried it both with and
without a selected diet; in the latter case there was no effect, and in
the former there was none which the diet alone would not have produced.Sodium phosphate, salicylic acid, salicylate of sodium, have all been
used, it is claimed, with good results, and the late Dr.Dougherty of
Newark, New Jersey, used with apparent advantage a mixture into which
all of these, together with sodium carbonate, entered, made up with
glycerin, tincture of cardamom, and water, the doses being 2-1/2,
2-1/2, 4-1/2, and 8-1/2 grains respectively.Moleschott has also
obtained good results with salicylic acid.{231}

SCROFULA.BY JOHN S. LYNCH, M.D.SYNONYMS.--Scrophula, Scrofulosis, Morbus scrophulosus, Struma, King's
evil, The evil, Quince, Cruels and Crewels (Scotice).DEFINITION.--A morbid condition of the system manifested by a peculiar
liability to certain forms of nutritive disorders of the skin, mucous
membranes, joints, bones, organs of special sense, and especially the
lymphatic glands.There is probably no disease of which it is more difficult to give an
exact and satisfactory definition than scrofula.The general tendency
of medical opinion within the last few decades has been to narrow the
significance of the term, and even to restrict it to those slow and
indolent inflammations and over-growths of lymphatic tissue which end
in caseation and finally imperfect suppuration.Formerly almost every
deviation from healthy functional activity in the young, as well as
every disorder of nutrition which could not be assigned to any definite
cause, was called struma; and thus, as Heule well remarks,[1] "Scrofula
became the receptacle into which one vaguely casts all the ailments
which afflict children under fourteen years, and of which we do not
know the cause."[Footnote 1: _Handbuch der Rationellen Pathologie_.]Before hereditary syphilis was understood all its manifestations were
classed as scrofulous, and at least one eminent authority in the United
States[2] has expressed the opinion that scrofula is only a
manifestation of the syphilitic poison in the second or third
generation.Rickets, chronic hydrocephalus, favus, lice, and worms
(Lugol), diabetes (Carmichael), and even scirrhus and cancer (R.
Hamilton), have all been classed as scrofulous diseases.Then there is
a large class of unhealthy persons whose morbid state can be no more
definitely expressed than by saying that they are "delicate" or of
"feeble health" or of "frail constitution," and by some all these are
included under the term scrofulous.But as knowledge advances, and
pathological knowledge as well as diagnostic acumen becomes larger and
keener, many of these affections and morbid conditions can be
eliminated from scrofula and assigned their true pathological and
nosological position.[Footnote 2: S. D. Gross, _Transactions American Medical Association_,
1878.]To many who have been educated in the more modern schools of medical
thought, therefore, our definition will appear much too broad, while to
others it may appear too narrow.Scrofula is essentially and purely a diathetic, not a cachectic,
disease.{232} It is true that what may be called the manifestations or
lesions of the disease are often excited by some preceding dyscrasia,
and also that the long persistence of these lesions may excite a
cachectic condition which we might call the scrofulous cachexia; still,
as many children suffer from the lesions of scrofula who have never
exhibited any evidence of a precedent dyscrasia, but on the contrary
appear to be in perfect health, and many others, on the other hand,
show unmistakable evidence of ill-health and are decidedly dyscrasic,
yet are never attacked by scrofula, it is believed that every subject
of scrofula becomes so not because of any pre-existing dyscrasia or
cachexia, but because of some peculiar condition of the system--innate
or acquired--which constitutes a diathesis."The hypothesis," says Niemeyer,[3] "that scrofula depends upon a
faulty composition of the blood (dyscrasia), and that the lesions found
in scrofulous persons were due to a deposit in the tissues of a matter
circulated by the blood and called a scrofulous material, is almost
universally abandoned."[Footnote 3: _Textbook of Practical Medicine_, vol.But while insisting upon the peculiar and, so to say, specific origin
of the disease in some special condition of the system, without which
it will never exist, it is admitted that the lesions of scrofula do not
differ essentially from other similar lesions of the same tissues of a
non-scrofulous origin.They are mostly of an inflammatory nature, and
are only to be distinguished by the often trivial character of their
exciting causes--often, indeed, by the total absence of any known
exciting cause--and by their tediousness and intractability.ETIOLOGY.--We believe, as already stated above, that the essential
cause of scrofula is some peculiarity in the constitution of the
tissues of the scrofulous subject; and we think it highly probable that
H. F. Formad of Philadelphia has pointed out what constitutes this
peculiarity.He declares--and the correctness of his observation has
been abundantly verified--that microscopic examination of the tissues
of certain animals characterized by their extreme aptness to be
affected by scrofula and tuberculosis, as well as of children known to
have been scrofulous or tuberculous, discloses the fact that the
lymph-spaces in these subjects are always more numerous, larger, and
more crowded with cells than in non-scrofulous subjects.The tissues of
the scrofulous are therefore coarser, less compact and solid, and there
is a greater tendency to undue cell-growth, than in the non-scrofulous.And these are precisely the characteristics which they present
clinically, and such as we might have, a priori, expected to find.This peculiarity of anatomical structure is in a large number of cases
undoubtedly inherited from the parents, but while heredity plays, as is
well known, an important part in the etiology of struma, it is not the
essential factor.Bad hygienic surroundings, overcrowding, and
consequent want of fresh air, improper food, consisting of a too great
proportion of starch, during the early months or years of life, will
cause the growing tissues to assume the peculiar anatomical arrangement
alluded to above."A coarse diet, containing but little nourishment in
comparison with its bulk, is especially held in evil repute.The
earlier this injudicious feeding of an infant commences, so much the
greater danger that it will become scrofulous; hence the children fed
on pap furnish a very important contingent to the army of scrofulous
persons."[4] The {233} well-known fact that few children at the breast
suffer from scrofulous lesions, but that a large number do so within
the first two or three years after weaning, certainly tells in favor of
the belief that too much starch and an insufficiency of animal food
favor, if they do not actually produce, that faulty nutrition and
construction of tissues which we believe lies at the foundation of the
scrofulous diathesis.Independent, however, of improper food and the
other predisposing causes mentioned, it is quite probable that faulty
nutrition caused by accidental disease of the digestive or assimilative
organs during infancy may create a predisposition.How else can we
account for those not very rare cases in which from parents perfectly
free from any scrofulous taint a large family of children may be
reared, of which only one will suffer from any scrofulous lesions?Two
such instances have been brought to my notice, and as the children in
these cases lived upon a farm on the water-side, and enjoyed an
abundance of pure air and salt-water bathing, and were certainly not
stinted in food of proper quality, it is difficult to account for the
acquired diathesis except upon the hypothesis above.Among the general
predisposing causes of scrofula in addition to the special ones I have
mentioned may be added--

[Footnote 4: Niemeyer, _loc.Locality and Climate.--It has long been believed that scrofula is
more common in the temperate zone than in the extreme north or in the
tropics.While this is probably true, it must be stated that a
sufficient amount of reliable statistics bearing upon this point have
not yet been collected to prove the fact beyond cavil.That we should
find that the disease prevails more extensively in cold and damp
situations than in warmer and drier ones is to be expected, since the
former conditions involve a greater confinement within dwellings, and
consequently a diminished supply of fresh air, which, as we have seen,
constitutes one of the predisposing causes of scrofula.Moreover, it is
in these situations we would encounter a greater number of catarrhs,
which, as we shall see, are known to be among the most active of the
exciting causes of the glandular affections of scrofula.Season.--For the same reason we find that a large number of cases of
scrofula make their appearance in the early spring months, the results
of catarrh contracted during the previous winter or of the sudden
changes of temperature which accompany the transition of winter to
summer.Age.--Scrofula is essentially a disease of early life, but not
exclusively so.As the diathesis can only be acquired directly from the
parent, or fortuitously by malnutrition during the period of active
growth, it follows that it becomes established, if at all, before the
age of twenty years.And as the predisposition seems to be quite strong
in most cases, and as the exciting causes are more apt to be applied
during the earlier years of life, it is not surprising that a very
large majority of the cases occur between the ages of three and fifteen
years.A few, however, escape during childhood, and only suffer from it
between twenty and thirty, while a small number only develop the
disease in old age.Rindfleisch mentions the period between twenty and
thirty as a common one for the development of hereditary scrofula; and
senile scrofula was first pointed out by Sir James Paget.[5] In all
these cases of deferred {234} manifestation of the scrofulous
diathesis--and they are not very numerous--it is to be presumed that
they have escaped the most active of the exciting causes of the
disease.Indeed, it is natural that a person having inherited the
predisposition should be more sedulously guarded--at first by his
parents, and afterward by himself--against the exciting causes of
scrofula during infancy and adolescence.[Footnote 5: _Clinical Lectures and Essays_, London, 1875.]Sex.--There is no reason to believe that sex plays any part in the
predisposition to this disease.Both sexes seem to be affected in about
equal proportions, but from the statistics bearing upon this point it
does seem to have some influence in determining the variety of its
lesions.Thus, females seem to be more frequently affected with
glandular disease, while males suffer from diseases of the joints in
the form of coxalgia, white swelling of the knee, and Pott's disease.Condition in Life: Social Position.--If what we have said about the
predisposing influence of improper or insufficient food, overcrowding,
etc.be true, it will naturally be inferred that a large proportion of
the cases of scrofula will be found in the lower strata of society; and
this is true.Especially in cities, where the disease prevails most
extensively, we always find that the denizens of narrow
