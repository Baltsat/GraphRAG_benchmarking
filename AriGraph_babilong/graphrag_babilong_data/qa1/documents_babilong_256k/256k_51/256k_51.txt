As before mentioned, the Corinthian order was only introduced into
Greece on the decline of art, and never rose during the purely Grecian
age to the dignity of a temple order.It most probably, however, was
used in the more ornate specimens of domestic architecture, and in
smaller works of art, long before any of those examples of it were
executed which we now find in Greece.Order of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.]The most typical specimen we now know is that of the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates (Woodcut No.143), which, notwithstanding all its elegance
of detail and execution, can hardly be pronounced to be perfect, the
Egyptian and Asiatic features being only very indifferently united to
one another.The foliaged part is rich and full, but is not carried up
into the upper or Ionic portion, which is, in comparison, lean and poor;
and though separately the two parts are irreproachable, it was left to
the Romans so to blend the two together as to make a perfectly
satisfactory whole out of them.In this example, as now existing, the junction of the column with the
capital is left a plain sinking, and so it is generally copied in modern
times; but there can be little doubt that this was originally filled by
a bronze wreath, which was probably gilt.Accordingly this is so
represented in the woodcut as being essential to the completion of the
order.The base and shaft have, like the upper part of the capital, more
Ionic feeling in them than the order was afterwards allowed to retain;
and altogether it is, as here practised, far more elegant, though less
complete, than the Roman form which superseded it.Order of the Tower of the Winds, Athens.]The other Athenian example, that of the Tower of the winds (Woodcut No.144), is remarkable as being almost purely Egyptian in its types, with
no Ionic admixture.The columns have no bases, the capitals no volutes,
and the water-leaf clings as closely to the bell as it does in the
Egyptian examples.The result altogether wants richness, and, though
appropriate on so small a scale, would hardly be pleasing on a larger.The great example of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius differs in no
essential part from the Roman order, except that the corners of the
abacus are not cut off; and that, being executed in Athens, there is a
degree of taste and art displayed in its execution which we do not find
in any Roman examples.Strictly speaking, however, it belongs to that
school, and should be enumerated as a Roman, and not as a Grecian,
example.Caryatide Figure in the British Museum.]It has been already explained that the Egyptians never used caryatide
figures, properly so called, to support the entablatures of their
architecture, their figures being always attached to the front of the
columns or piers, which were the real bearing mass.At Persepolis, and
elsewhere in the East, we find figures everywhere employed supporting
the throne or the platform of the palaces of the kings; not, indeed, on
their heads, as the Greeks used them, but rather in their uplifted
hands.The name, however, as well as their being only used in conjunction with
the Ionic order and with Ionic details, all point to an Asiatic origin
for this very questionable form of art.As employed in the little
Portico attached to the Erechtheium, these figures are used with so much
taste, and all the ornaments are so elegant, that it is difficult to
criticise or find fault; but it is nevertheless certain that it was a
mistake which even the art of the Greeks could hardly conceal.To use
human figures to support a cornice is unpardonable, unless it is done as
a mere secondary adjunct to a building.In the Erechtheium it is a
little too prominent for this, though used with as much discretion as
was perhaps possible under the circumstances.Another example of the
sort is shown in Woodcut No.146, which, by employing a taller cap,
avoids some of the objections to the other; but the figure itself, on
the other hand, is less architectural, and so errs on the other side.Caryatide Figure from the Erechtheium.]Another form of this class of support is that of the Giants or
_Telamones_, instances of which are found supporting the roof of the
great Temple at Agrigentum, and in the baths of the semi-Greek city of
Pompeii.As they do not actually bear the entablature, but only seem to
relieve the masonry behind them, their employment is less objectionable
than that of the female figures above described; but even they hardly
fulfil the conditions of true art, and their place might be better
filled by some more strictly architectural feature.The arrangements of Grecian Doric temples show almost less variety than
the forms of the pillars, and no materials exist for tracing their
gradual development in an historical point of view.The temples at
Corinth, and the oldest at Selinus, are both perfect examples of the
hexastyle arrangement to which the Greeks adhered in all ages; and
though there can be little doubt that the peripteral form, as well as
the order itself, was borrowed from Egypt, it still was so much modified
before it appeared in Greece, that it would be interesting, if it could
be done, to trace the several steps by which the change was effected.In an architectural point of view this is by no means difficult.The
simplest Greek temples were mere cells, or small square apartments
suited to contain an image—the front being what is technically called
_distyle in antis_, or with two pillars between _antæ_, or square
pilaster like piers terminating the side walls.Hence the interior
enclosure of Grecian temples is called the cell or cella, however large
and splendid it may be.The next change was to separate the interior into a cell and porch by a
wall with a large doorway in it, as in the small temple at Rhamnus
(Woodcut No.148), where the opening however can scarcely be called a
doorway, as it extends to the roof.A third change was to put a porch of
4 pillars in front of the last arrangement, or, as appears to have been
more usual, to bring forward the screen to the positions of the pillars
as in the last example, and to place the 4 pillars in front of this.None of these plans admitted of a peristyle, or pillars on the flanks.To obtain this it was necessary to increase the number of pillars of the
portico to 6, or, as it is termed, to make it hexastyle, the 2 outer
pillars being the first of a range of 13 or 15 columns, extended along
each side of the temple.The cell in this arrangement was a complete
temple in itself—distyle in antis, most frequently made so at both ends,
and the whole enclosed in its envelope of columns, as in Woodcut No.Sometimes the cell was tetrastyle or with four pillars in front.(From Hittorff,
‘Arch.Antique en Sicile.’) Scale 100 ft.In this form the Greek temple may be said to be complete, very few
exceptions occurring to the rule, though the Parthenon itself is one of
these few.It has an inner hexastyle portico at each end of the cell;
beyond these outwardly are octastyle porticoes, with 17 columns on each
flank.The great Temple at Selinus is also octastyle, but it is neither so
simple nor so beautiful in its arrangement; and, from the decline of
style in the art when it was built, is altogether an inferior example;
still, as one of the largest of Greek Doric temples, its plan is worthy
of being quoted as an illustration of the varying forms of these
temples.Another great exception is the great temple at Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.152 and 154), where the architect attempted an order on so gigantic a
scale that he was unable to construct the pillars with their architraves
standing free.The interstices of the columns are therefore built up
with walls pierced with windows, and altogether the architecture is so
bad, that even its colossal dimensions must have failed to render it at
any time a pleasing or satisfactory work of art.A fourth exception is the double temple at Pæstum, with 9 pillars in
front, a clumsy expedient, but which arose from its having a range of
columns down the centre to support the ridge of the roof by a simpler
mode than the triangular truss usually employed for carrying the roof
between two ranges of column.Plan of Great Temple at Agrigentum.With the exception of the temple at Agrigentum, all these were
peristylar, or had ranges of columns all around them, enclosing the cell
as it were in a case, an arrangement so apparently devoid of purpose,
that it is not at first sight easy to account for its universality.It
will not suffice to say that it was adopted merely because it was
beautiful, for the forms of Egyptian temples, which had no pillars
externally, were as perfect, and in the hands of the Greeks would have
become as beautiful, as the one they adopted.Besides, it is natural to
suppose they would rather have copied the larger than the smaller
temples, if no motive existed for their preference of the latter.The
peristyle, too, was ill suited for an ambulatory, or place for
processions to circulate round the temple; it was too narrow for this,
and too high to protect the procession from the rain.Indeed, I know of
no suggestion except that it may have been adopted to protect the
paintings on the walls of the cells from the inclemency of the weather.It hardly admits of a doubt that the walls were painted, and that
without protection of some sort this would very soon have been
obliterated.It seems also very evident that the peristyle was not only
practically, but artistically, most admirably adapted for this purpose.The paintings of the Greeks were, like those of the Egyptians, composed
of numerous detached groups, connected only by the story, and it almost
required the intervention of pillars, or some means of dividing into
compartments the surface to be so painted, to separate these groups from
one another, and to prevent the whole sequence from being seen at once;
while, on the other hand, nothing can have been more beautiful than the
white marble columns relieved against a richly  plane surface.The one appears so necessary to the other, that it seems hardly to be
doubted that this was the cause, or that the effect must have been most
surpassingly beautiful.MODE OF LIGHTING TEMPLES.The arrangement of the interior of Grecian temples necessarily depended
on the mode in which they were lighted.No one will, I believe, now
contend, as was once done, that it was by lamplight alone that the
beauty of their interiors could be seen; and as light certainly was not
introduced through the side walls, nor could be in sufficient quantities
through the doorways, it is only from the roof that it could be
admitted.At the same time it could not have been by a large horizontal
opening in the roof, as has been supposed, as that would have admitted
the rain and snow as well as the light; and the only alternative seems
to be one I suggested some years ago—of a clerestory,[142] similar
internally to that found in all the great Egyptian temples,[143] but
externally requiring such a change of arrangement as was necessary to
adapt it to a sloping instead of a flat roof.This could have been
effected by countersinking it into the roof, so as to make it in fact 3
ridges in those parts where the light was admitted, though the regular
<DW72> of the roof was retained between these openings, so that neither
the ridge nor the continuity of the lines of the roof was interfered
with.This would effect all that was required, and in the most beautiful
manner; it moreover agrees with all the remains of Greek temples that
now exist, as well as with all the descriptions that have been handed
down to us from antiquity.to 1 in]

[Illustration: 154.Part Section, part Elevation, of Great Temple at
Agrigentum.This arrangement will be understood from the section of the Parthenon
(Woodcut No.153), restored in accordance with the above explanation,
which agrees perfectly with all that remains on the spot, as well as
with all the accounts we have of that celebrated temple.The same system
applies even more easily to the great hexastyle at Pæstum and to the
beautiful little Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, in Phigaleia (Woodcut No.149), and in fact to all regular Greek temples.Indeed, it seems
impossible to account for the peculiarities of that temple except on
some such theory as this.Any one who studies the plan (Woodcut No.149)
will see at once what pains were taken to bring the internal columns
exactly into the spaces between those of the external peristyle.The
effect inside is clumsy, and never would have been attempted were it not
that practically their position was seen from the outside, and this
could hardly have been so on any other hypothesis than that now
proposed.An equally important point in the examination of this theory
is that it applies equally to the exceptional ones.The side aisles, for
instance, of the great temple at Agrigentum were, as before mentioned,
lighted by side windows; the central one could only be lighted from the
roof, and it is easy to see how this could be effected by introducing
openings between the telamones, as shown in Woodcut No.In the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius (Woodcut No.196), as described
by Vitruvius,[144] the nave had two storeys of columns all round, and
the middle was open to the sky.Dorpfield that the temple in Vitruvius’s time was incomplete, and that
subsequently when Hadrian erected the great chryselephantine statue in
it the nave may have lost its hypæthral source of light.(In that case
its light may have been introduced through the court or hypæthron in
front of the cell, such as is shown on the plan in Woodcut No.The Ionic temples of Asia are all too much ruined to enable us to say
exactly in what manner, and to what extent, this mode of lighting was
applied to them, though there seems no doubt that the method there
adopted was very similar in all its main features.Elevation of West End of Erechtheium.The little Temple of Nikè Apteros and the temple on the Ilissus, were
both too small to require any complicated arrangement of the sort, but
the Ionic temple of Pandrosus was lighted by windows which still remain
at the west end, so that it is possible the same expedient may have been
adopted to at least some extent in the Asiatic examples.The latter,
however, is, with one exception, the sole instance of windows in any
European-Greek temple, the only other example being in the very
exceptional temple at Agrigentum.It is valuable, besides, as showing
how little the Greeks were bound by rules or by any fancied laws of
symmetry.As is shown in the plan, elevation, and view (Woodcuts Nos.155, 156,
157), the Erechtheium consisted, properly speaking, of 3 temples grouped
together; and it is astonishing what pains the architect took to prevent
their being mistaken for one.The porticoes of two of them are on
different levels, and the third or caryatide porch is of a different
height and different style.Every one of these features is perfectly
symmetrical in itself, and the group is beautifully balanced and
arranged; and yet no Gothic architect in his wildest moments could have
conceived anything more picturesquely irregular than the whole becomes.Indeed, there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that Greek
architecture was fettered by any fixed laws of formal symmetry: each
detail, every feature, every object, such as a hall or temple, which
could be considered as one complete and separate whole, was perfectly
symmetrical and regular; but no two buildings—no two apartments—if for
different purposes, were made to look like one.On the contrary, it is
quite curious to observe what pains they took to arrange their buildings
so as to produce variety and contrast, instead of formality or
singleness of effect.Temples, when near one another, were never placed
parallel, nor were even their propylæa and adjuncts ever so arranged as
to be seen together or in one line.The Egyptians, as before remarked,
had the same feeling, but carried it into even the details of the same
building, which the Greeks did not.In this, indeed, as in almost every
other artistic mode of expression, they seem to have hit exactly the
happy medium, so as to produce the greatest harmony with the greatest
variety, and to satisfy the minutest scrutiny and the most refined
taste, while their buildings produced an immediate and striking effect
on even the most careless and casual beholders.Owing to the Erechtheium having been converted into a Byzantine church
during the Middle Ages, almost all traces of its original internal
arrangements have been obliterated, and this, with the peculiar
combination of three temples in one, makes it more than usually
difficult to restore.The annexed plan, however, meets all the
requirements of the case in so far as they are known.To the east was a
portico of 6 columns, between two of which stood an altar to Dione,
mentioned in the inscription enumerating the repairs in 409 B.C.;[145]
inside, according to Pausanias,[146] were three altars, the principal
dedicated to Poseidon, the others to Butes and Hephaistos.From its
form, it is evident the roof must have been supported by pillars, and
they probably also bore a clerestory, by which, I believe, with rare
exceptions, all Greek temples were lighted.Restored Plan of Erechtheium.The dark parts remain; the shaded are restorations.
]The Temple of Pandrosus was on a lower level, and was approached by a
flight of steps, corresponding with which was a chamber, containing the
well of salt water, and which apparently was the abode of the
serpent-god Erechthonios, mentioned by Herodotus.[147] The central cell
was lighted by the very exceptional expedient of 3 windows in the
western wall, which looked directly into it.Beyond this, on the south,
was the beautiful caryatide porch, where, if anywhere within the temple,
grew the olive sacred to Minerva.Unfortunately, our principal guide,
Pausanias, does not give us a hint where the olive-tree grew, and on the
whole I am inclined to believe it was in the enclosure outside the
western wall of the temple,[148] and to which a doorway leads directly
from the Temple of Pandrosus, as well as one under the north portico,
the use of which it is impossible to explain unless we assume that this
enclosure was really of exceptional importance.TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.A history of Grecian architecture can hardly be considered as complete
without some mention of the great Ephesian temple, which was one of the
largest and most gorgeous of all those erected by the Greeks, and
considered by them as one of the seven wonders of the world.Strange to
say, till very recently even its situation was utterly unknown; and even
now that it has been revealed to us by the energy and intelligence of
Mr.Wood, scarcely enough remains to enable him to restore the plan with
anything like certainty.This is the more remarkable, as it was found
buried under 17 to 20 feet of mud, which must have been the accumulation
of centuries, and might, one would have thought, have preserved
considerable portions of it from the hand of the spoiler.Plan of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, embodying
Mr.Wood’s researches embodies all the
information he has been able to obtain.The dimensions of the double
peristyle, and the number and position of its 96 columns, are quite
certain.So are the positions of the north, south, and west walls of the
cella; so that the only points of uncertainty are the positions of the
four columns necessary to make up the 100 mentioned by Pliny,[149] and
the internal arrangement of the cella itself and of the opisthodomus.With regard to the first there seems very little latitude for choice.The position of the other two must
be determined either by bringing forward the wall enclosing the stairs,
so as to admit of the intercolumniation east and west being the same as
that of the other columns, or of spacing them so as to divide the inner
roof of the pronaos into equal squares.I have preferred the latter as
that which appears to me the most probable.[150]

The west wall of the cella and the position of the statue having been
found, the arrangement of the pillars surrounding this apartment does
not admit of much latitude.Fragments of these pillars were found, but
not _in situ_, showing that they were in two heights and supported a
gallery.I have spaced them intermediately between the external pillars,
as in the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ (Woodcut No.149), because I do not
know of any other mode by which this temple could be lighted, except by
an opaion, as suggested for that temple; and if this is so they must
have been so spaced.Carrying out this system it leaves an opisthodomus
which is an exact square, which is so likely a form for that apartment
that it affords considerable confirmation to the correctness of this
restoration that it should be so.The four pillars it probably contained
are so spaced as to divide it into nine equal squares.Restored in this manner the temple appears considerably less in
dimensions than might have been supposed from Pliny’s text.His
measurements apply only to the lower step of the platform, which is
found to be 421 ft.But the temple itself, from angle to angle
of the peristyles, is only 342 ft.Assuming this restoration to be correct there can be very little doubt
as to the position of the thirty-six columnæ cælatæ, of which several
specimens have been recovered by Mr.Wood, and are now in the British
Museum.They must have been the sixteen at either end and the four in
the pronaos, shown darker in the woodcut.From the temple standing on a platform so much larger than appears
necessary, it is probable that pedestals with statues stood in front of
each column, and if this were so, the sculptures, with the columnæ
cælatæ and the noble architecture of the temple itself, must have made
up a combination of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic art such as hardly
existed anywhere else, and which consequently the ancients were quite
justified in considering as one of the wonders of the world.MUNICIPAL ARCHITECTURE.Very little now remains of all the various classes of municipal and
domestic buildings which must once have covered the land of Greece, and
from what we know of the exquisite feelings for art that pervaded that
people, they were certainly not less beautiful, though more ephemeral,
than the sacred buildings whose ruins still remain to us.There are, however, two buildings in Athens which, though small, give us
most exalted ideas of their taste in such matters.The first, already
alluded to, usually known as the Tower of the Winds, is a plain
octagonal building about 45 ft.in height by 24 in width, ornamented by
2 small porches of 2 pillars each, of the Corinthian order, the capitals
of which are represented in Woodcut No.Its roof, like the rest of
the building, is of white marble, and of simple but very elegant design,
and below this is a frieze of 8 large figures, symbolical of the 8
winds, from which the tower takes its name, they in fact being the
principal objects and ornaments of the building, the most important use
of which appears to have been to contain a clepsydra or water-clock.The other building, though smaller, is still more beautiful.It is known
as the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, and consists of a square base 12
ft.wide, on which stands a circular temple adorned by 6
Corinthian columns, which, with their entablature and the roof and
pedestal they support, make up 22 ft.more, so that the whole height of
the monument is only 34 ft.Notwithstanding these insignificant
dimensions, the beauty of its columns (Woodcut No.143) and of their
entablature—above all, the beauty of the roof and of the finial
ornament, which crowns the whole and is unrivalled for elegance even in
Greek art—make up a composition so perfect that nothing in any other
style or age can be said to surpass it.[151] If this is a fair index of
the art that was lavished on the smaller objects, the temples hardly
give a just idea of all that have perished.In extreme contrast with the buildings last described, which were among
the smallest, came the theatres, which were the largest, of the
monuments the Greeks seem ever to have attempted.The annexed plan of one at Dramyssus, the ancient Dodona, will give an
idea of their forms and arrangements.Its dimensions may be said to be
gigantic, being 443 ft.across; but even this, though perhaps the
largest in Greece, is far surpassed by many in Asia Minor.What remains
of it, however, is merely the auditorium, and consists only of ranges of
seats arranged in a semicircle, but without architectural ornament.In
all the examples in Europe, the proscenium,[152] which was the only part
architecturally ornamented, has perished, so that, till we can restore
this with something like certainty, the theatres hardly come within the
class of Architecture as a fine art.The theatre of Dionysus at Athens, which was excavated and laid bare in
1862-63, measures only 165 ft.Built on the south
side of the Acropolis, the natural <DW72> forming the rising ground was
utilised for the foundations of the tiers of seats which, in some cases,
and particularly at the back, were hewn in the rock; so that they were
carried back 294 ft.In the theatre of
Epidaurus, which, according to Pausanias, was the most beautiful theatre
in the world, the lines of the seats are continued on each side of the
orchestra so as to form a horse-shoe on plan; the foundations of the
stage, the projecting side wings with staircases on each side, and other
buildings belonging to the stage are still preserved.In Asia Minor some of the theatres have their proscenia adorned with
niches and columns, and friezes of great richness; but all these belong
to the Roman period, and, though probably copies of the mode in which
the Greeks ornamented theirs, are so corrupt in style as to prevent
their being used with safety in attempting to restore the earlier
examples.Many circumstances would indeed induce us to believe that the proscenia
of the earlier theatres may have been of wood or bronze, or both
combined, and heightened by painting and carving to a great degree of
richness.This, though appropriate and consonant with the origin and
history of the drama, would be fatal to the expectation of anything
being found to illustrate its earliest forms.Like the other Aryan races, the Greeks never were tomb-builders, and
nothing of any importance of this class is found in Greece, except the
tombs of the early Pelasgic races, which were either tumuli, or
treasuries, as they are popularly called.There are, it is true, some
headstones and small pillars of great beauty, but they are monolithic,
and belong rather to the department of Sculpture than of Architecture.In Asia Minor there are some important tombs, some built and others cut
in the rock.Some of the latter have been described before in speaking
of the tombs of the Lycians.The built examples which remain almost all
belong to the Roman period, though the typical and by far the most
splendid example of Greek tombs was that erected by Artemisia to the
memory of her husband Mausolus at Halicarnassus.We scarcely know enough
of the ethnic relations of the Carians to be able to understand what
induced them to adopt so exceptional a mode of doing honour to their
dead.With pure Greeks it must have been impossible, but the inhabitants
of these coasts were of a different race, and had a different mode of
expressing their feelings.View of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, as restored
by the Author.]Till Sir Charles Newton’s visit to Halicarnassus in 1856 the very site
of this seventh wonder of the world was a matter of dispute.We now know
enough to be able to restore the principal parts with absolute
certainty, and to ascertain its dimensions and general appearance within
very insignificant limits of error.[153]

The dimensions quoted by Pliny[154] are evidently extracted from a
larger work, said to have been written by the architect who erected it,
and which existed at his time.Every one of them has been confirmed in
the most satisfactory manner by recent discoveries, and enable us to put
the whole together without much hesitation.Plan of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, from a
Drawing by the Author.Sufficient remains of the quadriga, which crowned the monument, have
been brought home to give its dimensions absolutely.All the parts of
the Ionic order are complete.The steps of the pyramid have been found
and portions of the three friezes, and these, with Pliny’s dimensions
and description, are all that are required to assure us that its aspect
must have been very similar to the form represented in Woodcut No.There can be little doubt with regard to the upper storey, but in order
to work out to the dimensions given by Pliny (411 ft.in circumference)
and those found cut out in the rock (462 ft.), the lower storey must be
spread out beyond the upper to that extent, and most probably something
after the manner shown in the woodcut.The building consisted internally of two chambers superimposed the one
on the other, each 52 ft.by 42 ft.—the lower one being the
vestibule to the tomb beyond—the upper was surrounded by a peristyle of
36 columns.Externally the height was divided into three equal portions
of 37 ft.each (25 cubits), one of which was allotted to the
base—one to the pyramid with its meta—and one to the order between them.These with 14 ft., the height of the quadriga, and the same dimension
belonging to the lower entablature, made up the height of 140 Greek
feet[155] given it by Pliny.Though its height was unusually great for a Greek building, its other
dimensions were small.The admiration
therefore which the Greeks expressed regarding it must have arisen,
first, from the unusual nature of its design and of the purpose to which
it was applied, or perhaps more still from the extent and richness of
its sculptured decorations, of the beauty of which we are now enabled to
judge, and can fully share with them in admiring.Another, but very much smaller, tomb of about the same age was found by
Mr.Newton at Cnidus, and known as the Lion Tomb, from the figure of
that animal, now in the British Museum, which crowned its summit.Like
many other tombs found in Asia and in Africa, it follows the type of the
Mausoleum in its more important features.It possesses a base—a
peristyle—a pyramid of steps—and, lastly, an acroterion or pedestal
meant to support a quadriga or statue, or some other crowning object,
which appropriately terminated the design upwards.Several examples erected during the Roman period will be illustrated
when speaking of the architecture of that people, all bearing the
impress of the influence the Mausoleum had on the tomb architecture of
that age; but unfortunately we cannot yet go backwards and point out the
type from which the design of the Mausoleum itself was elaborated.The
tombs of Babylon and Passargadæ are remote both geographically and
artistically, though not without certain essential resemblances.Perhaps
the missing links may some day reward the industry of some scientific
explorer.At Cyrene there is a large group of tombs of Grecian date and with
Grecian details, but all cut in the rock, and consequently differing
widely in their form from those just described.It is not clear whether
the circumstance of this city possessing such a necropolis arose from
its proximity to Egypt, and consequently from a mere desire to imitate
that people, or from some ethnic peculiarity.Most probably the latter,
though we know so little about them that it is difficult to speak with
precision on such a subject.[156]

These tombs are chiefly interesting from many of the details of the
architecture still retaining the colour with which they were originally
adorned.The triglyphs of the Doric order are still painted blue,[157]
as appears to have been the universal practice, and the pillars are
outlined by red lines.The metopes are darker, and are adorned with
painted groups of figures, the whole making up one of the most perfect
examples of Grecian  decoration which still remain.Rock-cut and structural Tombs at Cyrene.(From
Hamilton’s ‘Wanderings in North Africa.’)]

There is another tomb at the same place—this time structural—which is
interesting not so much for any architectural beauty it possesses as
from its belonging to an exceptional type.It consists now only of a
circular basement—the upper part is gone—and is erected over an
excavated rock-cut tomb.There seem to be several others of the same
class in the necropolis, and they are the only examples known except
those at Marathos, one of which is illustrated above (Woodcut No.As before hinted, the Syrian example does not appear to be very ancient,
but we want further information before speaking positively on this
subject.No one on the spot has attempted to fix with precision the age
of the Cyrenean examples; nor have they been drawn in such detail as is
requisite for others to ascertain the fact.They may be as late as the
time of the Romans, but can hardly be dated as prior to the age of
Alexander the Great.(From Hamilton’s ‘North Africa.’)]


                         DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.We have nothing left but imperfect verbal descriptions of the domestic,
and even of the palatial architecture of Greece, and, consequently, can
only judge imperfectly of its forms.Unfortunately, too, Pompeii, though
but half a Greek city, belongs to too late and too corrupt an age to
enable us to use it even as an illustration; but we may rest assured
that in this, as in everything else, the Greeks displayed the same
exquisite taste which pervades not only their monumental architecture,
but all their works in metal or clay, down to the meanest object, which
have been preserved to our times.It is probable that the forms of their houses were much more irregular
and picturesque than we are in the habit of supposing them to have been.They seem to have taken such pains in their temples—in the Erechtheium,
for instance, and at Eleusis—to make every part tell its own tale, that
anything like forced regularity must have been offensive to them, and
they would probably make every apartment exactly of the dimensions
required, and group them so that no one should under any circumstances
be confounded with another.This, however, with all the details of their domestic arts, must now
remain to us as mere speculation, and the architectural history of
Greece must be confined to her temples and monumental erections.These
suffice to explain the nature and forms of the art, and to assign to it
the rank of the purest and most intellectual of all the styles which
have yet been invented or practised in any part of the world.ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

The ethnographical history of art in Italy is in all its essential
features similar to that of Greece, though arriving at widely different
results from causes the influence of which it is easy to trace.Both are
examples of an Aryan development based on a Turanian civilisation which
it has superseded.In Greece—as already remarked—the traces of the
earlier people are indistinct and difficult to seize.In Italy their
features are drawn with a coarser hand, and extend down into a more
essentially historic age.It thus happens that we have no doubt as to
the existence of the Etruscan people—we know very nearly who they were,
and cannot be mistaken as to the amount and kind of influence they
exercised on the institutions and arts of the Romans.The more striking differences appear to have arisen from the fact, that
Greece had some four or five centuries of comparative repose during
which to form herself and her institutions after the Pelasgic
civilisation was struck down at the time of the Dorian occupation of the
Peloponnesus.During that period she was undisturbed by foreign
invasion, and was not tempted by successful conquests to forsake the
gentler social arts for the more vulgar objects of national ambition.Rome’s history, on the other hand, from the earliest aggregation of a
robber horde on the banks of the Tiber till she became the arbiter of
the destinies of the ancient world, is little beyond the record of
continuous wars.From the possession of the seven hills, Rome gradually
carried her sway at the edge of the sword to the dominion of the whole
of Italy and of all the then known world, destroying everything that
stood in the way of her ambition, and seeking only the acquisition of
wealth and power.Greece, in the midst of her successful cultivation of the arts of
commerce and of peace, stimulated by the wholesome rivalry of the
different States of which she was composed, was awakened by the Persian
invasion to a struggle for existence.The result was one of the most
brilliant passages in the world’s history, and no nation was ever more
justified in the jubilant outburst of enthusiastic patriotism that
followed the repulse of the invader, than was Greece in that with which
she commenced her short but brilliant career.A triumph so gained by a
people so constituted led to results at which we still wonder, though
they cause us no surprise.If Greece attained her manhood on the
battle-fields of Marathon and Salamis, Rome equally reached the maturity
of her career when she cruelly and criminally destroyed Corinth and
Carthage, and the sequel was such as might be expected from such a
difference of education.Rome had no time for the cultivation of the
arts of peace, and as little sympathy for their gentler influences.Conquest, wealth, and consequent power, were the objects of her
ambition—for these she sacrificed everything, and by their means she
attained a pinnacle of greatness that no nation had reached before or
has since.Her arts have all the impress of this greatness, and are
characterised by the same vulgar grandeur which marks everything she
did.Very different they are from the intellectual beauty found in the
works of the Greeks, but in some respects they are as interesting to
those who can read the character of nations in their artistic
productions.In the earlier part of her career Rome was an Etruscan city under
Etruscan kings and institutions.After she had emancipated herself from
their yoke, Etruria long remained her equal and her rival in political
power, and her instructress in religion and the arts of peace.This
continued so long, and the architectural remains of that people are so
numerous, and have been so thoroughly investigated, that we have no
difficulty in ascertaining the extent of influence the older nation had
on the nascent empire.It is more difficult to ascertain exactly who the
Etruscans themselves were, or whence they came.But on the whole there
seems every reason to believe they migrated from Asia Minor some twelve
or thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and fixed themselves in
Italy, most probably among the Umbrians, or some people of cognate race,
who had settled there before—so long before, perhaps, as to entitle them
to be considered among the aboriginal inhabitants.It would have been only natural that the expatriated Trojans should have
sought refuge among such a kindred people, though we have nothing but
the vaguest tradition to warrant a belief that this was the case.They
may too from time to time have received other accessions to their
strength; but they were a foreign people in a strange land, and scarcely
seem ever to have become naturalised in the country of their adoption.But what stood still more in their way was the fact that they were an
old Turanian people in presence of a young and ambitious community of
Aryan origin, and, as has always been the case when this has happened,
they were destined to disappear.Before doing so, however, they left
their impress on the institutions and the arts of their conquerors to
such an extent as to be still traceable in every form.It may have been
that there was as much Pelasgic blood in the veins of the Greeks as
there was Etruscan in those of the Romans; but the civilisation of the
former had passed away before Greece had developed herself.Etruria, on
the other hand, was long contemporary with Rome: in early times her
equal, and sometimes her mistress, and consequently in a position to
force her arts upon her to an extent that was never effected on the
opposite shore of the Adriatic.Nothing can prove more clearly the Turanian origin of the Etruscans than
the fact that all we know of them is derived from their tombs.These
exist in hundreds—it may almost be said in thousands—at the gates of
every city; but no vestige of a temple has come down to our days.Had
any Semitic blood flowed in their veins, as has been sometimes
suspected, they could not have been so essentially sepulchral as they
were, or so fond of contemplating death, as is proved by the fact that a
purely Semitic tomb is still a desideratum among antiquaries, not one
having as yet been discovered.What we should like to find in Etruria
would be a square pyramidal mound with external steps leading to a cella
on its summit; but no trace of any such has yet been detected.Their
other temples—using the word in the sense in which we usually understand
it—were, as might be expected, insignificant and ephemeral.So much so,
indeed, that except from one passage in Vitruvius,[158] and our being
able to detect the influence of the Etruscan style in the buildings of
Imperial Rome, we should hardly be aware of their existence.The truth
seems to be that the religion of the Etruscans, like that of most of
their congeners, was essentially ancestral, and their worship took the
form of respect for the remains of the dead and reverence for their
memory.Tombs consequently, and not temples, were the objects on which
they lavished their architectural resources.They certainly were not
idolaters, in the sense in which we usually understand the term.They
had no distinct or privileged priesthood, and consequently had no motive
for erecting temples which by their magnificence should be pleasing to
their gods or tend to the glorification of their kings or priests.Still
less were they required for congregational purposes by the people at
large.The only individual temple of Etruscan origin of which we have any
knowledge, is that of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome.[159] Originally small,
it was repaired and rebuilt till it became under the Empire a splendid
fane.But not one vestige of it now remains, nor any description from
which we could restore its appearance with anything like certainty.From the chapter of the work of Vitruvius just alluded to, we learn that
the Etruscans had two classes of temples: one circular, like their
structural tombs, and dedicated to one deity; the other class
rectangular, but these, always possessing three cells, were devoted to
the worship of three gods.Plan and Elevation of an Etruscan Temple.]The general arrangement of the plan, as described by Vitruvius, was that
shown on the plan above (Fig.1), and is generally assented to by all
those who have attempted the restoration.In larger temples in Roman
times the number of pillars in front may have been doubled, and they
would thus be arranged like those of the portico of the Pantheon, which
is essentially an Etruscan arrangement.The restoration of the elevation
is more difficult, and the argument too long to be entered upon
here;[160] but its construction and proportions seem to have been very
much like those drawn in the above diagram (Fig.Of course, as
wooden structures, they were richly and elaborately carved, and the
effect heightened by colours, but it is in vain to attempt to restore
them.Without a single example to guide us, and with very little
collateral evidence which can at all be depended upon, it is hardly
possible that any satisfactory restoration could now be made.Moreover,
their importance in the history of art is so insignificant, that the
labour such an attempt must involve would hardly be repaid by the
result.The original Etruscan circular temple seems to have been a mere circular
cell with a porch.The Romans surrounded it with a peristyle, which
probably did not exist in the original style.They magnified it
afterwards into the most characteristic and splendid of all their
temples, the Pantheon, whose portico is Etruscan in arrangement and
design, and whose cell still more distinctly belongs to that order; nor
can there be any doubt that the simpler Roman temples of circular form
are derived from Etruscan originals.[161] It would therefore be of great
importance if we could illustrate the later buildings from existing
remains of the older: but the fact is that such deductions as we may
draw from the copies are our only source of information respecting the
originals.We know little of any of the civil buildings with which the cities of
Etruria were adorned, beyond the knowledge obtained from the remains of
their theatres and amphitheatres.The form of the latter was essentially
Etruscan, and was adopted by the Romans, with whom it became their most
characteristic and grandest architectural object.Of the amphitheatres
of ancient Etruria only one now remains in so perfect a state as to
enable us to judge of their forms.It is that at Sutrium, which,
however, being entirely cut in the rock, neither affords information as
to the mode of construction nor enables us to determine its age.in its greatest length by 265 in breadth,
and it is consequently much nearer a circular form than the Romans
generally adopted: but in other respects the arrangements are such as
appear to have usually prevailed in after times.Besides these, we have numerous works of utility, but these belong more
strictly to engineering than to architectural science.The city walls of
the Etruscans surpass those of any other ancient nation in extent and
beauty of workmanship.Their drainage works and their bridges, as well
as those of the kindred Pelasgians in Greece, still remain monuments of
their industrial science and skill, which their successors never
surpassed.On the whole, perhaps we are justified in asserting that the Etruscans
were not an architectural people, and had no temples or palaces worthy
of attention.It at least seems certain that nothing of the sort is now
to be found, even in ruins, and were it not that the study of Etruscan
art is a necessary introduction to that of Roman, it would hardly be
worth while trying to gather together and illustrate the few fragments
and notices of it that remain.The tombs of the Etruscans now found may be divided into two
classes—first, those cut in the rock, and resembling dwelling-houses;
secondly, the circular tumuli, which latter are by far the most numerous
and important class.Each of these may be again subdivided into two kinds.The rock-cut tombs
include, firstly, those with only a façade on the face of the rock and a
sepulchral chamber within; secondly, those cut quite out of the rock and
standing free all round.To this class probably once belonged an immense
number of tombs built in the ordinary way; but all these have totally
disappeared, and consequently the class, as now under consideration,
consists entirely of excavated examples.The second class may be divided into those tumuli erected over chambers
cut in the tufaceous rock which is found all over Etruria, and those
which have chambers built above-ground.In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say which of
these classes is the older.We know that the Egyptians buried in caves
long before the Etruscans landed in Italy, and at the same time raised
pyramids over rock-cut and built chambers.We know too that Abraham was
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Syria.On the other hand, the tombs
at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113), the treasuries of Mycenæ (Woodcut No.124),
the sepulchre of Alyattes (Woodcut No.115), and many others, are proofs
of the antiquity of the tumuli, which are found all over Europe and
Asia, and appear to have existed from the earliest ages.The comparative antiquity of the different kinds of tombs being thus
doubtful, it will be sufficient for the purposes of the present work to
classify them architecturally.It may probably be assumed, with safety,
that all the modes which have been enumerated were practised by the
Etruscans at a period very slightly subsequent to their migration into
Italy.Of the first class of the rock-cut tombs—those with merely a façade
externally—the most remarkable group is that at Castel d’Asso.At this
place there is a perpendicular cliff with hundreds of these tombs ranged
along its face, like houses in a street.A similar arrangement is found
in Egypt at Benihasan, at Petra, and Cyrene, and around all the more
ancient cities of Asia Minor.In Etruria they generally consist of one chamber lighted by the doorway
only.Their internal arrangement appears to be an imitation of a
dwelling chamber, with furniture, like the apartment itself, cut out of
the rock.Externally they have little or no pretension to architectural
decoration.It is true that some tombs are found adorned with
frontispieces of a debased Doric or Ionic order; but these were executed
at a much later period and under Roman domination, and cannot therefore
be taken as specimens of Etruscan art, but rather of that corruption of
style sure to arise from a conquered people trying to imitate the arts
of their rulers.Tombs at Castel d’Asso.(From the ‘Annale del
Instituto.’)]

The general appearance of the second class of rock-cut tombs will be
understood from the woodcut (No.168), representing two monuments at
Castel d’Asso.Unfortunately neither is complete, nor is there any
complete example known to exist of this class.Perhaps the apex was
added structurally and that these, like all such things in Etruria, have
perished.Possibly, if cut in the rock, the terminals were slender
carved ornaments, and therefore liable to injury.They are usually
restored by antiquaries in the shape of rectilinear pyramids, but so far
as I know, there is no authority for this.On the contrary, it is more
in accordance with what we know of the style and its affinities to
suppose that the termination of these monuments, even if added in
masonry, was curvilinear.Mouldings from Tombs at Castel d’Asso.]One remarkable thing about the rock-cut tombs is the form of their
mouldings, which differ from any found elsewhere in Europe.Two of these
are shown in the annexed woodcut (No.They are very numerous and
in great variety, but do not in any instance show the slightest trace of
a cornice, nor of any tendency towards one.On the contrary, in place of
this, we find nothing but a reverse moulding.It is probable that
similar forms may be found in Asia Minor, while something resembling
them actually occurs at Persepolis and elsewhere.It is remarkable that
this feature did not penetrate to Rome, and that no trace of its
influence is found there, as might have been expected.[162]


                                TUMULI.The simplest, and therefore perhaps the earliest, monument which can be
erected over the graves of the dead, by a people who reverence their
departed relatives, is a mound of earth or a cairn of stones, and such
seems to have been the form adopted by the Turanian or Tartar races of
mankind from the earliest days to the present hour.It is scarcely
necessary to remark how universal such monuments were among the ruder
tribes of Northern Europe.The Etruscans improved upon this by
surrounding the base with a _podium_, or supporting wall of masonry.This not only defined its limits and gave it dignity, but enabled
entrances to be made in it, and otherwise converted it from a mere
hillock into a monumental structure.It is usually supposed that this
basement was an invariable part of all Etruscan tumuli, and when it is
not found, it is assumed that it has been removed, or that it is buried
in the rubbish of the mound.No doubt such a stone basement may easily
have been removed by the peasantry, or buried, but it is by no means
clear that this was invariably the case.It seems that the enclosure was
frequently a circle of stones or monumental steles, in the centre of
which the tumulus stood.The monuments have hitherto been so carelessly
examined and restored, that it is difficult to arrive at anything like
certainty with regard to the details of their structure.Nor can we draw
any certain conclusion from a comparison with other tumuli of cognate
races.The description by Herodotus of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis
(Woodcut No.115), those described by Pausanias as existing in the
Peloponnesus, and the appearances of those at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
might be interpreted either way; but those at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113),
and a great number at least of those in Etruria, have a structural
circle of stone as a supporting base to the mound.Plan of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.These tumuli are found existing in immense numbers in every necropolis
of the Etruscans.A large space was generally set apart for the purpose
outside the walls of all their great cities.In these cemeteries the
tumuli are arranged in rows, like houses in streets.Even now we can
count them by hundreds, and in the neighbourhood of the largest
cities—at Vulci, for instance—almost by thousands.Most of them are now worn down by the effect of time to nearly the level
of the ground, though some of the larger ones still retain an imposing
appearance.Nearly all have been rifled at some early period, though the
treasures still discovered almost daily in some places show how vast
their extent was, and how much even now remains to be done before this
vast mine of antiquity can be said to be exhausted.One of the most remarkable among those that have been opened in modern
times is at Cervetri, the ancient Cære, known as the Regulini Galeassi
tomb, from the names of its discoverers.Sections of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.(From
Canina’s ‘Etruria Antica.’) Scale for large section, 50 ft.Like a Nubian pyramid or Buddhist tope, it consists of an inner and
older tumulus, around and over which another has been added.In the
outer mound are five tombs either of dependent or inferior personages.These were rifled long ago; but the outer pyramid having effectually
concealed the entrance to the principal tomb, it remained untouched till
very lately, when it yielded to its discoverers a richer collection of
ornaments and utensils in gold and bronze than has ever been found in
one place before.The dimensions and arrangements of this tumulus will be understood from
Woodcuts Nos.170, 171, and from the two sections of the principal tomb
which are annexed to them.These last display an irregularity of
construction very unusual in such cases, for which no cause can be
assigned.The usual section is perfectly regular, as in the annexed
woodcut (No.172), taken from another tomb at the same place.These chambers, like all those of the early Etruscans, are vaulted on
the horizontal principle, like the tombs at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
though none are found in Italy at all equal to those of Greece in
dimensions or beauty of construction.173 is a perspective view of the principal chamber in the
Regulini Galeassi tomb, showing the position of the furniture found in
it when first opened, consisting of biers or bedsteads, shields, arrows,
and vessels of various sorts.A number of vases are hung in a curious
recess in the roof, the form of which would be inexplicable but for the
utensils found in it.With this clue to its meaning we can scarcely
doubt that it represents a place for hanging such vessels in the houses
of the living.All the treasures found in this tomb are in the oldest style of Etruscan
art, and are so similar to the bronzes and ornaments brought by Layard
from Assyria as to lead to the belief that they had a common origin.The
tomb, with its contents, probably dates from the 9th or 10th century
before the Christian era.The largest tomb hitherto discovered in Etruria is now known as the
Cocumella, in the necropolis at Vulci.in
diameter, and originally could not have been less than 115 or 120 ft.in
height, though now it only rises to 50 ft.View of principal Chamber in the Regulini Galeassi
Tomb.]Near its centre are the remains of two solid towers, one circular, the
other square, neither of them actually central, nor are they placed in
such a way that we can understand how they can have formed a part of any
symmetrical design.A plan and a view of the present appearance of this
monument are given in Woodcuts 174 and 175.This tumulus, with its principal remaining features thus standing on one
side of the centre, may possibly assist us to understand the curious
description found in Pliny[163] of the tomb of Porsenna.This
description is quoted from Varro, being evidently regarded by Pliny
himself as not a little apocryphal.According to this account it
consisted of a square basement 300 ft.each way, from which arose five
pyramids, united at the summit by a bronze circle or cupola.This was
again surmounted by four other pyramids, the summits of which were again
united at a height of 300 ft.From this point rose
still five more pyramids, whose height Varro (from modesty, as Pliny
surmises) omits to state, but which was estimated in Etruscan traditions
at the same height as the rest of the monument.This last statement,
which does not rest on any real authority, may well be regarded as
exaggerated; but if we take the total height as about 400 ft., it is
easy to understand that in the age of Pliny, when all the buildings were
low, such a structure, as high as the steeple at Salisbury, would appear
fabulous; but the vast piles that have been erected by tomb-building
races in other parts of the earth render it by no means improbable that
Varro was justified in what he asserted.[164]

Near the gate of Albano is found a small tomb of five pyramidal pillars
rising from a square base, exactly corresponding with Varro’s
description of the lower part of the tomb of Porsenna.It is called by
tradition the tomb of Aruns, the son of Porsenna, though the character
of the mouldings with which it is adorned would lead us to assign to it
a more modern date.It consists of a lofty podium, on which are placed
five pyramids, a large one in the centre and four smaller ones at the
angles.Its present appearance is shown in the annexed woodcut (No.There are not in Etruria any features sufficiently marked to
characterise a style of architecture, nor any pillars with their
accessories which can be considered to constitute an order.It is true
that in some of the rock-cut tombs square piers support the roof; and in
one or two instances rounded pillars are found, but these are either
without mouldings or ornamented only with Roman details, betraying the
lateness of their execution.The absence of built examples of the class
of tombs found in the rock prevents us from recognising any of those
peculiarities of construction which sometimes are as characteristic of
the style and as worthy of attention as the more purely ornamental
parts.From their city gates, their aqueducts and bridges, we know that the
Etruscans used the radiating arch at an early age, with deep voussoirs
and elegant mouldings, giving it that character of strength which the
Romans afterwards imparted to their works of the same class.The Cloaca
Maxima of Rome (Woodcut No.104) must be considered as a work executed
under Etruscan superintendence, and a very perfect specimen of the
class.At the same time the Etruscans used the pointed arch, constructed
horizontally, and seem to have had the same predilection for it which
characterised the cognate Pelasgian race in Greece.A gateway at Arpino
(Woodcut No.177) is almost identical with that at Thoricus (Woodcut No.126), but larger and more elegant; and there are many specimens of the
same class found in Italy.The portion of an aqueduct at Tusculum, shown
in Woodcut No.178, is a curious transition specimen, where the two
stones meeting at the apex (usually called the Egyptian form, being the
first step towards the true arch) are combined with a substructure of
horizontal converging masonry.In either of these instances the horizontal arch is a legitimate mode of
construction, and may have been used long after the principle of the
radiating arch was known.The great convenience of the latter, as
enabling large spaces to be spanned even with brick or the smallest
stones, and thus dispensing with the necessity for stones of very large
dimensions, led ultimately to its universal adoption.Subsequently, when
the pointed form of the radiating arch was introduced, no motive
remained for the retention of the horizontal method, and it was entirely
abandoned.We now approach the last revolution that completed and closed the great
cycle of the arts and civilisation of the ancient world.We have seen
Art spring Minerva-like, perfect from the head of her great parent, in
Egypt.We have admired it in Assyria, rich, varied, but unstable; aiming
at everything, but never attaining maturity or perfection.We have tried
to trace the threads of early Pelasgic art in Asia, Greece, and Etruria,
spreading their influence over the world, and laying the foundation of
other arts which the Pelasgi were incapable of developing.We have seen
all these elements gathered together in Greece, the essence extracted
from each, and the whole forming the most perfect and beautiful
combinations of intellectual power that the world has yet witnessed.We
have now only to contemplate the last act in the great drama, the
gorgeous but melancholy catastrophe by which all these styles of
architecture were collected in wild confusion in Rome, and there
perished beneath the luxury and crimes of that mighty people, who for a
while made Rome the capital of Europe.View them as we will, the arts of Rome were never an indigenous or
natural production of the soil or people, but an aggregation of foreign
styles in a state of transition from the old and time-honoured forms of
Pagan antiquity to the new development introduced by Christianity.We
cannot of course suppose that the Romans foresaw the result to which
their amalgamation of previous styles was tending; still they advanced
as steadily towards that result as if a prophetic spirit had guided them
to a well-defined conception of what was to be.It was not however
permitted to the Romans to complete this task.Long before the ancient
methods and ideas had been completely moulded into the new, the power of
Rome sank beneath her corruption, and a long pause took place, during
which the Christian arts did not advance in Western Europe beyond the
point they had reached in the age of Constantine.Indeed, in many
respects, they receded from it during the dark ages.When they
reappeared in the 10th and 11th centuries it was in an entirely new garb
and with scarcely a trace of their origin—so distinct indeed that it
appears more like a reinvention than a reproduction of forms long since
familiar to the Roman world.Had Rome retained her power and
pre-eminence a century or two longer, a style might have been elaborated
as distinct from that of the ancient world, and as complete in itself,
as our pointed Gothic, and perhaps more beautiful.Such was not the
destiny of the world; and what we have now to do is to examine this
transition style as we find it in ancient Rome, and familiarise
ourselves with the forms it took during the three centuries of its
existence, as without this knowledge all the arts of the Gothic era
would for ever remain an inexplicable mystery.The chief value of the
Roman style consists in the fact that it contains the germs of all that
is found in the Middle Ages, and affords the key by which its mysteries
may be unlocked, and its treasures rendered available.Had the
transition been carried through in the hands of an art-loving and
artistic people, the architectural beauties of Rome must have surpassed
those of any other city in the world, for its buildings surpass in scale
those of Egypt and in variety those of Greece, while they affect to
combine the beauties of both.In constructive ingenuity they far surpass
anything the world had seen up to that time, but this cannot redeem
offences against good taste, nor enable any Roman productions to command
our admiration as works of art, or entitle them to rank as models to be
followed either literally or in spirit.During the first two centuries and a half of her existence, Rome was
virtually an Etruscan city, wholly under Etruscan influence; and during
that period we read of temples and palaces being built and of works of
immense magnitude being undertaken for the embellishment of the city;
and we have even now more remains of kingly than we have of consular
Rome.After expelling her kings and shaking off Etruscan influence, Rome
existed as a republic for five centuries, and during this long age of
barbarism she did nothing to advance science or art.Literature was
almost wholly unknown within her walls, and not one monument has come
down to our time, even by tradition, worthy of a city of a tenth part of
her power and magnitude.There is probably no instance in the history of
the world of a capital city existing so long, populous and peaceful at
home, prosperous and powerful abroad, and at the same time so utterly
devoid of any monuments or any magnificence to dignify her existence.When, however, Carthage was conquered and destroyed, when Greece was
overrun and plundered, and Egypt, with her long-treasured art, had
become a dependent province, Rome was no longer the city of the Aryan
Romans, but the sole capital of the civilised world.Into her lap were
poured all the artistic riches of the universe; to Rome flocked all who
sought a higher distinction or a more extended field for their ambition
than their own provincial capitals could then afford.She thus became
the centre of all the arts and of all the science then known; and, so
far at least as quantity is concerned, she amply redeemed her previous
neglect of them.It seems an almost indisputable fact that, during the
three centuries of the Empire, more and larger buildings were erected in
Rome and her dependent cities than ever were erected in a like period in
any part of the world.For centuries before the establishment of the Roman Empire, progressive
development and increasing population, joined to comparative peace and
security, had accumulated around the shores of the Mediterranean a mass
of people enjoying material prosperity greater than had ever been known
before.All this culminated in the first centuries of the Christian era.The greatness of the ancient world was then full, and a more
overwhelming and gorgeous spectacle than the Roman Empire then displayed
never dazzled the eyes of mankind.From the banks of the Euphrates to
those of the Tagus, every city vied with its neighbour in the erection
of temples, baths, theatres, and edifices for public use or private
luxury.In all cases these display far more evidence of wealth and power
than of taste and refinement, and all exhibit traces of that haste to
enjoy, which seems incompatible with the correct elaboration of anything
that is to be truly great.Notwithstanding all this, there is a
greatness in the mass, a grandeur in the conception, and a certain
expression of power in all these Roman remains which never fail to
strike the beholder with awe and force admiration from him despite his
better judgment.These qualities, coupled with the associations that
attach themselves to every brick and every stone, render the study of
them irresistibly attractive.It was with Imperial Rome that the ancient
world perished; it was in her dominions that the new and Christian world
was born.All that was great in Heathendom was gathered within her
walls, tied, it is true, into an inextricable knot, which was cut by the
sword of those barbarians who moulded for themselves out of the
fragments that polity and those arts which will next occupy our
attention.To Rome all previous history tends; from Rome all modern
history springs: to her, therefore, and to her arts, we inevitably turn,
if not to admire, at least to learn, and if not to imitate, at any rate
to wonder at and to contemplate a phase of art as unknown to previous as
to subsequent history, and, if properly understood, more replete with
instruction than any other form hitherto known.Though the lesson we
learn from it is far oftener what to avoid than what to follow, still
there is such wisdom to be gathered from it as should guide us in the
onward path, which may lead us to a far higher grade than it was given
to Rome herself ever to attain.Origin of style—The arch—Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be
called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country
previously occupied by Pelasgians.Their principal neighbour on one side
was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation.On the other hand was Magna Græcia,
which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of
kindred origin.It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the
Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two
people.As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of
both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries
afterwards.Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,
and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in
Roman architecture to its origin.From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with
its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used
it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being
sufficiently large for their purposes.The principal Etruscan temples,
as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half
occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the
portico never extended.The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of
these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its
breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the
building.Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,
but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though
frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns
attached to its walls.Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a
circular form of temple.As applied by the Romans it was generally
encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the
Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from
the Greeks on an Etruscan form.In early times these circular temples
were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown
or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this
distinction was lost sight of.A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the
Etruscans was the circular arch.It was known, it is true, to the
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps
excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their
ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and
introduced it into almost all their buildings.It was not at first used
in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones.In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was
generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders.In the
Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless
network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their
entablatures, is spread over the whole.This is a curious instance of
the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of
Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns
would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some
expedient more correctly constructive.After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the
arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in
advance by applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular
forms of buildings.The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of
the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple
of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so
distant in date.In these buildings the Roman architects so completely
emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to
entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture.It
would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to
the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for
boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the
new method ought to be applied.This is almost universally acknowledged
so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned.In simple grandeur
it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail.It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in
its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet
remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been
quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more
familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately
as the simpler dome of the Pantheon.These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to
which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of
architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors.It
may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman
architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the
semi-Oriental nation seized on its own circular form, and, modifying and
moulding it to its purpose, wrought out the Byzantine style; in which
the dome is the great feature, almost to the total exclusion of the
rectangular form with its intersecting vaults.On the other hand, the
rectangular form was appropriated by the nations of the West with an
equally distinct rejection of the circular and domical forms, except in
those cases in which we find an Eastern people still incorporated with
them.Thus in Italy both styles continued long in use, the one in
baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in
Rome.In France they were so completely fused into each other that it
requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate
them again into their component parts.In England we rejected the
circular form altogether, and so they did eventually in Germany, except
when under French influence.Each race reclaimed its own among the
spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during
its employment in the Imperial city.The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the
numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of
purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles.In
Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs.In
Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in
Etruria to tombs.It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to
deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who
for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture
subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster.It thus
happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find
basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of
triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all
equally objects of architectural skill.The best of these, in fact, are
those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped
with originality.These would have been noble works indeed had it not
been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and
details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to
temples by other nations.In the time of Constantine these orders had
nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative
purposes.In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the
Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before
remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore
still remain an essential part of Roman art.We find the old orders
predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as
we approach that of Constantine.Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the
Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about
half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly simple order of
the Greeks.It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for
monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter.It was, however,
more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter
column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek
style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,
but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman.This fact was apparently
recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple
throughout the Roman world.It would in consequence be most unfair to
institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in
civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world
spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was
devoted to the highest religious purposes.The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally
useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the
other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal
object of its introduction.The keynote of Roman architecture was the
Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,
many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders
together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three
should be reduced to something like harmony.This was accordingly done,
but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in
combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our
admiration.The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the
Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric.They
never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed
it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two.In its own native
East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers
or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no
angles to be turned.When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples
of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at
each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to
one another.In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut
No.142) they used a capital with four faces.The Romans, impatient of
control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over
the extreme difficulty of its employment.With them the angular volutes
became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants
harmony and meaning.When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,
and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this
state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually
deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord
in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to
be found in Roman remains.The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from
that of the other two.The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme
of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have
become incapable of further improvement.The Corinthian, on the
contrary, was a recent conception; and although nothing can surpass the
elegance and grace with which the Greeks adorned it, the new capital
never acquired with them that fulness and strength so requisite to
render it an appropriate architectural ornament.These were added to it
by the Romans, or rather perhaps by Grecian artists acting under their
direction, who thus, as shown in Woodcut No.181, produced an order
which for richness combined with proportion and architectural fitness
has hardly been surpassed.The base is elegant and appropriate; the
shaft is of the most pleasing proportion, and the fluting gives it just
the requisite degree of richness and no more; while the capital, though
bordering on over-ornamentation, is so well arranged as to appear just
suited to the work it has to do.The acanthus-leaves, it is true,
approach the very verge of that degree of direct imitation of nature
which, though allowable in architectural ornaments, is seldom advisable;
they are, however, disposed so formally, and there still remains so much
that is conventional in them, that, though perhaps not justly open to
criticism on this account, they are nevertheless a very extreme example.The entablature is not so admirable as the column.The architrave is too
richly carved.It is evident, however, that this arose from the artist
having copied in carving what the Greeks had only painted, and thereby
produced a complexity far from pleasing.The frieze, as we now find it, is perfectly plain; but this undoubtedly
was not the case when originally erected.It either must have been
painted (in which case the whole order of course was also painted), or
ornamented with scrolls or figures in bronze, which may probably have
been gilt.The cornice is perhaps open to the same criticism as the architrave, of
being over-rich, though this evidently arose from the same cause, viz.,
reproducing in carving what was originally only painted; which to our
Northern eyes at least appears more appropriate for internal than for
external decoration, though, under the purer skies where it was
introduced and used, this remark may be hardly applicable.The order of the portico of the Pantheon is, according to our notions, a
nobler specimen of what an external pillar should be than that of the
Temple of Jupiter Stator.The shafts are of one block, unfluted; the
capital plainer; and the whole entablature, though as correctly
proportional, is far less ornamented and more suited to the greater
simplicity of the whole.The order of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina is another example
intermediate between these two.The columns are in this instance very
similar to those of the Pantheon, and the architrave is plain.The
frieze, however, is ornamented with more taste than any other in Rome,
and is a very pleasing example of those conventional representations of
plants and animals which are so well suited to architectural
purposes—more like Nature than those of the Greeks, but still avoiding
direct imitation sufficiently to escape the affectation of pretending to
appear what it is not and cannot be.The Maison Carrée at Nîmes presents an example of a frieze ornamented
with exquisite taste, while at Baalbec, and in some other examples, we
have them so over-ornamented that the effect is far more offensive, from
utter want of repose, than the frieze in the Temple of Jupiter Stator
ever could be from its baldness.Besides these there are at least fifty varieties of Corinthian capitals
to be found, either in Rome or in various parts of the Roman Empire, all
executed within the three centuries during which Rome continued to be
the imperial city.Some of them are remarkable for that elegant
simplicity which so evidently betrays the hand of a Grecian artist,
while others again show a lavish exuberance of ornament which is but too
characteristic of Roman art in general.Many, however, contain the germs
of something better than was accomplished in that age; and a collection
of them would afford more useful suggestions for designing capitals than
have yet been available to modern artists.Among their various attempts to improve the order which has just been
described, the Romans hit upon one which is extremely characteristic of
their whole style of art.This is known by the distinguishing name of
the Composite order, though virtually more like the typical examples of
the Corinthian order than many of those classed under the latter
denomination.The greatest defect of the Corinthian capital is the weakness of the
small volutes supporting the angles of the abacus.A true artist would
have remedied this by adding to their strength and carrying up the
fulness of the capital to the top.The Romans removed the whole of the
upper part and substituted an Ionic capital instead.Their only original
idea, if it may be so called, in art was that of putting two dissimilar
things together to make one which should combine the beauties of both,
though as a rule the one generally serves to destroy the other.In the
Composite capital they never could hide the junction; and consequently,
though rich, and in some respects an improvement on the order out of
which it grew, this capital never came into general use, and has seldom
found favour except amongst the blindest admirers of all that the Romans
did.Corinthian Base, found in Church of St.In the latter days of the Empire the Romans attempted another innovation
which promised far better success, and with very little more elaboration
would have been a great gain to the principles of architectural design.This was the introduction of the Persian or Assyrian base, modified to
suit the details of the Corinthian or Composite orders.If they had
always used this instead of the square pedestals on which they mounted
their columns, and had attenuated the pillars slightly when used with
arcades, they would have avoided many of the errors they fell into.This
application, however, came too late to be generally used; and the forms
already introduced continued to prevail.At the same time it is evident
that a Persepolitan base for an Ionic and even for a Corinthian column
would be amongst the greatest improvements that could now be introduced,
especially for internal architecture.The true Roman order, however, was not any of these columnar ordinances
we have been enumerating, but an arrangement of two pillars placed at a
distance from one another nearly equal to their own height, and having a
very long entablature, which in consequence required to be supported in
the centre by an arch springing from piers.This, as will be seen from
the annexed woodcut, was in fact merely a screen of Grecian architecture
placed in front of a construction of Etruscan design.Though not without
a certain richness of effect, still, as used by the Romans, these two
systems remain too distinctly dissimilar for the result to be pleasing,
and their use necessitated certain supplemental arrangements by no means
agreeable.In the first place, the columns had to be mounted on
pedestals, or otherwise an entablature proportional to their size would
have been too heavy and too important for a thing so useless and so
avowedly a mere ornament.A projecting keystone was also introduced into
the arch.Mary journeyed to the bathroom.This was unobjectionable in itself, but when projecting so far
as to do the duty of an intermediate capital, it overpowered the arch
without being equal to the work required of it.The Romans used these arcades with all the 3 orders, frequently one over
the other, and tried various expedients to harmonise the construction
with the ornamentation, but without much effect.They seem always to
have felt the discordance as a blemish, and at last got rid of it, but
whether they did so in the best way is not quite clear.The most obvious
mode of effecting this would no doubt have been by omitting the pillars
altogether, bending the architrave, as is usually done, round the arch,
and then inserting the frieze and cornices into the wall, using them as
a string-course.A slight degree of practice would soon have enabled
them—by panelling the pier, cutting off its angles, or some such
expedient—to have obtained the degree of lightness or of ornament they
required, and so really to have invented a new order.This, however, was not the course that the Romans pursued.What they did
was to remove the pier altogether, and to substitute for it the pillar
taken down from its pedestal.This of course was not effected at once,
but was the result of many trials and expedients.One of the earliest of
these is observed in the Ionic Temple of Concord before alluded to, in
which a concealed arch is thrown from the head of each pillar, but above
the entablature, so as to take the whole weight of the superstructure
from off the cornice between the pillars.When once this was done it was
perceived that so deep an entablature was no longer required, and that
it might be either wholly omitted, as was sometimes done in the centre
intercolumniation, or very much reduced.There is an old temple at
Talavera in Spain, which is a good example of the former expedient; and
the Roman gateway at Damascus is a remarkable instance of the latter.There the architrave, frieze and cornice are carried across in the form
of an arch from pier to pier, thus constituting a new feature in
architectural design.View in Courtyard of Palace at Spalato]

In Diocletian’s reign we find all these changes already introduced into
domestic architecture, as shown in Woodcut No.185, representing the
great court of his palace at Spalato, where, at one end, the entablature
is bent into the form of an arch over the central intercolumniation,
while on each side of the court the arches spring directly from the
capitals of the columns.Had the Romans at this period been more desirous to improve their
external architecture, there is little doubt that they would have
adopted the expedient of omitting the entire entablature: but at this
time almost all their efforts were devoted to internal improvement, and
not unfrequently at the expense of the exterior.Indeed the whole
history of Roman art, from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine,
is a transition from the external architecture of the Greeks to the
internal embellishment of the Christians.At first we see the cells of
the temple gradually enlarged at the expense of the peristyle, and
finally, in some instances, entirely overpowering them.Their basilicas
and halls become more important than their porticoes, and the exterior
is in almost every instance sacrificed to internal arrangements.For an
interior, an arch resting on a circular column is obviously far more
appropriate than one resting on a pier.Externally, on the contrary, the
square pier is most suitable, because a pillar cannot support a wall of
sufficient thickness.This defect was not remedied until the Gothic
architects devised the plan of coupling two or more pillars together;
but this point had not been reached at the time when with the fall of
Rome all progress in art was effectually checked for a time.There is perhaps nothing that strikes the inquirer into the
architectural history of Rome more than the extreme insignificance of
her temples, as compared with the other buildings of the imperial city
and with some contemporary temples found in the provinces.The only
temple which remains at all worthy of such a capital is the Pantheon.All others are now mere fragments, from which we can with difficulty
restore even the plans of the buildings, far less judge of their effect.We have now no means of forming an opinion of the great national temple
of the Capitoline Jove, no trace of it, nor any intelligible
description, having been preserved to the present time.Its having been
of Etruscan origin, and retaining its original form to the latest day,
would lead us to suppose that the temple itself was small, and that its
magnificence, if any, was confined to the enclosure and to the
substructure, which may have been immense.Of the Augustan age we have nothing but the remains of three temples,
each consisting of only three columns; and the excavations that have
been made around them have not sufficed to make even their plans
tolerably clear.The most remarkable was that of Jupiter Stator in the Forum, the
beautiful details of which have been already alluded to and described.It was raised on a stylobate 22 ft.in height, the extreme width of which was 98 ft., and this corresponds
as closely as possible with 100 Roman ft.The height of the pillars was 48 ft., and
that of the entablature 12 ft.[165] It is probable that the whole
height to the apex of the pediment was nearly equal to the extreme
width, and that it was designed to be so.The pillars certainly extended on both flanks, and the temple is
generally restored as peristylar, but apparently without any authority.From the analogy of the other temples it seems more probable that there
were not more than eight or ten pillars on each side, and that the apse
of the cella formed the termination opposite the portico.The temple nearest to this in situation and style is that of Jupiter
Tonans.[166] The order in this instance is of slightly inferior
dimensions to that of the temple just described, and of very inferior
execution.The temple, too, was very much smaller, having only six
columns in front, and from its situation it could not well have had more
than that number on the flanks, so that its extreme dimensions were
probably about 70 ft.The third is the Temple of Mars Ultor, of which a plan is annexed; for
though now as completely decayed as the other two, in the time of Ant.Sabacco and Palladio there seem to have been sufficient remains to
justify an attempt at restoration.As will be seen, it is nearly square
in plan (112 ft.The cella is here a much more important part
than is usual in Greek temples, and terminates in an apse, which
afterwards became characteristic of all places of worship.Behind the
cella, and on each side, was a lofty screen of walls and arches, part of
which still remain, and form quite a new adjunct, unlike anything
hitherto met with attached to any temple now known.(From Cresy’s ‘Rome.’) Scale
100 ft.The next class of temples, called pseudo-peripteral (or those in which
the cella occupies the whole of the after part), are generally more
modern, certainly more completely Roman, than these last.One of the
best specimens at Rome is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, a small
building measuring 72 ft.There is also a very elegant little
Ionic temple of this class called that of Fortuna Virilis; while the
Ionic Temple of Concord, built by Vespasian, and above alluded to,
appears also to have been of this class.So was the temple in the forum
at Pompeii; but the finest specimen now remaining to us is the so-called
Maison Carrée at Nîmes, which is indeed one of the most elegant temples
of the Roman world, owing probably a great deal of its beauty to the
taste of the Grecian colonists long settled in its neighbourhood.It is
hexastyle, with 11 columns in the flanks, 3 of which stand free, and
belong to the portico; the remaining 8 are attached to the walls of the
cella.by 85; but such is the beauty of
its proportions and the elegance of its details that it strikes every
beholder with admiration.Plan of Maison Carrée at Nîmes.The date of this temple has not been satisfactorily ascertained.From
the nail-holes of the inscription on the frieze it has been attempted to
make out the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and there is nothing in
the style of its architecture to contradict this hypothesis.Even if the
buildings in the capital were such as to render this date ambiguous, it
would scarcely be safe to apply any argument derived from them to a
provincial example erected in the midst of a Grecian colony.But for
their evidence we might almost be inclined to fancy its style
represented the age of Trajan.The temple of Diana in the same city is another edifice of singular
beauty of detail, and interesting from the peculiarity of its plan.Exclusive of the portico it is nearly square, 70 ft.by 65, and consists
of a cella which is covered with a stone ribbed vault, the thrust of
which is counteracted by smaller vaults thrown across two side passages
or aisles which are, however, not thrown open to the cella.The columns
in the cella are detached from the wall, which is singularly interesting
as the origin of much which we find afterwards in Gothic work.(A
somewhat similar arrangement is found in the small temple at Baalbec
(Woodcut No.197) where, however, the peristyle occupies the position
and serves the same purpose as the aisles at Nîmes, viz., to resist the
thrust of the vault over the cella.)Plan of Temple of Diana at Nîmes.Throughout this building the details of the architecture are unsurpassed
for variety and elegance by anything found in the metropolis, and are
applied here with a freedom and elegance bespeaking the presence of a
Grecian mind even in this remote corner of the Empire.This was supported by four slender
columns of singularly elegant design, but placed so widely apart that
they could not have carried a stone entablature.It is difficult to
guess what could have been the form of the wooden ones; but a mortice
which still exists in the walls of the temple shows that it must have
been eight or ten feet deep, and therefore probably of Etruscan form
(Woodcut No.167); though it may have assumed a circular arched form
between the pillars.[167]

[Illustration: 189.View of the Interior of the Temple of Diana at
Nîmes.Another peculiarity is, that the light was introduced over the portico
by a great semicircular window, as is done in the Buddhist caves in
India; which, so far as I know, is the most perfect mode of lighting the
interior of a temple which has yet been discovered.Not far from the Colosseum, in the direction of the Forum, are still to
be seen the remains of a great double temple built by the Emperor
Hadrian, and dedicated to Venus and Rome, and consisting of the ruins of
its two cells, each about 70 ft.square, covered with tunnel-vaults, and
placed back to back, so that their apses touch one another.long by 330 wide; and it is generally supposed
that on the edge of this once stood 56 great columns, 65 ft.in height,
thus moulding the whole into one great peripteral temple.Some fragments
of such pillars are said to be found in the neighbourhood, but not one
is now erect,—not even a base is in its place,—nor can any of its
columns be traced to any other buildings.This part, therefore, of the
arrangement is very problematical, and I should be rather inclined to
restore it, as Palladio and the older architects have done, with a
corridor of ten small columns in front of each of the cells.If we could
assume the plan of this temple to have been really peripteral, as
supposed, it must have been a building worthy of the imperial city and
of the magnificence of the emperor to whom its erection is ascribed.More perfect and more interesting than any of these is the Pantheon,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest temples of the ancient world.Externally its effect is very much destroyed by its two parts, the
circular and the rectangular, being so dissimilar in style and so
incongruously joined together.The portico especially, in itself the
finest which Rome exhibits, is very much injured by being prefixed to a
mass which overpowers it and does not harmonise with any of its lines.The pitch, too, of its pediment is perhaps somewhat too high, but,
notwithstanding all this, its sixteen columns, the shaft of each
composed of a single block, and the simple grandeur of the details,
render it perhaps the most satisfactory example of its class.The pillars are arranged in the Etruscan fashion, as they were
originally disposed in front of three-celled temples.As they now stand,
however, they are added unsymmetrically to a rotunda, and in so clumsy a
fashion that the two are certainly not part of the same design and do
not belong to the same age.Either it was that the portico was added to
the pre-existing rotunda, or that the rotunda is long subsequent to the
portico.Unfortunately the two inscriptions on the portico hardly help
to a solution of the difficulty.The principal one states that it was
built by M. Agrippa, but the “it” may refer to the rotunda only, and may
have been put there by those who in the time of Aurelius[168] repaired
the temple which had “fallen into decay from age.” This hardly could,
under any circumstances, be predicated of the rotunda, which shows no
sign of decay during the last seventeen centuries of ill-treatment and
neglect, and may last for as many more without injury to its stability,
but might be said of a portico which, if of wood, as Etruscan porticoes
usually were, may easily in 200 years have required repairs and
rebuilding.From a more careful examination on the spot, I am convinced
that the portico was added at some subsequent period to the rotunda.If
by Agrippa, then the dome must belong to Republican times; if by Severus
it may have been, as is generally supposed, the hall of the Baths of
Agrippa.[169] Altogether I know of no building whose date and
arrangements are so singular and so exceptional as this.Though it is,
and always must have been, one of the most prominent buildings in Rome,
and most important from its size and design, I know of no other building
in Rome whose date or original destination it is so difficult to
determine.Half Elevation, half Section, of the Pantheon at
Rome.Internally perhaps the greatest defect of the building is a want of
height in the perpendicular part, which the dome appears to overpower
and crush.This mistake is aggravated by the lower part being cut up
into two storeys, an attic being placed over the lower order.The former
defect may have arisen from the architect wishing to keep the walls in
some proportion to the portico.The latter is a peculiarity of the age
in which I suppose this temple to have been remodelled, when two or more
storeys seem to have become indispensable requisites of architectural
design.We must ascribe also to the practice of the age the method of
cutting through the entablature by the arches of the great niches, as
shown in the sectional part of the last woodcut.It has already been
pointed out that this was becoming a characteristic of the style at the
time when the circular part of this temple was arranged as it at present
appears.Notwithstanding these defects and many others of detail that might be
mentioned, there is a grandeur and a simplicity in the proportions of
this great temple that render it still one of the very finest and most
sublime interiors in the world, and the dimensions of its dome, 145 ft.span by 147 in height, have not yet been surpassed by any
subsequent erection.Though it is deprived of its bronze covering[170]
and of the greater part of those ornaments on which it mainly depended
for effect, and though these have been replaced by tawdry and
incongruous modernisms, still nothing can destroy the effect of a design
so vast and of a form so simply grand.It possesses moreover one other
element of architectural sublimity in having a single window, and that
placed high up in the building.I know of no other temples which possess
this feature except the great rock-cut Buddhist basilicas of India.In
them the light is introduced even more artistically than here; but,
nevertheless, that one great eye opening upon heaven is by far the
noblest conception for lighting a building to be found in Europe.Besides this great rotunda there are two other circular temples in or
near Rome.The one at Tivoli, shown in plan and elevation in the annexed
woodcuts (Nos.192 and 193), has long been known and admired; the other,
near the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima, has a cell surrounded by twenty
Corinthian columns of singularly slender proportions.Both these
probably stand on Etruscan sites; they certainly are Etruscan in form,
and are very likely sacred to Pelasgic deities, either Vesta or Cybele.Restored Elevation of Temple at Tivoli.Both in dimensions and design they form a perfect contrast to the
Pantheon, as might be expected from their both belonging to the Augustan
age of art: consequently the cella is small, its interior is
unornamented, and all the art and expense is lavished on the external
features, especially on the peristyle; showing more strongly than even
the rectangular temple the still remaining predominance of Grecian
taste, which was gradually dying out during the whole period of the
Empire.It is to be regretted that the exact dates of both these temples are
unknown, for, as that at Tivoli shows the stoutest example of a
Corinthian column known and that in Rome the slenderest, it might lead
to some important deductions if we could be certain which was the older
of the two.It may be, however, that this difference of style has no
connection with the relative age of the two buildings, but that it is
merely an instance of the good taste of the age to which they belong.The Roman example, being placed in a low and flat situation, required
all the height that could be given it; that at Tivoli, being placed on
the edge of a rock, required as much solidity as the order would admit
of to prevent its looking poor and insecure.A Gothic or a Greek
architect would certainly have made this distinction.One more step towards the modern style of round temples was taken before
the fall of the Western Empire, in the temple which Diocletian built in
his palace at Spalato.Internally the temple is circular, 28 ft.in
diameter, and the height of the perpendicular part to the springing of
the dome is about equal to its width.This is a much more pleasing
proportion than we find in the Pantheon; perhaps the very best that has
yet been employed.Externally the building is an octagon, surrounded by
a low dwarf peristyle, very unlike that employed in the older examples.This angularity is certainly a great improvement, giving expression and
character to the building, and affording flat faces for the entrances or
porches; but the peristyle is too low, and mars the dignity of the
whole.[171]

[Illustration: 194.Plan and Elevation of Temple in Diocletian’s Palace
at Spalato.To us its principal interest consists in its being so extremely similar
to the Christian baptisteries which were erected in the following
centuries, and which were copies, but very slightly altered, from
buildings of this class.Even assuming that Hadrian completed the great Temple of Venus at Rome
in the manner generally supposed, it must have been very far surpassed
by the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, which, though
probably not entirely erected, was certainly finished, by that Emperor.It was octastyle in front,[172] with a double range of 20 columns on
each flank so that it could not well have had less than 106 columns, all
about 58 ft.in height, and of the most elegant Corinthian order,
presenting altogether a group of far greater magnificence than any other
temple we are acquainted with of its class in the ancient world.Its
lineal dimensions also, as may be seen from the plan (Woodcut No.195),
were only rivalled by the two great Sicilian temples at Selinus and
Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.wide by 354 in
length, or nearly the same dimensions as the great Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac, from which, however, it differs most materially, that being a
beautiful example of an interior, this depending for all its
magnificence on the external arrangement of its columns.Penrose’s
discoveries in 1884 show that there was an opisthodomus at the rear and
a vestibule or court in front of the cella which may have been hypæthral
so as to admit light into the interior.This arrangement became so
common in the early Christian world that there must have been some
precedent for it; which, in addition to other reasons,[173] strongly
inclines me to believe that the arrangement shown in the plan is
correct.Ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]Plan of Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]The temples of Palmyra and Kangovar have been already mentioned in
speaking of that of Jerusalem, to which class they seem to belong in
their general arrangements, though their details are borrowed from Roman
architecture.This, however, is not the case with the temples at
Baalbec, which taken together and with their accompaniments, form the
most magnificent temple group now left to us of their class and age.The
great temple, if completed (which, however, probably it never was),
would have been about 160 ft.by 290, and therefore, as a Corinthian
temple, only inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.Only nine
of its colossal columns are now standing, but the bases of most of the
others are _in situ_.Scarcely less magnificent than the temple itself
was the court in which it stood, above 380 ft.square, and surrounded on
three sides by recessed porticoes of most exuberant richness, though in
perhaps rather questionable taste.In front of this was a hexagonal
court of very great beauty, with a noble portico of 12 Corinthian
columns, with two square blocks of masonry at each end.The whole extent
of the portico is 260 ft., and of its kind it is perhaps unrivalled,
certainly among the buildings of so late a date as the period to which
it belongs.Elevation of Small Temple at Baalbec.The other, or smaller temple, stands close to the larger.Its
dimensions, to the usual scale, are shown in the plan (Woodcut No.It is larger than any of the Roman peripteral temples, being 117 ft.John went to the hallway.by
227 ft., or rather exceeding the dimensions of the Parthenon at Athens,
and its portico is both wider and higher than that of the Pantheon at
Rome.Had this portico been applied to that building, the <DW72> of its
pediment would have coincided exactly with that of the upper sloping
cornice, and would have been the greatest possible improvement to that
edifice.As it is, it certainly is the best proportioned and the most
graceful Roman portico of the first class that remains to us in a state
of sufficient completeness to allow us to judge of its effect.The interior of the cella was richly ornamented with niches and
pilasters, and covered with a ribbed and coffered vault, remarkable,
like every part of this edifice, rather for the profusion than for the
good taste of its ornaments.One of the principal peculiarities of this group of buildings is the
immense size of some of the stones used in the substructure of the great
temple: three of these average about 63 ft.A fourth, of similar dimensions, is lying
in the quarry, which it is calculated must weigh alone more than 1100
tons in its rough state, or nearly as much as one of the tubes of the
Britannia Bridge.It is not easy to see why such masses were employed.If they had been used as foundation stones their use would have been
apparent, but they are placed over several courses of smaller stones,
about half-way up the terrace wall, as mere binding stones, apparently
for show.It is true that in many places in the Bible and in Josephus
nothing is so much insisted upon as the immense size of the stones used
in the building of the Temple and the walls of Jerusalem, the bulk of
the materials used appearing to have been thought a matter of far more
importance than the architecture.It probably was some such feeling as
this which led to their employment here, though, had these huge stones
been set upright, as the Egyptians would have placed them, we might more
easily have understood why so great an expense should have been incurred
on their account.As it is, there seems no reason for doubting their
being of the same age as the temples they support, though their use is
certainly exceptional in Roman temples of this class.BASILICAS, THEATRES, AND BATHS.Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius—Provincial basilicas—Theatre at
  Orange—Colosseum—Provincial amphitheatres—Baths of Diocletian.We have already seen that in size and magnificence the temples of Rome
were among the least remarkable of her public buildings.It may be
doubted whether in any respect, in the eyes of the Romans themselves,
the temples were as important and venerable as the basilicas.The people
cared for government and justice more than for religion, and
consequently paid more attention to the affairs of the basilicas than to
those of the temples.Our means for the restoration of this class of
buildings are now but small, owing to their slight construction in the
first instance, and to their materials having been so suitable for the
building of Christian basilicas as to have been extensively used for
that purpose.It happens, however, that the remains which we do possess
comprise what we know to be the ruins of the two most splendid buildings
of this class in Rome, and these are sufficiently complete to enable us
to restore their plans with considerable confidence.It is also
fortunate that one of these, the Ulpian or Trajan’s basilica, is the
typical specimen of those with wooden roofs; the other, that of
Maxentius, commonly called the Temple of Peace, is the noblest of the
vaulted class.Plan of Trajan’s Basilica at Rome.The part shaded darker is all that is uncovered.
]Restored Section of Trajan’s Basilica.The rectangular part of Trajan’s basilica was 180 ft.in width and a
little more than twice that in length, but, neither end having yet been
excavated, its exact longitudinal measurement has not been ascertained.It was divided into five aisles by four rows of columns, each about 35
ft.wide, and the side-aisles 23 ft.The centre was covered by a wooden roof of semicircular
form,[174] covered apparently with bronze plates richly ornamented and
gilt.Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was
supported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang
the arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was
thus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,
though not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was
raised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre
of this platform was the raised seat of the quæstor or other magistrate
who presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the
assessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front
of the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before
commencing any important public business.[175]

Externally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It
was entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and
section) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on
either side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height
as those used internally.These supported statues, or rather, to judge
from the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set
off, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as
this was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to
have prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have
been very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the
structure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the
exception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class
of buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took
the place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always
suggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a
mere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the façade.The interior
of the basilica was, however, the important element to which the
exterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design
which we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,
which were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose
conformation had become sacred from the traditions of past ages.Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.Transverse Section of Basilica of Maxentius.The basilica of Maxentius, which was probably not entirely finished till
the reign of Constantine, was rather broader than that of Trajan, being
195 ft.between the walls, but it was 100 ft.The
central aisle was very nearly of the same width, being 83 ft.There was, however, a vast difference
in the construction of the two; so much so, that we are startled to see
how rapid the progress had been during the interval, of less than two
centuries, that had elapsed between the construction of the two
basilicas.Pillar of Maxentian Basilica.(From an old print
quoted by Letarouilly.)]In this building no pillars were used with the exception of eight great
columns in front of the piers, employed merely as ornaments, or as
vaulting shafts were in Gothic cathedrals, to support in appearance,
though not in construction, the springing of the vaults.[176] The
side-aisles were roofed by three great arches, each 74 ft.in span, and
the centre by an immense intersecting vault in three compartments.The
form of these will be understood from the annexed sections (Woodcuts
Nos.202 and 203), one taken longitudinally, the other across the
building.As will be seen from them, all the thrusts are collected to a
point and a buttress placed there to receive them: indeed almost all the
peculiarities afterwards found in Gothic vaults are here employed on a
far grander and more gigantic scale than the Gothic architects ever
attempted; but at the same time it must be allowed that the latter, with
smaller dimensions, often contrived by a more artistic treatment of
their materials to obtain as grand an effect and far more actual beauty
than ever were attained in the great transitional halls of the Romans.The largeness of the parts of the Roman buildings was indeed their
principal defect, as in consequence of this they must all have appeared
smaller than they really were, whereas in all Gothic cathedrals the
repetition and smallness of the component parts has the effect of
magnifying their real dimensions.The roofs of these halls had one peculiarity which it would have been
well if the mediæval architects had copied, inasmuch as they were all,
or at least might have been, honestly used as roofs without any
necessity for their being covered with others of wood, as all Gothic
vaults unfortunately were.It is true this is perhaps one of the causes
of their destruction, for, being only overlaid with cement, the rain
wore away the surface, as must inevitably be the case with any
composition of the sort exposed horizontally to the weather, and that
being gone, the moisture soon penetrated through the crevices of the
masonry, destroying the stability of the vault.Still, some of these in
Rome have resisted for fifteen centuries, after the removal of any
covering they ever might have had, all the accidents of climate and
decay, while there is not a Gothic vault of half their dimensions that
would stand for a century after the removal of its wooden protection.The construction of a vault capable of resisting the destructive effects
of exposure to the atmosphere still remains a problem for modern
architects to solve.Until this is accomplished we must regard roofs
entirely of honest wood as preferable to the deceptive stone ceilings
which were such favourites in the Middle Ages.Plan of the Basilica at Trèves.Internal View of the Basilica at Trèves.]The provincial basilicas of the Roman Empire have nearly all perished,
probably from their having been converted, first into churches, for
which they were so admirably adapted, and then rebuilt to suit the
exigencies and taste of subsequent ages.One example, however, still
exists in Trèves of sufficient completeness to give a good idea of what
such structures were.As will be seen by the annexed plan, it consists
of a great hall, 85 ft.in width internally, and rather more than twice
that dimension in length.in height and
pierced with two rows of windows; but whether they were originally
separated by a gallery or not is now by no means clear.At one end was
the apse, rather more than a semicircle of 60 ft.The floor
of the apse was raised considerably above that of the body of the
building, and was no doubt adorned by a hemicycle of seats raised on
steps, with a throne in the centre for the judge.The building has been
used for so many purposes since the time of the Romans, and has been so
much altered, that it is not easy now to speak with certainty of any of
its minor arrangements.Its internal and external appearance, as it
stood before the recent restoration, are well expressed in the annexed
woodcuts; and though ruined, it was the most complete example of a Roman
basilica to be found anywhere out of the capital.A building of this
description has been found at Pompeii, which may be considered a fair
example of a provincial basilica of the second class.Its plan is
perfectly preserved, as shown in Woodcut No.The most striking
difference existing between it and those previously described is the
square termination instead of the circular apse.It must, however, be
observed that Pompeii was situated nearer to Magna Græcia than to Rome,
and was indeed far more a Greek than a Roman city.Very slight traces of
any Etruscan designs have been discovered there, and scarcely any
buildings of the circular form so much in vogue in the capital.Though
the ground-plan of this basilica remains perfect, the upper parts are
entirely destroyed, and we do not even know for certain whether the
central portion was roofed or not.[177]

[Illustration: 207.External View of the Basilica at Trèves.]There is a small square building at Otricoli, which is generally
supposed to be a basilica, but its object as well as its age is so
uncertain that nothing need be said of it here.In the works of
Vitruvius, too, there is a description of one built by him at Fano, the
restoration of which has afforded employment for the ingenuity of the
admirers of that worst of architects.Even taking it as restored by
those most desirous of making the best of it, it is difficult to
understand how anything so bad could have been erected in such an age.It is extremely difficult to trace the origin of these basilicas, owing
principally to the loss of all the earlier examples.Their name is
Greek, and they may probably be considered as derived from the Grecian
Lesche, or perhaps as amplifications of the cellæ of Greek temples,
appropriated to the purposes of justice rather than of religion; but
till we know more of their earlier form and origin, it is useless
speculating on this point.The greatest interest to us, arises rather
from the use to which their plan was afterwards applied, than from the
source from which they themselves sprang.All the larger Christian
churches in the early times were copies, more or less exact, of the
basilicas of which that of Trajan is an example.The abundance of
pillars, suitable to such an erection, that were found everywhere in
Rome, rendered their construction easy and cheap; and the wooden roof
with which they were covered was also as simple and as inexpensive a
covering as could well be designed.The very uses of the Christian
basilicas at first were by no means dissimilar to those of their heathen
originals, as they were in reality the assembly halls of the early
Christian republic, before they became liturgical churches of the
Catholic hierarchy.The more expensive construction of the bold vaults of the Maxentian
basilica went far beyond the means of the early Church, established in a
declining and abandoned capital, and this form therefore remained
dormant for seven or eight centuries before it was revived by the
mediæval architects on an infinitely smaller scale, but adorned with a
degree of appropriateness and taste to which the Romans were strangers.It was then used with a completeness and unity which entitle it to be
considered as an entirely new style of architecture.The theatre was by no means so essential a part of the economy of a
Roman city as it was of a Grecian one.With the latter it was quite as
indispensable as the temple; and in the semi-Greek city of Herculaneum
there was one, and in Pompeii two, on a scale quite equal to those of
Greece when compared with the importance of the town itself.In the
capital there appears only to have been one, that of Marcellus,[178]
built during the reign of Augustus.It it is very questionable whether
what we now see—especially the outer arcades—belong to that age, or
whether the theatre may not have been rebuilt and these arcades added at
some later period.It is so completely built over by modern houses, and
so ruined, that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any satisfactory
opinion regarding it.Its dimensions were worthy of the capital, the
audience part being a semicircle of 410 ft.in diameter, and the scena
being of great extent in proportion to the other part, which is a
characteristic of all Roman theatres, as compared with Grecian edifices
of this class.One of the most striking Roman provincial theatres is that of Orange, in
the south of France.Perhaps it owes its existence, or at all events its
splendour, to the substratum of Grecian colonists that preceded the
Romans in that country.in diameter, but much
ruined, in consequence of the Princes of Orange having used this part as
a bastion in some fortification they were constructing.It shows well the increased
extent and complication of arrangements required for the theatrical
representations of the age in which it was constructed, being a
considerable advance towards the more modern idea of a play, as
distinguished from the stately semi-religious spectacle in which the
Greeks delighted.The noblest part of the building is the great wall at
the back, an immense mass of masonry 340 ft.in
height, without a single opening above the basement, and no ornament
except a range of blank arches, about midway between the basement and
the top, and a few projecting corbels to receive the footings of the
masts that supported the velarium.Nowhere does the architecture of the
Romans shine so much as when their gigantic buildings are left to tell
their own tale by the imposing grandeur of their masses.Whenever
ornament is attempted, their bad taste comes out.The size of their
edifices, and the solidity of their construction, were only surpassed by
the Egyptians, and not always by them; and when, as here, the mass of
material heaped up stands unadorned in all its native grandeur,
criticism is disarmed, and the spectator stands awe-struck at its
majesty, and turns away convinced that truly “there were giants in those
days.” This is not, it is true, the most intellectual way of obtaining
architectural effect, but it has the advantage of being the easiest, the
most certain to secure the desired result, and at the same time the most
permanent.The deficiency of theatres erected by the Romans is far more than
compensated by the number and splendour of their amphitheatres, which,
with their baths, may be considered as the true types of Roman art,
although it is possible that they derived this class of public buildings
from the Etruscans.At Sutrium there is a very noble one cut out of the
tufa rock,[179] which was no doubt used by that people for festal
representations long before Rome attempted anything of the kind.It is
uncertain whether gladiatorial fights or combats of wild beasts formed
any part of the amusements of the arena in those days, though boxing,
wrestling, and contests of that description certainly did; but whether
the Etruscans actually proceeded to the shedding of blood and to
slaughter is more than doubtful.Even in the remotest parts of Britain, in Germany and Gaul, wherever we
find a Roman settlement, we find the traces of their amphitheatres.Their soldiery, it seems, could not exist without the enjoyment of
seeing men engaged in doubtful and mortal combats—either killing one
another, or torn to pieces by wild beasts.It is not to be wondered at
that a people who delighted so much in the bloody scenes of the arena
should feel but very little pleasure in the mimic sorrows and tame
humour of the stage.The brutal exhibition of the amphitheatre fitted
them, it is true, to be a nation of conquerors, and gave them the empire
of the world, but it brought with it feelings singularly inimical to all
the softer arts, and was perhaps the great cause of their ultimate
debasement.Elevation and Section of part of the Flavian
Amphitheatre at Rome.Quarter-plan of the Seats and quarter-plan of the
Basement of the Flavian Amphitheatre.As might be expected, the largest and most splendid of these buildings
is that which adorns the capital; and of all the ruins which Rome
contains, none have excited such universal admiration as the Flavian
Amphitheatre.Poets, painters, rhapsodists, have exhausted all the
resources of their arts in the attempt to convey to others the
overpowering impression this building produces on their own minds.With
the single exception, perhaps, of the Hall at Karnac, no ruin has met
with such universal admiration as this.Its association with the ancient
mistress of the world, its destruction, and the half-prophetic destiny
ascribed to it, all contribute to this.In spite of our better judgment
we are forced to confess that

                 “The gladiators’ bloody circus stands
                 A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,”

and worthy of all or nearly all the admiration of which it has been the
object.Its interior is almost wholly devoid of ornament, or anything
that can be called architecture—a vast inverted pyramid.The exterior
does not possess one detail which is not open to criticism, and indeed
to positive blame.Notwithstanding all this, its magnitude, its form,
and its associations, all combine to produce an effect against which the
critic struggles in vain.Still, all must admit that the pillars and
their entablature are useless and are added incongruously, and that the
upper storey, not being arched like the lower, but solid, and with ugly
pilasters, is a painful blemish.This last defect is so striking that,
in spite of the somewhat dubious evidence of medals, I should feel
inclined to suspect that it was a subsequent addition, and meant wholly
for the purpose of supporting and working the great velarium or awning
that covered the arena during the representation, which may not have
been attempted when the amphitheatre was first erected.Be this as it may, it certainly now very much mars the effect of the
building.The lower storeys are of bad design, but this is worse.But
notwithstanding these defects, there is no building of Rome where the
principle of reduplication of parts, of which the Gothic architects
afterwards made so much use, is carried to so great an extent as in
this.The Colosseum is principally indebted to this feature for the
effect which it produces.Had it, for instance, been designed with only
one storey of the height of the four now existing, and every arch had
consequently been as wide as the present four, the building would have
scarcely appeared half the size it is now seen to be.For all this,
however, when close under it, and comparing it with moving figures and
other objects, we could scarcely eventually fail to realise its
wonderful dimensions.In that case, a true sense of the vast size of the
building would have had to be acquired, as is the case with the façade
of St.Now it forces itself on the mind at the first glance.It
is the repetition of arch beyond arch and storey over storey that leads
the mind on, and gives to this amphitheatre its imposing grandeur, which
all acknowledge, though few give themselves the trouble to inquire how
this effect is produced.Fortunately, too, though the face of the building is much cut up by the
order, the entablatures are unbroken throughout, and cross the building
in long vanishing lines of the most graceful curvatures.The oval, also,
is certainly more favourable for effect than a circular form would be.A
building of this shape may perhaps look smaller than it really is to a
person standing exactly opposite either end; but in all other positions
the flatter side gives a variety and an appearance of size, which the
monotonous equality of a circle would never produce.The length of the building, measured over all along its greatest
diameter, is 620 ft., its breadth 513, or nearly in the ratio of 6 to 5,
which may be taken as the general proportion of these buildings, the
variations from it being slight, and apparently either mistakes in
setting out the work in ancient times, or in measuring it in modern
days, rather than an intentional deviation.The height of the three
lower storeys, or of what I believe to have been the original building,
is 120 ft.; the total height as it now stands is 157 ft.The whole area of
the building has been calculated to contain 250,000 square feet, of
which the arena contains 40,000; then deducting 10,000 for the external
wall, 200,000 square feet will remain available for the audience.If we
divide this by 5,[180] which is the number of square feet it has been
found necessary to allow for each spectator in modern places of
amusement, room will be afforded for 40,000 spectators; at 4 feet, which
is a possible quantity, with continuous seats and the scant drapery of
the Romans, the amphitheatre might contain 50,000 spectators at one
time.The area of the supports has also been calculated at about 40,000 square
feet, or about one-sixth of the whole area; which for an unroofed
edifice of this sort[181] is more than sufficient, though the excess
accounts for the stability of the building.Next in extent to this great metropolitan amphitheatre was that of
Capua; its dimensions were 558 ft.It had three storeys, designed similarly to those of the Colosseum, but
all of the Doric order, and used with more purity than in the Roman
example.Next in age, though not in size, is that at Nîmes, 430 ft.by 378, and
72 in height, in two storeys.Both these storeys are more profusely and
more elegantly ornamented with pillars than those of either of the
amphitheatres mentioned above.The entablature is however broken over
each column, and pediments are introduced on each front.All these
arrangements, though showing more care in design and sufficient elegance
in detail, make this building very inferior in grandeur to the two
earlier edifices, whose simplicity of outline makes up, to a great
extent, for their faults of detail.A more beautiful example than this is that at Verona.high, in three storeys beautifully
proportioned.Here the order almost entirely disappears to make way for
rustication, showing that it must be considerably more modern than
either of the three examples above quoted, though hardly so late as the
time of Maximianus, to whom it is frequently ascribed.[182] The arena of
this amphitheatre is very nearly perfect, owing to the care taken of it
during the Middle Ages, when it was often used for tournaments and other
spectacles; but of its outer architectural enclosure only four bays
remain, sufficient to enable an architect to restore the whole, but not
to allow of its effect being compared with that of more entire examples.The amphitheatre at Pola, which is of about the same age as that of
Verona, and certainly belonging to the last days of the Western Empire,
presents in its ruin a curious contrast to the other.That at Verona has
a perfect arena and only a fragment of its exterior decoration, while
the exterior of Pola is perfect, but not a trace remains of its arena,
or of the seats that surrounded it.This is probably owing to their
having been of wood, and consequently having either decayed or been
burnt.Like that at Verona, it presents all the features of the last
stage of transition; the order is still seen, or rather is everywhere
suggested, but so concealed and kept subordinate that it does not at all
interfere with the general effect.But for these faint traces we should
possess in this amphitheatre one specimen entirely emancipated from
incongruous Grecian forms, but, as before remarked, Rome perished when
just on the threshold of the new style.Elevation of the Amphitheatre at Verona.The dimensions of the amphitheatre at Pola are very nearly the same as
of that at Nîmes, being 436 ft.It has, however, three storeys,
and thus its height is considerably greater, being 97 ft.Owing to the
inequality of the ground on which it is built, the lower storey shows
the peculiarity of a sub-basement, which is very pleasingly managed, and
appears to emancipate it more from conventional forms than is the case
with its contemporary at Verona.The third storey, or attic, is also
more pleasing than elsewhere, as it is avowedly designed for the support
of the masts of the velarium.The pilasters and all Greek forms are
omitted, and there is only a groove over every column of the middle
storey to receive the masts.There is also a curious sort of open
battlement on the top, evidently designed to facilitate the working of
the awning, though in what manner is not quite clear.There is still one
other peculiarity about the building, the curvature of its lines is
broken by four projecting wings, intended apparently to contain
staircases; in a building so light and open as this one is in its
present state there can be no doubt but that the projections give
expression and character to the outline, though such additions would go
far to spoil any of the greater examples above quoted.At Otricoli there is a small amphitheatre, 312 ft.by 230, in two
storeys, from which the order has entirely disappeared; it is therefore
possibly the most modern of its class, but the great flat pilasters that
replace the pillars are ungraceful and somewhat clumsy.Perhaps its
peculiarities ought rather to be looked on as provincialisms than as
genuine specimens of an advanced style.Still there is a pleasing
simplicity about it that on a larger scale would enable it to stand
comparison with some of its greater rivals.Besides these, which are the typical examples of the style, there are
the “Castrense” at Rome, nearly circular, and possessing all the faults
and none of the beauties of the Colosseum; one at Arles, very much
ruined; and a great number of provincial ones, not only in Italy and
Gaul, but in Germany and Britain.Almost all these were principally if
not wholly excavated from the earth, the part above-ground being the
mound formed by the excavation.If they ever possessed any external
decoration to justify their being treated as architectural objects, it
has disappeared, so that in the state at least in which we now find them
they do not belong to the ornamental class of works of which we are at
present treating.Next in splendour to the amphitheatres of the Romans were their great
thermal establishments: in size they were perhaps even more remarkable,
and their erection must certainly have been more costly.The
amphitheatre, however, has the great advantage in an architectural point
of view of being one object, one hall in short, whereas the baths were
composed of a great number of smaller parts, not perhaps very
successfully grouped together.They were wholly built of brick covered
with stucco (except perhaps the pillars), and have, therefore, now so
completely lost their architectural features that it is with difficulty
that even the most practised architect can restore them to anything like
their original appearance.In speaking of the great Thermæ of Imperial Rome, they must not be
confounded with such establishments as that of Pompeii for instance.The
latter was very similar to the baths now found in Cairo or
Constantinople, and indeed in most Eastern cities.These are mere
establishments for the convenience of bathers, consisting generally of
one or two small circular or octagonal halls, covered by domes, and one
or two others of an oblong shape, covered with vaults or wooden roofs,
used as reception-rooms, or places of repose after the bath.These have
never any external magnificence beyond an entrance-porch; and although
those at Pompeii are decorated internally with taste, and are well
worthy of study, their smallness of size and inferiority of design do
not admit of their being placed in the same category as those of the
capital, which are as characteristic of Rome as her amphitheatres, and
are such as could only exist in a capital where the bulk of the people
were able to live on the spoils of the conquered world rather than by
the honest gains of their own industry.Agrippa is said to have built baths immediately behind the Pantheon, and
Palladio and others have attempted restorations of them, assuming that
building to have been the entrance-hall.Nothing, however, can be more
unlikely than that, if he had first built the rotunda as a hall of his
baths, he should afterwards have added the portico, and converted it
from its secular use into a temple dedicated to all the gods.As before remarked, the two parts are certainly not of the same age.If
Agrippa built the rotunda as a part of his baths, the portico was added
a century and a half or two centuries afterwards, and it was then
converted into a temple.If Agrippa built the portico, he added it to a
building belonging to Republican times, which may always have been
dedicated to sacred purposes.As the evidence at present stands, I am
rather inclined to believe the first hypothesis most correctly
represents the facts of the case.[183]

Nero’s baths, too, are a mere heap of shapeless ruins, and those of
Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan in like manner are too much ruined for
their form, or even their dimensions, to be ascertained with anything
like correctness.Those of Titus are more perfect, but the very
discrepancies that exist between the different systems upon which their
restoration has been attempted show that enough does not remain to
enable the task to be accomplished in a satisfactory manner.They owe
their interest more to the beautiful fresco paintings that adorn their
vaults than to their architectural character.These paintings are
invaluable, as being the most extensive and perfect relics of the
painted decoration of the most flourishing period of the Empire, and
give a higher idea of Roman art than other indications would lead us to
expect.The baths of Constantine are also nearly wholly destroyed, so that out
of the great Thermæ two only, those of Diocletian and of Caracalla, now
remain sufficiently perfect to enable a restoration to be made of them
with anything like certainty.Baths of Caracalla, as restored by A.The great hall belonging to the baths of Diocletian is now the Church of
Sta.Maria degli Angeli, and has been considerably altered to suit the
changed circumstances of its use; while the modern buildings attached to
the church have so overlaid the older remains that it is not easy to
follow out the complete plan.This is of less consequence, as both in
dimensions and plan they are extremely similar to those of Caracalla,
which seem to have been among the most magnificent, as they certainly
are the best preserved, of these establishments.[184]

The general plan of the whole enclosure of the baths of Caracalla was a
square of about 1150 ft.each way, with a bold but graceful curvilinear
projection on two sides, containing porticoes, gymnasia, lecture-rooms,
and other halls for exercise of mind or body.In the rear were the
reservoirs to contain the requisite supply of water and below them the
hypocaust or furnace, by which it was warmed with a degree of scientific
skill we hardly give the Romans of that age credit for.Opposite to this
and facing the street was one great portico extending the whole length
of the building, into which opened a range of apartments, meant
apparently to be used as private baths, which extend also some way up
each side.In front of the hypocaust, facing the north-east, was a
semicircus or _theatridium_, 530 ft.long, where youths performed their
exercises or contended for prizes.These parts were, however, merely the accessories of the establishment
surrounding the garden, in which the principal building was placed.by 380, with a projection covered by a dome on
the south-western side, which was 167 ft.There were two small courts (A A) included in the
block, but nearly the whole of the rest appears to have been roofed
over.The modern building which approaches nearest in extent to this is
probably our Parliament Houses.in length, with
an average breadth of about 300, and, with Westminster Hall, cover as
nearly as may be the same area as the central block of these baths.But
there the comparison stops; there is no building of modern times on
anything like the same scale arranged wholly for architectural effect as
this one is, irrespective of any utilitarian purpose.On the other hand,
the whole of the walls being covered with stucco, and almost all the
architecture being expressed in that material, must have detracted
considerably from the monumental grandeur of the effect.Judging,
however, from what remains of the stucco ornament of the roof of the
Maxentian basilica (Woodcut No.202), it is wonderful to observe what
effects may be obtained with even this material in the hands of a people
who understand its employment.While stone and marble have perished, the
stucco of these vaults still remains, and is as impressive as any other
relic of ancient Rome.In the centre was a great hall (B), almost identical in dimensions with
the central aisle of the basilica of Maxentius already described, being
82 ft.wide by 170 in length, and roofed in the same manner by an
intersecting vault in three compartments, springing from eight great
pillars.This opened into a smaller apartment at each end, of
rectangular form, and then again into two other semicircular halls
forming a splendid suite 460 ft.This central room is
generally considered as the _tepidarium_, or warmed apartment, having
four warm baths opening out of it.On the north-east side was the
frigidarium, or cold water bath, a hall[185] of nearly the same
dimensions as the central Hall.Between this and the circular hall (D)
was the sudatorium or sweating-bath, with a hypocaust underneath, and
flue-tiles lining its walls.The laconicum or caldarium (D) is an
immense circular hall, 116 ft.in diameter, also heated by a hypocaust
underneath, and by flue tiles in the walls.This rotunda is said to be
of later date than Caracalla.There are four other rooms on this side,
which seem also to have been cold baths.None of these points have,
however, yet been satisfactorily settled, nor the uses of the smaller
subordinate rooms; every restorer giving them names according to his own
ideas.For our purpose it suffices to know that no groups of state
apartments in such dimensions, and wholly devoted to purposes of display
and recreation, were ever before or since grouped together under one
roof.The taste of many of the decorations would no doubt be faulty, and
the architecture shows those incongruities inseparable from its state of
transition; but such a collection of stately halls must have made up a
whole of greater splendour than we can easily realise from their bare
and weather-beaten ruins, or from anything else to which we can compare
them.Even allowing for their being almost wholly built of brick, and
for their being disfigured by the bad taste inseparable from everything
Roman, there is nothing in the world which for size and grandeur can
compare with these imperial places of recreation.[186]




                               CHAPTER V.

             TRIUMPHAL ARCHES, TOMBS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS.Arches at Rome; in France—Arch at Trèves—Columns of
  Victory—Tombs—Minerva Medica—Provincial tombs—Eastern tombs—Domestic
  architecture—Spalato—Pompeii—Bridges—Aqueducts.Triumphal Arches were among the most peculiar of the various forms of
art which the Romans borrowed from those around them, and used with that
strange mixture of splendour and bad taste which characterises all their
works.(From a plate in
Gailhabaud’s ‘Architecture.’)]

These were in the first instance no doubt borrowed from the Etruscans,
as was also the ceremony of the triumph with which they were ultimately
associated.At first they seem rather to have been used as festal
entrances to the great public roads, the construction of which was
considered one of the most important benefits a ruler could confer upon
his country.There was one erected at Rimini in honour of an important
restoration of the Flaminian way by Augustus; another at Susa in
Piedmont, to commemorate a similar act of the same Emperor.Trajan built
one on the pier at Ancona, when he restored that harbour, and another at
Beneventum, when he repaired the Via Appia, represented in the preceding
woodcut (No.It is one of the best preserved as well as most
graceful of its class in Italy.The Arch of the Sergii at Pola in Istria
seems also to have been erected for a like purpose.That of Hadrian at
Athens, and another built by him at Antinoë in Egypt, were monuments
merely commemorative of the benefits which he had conferred on those
cities by the architectural works he had erected within their walls.By
far the most important application of these gateways, in Rome at least,
was to commemorate a triumph which may have passed along the road over
which the arch was erected, and perhaps in some instances they may have
been erected beforehand, for the triumphal procession to pass through,
and of which they would remain memorials.The Arch of Titus at Rome is well known for the beauty of its detail, as
well as from the extraordinary interest which it derives from having
been erected to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem, and consequently
representing in its bassi-rilievi the spoils of the Temple.From the
annexed elevation, drawn to the usual scale, it will be seen that the
building is not large, and it is not so well proportioned as that at
Beneventum, represented in the preceding woodcut, the attic being
overpoweringly high.The absence of sculpture on each side of the arch
is also a defect, for the real merit of these buildings is their being
used as frameworks for the exhibition of sculptural representations of
the deeds they were erected to commemorate.In the later days of the Empire two side arches were added for
foot-passengers, in addition to the carriage-way in the centre.This
added much to the splendour of the edifice, and gave a greater
opportunity for sculptural decoration than the single arch afforded.The
Arch of Septimius Severus, represented to the same scale in Woodcut No.217, is perhaps the best specimen of the class.That of Constantine is
very similar and in most respects equal to this—a merit which it owes to
most of its sculptures being borrowed from earlier monuments.More splendid than either of these is the Arch at Orange.It is not
known by whom it was erected, or even in what age: it is, however,
certainly very late in the Roman period, and shows a strong tendency to
treat the order as entirely subordinate, and to exalt the plain masses
into that importance which characterises the late transitional period.Unfortunately its sculptures are so much destroyed by time and violence
that it is not easy to speak with certainty as to their age; but more
might be done than has hitherto been effected to illustrate this
important monument.At Rheims there is an arch which was probably much more magnificent than
this.When in a perfect state it was 110 ft.in width, and had three
openings, the central one 17 ft.high, and those on each
side 10 ft.in width, each separated by two Corinthian columns.From the
style of the sculpture it certainly was of the last age of the Roman
Empire, but having been built into the walls of the city, it has been so
much injured that it is difficult to say what its original form may have
been.Besides these there is in France a very elegant single-arched gateway at
St.Rémi, similar to and probably of the same age as that at Beneventum;
another at Cavallon, and one at Carpentras, each with one arch.There is
also one with two similar arches at Langres; and one, the Porta Nigra,
at Besançon, which shows so complete a transition from the Roman style
that it is difficult to believe that it does not belong to the
Renaissance.[187] (From Laborde’s
‘Monumens de la France.’)]

There still remains in France another class of arches, certainly not
triumphal, but so similar to those just mentioned that it is difficult
to separate the one from the other.The most important of these are two
at Autun, called respectively the Porte Arroux and the Porte St.André,
a view of which is given in Woodcut No.Each of these has two
central large archways for carriages, and one on each side for
foot-passengers.Their most remarkable peculiarity is the light arcade
or gallery that runs across the top of them, replacing the attic of the
Roman arch, and giving a degree of lightness combined with height that
those never possessed.These gates were certainly not meant for defence,
and the apartment over them could scarcely be applied to utilitarian
purposes; so that we may, I believe, consider it as a mere ornamental
appendage, or as a balcony for display on festal occasions.It appears,
however, to offer a better hint for modern arch-builders than any other
example of its class.Plan of Porta Nigra at Trèves.View of the Porta Nigra at Trèves.]Even more interesting than these gates at Autun is that called the Porta
Nigra at Trèves; for though far ruder in style and coarser in detail, as
might be expected from the remoteness of the province where it is found,
it is far more complete.Indeed it is the only example of its class
which we possess in anything like its original state.Its front consists
of a double archway surmounted by an arcaded gallery, like the French
examples.Within this is a rectangular court which seems never to have
been roofed, and beyond this a second double archway similar to the
first.At the ends of the court, projecting each way beyond the face of
the gateway and the gallery surmounting it, are two wings four storeys
in height, containing a series of apartments in the form of small
basilicas, all similar to one another, and measuring about 55 ft.It is not easy to understand how these were approached, as there is no
stair and no place for one.Of course there must have been some mode of
access, and perhaps it may have been on the site of the apse, shown in
the plan (Woodcut No.219), which was added when the building was
converted into a church in the Middle Ages.These apartments were
probably originally used as courts or chambers of justice, thus
realising, more nearly than any other European example I am acquainted
with, the idea of a gate of justice.Notwithstanding its defects of detail, there is a variety in the outline
of this building and a boldness of profile that render it an extremely
pleasing example of the style adopted; and though exhibiting many of the
faults incidental to the design of the Colosseum, it possesses all that
repetition of parts and Gothic feeling of design which give such value
to its dimensions, though these are far from being contemptible, the
building being 115 ft.wide by 95 in height to the top of the wings.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There probably were many similar gates of justice in the province, but
all have perished, unless we except those at Autun just described.I am
convinced that at that place there were originally such wings as these
at Trèves, and that the small church, the apse of which is seen on the
right hand (woodcut No.220), stands upon the foundations of one of
these.A slight excavation on the opposite side would settle this point
at once.If it could be proved that these gateways at Autun had such
lateral adjuncts, it would at once explain the use of the gallery over
the arch, which otherwise looks so unmeaning, but would be intelligible
as a passage connecting the two wings together.Another form also is that of an arch at the entrance of a bridge,
generally bearing an inscription commemorative of its building.Its
purpose is thus closely connected with that of the arches before
mentioned, which commemorate the execution of roads.Most of the great
bridges of Italy and Spain were so adorned; but unfortunately they have
either been used as fortifications in the Middle Ages, or removed in
modern times to make room for the increased circulation of traffic.That
built by Trajan on his noble bridge at Alcantara in Spain is well known;
and there exists a double-arched bridge at Saintes, in the south of
France.The most elegant and most perfect specimen, however, of this
class is that of St.Chamas in Provence, represented in woodcut No.It consists of two arches, one at each end of the bridge, of singular
elegance of form and detail.Although it bears a still legible
inscription, it is uncertain to what age it belongs, probably that of
the Antonines: and I would account for the purity of its details by
referring to the Greek element that pervades the south of France.Whether this is so or not, it is impossible not to admire not only the
design of the whole bridge with its two arches, but the elegance with
which the details have been executed.Used in this mode as commencements of roads, or entrances to bridges, or
as festal entrances to unfortified towns, there are perhaps no monuments
of the second class more appropriate or more capable of architectural
expression than these arches, though all of them have been more or less
spoiled by an incongruous order being applied to them.Used, however, as
they were in Rome, as monuments of victory, without offering even an
excuse for a passage through them, the taste displayed in them is more
than questionable: the manner, too, in which they were cut up by broken
cornices and useless columns placed on tall pedestals, with other
trivial details highly objectionable, deprive them of that largeness of
design which is the only true merit and peculiar characteristic of Roman
art, while that exquisite elegance with which the Greeks knew so well
how to dignify even the most trivial objects was in them almost entirely
lost.Columns of Victory are a class of monuments which seem to have been used
in the East in very early times, though their history it must be
confessed is somewhat fragmentary and uncertain, and they seem to have
been adopted by the Romans in those provinces where they had been
employed by the earlier inhabitants.Whatever the original may have
been, the Romans were singularly unsuccessful in their application of
the form.They never, in fact, rose above the idea of taking a column of
construction, magnifying it, and placing it on a pedestal, without any
attempt to modify its details or hide the original utilitarian purpose
for which the column was designed.When they attempted more than this,
they failed entirely in elaborating any new form at all worthy of
admiration.The Columna Rostrata, or that erected to celebrate naval
victories, was, so far as we can judge from representations (for no
perfect specimen exists), one of the ugliest and clumsiest forms of
column it is possible to conceive.Of those of Victory, one of the most celebrated is that erected by
Diocletian at Alexandria.A somewhat similar one exists at Arsinoë,
erected by Alexander Severus; and a third at Mylassa in Caria.All these
are mere Corinthian columns of the usual form, and with the details of
those used to support entablatures in porticoes.However beautiful these
may be in their proper place, they are singularly inappropriate and
ungraceful when used as minarets or single columns.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There are two in Rome not quite so bad as these, both being of the Doric
order.Had the square abacus in these been cut to a round form, and
ornamented with an appropriate railing, we might almost have forgotten
their original, and have fancied that they really were round towers with
balconies at the top.The great object of their erection was to serve as
vehicles for sculpture, though, as we now see them, or as they are
caricatured at Paris and elsewhere, they are little more than instances
of immense labour bestowed to very little purpose.As originally used,
these columns were placed in small courts surrounded by open porticoes,
whence the spectator could at two or perhaps at three different levels
examine the sculpture at his leisure and at a convenient distance, while
the absurdity of the column supporting nothing was not apparent, from
its not being seen from the outside.This arrangement is explained in
woodcut No.200, which is a section through the basilica of Trajan,
showing the position of his column, not only with reference to that
building, but to the surrounding colonnade.The same was almost
certainly the case with the column of Marcus Aurelius, which, with
slight modifications, seems to have been copied from that of Trajan; but
even in the most favourable situations no monuments can be less worthy
of admiration or of being copied than these.A far better specimen of this class is that at Cussi, near Beaune, in
France.It probably belongs to the time of Aurelian, but it is not known
either by whom it was erected or what victory it was designed to
celebrate; still that it is a column of victory seems undoubted; and its
resemblance to columns raised with the same object in India is quite
striking.The arrangement of the base serving as a pedestal for eight statues is
not only elegant but appropriate.The ornament which covers the shaft
takes off from the idea of its being a mere pillar, and at the same time
is so subdued as not to break the outline or interfere with constructive
propriety.Supposed Capital of Column at Cussi.]The capital, of the Corinthian order, is found in the neighbourhood used
as the mouth of a well.In its original position it no doubt had a hole
through it, which being enlarged suggested its application to its
present ignoble purpose, the hole being no doubt intended either to
receive or support the statue or emblem that originally crowned the
monument, but of that no trace now remains.There cannot be a more natural mode of monumental expression than that
of a simple upright stone set up by the victors to commemorate their
prowess and success.Accordingly steles or pillars erected for this
purpose are found everywhere, and take shapes as various as the
countries where they stand or the people who erected them.In Northern
Europe they are known as Cath or battle-stones, and as rude unhewn
monoliths are found everywhere.In India they are as elegant and as
elaborately adorned as the Kutub Minar at Delhi, but nowhere was their
true architectural expression so mistaken as in Rome.There, by
perverting a feature designed for one purpose to a totally different
use, an example of bad taste was given till then unknown, though in our
days it has become not uncommon.In that strange collection of the styles of all nations which mingled
together makes up the sum of Roman art, nothing strikes the
architectural student with more astonishment than the number and
importance of their tombs.If the Romans are of Aryan origin, as is
generally assumed, they are the only people of that race among whom
tomb-building was not utterly neglected.The importance of the tombs
among the Roman remains proves one of two things.Either a considerable
proportion of Etruscan blood was mixed up with that of the dominant race
in Rome, or that the fierce and inartistic Romans, having no art of
their own, were led blindly to copy that of the people among whom they
were located.Of the tombs of Consular Rome nothing remains except perhaps the
sarcophagus of Scipio; and it is only on the eve of the Empire that we
meet with the well-known one of Cæcilia Metella, the wife of Crassus,
which is not only the best specimen of a Roman tomb now remaining to us,
but the oldest architectural building of the imperial city of which we
have an authentic date.It consists of a bold square basement about 100
ft.square, which was originally ornamented in some manner not now
intelligible.From this rose a circular tower about 94 ft.in diameter,
of very bold masonry, surmounted by a frieze of ox-skulls with wreaths
joining them, and a well-profiled cornice: two or three courses of
masonry above this seem to have belonged to the original work; and above
this, almost certainly, in the original design rose a conical roof,
which has perished.The tower having been used as a fortress in the
Middle Ages, battlements have been added to supply the place of the
roof, and it has been otherwise disfigured, so as to detract much from
its beauty as now seen.Still we have no tomb of the same importance so
perfect, nor one which enables us to connect the Roman tombs so nearly
with the Etruscan.The only addition in this instance is that of the
square basement or podium, though even this was not unknown at a much
earlier period, as for instance in the tomb of Aruns (Woodcut No.The exaggerated height of the circular base is also remarkable.Here it
rises to be a tower instead of a mere circular base of stones for the
earthen cone of the original sepulchre.The stone roof which probably
surmounted the tower was a mere reproduction of the original earthen
cone.Tomb of Cæcilia Metella.]Next in age and importance was the tomb of Augustus in the Campus
Martius.It is now so completely ruined that it is extremely difficult
to make out its plan, and those who drew and restored it in former days
were so careless in their measurements that even its dimensions cannot
be ascertained; it appears, however, to have consisted of a circular
basement about 300 ft.in height, adorned
with 12 large niches.Above this rose a cone of earth as in the Etruscan
tombs, not smooth like those, but divided into terraces, which were
planted with trees.We also learn from Suetonius that Augustus laid out
the grounds around his tomb and planted them with gardens for public use
during his lifetime.More like the practice of a true Mogul in the East
than the ruler of an Indo-Germanic people in Europe.This tomb, however, was far surpassed, not only in solidity but in
splendour, by that which Hadrian erected for himself on the banks of the
Tiber, now known as the Mole of Hadrian, or more frequently the Castle
of St.The basement of this great tomb was a square, about 340
ft.Above this rose a circular tower 235
ft.The whole was crowned either by a
dome or by a conical roof in steps, which, with its central ornament,
must have risen to a height of not less than 300 ft.The circular or
tower-like part of this splendid building was ornamented with columns,
but in what manner restorers have not been quite able to agree; some
making two storeys, both with pillars, some, one of pillars and the
upper one of pilasters.It would require more correct measurements than
we have to enable us to settle this point, but it seems probable that
there was only one range of columns on a circular basement of some
height surmounted by an attic of at least equal dimensions.The order
might have been 70 ft., the base and attic 35 ft.Internally the mass was nearly solid, there being only one sepulchral
apartment, as nearly as may be in the centre of the mass, approached by
an inclined plane, winding round the whole building, from the entrance
in the centre of the river face.Besides these there was another class of tombs in Rome, called
columbaria, generally oblong or square rooms below the level of the
ground, the walls of which were pierced with a great number of little
pigeon-holes or cells just of sufficient size to receive an urn
containing the ashes of the body, which had been burnt according to the
usual Roman mode of disposing of the dead.Externally of course they had
no architecture, though some of the more important family sepulchres of
this class were adorned internally with pilasters and painted ornaments
of considerable beauty.In the earlier ages of the Roman Empire these two forms of tombs
characterised with sufficient clearness the two races, each with their
distinctive customs, which made up the population of Rome.Long before
its expiration the two were fused together so thoroughly that we lose
all trace of the distinction, and a new form of tomb arose compounded of
the two older, which became the typical form with the early Christians,
and from them passed to the Saracens and other Eastern nations.The new form of tomb retained externally the circular form of the
Pelasgic sepulchre, though constructive necessities afterwards caused it
to become polygonal.Instead however of being solid, or nearly so, the
walls were only so thick as was necessary to support the dome, which
became the universal form of roof of these buildings.The sepulchres of Rome have as yet been far too carelessly examined to
enable us to trace all the steps by which the transformation took place,
but as a general rule it may be stated that the gradual enlargement of
the central circular apartment is almost a certain test of the age of a
tomb; till at last, before the age of Constantine, they became in fact
representations of the Pantheon on a small scale, almost always with a
crypt or circular vault below the principal apartment.Section of Sepulchre at San Vito.One of the most curious transitional specimens is that found near San
Vito, represented in Woodcut No.Here, as in all the earlier
specimens, the principal apartment is the lower, in the square basement.The upper, which has lost its decoration, has the appearance of having
been hollowed out of the frustum of a gigantic Doric column, or rather
out of a solid tower like the central one of the Tomb of Aruns (Woodcut
No.Shortly after the age of this sepulchre the lower apartment
became a mere crypt, and in such examples as those of the sepulchres of
the Cornelia and Tossia families we have merely miniature Pantheons
somewhat taller in proportion, and with a crypt.This is still more
remarkable in a building called the Torre dei Schiavi, which has had a
portico attached to one side, and in other respects looks very like a
direct imitation of that celebrated temple.It seems certainly, however,
to have been built for a tomb.Another tomb, very similar to that of the Tossia family, is called that
of Sta.If it is not hers, it belongs
at any rate to the last days of the Empire, and may be taken as a fair
specimen of the tombs of that age and class.It is a vast transition
from the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, though, like all the changes
introduced by the Romans, it shows the never-failing tendency to
transfer all architectural embellishments from the exterior to the
interior of every style of building.On
this stands a circular tower in two storeys.In the lower storey is a
circular apartment about 66 ft.in diameter, surrounded by eight niches;
in the upper the niches are external, and each is pierced with a window.The dimensions of the tomb are nearly the same as those of Cæcilia
Metella, and it thus affords an excellent opportunity of comparing the
two extremes of the series, and of contrasting the early Roman with the
early Christian tomb.The typical example of a sepulchre of this age is the tomb or baptistery
of Sta.Costanza, the daughter of Constantine (Woodcut No.In this
building the pillars that adorned the exterior of such a mausoleum, for
instance, as that of Hadrian, are introduced internally.Externally the
building never can have had much ornament.But the breaks between the
lower aisle and the central compartment, pierced with the clerestory,
must have had a very pleasing effect.In this example there is still
shown a certain degree of timidity, which does not afterwards reappear.The columns are coupled and are far more numerous than they need have
been, and are united by a fragment of an entablature, as if the
architect had been afraid to place his vault directly on the capitals.Notwithstanding these defects, it is a pleasing and singularly
instructive example of a completed transformation, and is just what we
miss in those secular buildings for which the Christians had no use.Another building, which is now known as the Lateran Baptistery (Woodcut
No.422), was also undoubtedly a place of sepulture.Its erection is
generally ascribed to Constantine, and it is said was intended by him to
be the place of his own sepulture.Whether this is correct or not, it
certainly belongs to his age, and exhibits all the characteristics of
the architecture of his time.Here the central apartment, never having
been designed to support a dome, is of a far lighter construction, an
upper order of pillars being placed on the lower, with merely a slight
architrave and frieze running between the two orders, the external walls
being slight in construction and octagonal in plan.[188] We must not in
this place pursue any further the subject of the transition of style, as
we have already trespassed within the pale of Christian architecture and
passed beyond the limits of Heathen art.So gradual, however, was the
change, and so long in preparation, that it is impossible to draw the
line exactly where the separation actually took place between the two.TEMPLE OF MINERVA MEDICA.One important building remains to be mentioned before leaving this part
of the subject.It commonly goes by the name of the Temple of Minerva
Medica, though this is certainly a misnomer.[189] Recently it has become
the fashion to assume that it was the hall of some bath; no building of
that class, however, was known to exist in the neighbourhood, and it is
extremely improbable that any should be found outside the Servian walls
in this direction; moreover, it is wanting in all the necessary
accompaniments of such an establishment.It is here placed with the tombs, because its site is one that would
justify its being so classed, and its form being just such as would be
applicable to that purpose and to no other.It is not by any means
certain, however, that it is a tomb, though there does not seem to be
any more probable supposition.It certainly belongs to the last days of
the Roman Empire, if indeed it be not a Christian building, which I am
very much inclined to believe it is, for, on comparing it with the
Baptistery of Constantine and the tomb of Sta.Costanza, it shows a
considerable advance in construction on both these buildings, and a
greater similarity to San Vitale at Ravenna, and other buildings of
Justinian’s time, than to anything else now found in Rome.As will be seen from the plan and section (Woodcuts Nos.228 and 229),
it has a dome, 80 ft.in diameter, resting on a decagon of singularly
light and elegant construction.Nine of the compartments contain niches
which give great room on the floor, as well as great variety and
lightness to the general design.Above this is a clerestory of ten
well-proportioned windows, which give light to the building, perhaps not
in so effective a manner as the one eye of the Pantheon, though by a far
more convenient arrangement, to protect from the elements a people who
did not possess glass.So far as I know, all the domed buildings erected
by the Romans up to the time of Constantine, and indeed long afterwards,
were circular in the interior, though, like the temple built by
Diocletian at Spalato, they were sometimes octagonal externally.This,
however, is a Polygon both internally and on the outside, and the mode
in which the dome is placed on the polygon shows the first rudiments of
the pendentive system, which was afterwards carried to such perfection
by the Byzantine architects, but is nowhere else to be found in Rome.It
probably was for the purpose of somewhat diminishing the difficulties of
this construction that the architect adopted a figure with ten instead
of eight sides.Plan of Minerva Medica at Rome, as restored in
Isabelle’s ‘Édifices Circulaires,’ on the theory of its being a Bath.Section of Minerva Medica (from Isabelle.)Rib of the Roof of the Minerva Medica at Rome.]This, too, is, I believe, the first building in which buttresses are
applied so as to give strength to the walls exactly at the point where
it is most wanted.By this arrangement the architect was enabled to
dispense with nearly one-half the quantity of material that was thought
necessary when the dome of the Pantheon was constructed, and which he
must have employed had he copied that building.Besides this, the dome
was ribbed with tiles, as shown in Woodcut No.230, and the space
between the ribs filled in with inferior, perhaps lighter masonry,
bonded together at certain heights by horizontal courses of tiles where
necessary.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

Besides the lightness and variety which the base of this building
derives from the niches, it is 10 ft.higher than its diameter, which
gives to it that proportion of height to width, the want of which is the
principal defect of the Pantheon.It is not known what the side
erections are which are usually shown in the ground-plans, nor even
whether they are coeval with the main central edifice.I suspect they
have never been very correctly laid down.Taking it altogether, the building is certainly, both as concerns
construction and proportion, by far the most scientific of all those in
ancient Rome, and in these respects as far superior to the Pantheon as
it is inferior to that temple in size.Indeed there are few inventions
of the Middle Ages that are not attempted here or in the Temple of
Peace—but more in this than in the latter; so much so, indeed, that I
cannot help believing that it is much more modern than is generally
supposed.As might be expected from our knowledge of the race that inhabited the
European provinces of the Roman Empire, there are very few specimens of
tombs of any importance to be found in them.One very beautiful example
exists at St.Rémi, represented in the annexed woodcut (No.It can
hardly, however, be correctly called a tomb, but is rather a cenotaph or
a monument, erected as the inscription on it tells us, by Sextus and
Marcus, of the family of the Julii, to their parents, whose statues
appear under the dome of the upper storey.There is nothing funereal
either in the inscription or the form, nor anything to lead us to
suppose that the bodies of the parents repose beneath its foundation.The lower portion of this monument is the square basement which the
Romans always added to the Etruscan form of tomb.Upon this stands a
storey pierced with an archway in each face, with a three-quarter pillar
of the Corinthian order at every angle.The highest part is a circular
colonnade, a miniature copy of that which we know to have once encircled
Hadrian’s Mole.The open arrangement of the arches and colonnade, while it takes off
considerably from the tomb-like simplicity appropriate to such
buildings, adds very much to the lightness and elegance of the whole.Altogether the building has much more of the aspiring character of
Christian art than of the more solid and horizontal forms which were
characteristic of the style then dying out.Another monument of very singular and exceptional form is found at Igel,
near Trèves, in Germany.It is so unlike anything found in Italy, or
indeed anything of the Roman age, that were its date not perfectly known
from the inscription upon it, one might rather be inclined to ascribe it
to the age of Francis I. than to the latter days of the Roman Empire.The form is graceful, though the pilasters and architectural ornaments
seem somewhat misplaced.It is covered with sculptures from top to
bottom.These, however, as is generally the case with Roman funereal
monuments, have no reference to death, nor to the life or actions of the
person to whom the monument is sacred, but are more like the scenes
painted on a wall or ornamental stele anywhere.The principal object on
the face represented in the woodcut is the sun, but the subjects are
varied on each face, and, though much time-worn, they still give a very
perfect idea of the rich ornamentation of the monuments of the last age
of the Empire.Monument at Igel, near Trèves.(From Schmidt’s
‘Antiquities of Trèves.’)]

The Tour Magne at Nîmes is too important a monument to be passed over,
though in its present ruined state it is almost more difficult to
explain than any other Roman remains that have reached our times.It
consists of an octagonal tower 50 ft.The basement is extended beyond this tower on every side by a
series of arches supporting a terrace to which access was obtained by an
external flight of steps, or rather an inclined plane.From the marks in
the walls it seems evident that this terrace originally supported a
peristyle, or, possibly, a range of chambers.Within the basement is a
great chamber covered by a dome of rubble masonry, to which no access
could be obtained from without, but the interior may have been reached
through the eye of the dome.From the terrace an important flight of
steps led upwards to—what?It is almost impossible to refrain from
answering, to a cella, like those which crowned the tomb temples of
Assyria.That the main object of the building was sepulchral seems
hardly doubtful, but we have no other instance in Europe of a tomb with
such a staircase leading to a chamber above it.That Marseilles was a Phœnician and then a Phocian colony long before
Roman times seems generally to be admitted, and that in the Temple of
Diana (Woodcuts Nos.188 and 189) and in this building there is an
Etruscan or Eastern element which can hardly be mistaken, and may lead
to very important ethnographical indications when more fully
investigated and better understood.This scarcity of tombs in the western part of the Roman Empire is to a
great extent made up for in the East; but the history of those erected
under the Roman rule in that part of the world is as yet so little known
that it is not easy either to classify or to describe them; and as
nearly all those which have been preserved are cut in the rock, it is
sometimes difficult—as with other rock-cut objects all over the world—to
understand the form of building from which they were copied.The three principal groups of tombs of the Roman epoch are those of
Petra, Cyrene, and Jerusalem.Though many other important tombs exist in
those countries, they are so little known that they must be passed over
for the present.From the time when Abraham was laid in the cave of Machpelah until after
the Christian era, we know that burying in the rock was not the
exception but the general practice among the nations of this part of the
East.So far as can be known, the example was set by Egypt, which was
the parent of much of their civilisation.In Egypt the façades of their
rock-cut tombs were—with the solitary exception of those of Beni
Hasan[190]—ornamented so simply and unobtrusively as rather to belie
than to announce their internal magnificence.All the oldest Asiatic
tombs seem to have been mere holes in the rock, wholly without
architectural decorations.(From Laborde’s ‘Petra and Mount Sinai.’)]

We have seen, however, how the Persian kings copied their palace façades
to adorn their last resting-places, and how about the same time in Lycia
the tomb-builders copied, first their own wooden structures, and
afterwards the architectural façades which they had learned from the
Greeks how to construct.But it was not till the Roman period that this
species of magnificence extended to the places enumerated above; when to
such an extent did it prevail at Petra as to give to that now deserted
valley the appearance of a petrified city of the dead.The typical and most beautiful tomb of this place is that called the
Khasné or Treasury of Pharaoh—represented in elevation and section in
the annexed woodcuts, Nos.As will be seen, it consists of
a square basement, adorned with a portico of four very beautiful
Corinthian pillars, surmounted by a pediment of low Grecian pitch.Above
this are three very singular turrets, the use and application of which
it is extremely difficult to understand.The central one is circular,
and is of a well-understood sepulchral form, the use of which, had it
been more important, or had it stood alone, would have been intelligible
enough; but what are the side turrets?If one might hazard so bold a
conjecture, I would suggest that the original from which this is derived
was a five-turreted tomb, like that of Aruns (Woodcut No.176), or that
of Alyattes at Sardis, which in course of time became translated into so
foreign a shape as this; but where are the intermediate forms?and by
whom and when was this change effected?Before forming any theories on
this subject, it will be well to consider whether all these buildings
really are tombs.Most of them undoubtedly are so; but may not the name
_el Deir_, or the Convent, applied by the Arabs to one of the principal
rock-cut monuments of Petra, be after all the true designation?Are none
of them, in short, cells for priests, like the _viharas_ found in India?All who have hitherto visited these spots have assumed at once that
everything cut in the rock must be a tomb, but I am much mistaken if
this is really the case with all.(From Laborde’s ‘Mount
Sinai,’ p.To return, however, to the Khasné.Though all the forms of the
architecture are Roman, the details are so elegant and generally so well
designed as almost to lead to the suspicion that there must have been
some Grecian influence brought to bear upon the work.The masses of rock
left above the wings show how early a specimen of its class it is, and
how little practice its designers could have had in copying in the rock
the forms of their regular buildings.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’ p.A little further within the city is found another very similar in design
to this, but far inferior to it in detail and execution, and showing at
least a century of degradation, though at the same time presenting an
adaptation to rock-cut forms not found in the earlier examples.A third is that above alluded to, called _el Deir_.This is the same in
general outline as the two former—of an order neither Greek nor Roman,
but with something like a Doric frieze over a very plain Corinthian
capital.In other respects it presents no new feature except the
apparent absence of a door, and on the whole it seems, if finished, to
deserve its name less than either of the other two.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’
p.Perhaps the most singular object among these tombs, if tombs they are,
is the flat façade with three storeys of pillars one over the
other—slightly indicated on the left of the Corinthian tomb in Woodcut
No.It is like the proscenium of some of the more recent Greek
theatres.If it was really the frontispiece to a tomb, it was totally
unsuitable to the purpose, and is certainly one of the most complete
misapplications of Greek architecture ever made.Generally speaking, the interiors of these buildings are so plain that
travellers have not cared either to draw or measure them; one, however,
represented in the annexed woodcut (No.236), is richly ornamented, and,
as far as can be judged from what is published, is as unlike a tomb as
it is like a _vihara_.But, as before remarked, they all require
re-examination before the purpose for which they were cut can be
pronounced upon with any certainty.Façade of Herod’s Tombs, from a Photograph.]The next group of tombs is that at Jerusalem.These are undoubtedly all
sepulchres.By far the greater number of them are wholly devoid of
architectural ornament.To the north of the city is a group known as the
Tombs of the Kings, with a façade of a corrupt Doric order, similar to
some of the latest Etruscan tombs.[191] These are now very much ruined,
but still retain sufficient traces of the original design to fix their
date within or subsequently to the Herodian period without much
possibility of doubt.A somewhat similar façade, but of a form more like
the Greek Doric, found in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, bears the name of
the Sepulchre of St.So-called “Tomb of Zechariah.”]

Close to this is a square tomb, known as that of Zechariah, cut in the
rock, but standing free.Each face is adorned with Ionic pillars and
square piers at the angles, the whole being crowned with a pyramidal
roof.Perhaps this building should properly be called a cenotaph, as it
is perfectly solid, and no cave or sepulchral vault has been found
beneath it, though judging from analogies one might yet be found if
properly looked for.A tomb with an architectural façade, similar to
that of the so-called Tomb of the Judges, does exist behind it cut in
rock, and is consequently of more modern construction.It may be to mark
this that the architectural monolith was left.Close to this is another identical with it in as far as the basement is
concerned, and which is now popularly known as the Tomb of Absalom; but
in this instance the pyramid has been replaced with a structural spire,
and it is probable when this was done that the chamber which now exists
in its interior was excavated.The so-called Tomb of Absalom.]One of the remarkable points in these tombs is the curious jumble of the
Roman orders which they present.The pillars and pilasters are Ionic,
the architraves and frieze Doric, and the cornice Egyptian.The capitals
and frieze are so distinctly late Roman, that we can feel no hesitation
as to their date being either of the age of Herod or subsequent to that
time.In an architectural point of view the cornice is too plain to be
pleasing if not painted; it probably therefore was so treated.Another class of these tombs is represented by the so-called Tomb of the
Judges (Woodcut No.These are ornamented by a tympanum of a Greek
or Roman temple filled with a scroll-work of rich but debased pattern,
and is evidently derived from something similar, though Grecian in
design.In age it is certainly more recent than the so-called Tomb of
Zechariah, as one of precisely similar design is found cut into the face
of the rock out of which that monument was excavated.Façade of the Tomb of the Judges.]The third group is that of Cyrene, on the African coast.Notwithstanding
the researches of Admiral Beechey and of M. Pacho,[192] and the still
more recent explorations of Messrs.Smith and Porcher, above referred to
(p.285), they are still much less perfectly known to us than they
should be.Their number is immense, and they almost all have
architectural façades, generally consisting of two or more columns
between pilasters, like the grottoes of Beni-Hasan, or the Tomb of St.Many of them show powerful evidence of Greek taste,
while some may be as old as the Grecian era, though the greater part are
undoubtedly of Roman date, and the paintings with which many of them are
still adorned are certainly Roman in design.Two of them are illustrated
by Woodcuts Nos.165 and 166: one as showing more distinct evidence of
Greek taste and colour than is to be found elsewhere, though it is
doubtful if it belongs to the Grecian period any more than the so-called
Tomb of St.James at Jerusalem; the other, though of equally uncertain
date, is interesting as being a circular monument built over a cave like
that at Amrith (Woodcut No.122), and is the only other example now
known.None of them have such splendid architectural façades as the
Khasné at Petra; but the number of tombs which are adorned with
architectural features is greater than in that city, and, grouped as
they are together in terraces on the hill-side, they constitute a
necropolis which is among the most striking of the ancient world.Altogether this group, though somewhat resembling that at Castel d’Asso,
is more extensive and far richer in external architecture.[193]


Time has not left us any perfect structural tombs in all these places,
though there can be little doubt but they were once numerous.Almost the
only tomb of this class constructed in masonry known to exist, and which
in many respects is perhaps the most interesting of all, is found in
Asia Minor, at Mylassa in Caria.In form it is something like the
free-standing rock-cut examples at Jerusalem.As shown in the woodcut
(No.242), it consists of a square base, which supports twelve columns,
of which the eight inner ones support a dome, the outer four merely
completing the square.The dome itself is constructed in the same manner
as all the Jaina domes are in India (as will be explained hereafter when
describing that style), and, though ornamented with Roman details, is so
unlike anything else ever built by that people, and is so completely and
perfectly what we find reappearing ten centuries afterwards in the far
East, that we are forced to conclude that it belongs to a style once
prevalent and long fixed in these lands, though this one now stands as
the sole remaining representative of its class.(From ‘Antiquities of Ionia,’
published by the Dilettanti Society.)]Another example, somewhat similar in style, though remotely distant in
locality, is found at Dugga, near Tunis, in Africa.This, too, consists
of a square base, taller than in the last example, surmounted by twelve
Ionic columns, which are here merely used as ornaments.There were
probably square pilasters at the angles, like that at Jerusalem
(Woodcuts Nos.238, 239), while the Egyptian form of the cornice is
similar to that found in these examples, though with the omission of the
Doric frieze.It apparently originally terminated in a pyramid of steps like the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and a large number of structural tombs which
copied that celebrated model.Nothing of this now remains but the four
corner-stones, which were architecturally most essential to accentuate
the weak lines of a sloping pyramid in such a situation.Taken
altogether, perhaps no more graceful monument of its class has come down
to our days than this must have been when complete.Besides these there are in Algeria two tombs of very great interest,
both from their size and the peculiarity of their forms.The best known
is that on the coast a short distance from Algiers to the westward.It
is generally known as the Kubr Roumeïa, or Tomb of the Christian
Virgin—a name it acquired from its having four false doors, each of a
single stone divided into four panels, and the stile between them
forming a cross, which has consequently been assumed to be the Christian
symbol.The building itself, which is circular, and as nearly as may be
200 ft.in diameter, stands on a square platform measuring 210 ft.The
perpendicular part is ornamented by 60 engaged columns of the Ionic
order, and by the four false doors just mentioned; above this rose a
cone—apparently in 40 steps—making the total height about 130 ft.It is,
however, so ruined that it is very difficult to feel sure about its
exact dimensions or form.Plan of the Kubr Roumeïa.(From a plate in Blakesley’s ‘Four
Months in Algeria.’)]

From objects and scribblings of various kinds found in the interior, it
appears to have remained open till nearly the time of the Moslem
conquest, but shortly afterwards to have been closed, and to have defied
all the ingenuity of explorers till a passage was forced in 1866 by
Messrs.MacCarthy and Berbrugger, acting under the orders and at the
expense of the late Emperor Napoleon III.[194] The entrance was found
passing under the sill of the false door on the east from a detached
building standing outside the platform, and which seems to have been
originally constructed to cover and protect the entrance.From this a
winding passage, 560 ft.in length, led to the central chamber where it
is assumed the royal bodies were once deposited, but when opened no
trace of them remained, nor anything to indicate who they were, nor in
what manner they were buried.The other tomb, the Madracen, is very similar to this one, but smaller.Its peristyle is of a sort of Doric order, without bases, and surmounted
by a quasi-Egyptian cornice, not unlike that on the Tomb of Absalom at
Jerusalem (Woodcut No.240), or that at Dugga (Woodcut No.Altogether its details are more elegant, and from their general
character there seems no reason for doubting that this tomb is older
than the Kubr Roumeïa, though they are so similar to each other that
their dates cannot be far distant.[195]

There seems almost no reason for doubting that the Kubr Roumeïa was the
“Monumentum commune Regiæ gentis” mentioned by Pomponius Mela,[196]
about the middle of the first century of our era, and if so, this could
only apply to the dynasty that expired with Juba II., A.D.23, and in
that case the older monument most probably belonged to the previous
dynasty, which ceased to reign with Bocchus III., 33 years before the
birth of Christ.One of the most interesting points connected with these Mauritanian
tombs is their curious similarity to that of Hadrian at Rome.The square
base, the circular colonnade, the conical roof, are all the same.At
Rome they are very much drawn out, of course, but that arose from the
“Mole” being situated among tall objects in a town, and more than even
that, perhaps, from the tendency towards height which manifested itself
so strongly in the architecture of that age.The greatest similarity, however, exists in the interior.The long
winding corridor terminating in an oblong apartment in the centre is an
identical feature in both, but has not yet been traced elsewhere, though
it can be hardly doubted that it must have existed in many other
examples.If we add to these the cenotaph at St.231), we have a
series of monuments of the same type extending over 400 years; and,
though many more are wanted before we can fill up the gaps and complete
the series, there can be little doubt that the missing links once
existed which connected them together.Beyond this we may go still
further back to the Etruscan tumuli and the simple mounds of earth on
the Tartar steppes.At the other end of the series we are evidently
approaching the verge of the towers and steeples of Christian art; and,
though it may seem the wildest of hypotheses to assert that the design
of the spire of Strasbourg grew out of the mound of Alyattes, it is
nevertheless true, and it is only non-apparent because so many of the
steps in the progress from the one to the other have disappeared in the
convulsions of the interval.We know, not only from the descriptions and incidental notices that have
come down to us, but also from the remains found at Pompeii and
elsewhere, that the private dwellings of the Romans were characterised
by that magnificence and splendour which we find in all their works,
accompanied, probably, with more than the usual amount of bad taste.In Rome itself no ancient house—indeed no trace of a domestic
edifice—exists except the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine Mount,
and the house of the Vestal Virgins[197] at its foot; and these even are
now a congeries of shapeless ruins, so completely destroyed as to make
it difficult even for the most imaginative of restorers to make much of
them.The extent of these ruins, however, coupled with the descriptions
that have been preserved, suffice to convince us that, of all the
palaces ever built, either in the East or the West, these were probably
the most magnificent and the most gorgeously adorned.Never in the
world’s history does it appear that so much wealth and power were at the
command of one man as was the case with the Cæsars; and never could the
world’s wealth have fallen into the hands of men more inclined to lavish
it for their own personal gratification than these emperors were.They
could, moreover, ransack the whole world for plunder to adorn their
buildings, and could command the best artists of Greece, and of all the
subject kingdoms, to assist in rendering their golden palaces the most
gorgeous that the world had then seen, or is likely soon to see again.The whole area of the palace may roughly be described as a square
platform measuring 1500 ft.east and west, with a mean breadth of 1300
ft.Owing, however, to its deeply indented
and irregular outline, it hardly covers more ground than the Baths of
Caracalla.Recent excavations have laid bare nearly the whole of the western
portion of this area, and have disclosed the plan of the building, but
all has been so completely destroyed that it requires considerable skill
and imagination to reinstate it in its previous form.The one part that
remains tolerably perfect is the so-called house of Livia the wife of
Augustus, who is said to have lived in it after the death of her
husband.In dimensions and arrangement it is not unlike the best class
of Pompeian houses, but its paintings and decorations are very superior
to anything found in that city.They are, in fact, as might be expected
from their age and position, the finest mural decorations that have come
down to us, and as they are still wonderfully perfect, they give a very
high idea of the perfection of art attained in the Augustan age, to
which they certainly belong.That part of the palace on the Palatine which most impresses the visitor
is the eastern half, which looks on one hand to the Amphitheatre, on the
other to the Baths of Caracalla, and overhangs the Circus Maximius.Though all their marble or painted decorations are gone, the enormous
masses of masonry which here exist convey that impression of grandeur
which is generally found in Roman works.It is not of Æsthetic beauty
arising from ornamental or ornamented construction, but the Technic
expression of power and greatness arising from mass and stability.It is
the same feeling with which we contemplate the aqueducts and engineering
works of this great people; and, though not of the highest class, few
scenes of architectural grandeur are more impressive than the now ruined
Palace of the Cæsars.Notwithstanding all this splendour, this palace was probably as an
architectural object inferior to the Thermæ.The thousand and one
exigencies of private life render it impossible to impart to a
residence—even to that of the world’s master—the same character of
grandeur as may be given to a building wholly devoted to show and public
purposes.In its glory the Palace of the Cæsars must have been the
world’s wonder; but as a ruin deprived of its furniture and ephemeral
splendour, it loses much that would tend to make it either pleasing or
instructive.We must not look for either beauty of proportion or
perfection of construction, or even for appropriateness of material, in
the hastily constructed halls of men whose unbounded power was only
equalled by the coarse vulgarity of their characters.The only palace of the Roman world of which sufficient remains are still
left to enable us to judge either of its extent or arrangements is that
which Diocletian built for himself at Spalato, in Dalmatia, and in which
he spent the remaining years of his life, after shaking off the cares of
Empire.It certainly gives us a most exalted idea of what the splendour
of the imperial palace at Rome must have been when we find one
emperor—certainly neither the richest nor the most powerful—building,
for his retirement, a villa in the country of almost exactly the same
dimensions as the Escurial in Spain, and consequently surpassing in
size, as it did in magnificence, most of the modern palaces of Europe.It is uncertain how far it resembles or was copied from that in Rome,
more especially as it must be regarded as a fortified palace, which
there is no reason to believe that at Rome was, while its model would
seem to have been the prætorian camp rather than any habitation built
within the protection of the city walls.In consequence of this its
exterior is plain and solid, except on the side next the sea, where it
was least liable to attack.The other three sides are only broken by the
towers that flank them, and by those that defend the great gates which
open in the centre of each face.Palace of Diocletian at Spalato.The building is nearly a regular parallelogram, though not quite so.The
south side is that facing the sea, and is 592 ft.from angle to angle;
the one opposite being only 570 in length;[198] while the east and west
sides measure each 698 ft., the whole building thus covering about 9½
English acres.The principal entrance to the palace is on the north, and is called the
Golden Gate, and, as represented in the annexed woodcut (No.247), shows
all the peculiarities of Roman architecture in its last stage.The
horizontal architrave still remains over the doorway, a useless
ornament, under a bold discharging arch, which usurps its place and does
its duty.Above this, a row of Corinthian columns, standing on brackets,
once supported the archivolts of a range of niches—a piece of pleasing
decoration, it must be confessed, but one in which the original purpose
of the column has been entirely overlooked or forgotten.Entering this portal, we pass along a street ornamented with arcades on
either side, till exactly in the centre of the building this is crossed
at right angles by another similar street, proceeding from the so-called
Iron and Brazen Gates, which are similar to the Golden Gate in design,
but are far less richly ornamented.These streets divided the building into four portions: those to the
north are so much ruined that it is not now easy to trace their plan, or
to say to what purpose they were dedicated; but probably the one might
have been the lodgings of the guests, the other the residence of the
principal officers of the household.The whole of the southern half of the building was devoted to the palace
properly so called.It contained two temples, as they are now
designated.That on the right is said to have been dedicated to Jupiter,
though, judging from its form, it would appear to have been designed
rather as the mausoleum of the founder than as a temple of that god.On
the assumption that it was a temple it has been illustrated at a
previous page.[199] Opposite to it is another small temple, dedicated,
it is said, to Æsculapius.Between these two is the arcade represented in Woodcut No.185, at the
upper end of which is the vestibule—circular, as all buildings dedicated
to Vesta, or taking their name from that goddess, should be.This opened
directly on to a magnificent suite of nine apartments, occupying the
principal part of the south front of the palace.Beyond these, on the
right hand, were the private apartments of the emperor, and behind them
his baths.The opposite side is restored as if it exactly corresponded,
but this is more than doubtful; and, indeed, there is scarcely
sufficient authority for many of the details shown in the plan, though
they are, probably, on the whole, sufficiently exact to convey a general
idea of the arrangements of a Roman imperial palace.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia.’)]

Perhaps, however, the most splendid feature in this palace was the great
southern gallery, 515 ft.in length by 24 in width, extending along the
whole seaward face of the building.Besides its own intrinsic beauty as
an architectural feature, it evinces an appreciation of the beauties of
nature which one would hardly expect in a Roman.This great arcade is
the principal feature in the whole design, and commands a view well
worthy the erection of such a gallery for its complete enjoyment.POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM.Failing to discover any example of domestic architecture in Rome, we
turn to Pompeii and Herculaneum, where we find numerous and most
interesting examples of houses of all classes, except, perhaps, the
best; for there is nothing there to compare with the Laurentian villa of
Pliny, or with some others of which descriptions have come down to us.Pompeii, moreover, was far more a Grecian than a Roman city, and its
buildings ought to be considered rather as illustrative of those of
Greece, or at least of Magna Græcia, than of anything found to the
northward.Still these cities belonged to the Roman age, and, except in
taste and in minor arrangements, we have no reason to doubt that the
buildings did resemble those of Rome, at least to a sufficient extent
for illustration.With scarcely an exception, all the houses of Pompeii were of one storey
only in height.It is true that in some we find staircases leading to
the roof, and traces of an upper storey, but where this latter is the
case the apartments would appear to have been places for washing and
drying clothes, or for some such domestic purpose rather than for living
or even sleeping rooms.All the principal apartments were certainly on
the ground floor, and as an almost inevitable corollary from this, they
all faced inwards, and were lighted from courtyards or _atria_, and not
from the outside; for, with a people who had not glass with which to
glaze their windows, it was impossible to enjoy privacy or security
without at the same time excluding both light and air, otherwise than by
lighting their rooms from the interior.Hence it arose that in most
instances the outside of the better class of houses was given up to
shops and smaller dwellings, which opened on to the street, while the
residence, with the exception of the principal entrance, and sometimes
one or two private doors that opened outwards, was wholly hidden from
view by their entourage.Even in the smallest class of tradesmen’s houses which opened on the
street, one apartment seems always to have been left unroofed to light
at least two rooms on each side of it, used as bedrooms; but as the
roofs of all are now gone, it is not always easy to determine which were
so treated.It is certain that, in the smallest houses which can have belonged to
persons at all above the class of shopkeepers, there was always a
central apartment, unroofed in the centre, into which the others opened.Sometimes this was covered by two beams placed in one direction, and two
crossing them at right angles, framing the roof into nine compartments,
generally of unequal dimensions, the central one being open, and with a
corresponding sinking in the floor to receive the rain and drainage
which inevitably came through it.When this court was of any extent,
four pillars were required at the intersection of the beams, or angles
of the opening, to support the roof.In larger courts eight, twelve,
sixteen, or more columns were so employed, often apparently more as
decorative objects than as required by the constructive necessities of
the case, and very frequently the numbers of these on either side of the
apartment did not correspond.Frequently the angles were not right
angles, and the pillars were spaced unequally with a careless disregard
of symmetry that strikes us as strange, though in such cases this may
have been preferable to cold and formal regularity, and even more
productive of grace and beauty.Besides these courts, there generally
existed in the rear of the house another bounded by a dead wall at the
further extremity, and which in the smaller houses was painted, to
resemble the garden which the larger mansions possessed in this
direction.The apartments looking on this court were of course perfectly
private, which cannot be said of any of those looking inwards on the
_atrium_.The house called that of Pansa at Pompeii is a good illustration of
these peculiarities, and, as one of the most regular, has been
frequently chosen for the purpose of illustration.(From Gell’s ‘Pompeii’)
Scale 100 ft to 1 in.]248) all the parts that do not belong
to the principal mansion are shaded darker except the doubtful part
marked A, which may either have been a separate house, or the women’s
apartments belonging to the principal one, or, what is even more
probable, it may have been designed so as to be used for either purpose.B is certainly a separate house, and the whole of the remainder of this
side, of the front, and of the third side, till we come opposite to A,
was let off as shops.At C we have the kitchen and servants’ apartments,
with a private entrance to the street, and an opening also to the
principal peristyle of the house.Returning to the principal entrance or front door D, you enter through a
short passage into the outer court E, on each side of which are several
small apartments, used either by the inferior members of the household
or by guests.A wider passage than the entrance leads from this to the
peristyle, or principal apartment of the house.On the left hand are
several small rooms, used no doubt as sleeping apartments, which were
probably closed by half-doors open above and below, so as to admit air
and light, while preserving sufficient privacy, for Roman tastes at
least.In front and on the right hand are two larger rooms, either of
which may have been the triclinium or dining-room, the other being what
we should call the drawing-room of the house.A passage between the
kitchen and the central room leads to a verandah which crosses the whole
length of the house, and is open to the garden beyond.As will be observed, architectural effect has been carefully studied in
this design, a vista nearly 300 ft.in length being obtained from the
outer door to the garden wall, varied by a pleasing play of light and
shade, and displaying a gradually increasing degree of spaciousness and
architectural richness as we advance.All these points must have been
productive of the most pleasing effect when complete, and of more beauty
than has been attained in almost any modern dwelling of like dimensions.Generally speaking the architectural details of the Pompeian houses are
carelessly and ungracefully moulded, though it cannot be denied that
sometimes a certain elegance of feeling runs through them that pleases
in spite of our better judgment.It was not, however, on form that they
depended for their effect; and consequently it is not by that that they
must be judged.The whole architecture of the house was, but
even this was not considered so important as the paintings which covered
the flat surfaces of the walls.Comparing the Pompeian decoration with
that of the baths of Titus, and those of the House of Livia, the only
specimens of the same age and class found in Rome, it must be admitted
that the Pompeian examples show an equally correct taste, not only in
the choice but in the application of the ornaments used, though in the
execution there is generally that difference that might be expected
between paintings executed for a private individual and those for the
Emperor of the Roman world.Notwithstanding this, these paintings, so
wonderfully preserved in this small provincial town, are even now among
the best specimens we possess of mural decoration.They excel the
ornamentation of the Alhambra, as being more varied and more
intellectual.For the same reason they are superior to the works of the
same class executed by the Moslems in Egypt and Persia, and they are far
superior to the rude attempts of the Gothic architects in the Middle
Ages; still they are probably as inferior to what the Greeks did in
their best days as the pillars of the Pompeian peristyles are to the
porticoes of the Parthenon.But though doubtless far inferior to their
originals, those at Pompeii are direct imitations of true Greek
decorative forms; and it is through them alone that we can form even the
most remote idea of the exquisite beauty to which polychromatic
architecture once attained, but which we can scarcely venture to hope it
will ever reach again.One curious point which has hitherto been too much overlooked is, that
in Pompeii there are two perfectly distinct styles of decoration.One of
these is purely Etruscan, both in form and colour, and such as is only
found in the tombs or on the authentic works of the Etruscans.The other
is no less essentially Greek, both in design and colour: it is far more
common than the Etruscan form, and is always easily to be distinguished
from it.The last-mentioned or Greek style of decoration may be again
divided into two varieties; one, the most common, consisting of
ornaments directly copied from Greek models; the other with a
considerable infusion of Roman forms.This Romanised variety of Greek
decoration represents an attenuated and lean style of architecture,
which could only have come into fashion from the continued use of iron
or bronze, or other metallic substances, for pillars and other
architectural members.Vitruvius reprobates it; and in a later age
Cassiodorus speaks of it in a manner which shows that it was practised
in his time.The general adoption of this class of ornament, both at
Pompeii and in the baths of Titus, proves it to have been a very
favourite style at that time.This being the case, it must have either
been a representation of metallic pillars and other architectural
objects then in use, or it must have been copied from painted
decorations.This is a new subject, and cannot be made clear, except at
considerable length and with the assistance of many drawings.It seems,
however, an almost undoubted fact that the Romans did use metal as a
constructive material.Were it only that columns of extreme tenuity are
represented in these paintings, we might be inclined to ascribe it to
mere incorrect drawing; but the whole style of ornament here shown is
such as is never found in stone or brick pillars, and which is only
susceptible of execution in metal.Besides this, the pillars in question
are always shown in the decorations as though simply gilt or bronzed,
while the representations of stone pillars are.All this
evidence goes to prove that a style of art once existed in which metal
was generally employed in all the principal features, all material
traces of which are now lost.The disappearance of all remains of such a
style is easily accounted for by the perishable nature of iron from
rust, and the value and consequent peculation induced by bronze and
similar metals.We are, moreover, aware that much bronze has been
stolen, even in recent days, from the Pantheon and other buildings which
are known to have been adorned with it.Another thing which we learn from these paintings is, that though the
necessities of street architecture compelled these city mansions to take
a rectilinear outline, whenever the Roman architects built in the
country they indulged in a picturesque variety of outline and of form,
which they carried perhaps as far as even the Gothic architects of the
Middle Ages.This indeed we might have expected, from their carelessness
in respect to regularity in their town-houses; but these were interiors,
and were it not for the painted representations of houses, we should
have no means of judging how the same architects would treat an exterior
in the country.From this source, however, we learn that in the exterior
arrangements, in situations where they were not cramped by confined
space, their plans were totally free from all stiffness and formality.In this respect Roman taste coincided with that of all true architecture
in all parts of the world.Each part of the design was left to tell its own tale and to express the
use to which each apartment was applied, though the whole were probably
grouped together with some reference to symmetry.There is certainly
nothing in these ancient examples to justify the precise regularity
which the architects of the Renaissance introduced into their classical
designs, in which they sought to obliterate all distinction between the
component parts in a vain attempt to make one great whole out of a great
number of small discordant fragments.BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS.Perhaps the most satisfactory works of the Romans are those which we
consider as belonging to civil engineering rather than to architecture.The distinction, however, was not known in those earlier days.The
Romans set about works of this class with a purpose-like earnestness
that always ensures success, and executed them on a scale which leaves
nothing to be desired; while at the same time they entirely avoided that
vulgarity which their want of refinement allowed almost inevitably to
appear in more delicate or more ornate buildings.Their engineering
works also were free from that degree of incompleteness which is
inseparable from the state of transition in which their architecture was
during the whole period of the Empire.It is owing to these causes that
the substructions of the Appian way strike every beholder with
admiration and astonishment; and nothing impresses the traveller more,
on visiting the once imperial city, than the long lines of aqueducts
that are seen everywhere stretching across the now deserted plain of the
Campagna.It is true they are mere lines of brick arches, devoid of
ornament and of every attempt at architecture properly so called; but
they are so well adapted to the purpose for which they were designed, so
grand in conception, and so perfect in execution, that, in spite of
their want of architectural character, they are among the most beautiful
of the remains of Roman buildings.The aqueducts were not, however, all so devoid of architectural design
as those of the Campagna.That, for instance, known as the Pont du Gard,
built to convey water to the town of Nîmes in France, is one of the most
striking works of antiquity.Its height above the stream is about 180
ft., divided into two tiers of larger arches surmounted by a range of
smaller ones, giving the structure the same finish and effect that an
entablature and cornice gives to a long range of columns.Without the
introduction of one single ornament, or of any member that was not
absolutely wanted, this arrangement converts what is a mere utilitarian
work into an architectural screen of a beauty hitherto unrivalled in its
class.The aqueducts of Segovia and Tarragona in Spain, though not perhaps so
grand, are quite as elegant and appropriate as this; and if they stood
across a line of well wooded and watered valleys, might form as
beautiful objects.Unfortunately the effect is much marred by the houses
and other objects that crowd their bases.above the level of their foundation in the centre.That of Segovia
is raised on light piers, the effect of which is perhaps somewhat
spoiled by numerous offsets, and the upper tier is if anything too light
for the lower.These defects are avoided at Tarragona, the central
arches of which are shown in Woodcut No.In this example the
proportion of the upper to the lower arcade is more perfect, and the
whole bears a character of lightness combined with constructive solidity
and elegance unrivalled, so far as I know, in any other work of its
class.It wants, however, the grandeur of the Pont du Gard; for though
its length is about the same, exceeding 800 ft., it has neither its
height nor the impression of power given by the great arches of that
building, especially when contrasted with those that are smaller.Aqueduct of Tarragona.The Roman bridges were designed on the same grand scale as their
aqueducts, though from their nature they of course could not possess the
same grace and lightness.This was, however, more than compensated by
their inherent solidity and by the manifestation of strength imparted by
the Romans to all these structures.They seem to have been designed to
last for ever; and but for the violence of man, it would be hardly
possible to set limits to their durability.Many still remain in almost
every corner of the Roman Empire; and wherever found are easily
recognised by the unmistakable impress of Roman grandeur which is
stamped upon them.One of the most remarkable of these is that which Trajan erected at
Alcantara, in Spain, represented in the annexed woodcut.The roadway is
perfectly level, as is generally the case in Roman bridges, though the
mode by which this is obtained, of springing the arches from different
levels, is perhaps not the most pleasing.To us at least it is
unfamiliar, and has never, I think, been adopted in modern times.In
such a case we should either have made the arches all equal—a mistake,
considering their different heights—or have built solidly over the
smaller arches to bring up the level, which would have been a far
greater error in construction than the other is in taste.The bridge
consists of six arches, the whole length of the roadway being 650 ft.;
the two central arches are about 100 ft.above the level of the stream which it crosses.The piers are well
proportioned and graceful; and altogether the work is as fine and as
tasteful an example of bridge-building as can be found anywhere, even in
these days of engineering activity.Bridge of Trajan, at Alcantara, in Spain.]The bridge which the same Emperor erected over the Danube was a far more
difficult work in an engineering point of view; but the superstructure
being of wood, resting only on stone piers, it would necessarily have
possessed much less architectural beauty than this, or indeed than many
others.These examples of this class of Roman works must suffice; they are so
typical of the style that it was impossible to omit them altogether,
though the subject scarcely belongs in strictness to the objects of this
work.The bridges and aqueducts of the Romans richly deserve the
attention of the architect, not only because they are in fact the only
works which the Romans, either from taste or from social position, were
enabled to carry out without affectation, and with all their originality
and power, but also because it was in building these works that the
Romans acquired that constructive skill and largeness of proportion
which enabled them to design and carry out works of such vast
dimensions, to vault such spaces, and to give to their buildings
generally that size and impress of power which form their chief and
frequently their only merit.It was this too that enabled them to
originate that new style of vaulted buildings which at one period of the
Middle Ages promised to reach a degree of perfection to which no
architecture of the world had ever attained.The Gothic style, it is
true, perished at a time when it was very far from completed; but it is
a point of no small interest to know where and under what circumstances
it was invented.We shall subsequently have to trace how far it advanced
towards that perfection at which it aimed, but to which it never
reached.Strangely enough, it failed solely because of the revival and
the pernicious influence of that very parent style to which it owed its
birth, and the growth and maturity of which we have just been
describing.It was the grandeur of the edifices reared at Rome in the
first centuries of the Empire which so impressed the architects of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that they abandoned their own
beautiful style to imitate that of the Romans, but with an incongruity
which seems inevitably to result from all imitations, as contrasted with
true creations, in architectural art.PARTHIAN AND SASSANIAN ARCHITECTURE.Historical notice—Palaces of Al Hadhr and Diarbekr—Domes—Palaces of

There still remains one other style to be described before leaving the
domain of Heathendom to venture into the wide realms of Christian and
Saracenic art with which the remainder of these two volumes is mainly
occupied.Unfortunately it is not one that was of great importance while
it existed, and it is one of which we know very little at present.This
arises partly from the fact that all the principal buildings of the
Sassanian kings were situated on or near the alluvial plains of
Mesopotamia and were therefore built either of sun-burnt or imperfectly
baked bricks, which consequently crumbled to dust, or, where erected
with more durable materials, these have been quarried by the succeeding
inhabitants of these fertile regions.Partly also it arises from the
Sassanians not being essentially a building race.Their religion
required no temples and their customs repudiated the splendour of the
sepulchre, so that their buildings were mainly palaces.One of these,
that at Dustagird, is described by all contemporary historians[200] as
one of the most gorgeous palaces of the East, but its glories were
ephemeral: gold and silver and precious hangings rich in colour and
embroidery made up a splendour in which the more stable arts of
architecture had but little part, and all perished in an hour when
invaded by the victorious soldiers of Heraclius, or the more destructive
hosts of Arabian invaders a few years afterwards.Whatever the cause
however, never was destruction more complete.Two or three ruined
palaces still exist in Persia and Mesopotamia.A fragment known as the
Tâk Kesra still remains to indicate the spot where Ctesiphon once stood,
but the site of Dustagird is still a matter of dispute.So little in
fact remains that we should hardly be able to form an idea of what the
style really was, but for the fortunate discovery of a palace at Mashita
in Moab, which seems undoubtedly to have been erected by the last great
king of this dynasty, and which is yet unsurpassed for beauty of detail
and richness of ornament by any building of its class and age.As nearly as may be, one thousand years had elapsed since the completion
of the palaces at Persepolis and Susa and the commencement of this
building, and for the great part of that period the history of Persian
or Central Asian architecture is a blank.The Seleucidæ built nothing
that has come down to our times.The Parthians, too, have left us
little, so that it is practically only after a hiatus of nearly six
centuries, that we again begin to feel that the art had not entirely
perished in the populous countries of Central Asia; but even then our
history recommences so timidly and with buildings of such uncertain
dates as to be very far from satisfactory.One of the oldest buildings known as belonging to the new school is the
palace of Al Hadhr, situated in the plain, about thirty miles from the
Tigris, nearly west from the ruins of Kaleh Shergat.The city itself is circular in plan, nearly an English mile in diameter,
and surrounded by a stone wall with towers at intervals, in the centre
of which stands a walled enclosure, nearly square in plan, about 700 ft.This is again subdivided into an outer and inner court by a wall
across its centre.The outer court is unencumbered by buildings, the
inner nearly filled with them.[201] The principal of these is that
represented in plan on Woodcut No.It consists of three large and
four smaller halls placed side by side, with various smaller apartments
in the rear.All these halls are roofed by semicircular tunnel-vaults,
without ribs or other ornament, and they are all entirely open in front,
all the light and air being admitted from the one end.There can be little doubt that these halls are copies, or intended to be
so, of the halls of the old Assyrian palaces; but the customs and
requirements of the period have led the architect on to a new class of
arrangements which renders the resemblance by no means apparent at first
sight.Elevation of part of the Palace of Al Hadhr.The old halls had almost invariably their entrances on the longer side,
which with a vault required very thick external walls as abutments.This
was obviated in Al Hadhr by using the halls as abutments the one to the
other like the arches of a bridge; so that, if the two external arches
were firm, all the rest were safe.This was provided for by making the
outer halls smaller, as shown in the elevation (Woodcut No.254), or by
strengthening the outer wall.But even then the architect seems to have
shrunk from weakening the intermediate walls by making too many openings
in them.Those which do exist are small and infrequent; so that there is
generally only one entrance to each apartment, and that so narrow as to
seem incongruous with the size of the room to which it leads.The square apartment at the back would seem to have been a temple, as
the lintel over the entrance doorway (which faces the east) is carved
with the sun, the moon, and other religious emblems; and the double wall
round may have contained a stair or inclined plane leading to an upper
storey, or to rooms which certainly existed over the smaller halls at
least.All the details of the building are copied from the Roman—the archivolts
and pilasters almost literally so, but still so rudely executed as to
prove that it was not done under the direct superintendence of a Roman
artist.This is even more evident with regard to the griffins and
scroll-work, and the acanthus-leaves which ornament the capitals and
friezes.The most peculiar ornament, however, is the range of masks
carried round all the archivolts of the smaller arches.Of the nineteen
voussoirs of the larger arches, seven of them, according to Ross and
Ainsworth, had figures carved on them in relief of angels, or females,
apparently in the air, and with feet crossed and robes flying loose,
possibly emblematic of the seven planets.Even tradition is silent
regarding the date of these remarkable ruins; the town was besieged
unsuccessfully by Trajan in 116 A.D., and it is recorded to have been a
walled town containing a temple of the sun noted for its rich offerings.This is probably the square building at the back of the great hall on
the left of the palace, and the existence of the carved religious
emblems on the lintel suggest that the palace was erected in front at a
later period.Professor Rawlinson, in his notes on the great
monarchies,[202] suggests about 200 A.D.as the probable date, and
ascribes its erection to the monarchs of the Parthian dynasty.There is
no doubt that the execution of the masonry with its fine joints is of a
totally different character from that which is found in Sassanian
buildings, which comes more under the head of rubble masonry, and was
entirely hidden, in the interior at least, by stucco.The ornament also
is of a rich character, Roman in its design, but debased Greek in its
execution.Loftus, during his researches in Chaldea, discovered at
Wurka (the ancient Erech in Mesopotamia), a large number of ornamental
details, in stone and in plaster, of precisely the same character as
those found at Al Hadhr.Among these remains he found a griffin
resembling those carved on the lintel of the square temple before
referred to, and quantities of Parthian coins, so that it is fair to
assume that Al Hadhr belongs to that dynasty.Another building which merits more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed upon it, is now used as the great mosque at Diarbekr.The
ancient portions consist of the façades only of two palaces, the north
and the south, which face one another at a distance of some 400 feet,
and form the boundaries of the great court (Woodcut No.They are
apparently erected with materials taken from some more ancient building,
and whilst the capitals and friezes are of debased Roman character, the
carved shafts of the north palace (Woodcut No.257) resemble in the
plaster design ornaments found at Wurka.256, which represents the façade of the
South Palace, the openings of the ground storey are spanned by arches of
two different forms; and those of the upper storey by lintels carried on
corbels with relieving arch over; the latter a Byzantine treatment; the
former of a very much later date, and probably Saracenic: above the
openings and under the frieze are Cufic inscriptions.On the whole there
seems little doubt that the building we now see was erected, as it now
stands, at the age of the Cufic inscriptions,[203] whatever they may be,
but that the remains of some more ancient edifice was most skilfully
worked up in the new.Till, however, the building is carefully examined
by some thoroughly competent person, this must remain doubtful.The
building is rich, and so interesting that it is to be hoped that its
history and peculiarities will before long be investigated.Façade of South Palace at Diarbekr.]With the accession of the Sassanians, A.D.223, Persia regained much of
that power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger.The
capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian by the 2nd king of the race, A.D.260, the Conquest of Armenia and victories over Galerius by the 7th
(A.D.296), and the exploits of the 14th King, Bahram Gaur, his visit to
India and his alliance with its kings, all point to extended power
abroad; while the improvement in the fine arts at home indicates
returning prosperity and a degree of security unknown since the fall of
the Achæmenidæ.These kings seem to have been of native race, and claimed descent from
the older dynasties: at all events they restored the ancient religion
and many of the habits and customs with which we are familiar as
existing before the time of Alexander the Great.View in the Court of the Great Mosque at Diarbekr.]As before remarked, fire-worship does not admit of temples, and we
consequently miss that class of buildings which in all ages best
illustrates the beauties of architecture; and it is only in a few
scattered remains of palaces that we are able to trace the progress of
the style.Such as they are, they indicate considerable originality and
power, but at the same time point to a state of society when attention
to security hardly allowed the architect the free exercise of the more
delicate ornaments of his art.The Sassanians took up the style where it was left by the builders of Al
Hadhr; but we only find it after a long interval of time, during which
changes had taken place which altered it to a considerable extent, and
made it in fact into a new and complete style.They retained the great tunnel-like halls of Al Hadhr, but only as
entrances.They cut bold arches through the dividing walls, so as to
form them into lateral suites.But, above all, they learnt to place
domes on the intersections of their halls, not resting on drums, but on
pendentives,[204] and did not even attempt to bring down simulated lines
of support to the ground.Besides all these constructive peculiarities,
they lost all trace of Roman detail, and adopted a system of long
reed-like pilasters, extending from the ground to the cornice, below
which they were joined by small semicircular arches.They in short
adopted all the peculiarities which are found in the Byzantine style as
carried out at a later age in Armenia and the East.We must know more of
this style, and be able to ascribe authentic dates to such examples as
we are acquainted with, before we can decide whether the Sassanians
borrowed the style from the Eastern Romans, or whether they themselves
were in fact the inventors from whom the architects of the more western
nations took the hints which they afterwards so much improved upon.The various steps by which the Romans advanced from the construction of
buildings like the Pantheon to that of the church of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople are so consecutive and so easily traced as to be
intelligible in themselves without the necessity of seeking for any
foreign element which may have affected them.If it really was so, and
the architecture of Constantinople was not influenced from the East, we
must admit that the Sassanian was an independent and simultaneous
invention, possessing characteristics well worthy of study.It is quite
certain too that this style had a direct influence on the Christian and
Moslem styles of Asia, which exhibit many features not derivable from
any of the more Western styles.Section on line A B of Palace at Serbistan.A few examples will render this clearer than it can be made in words.258 and 259) of a small but
interesting palace at Serbistan will explain most of the peculiarities
of the style.The entrances, it will be observed, are deep tunnel-like
arches, but the centre is covered by a dome resting on pendentives.In
the palace of Firouzabad these are constructed by throwing a series of
arches across the angles, one recessed behind the other, the lower ones
serving as centres for those above, until a circular base for the dome
has been obtained; but here in Serbistan they do not seem to have known
this expedient: the lower courses run through to the angle, and the
upper ones are brought forward in so irregular and unscientific a way as
to suggest that for their support they placed their reliance almost
entirely on the tenacious qualities of the mortar.That which, however,
would have formed the outer arch of the pendentive is wrought on the
stone down almost to the springing, as if the builder of Serbistan had
seen regular arched pendentives of some kind, but did not know how to
build them.This is the more remarkable because, as we shall see later
on, they knew how to construct semi-domes over their recesses or square
niches, and in regular coursed masonry; if they had applied these to the
angles, they would have invented the squinch, a kind of pendentive
employed in Romanesque work in the south of France.The dome is
elliptical, as are also the barrel vaults over the entrances, the
recesses in the central hall, and the vaults over the lateral halls.In
these lateral halls piers are built within the walls, forming a series
of recesses; these either have transverse arches thrown across them
where the lofty doorways come, or are covered with semidomes in regular
coursed masonry, the angles being filled in below them with small
arches.The lower portions of the piers consist of circular columns
about six feet high, behind which a passage is formed.The builders thus
obtained the means of counteracting the thrust of the vault, without
breaking the external outline by buttresses and without occupying much
room on the floor, while at the same time these projections added
considerably to the architectural effect of the interior.The date of
the building is not correctly known, but it most probably belongs to the
age of Shapour, in the middle of the fourth century.The palace at Firouzabad is probably a century more modern, and is
erected on a far more magnificent scale, being in fact the typical
building of the style, so far at least as we at present know.(From Flandin and Coste.)]As will be seen in the plan, the great central entrance opens laterally
into two side chambers, and the inner of these into a suite of three
splendid domed apartments, occupying the whole width of the building.Beyond this is an inner court, surrounded by apartments all opening upon
it.261, representing one of the
doorways in the domed halls, the details have nothing Roman about them,
but are borrowed directly from Persepolis, with so little change that
the style, so far as we can now judge, is almost an exact reproduction,
except that the work is only surface ornament in plaster, and is an
irregular and a degraded copy of the original stone features at
Persepolis.The opening also is spanned by a circular arch under the
lintel of the Persian example, the former being the real constructive
feature, the latter a decorative imitation.The portion of the exterior
represented in Woodcut No.262 tells the same tale, though for its
prototype we must go back still further to the ruins at Wurka—the
building called Wuswus at that place (see p.165) being a palace
arranged very similarly to these, and adorned externally by panellings
and reeded pilasters, differing from these buildings only in detail and
arrangement, but in all essentials so like them as to prove that the
Sassanians borrowed most of their peculiarities from earlier native
examples.The building itself is a perfectly regular parallelogram, 332 ft.by
180, without a single break, or even an opening of any sort, except the
one great arch of the entrance; and externally it has no ornament but
the repetition of the tall pilasters and narrow arches represented in
Woodcut No.Its aspect is thus simple and severe, but more like a
gigantic Bastile than the palace of a gay, pavilion-loving people, like
the Persians.Internally the arrangement of the halls is simple and appropriate, and,
though somewhat too formal, is dignified and capable of considerable
architectural display.On the whole, however, its formality is perhaps
less pleasing than the more picturesque arrangements of the palace at
Serbistan last described.Part of External Wall, Firouzabad.Another century probably elapsed before Khosru (Nushirvan) commenced the
most daring, though certainly not the most beautiful ever attempted by
any of his race; for to him we must ascribe the well-known Tâk Kesra
(Woodcuts Nos.263, 264), the only important ruin that now marks the
site of the Ctesiphon of the Greeks—the great Modain of the Arabian
conquerors.As it is, it is only a fragment of a palace, a façade similar in
arrangement to that at Firouzabad, but on a much larger scale, its width
being 312 ft., its height 105 to 110, and the depth of the remaining
block 170 ft.In the centre is a magnificent portal, the Aiwan, or
Throne room of the palace, vaulted over with an elliptical barrel vault
and similar to the smaller vestibules of Serbistan and Firouzabad; the
lower portion of the arch, the springing of which is about 40 ft.from
the ground, is built in horizontal courses up to 63 ft.above the
ground, above which comes the portion arched with regular voussoirs; by
this method not only was an enormous centering saved, but the thrust of
that portion built with voussoirs was brought well within the thickness
of the side walls.It is probable that the front portion of the arch,
about 20 ft.in depth, was built on walls erected temporarily for that
purpose; the remainder of the vault, however, was possibly erected
without centres, the bricks being placed flatwise and the rings being
inclined at an angle of about 10° towards the back of the front arch.The tenacious quality of the mortar was probably sufficient to hold the
bricks in their places till the arch ring was complete, so that the
centering was virtually a template only, giving the correct form of the
ellipse, and constructed with small timbers so as to save expense.A
similar method of construction was found by Sir Henry Layard in the
drain vaults at Nimroud, and it exists in the granaries built by Rameses
II.in the rear of the Rameseum at Thebes.The lower or inner portion of
the great arch is built in four rings of bricks or tiles laid flatwise,
two of which are carried down to the springing of the whole arch: above
these in the upper portion of the arch comes a ring 3 feet in height,
regularly built in voussoir-shaped bricks breaking joint, on the surface
of which are cut a series of seventeen foils, the whole being crowned by
a slightly projecting moulding.These have nothing to do with the
construction, and are simply a novel method of decoration carved after
the arch was built.Plan of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.(From Flandin and
Coste.)Elevation of Great Arch of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.The wall flanking the great arch on either side is decorated with
buttress shafts and blind arches, which are partially constructive, and
intended to support and strengthen those portions of the wall which were
simply screens, or to resist the thrust of the walls of the vaulted
chambers behind, consisting of one storey only.Decoratively they divide
up the front and were apparently introduced in imitation of the great
Roman amphitheatres.The position occupied by these semi-detached shafts
on the first storey (resting on the ledge left by the greater thickness
of wall of the lower storey), which are not in the axes of those below,
proves that the Sassanian architect thought more of their constructive
value as buttresses, than of their architectural value as superimposed
features.Sketch Plan of Palace at Mashita.]Though it may not perhaps be beautiful, there is certainly something
grand in a great vaulted entrance, 72 ft.in height and
115 in depth, though it makes the doorway at the inner end and all the
adjoining parts look extremely small.It would have required the rest of
the palace to be carried out on an unheard-of scale to compensate for
this defect.The Saracenic architects got over the difficulty by making
the great portal a semidome, and by cutting it up with ornaments and
details, so that the doorway looked as large as was required for the
space left for it.Here, in the parent form, all is perfectly plain in
the interior, and painting alone could have been employed to relieve its
nakedness, which, however, it never would have done effectually.[205]

The ornaments in these and in all the other buildings of the Sassanians
having been executed in plaster, we should hardly be able to form an
idea of the richness of detail they once possessed but for the fortunate
discovery of a palace erected in Moab by Khosru Purviz, the last great
monarch of this line.[206]

As will be seen from the woodcut (No.265), the whole building is a
square, measuring above 500 ft.each way, but only the inner portion of
it, about 170 ft.square, marked E E, has been ever finished or
inhabited.It was apparently originally erected as a hunting-box on the
edge of the desert for the use of the Persian king, and preserves all
the features we are familiar with in Sassanian palaces.It is wholly in
brick, and contains in the centre a triapsal hall, once surmounted by a
dome on pendentives like those at Serbistan or Firouzabad.On either
side were eight vaulted halls with intermediate courts almost identical
with those found at Eski Bagdad[207] or at Firouzabad.So far there is
nothing either remarkable or interesting, except the peculiarity of
finding a Persian building in such a situation, and in the fact that the
capitals of the pillars are of that full-curved shape which are first
found in the works of Justinian, which so far helps to fix the date of
the building.It seems, however, that at a time when Chosroes possessed all Asia and
part of Africa, from the Indus to the Nile, and maintained a camp for
ten years on the shores of the Bosphorus, in sight of Constantinople,
that this modest abode no longer sufficed for the greatest monarch of
the day.He consequently determined to add to it the enclosure above
described, and to ornament it with a portal which should exceed in
richness anything of the sort to be found in Syria.Unfortunately for
the history of art, this design was never carried out.When the walls
were raised to the height of about twenty feet, the workmen were called
off, most probably in consequence of the result of the battle of Nineveh
in 627; and the stones remain half hewn, the ornament unfinished, and
the whole exactly as if left in a panic, never to be resumed.Interior of ruined triapsal Hall of Palace.]The length of the façade—marked A A in plan, Woodcut No.265—between the
plain towers, which are the same all round, is about 170 ft.,[208] the
centre of which was occupied by a square-headed portal flanked by two
octagonal towers.Each face of these towers was ornamented by an
equilateral triangular pediment, filled with the richest sculpture.267, two large animals are represented facing
one another on the opposite sides of a vase, on which are two doves, and
out of which springs a vine which spreads over the whole surface of the
triangle, interspersed with birds and bunches of grapes.In another
panel one of the lions is represented with wings, evidently the last
lineal descendant of those found at Nineveh and Persepolis, and in all
are curious hexagonal rosettes, carved with a richness far exceeding
anything found in Gothic architecture, but which are found repeated with
very little variation in the Jaina temples of western India.One Compartment of Western Octagon Tower of the
Persian Palace at Mashita.]The wing walls of the façade are almost more beautiful than the central
part itself.As on the towers, the ornamentation consists of a series of
triangles filled with incised decorations and with rosettes in their
centres; while, as will be observed in Woodcut No.265, the decoration
in each panel is varied, and all are unfinished.The cornice only exists
at one angle, and the mortice stones never were inserted that were meant
to keep it in its place.Enough however remains to enable us to see
that, as a surface decoration, it is nearly unrivalled in beauty and
appropriateness.As an external form I know nothing like it.It is only
matched by that between the arches of the interior of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople, which is so near it in age that they may be considered
as belonging to the same school of art.Part of West Wing Wall of External Façade of Palace
at Mashita.Elevation of External Façade of the Mashita, as
restored by the Author.]Notwithstanding the incomplete state in which this façade was left,
there does not seem much difficulty in restoring it within very narrow
limits of certainty.The elevation cannot have differed greatly from
that shown in Woodcut No.In the first place
there must have been a great arch over the entrance doorway—this is _de
rigueur_ in Sassanian art, and this must have been stilted or
horse-shoed, as without that it could not be made to fit on to the
cornice in the towers, and all the arches in the interior take, as I am
informed, that shape.Besides this there is at Takt-i-Gero[209] a
Sassanian arch of nearly the same age and equally classical in design,
which is, like this one, horse-shoed to the extent of one-tenth of its
diameter; and at Urgub, in Asia Minor, all the rock-cut excavations
which are of this or an earlier age have this peculiarity in a marked
degree.[210]

Above this, the third storey, is a repetition of the lowest, on half its
scale—as in the Tâk Kesra,—but with this difference, that here the
angular form admits of its being carried constructively over the great
arch, so that it becomes a facsimile of an apse at Murano near
Venice,[211] which is adorned with the spoils of some desecrated
building of the same age, probably of Antioch or some city of Syria
destroyed by the Saracens.Above this the elevation is more open to
conjecture, but it is evident that the whole façade could not have been
less than 90 ft.in height, from the fact that the mouldings at the base
(Woodcut No.265) are the mouldings of a Corinthian column of that
height, and no architect with a knowledge of the style would have used
such mouldings four and a half feet in height, unless he intended his
building to be of a height equal at least to that proportion.The domes
are those of Serbistan or of Amrith (Woodcut No.122); but such domes
are frequent in Syria before this age, and became more so afterwards.The great defect of the palace at Mashita as an illustration of
Sassanian art arises from the fact that, as a matter of course, Chosroes
did not bring with him architects or sculptors to erect this building.He employed the artists of Antioch or Damascus, or those of Syria, as he
found them.He traced the form and design of what he wanted, and left
them to execute it, and they introduced the vine—which had been the
principal “motif” in such designs from the time of Herod till the Moslem
invasion—and other details of the Byzantine art with which Justinian had
made them familiar from his buildings at Jerusalem, Antioch, and
elsewhere.Exactly the same thing happened in India six centuries later.When the Moslems conquered that country in the beginning of the
thirteenth century they built mosques at Delhi and Ajmere which are
still among the most beautiful to be found anywhere.The design and
outline are purely Saracenic, but every detail is Hindu, but, just as in
this case, more exquisite than anything the Moslems ever did afterwards
in that country.Though it thus stands almost alone, the discovery of this palace fills a
gap in our history such as no other building occupies up to the present
time.And when more, and more correct, details have been procured, it
will be well worthy of a monograph, which can hardly be attempted now
from the scanty materials available.Its greatest interest, however,
lies in the fact that all the Persian and Indian mosques were derived
from buildings of this class.The African mosques were enlargements of
the _atria_ of Christian basilicas, and this form is never found there,
but it is the key to all that was afterwards erected to the eastward.The palace of Rabbath Ammon (Woodcuts Nos.270, 271), also in Moab,
consists of a central court open to the sky, and four recesses or
transepts, one on each face; two of these are covered with elliptical
barrel vaults, and two with semidomes carried on pendentives.The
decoration of this palace is similar to that found at Mashita, but not
so rich in design or so good in its execution.The remains of two other palaces have been found in Persia, one at
Imumzade, which consists of a dome on pendentives, and a second, called
the Tag Eiran, made known to us by M. Dieulafoy, and published in his
work on the ancient art of Persia.[212] The latter is probably a late
example, for it shows a considerable advance in construction, and is
lighted by clerestory windows between the brick transverse arches which
span the hall.The plan consisted of a central hall, covered over by a
dome carried on pendentives, and two wings; of the original building,
only one of these wings remains, and two sides of the central hall, in
both cases up to the springing of the real arch, the lower courses being
horizontal as in the arch at Ctesiphon.Arch of Chosroes at Takt-i-Bostan.(From Flandin and
Coste.)]In the dearth of Sassanian buildings there is one other monument that it
is worth while quoting before closing this chapter.It is an archway or
grotto, which the same Chosroes cut in the rock at Takt-i-Bostan, near
Kermanshah (Woodcut No.Though so far removed from Byzantine
influence it is nearly as classical as the palace at Mashita.The flying
figures over the arch are evident copies of those adorning the triumphal
arches of the Romans, the mouldings are equally classical, and though
the costumes of the principal personages, and of those engaged in the
hunting scenes on either hand, partake more of Assyria than of Rome, the
whole betrays the influence of his early education and the diffusion of
Western arts at that time more than any other monument we know of.The
statue of Chosroes on his favourite black steed “Shubz diz,” is original
and interesting, and, with many of the details of this monument, it has
been introduced into the restoration of Mashita.This, it must be confessed, is but a meagre account of the architecture
of a great people.Perhaps it may be that the materials do not exist for
making it more complete; but what is more likely is that they have not
yet been looked for, but will be found when attention is fairly directed
to the subject.In the meanwhile what has been said regarding it will be
much clearer and better understood when we come to speak of the
Byzantine style, which overlapped the Sassanian, and was to some extent
contemporary with it.If a line were drawn north and south from Memel on the shores of the
Baltic to Spalato on the Adriatic, it would divide Europe into nearly
equal halves.All that part lying to the west of the line would be found
to be inhabited by nations of Celtic or Teutonic races, and all those to
the eastward of it by nations of Sclavonic origin, if—as we must do—we
exclude from present consideration those fragments of the effete
Turanian races which still linger to the westward, as well as the
intrusive hordes of the same family which temporarily occupy some fair
portions to the eastward of the line so drawn.This line is not of course quite straight, for it follows the boundary
between Germany on the one hand, and Russia and Poland on the other as
far as Cracow, while it crosses Hungary by the line of the Raab and
separates Dalmatia from Turkey.Though Sclavonic influences may be
detected to the westward of the boundary, they are faint and underlie
the Teutonic element; but to the eastward, the little province of
Siebenburgen, in the north-east corner of Hungary, forms the only little
oasis of Gothic art in the desert of Panslavic indifference to
architectural expression.Originally it was a Roman, afterwards a
German, colony, and maintained its Gothic style throughout the Middle
Ages.[213]

From Spalato the line crosses the Adriatic to Fermo, and then following
very closely the 43rd parallel of latitude, divides Italy into two
nearly equal halves.Barbarian tribes settled to a certain extent to the
northward of this boundary and influenced the style of architecture in
some degree; while to the southward of it, their presence can with
difficulty be detected, except in a few exceptional cases, and for a
very limited time.Architecturally all the styles of art practised during the Middle Ages
to the westward and northward of this boundary may be correctly and
graphically described as the Gothic style, using this term in a broad
sense.All those to the eastward may with equal propriety be designated
as the Byzantine style of art.Anterior, however, to the former there existed a transitional style
known as Romanesque, but which was virtually at first nothing more than
debased Roman.It was, in fact, a modification of the classical Roman
form which was introduced between the reigns of Constantine and
Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt to adapt classical forms to
Christian purposes.At first the materials of ancient buildings sufficed
for its wants, and if after the 4th century the style did not lapse into
absolute barbarism it was due to the influence which the Proto-Byzantine
style began to exert and to the magnificent works erected by Greek
artists at Parenzo and Grado in Dalmatia, at Ravenna, Milan, and even in
Rome herself.To the eastward of the line of demarcation the transition
was perfected under the reign of Justinian (A.D.527 to 564), when it
became properly entitled to the name of Byzantine.To the westward, in
Italy and the south of France, this first phase of the Romanesque
continued to be practised till the 6th or 7th centuries; but about that
time occurs an hiatus in the architectural history of Western Europe,
owing to the troubles which arose on the dissolution of the Roman Empire
and the irruption of the Barbarian hordes.When the art again
reappeared, it was strongly tinctured by Barbarian influences, and might
with propriety be designated the _Gothic style_, the essential
characteristic being that it is the architecture of a people differing
from the Romans or Italians in blood, and, it need hardly be added,
differing from them in a like ratio in their architectural conceptions.The term “Gothic,” however, is so generally adopted throughout Europe to
designate the style in which the intersecting vault with pointed arches
is the main characteristic, that to depart from it, even when subdivided
into round arched and pointed arched Gothic, would only lead to
confusion.It would therefore seem better to retain the nomenclature
usually employed in modern architectural works, and to class all the
phases of the transitional style between the Roman and the Gothic
periods under the broad title of Romanesque.This would include what we
have termed Early Christian——Lombardi——Rhenish——those phases of the
style which in Italy and France are influenced by Byzantine detail——the
pure Romanesque or Romance of the south of France——the Norman style in
Italy, Sicily, and the North of France, and——Saxon and Norman in our own
country.The attempt to restrict the term Romanesque within the confines
of the 6th and 7th centuries, which was formerly attempted, has proved
to be illusory, as it has never been recognised by any student of
architecture.At the same time it is not necessary to insist on the term
when describing its various phases, and when they are better known under
other terms.It is, however, of importance, when writing a general
history of all styles, to keep strictly to some definite system, and not
to adopt the nomenclature which has in some cases been given by persons
writing monographs of the style of their own particular country.The
Germans, for instance, are inclined to call the architecture of such
cathedrals as Spires, Worms, etc., by the absurd name of Byzantine,
though no features in them have ever been borrowed from the Eastern
capital, nor do they resemble the buildings of that part of Europe.The title Gothic, which was originally invented as a term of reproach,
and which was applied to the imaginary work of the western Barbarians
who at one time overthrew the western Empire and settled within its
limits, has no architectural or ethnological value, it being impossible
to point out any features, much less buildings, which the Goths
introduced, and which are not to be more correctly attributed to Roman
or Byzantine artists.If we except the tomb of Theodoric, all the works
in Ravenna are scarcely to be distinguished from the basilicas of the
Eastern Empire, and only embody such modifications as the material of
the country and a certain influence of debased Roman architecture in
Italy would naturally exert.The churches and thermæ which Theodoric is
said to have restored in Rome have no characteristics which are not
found in other buildings of the same class before his reign, and even in
Spain and the south of France, which was occupied more or less
continuously by the Visigoths for more than two centuries, there are no
features which they could claim to have invented.The term Gothic, therefore, is misplaced, but inasmuch as the Goths
never invented any style, there is not likely, if this fact is
recognised, to be any confusion in its adoption.The chief difficulty which presents itself in any attempt to classify
the work of the Romanesque and the Gothic styles is that of drawing a
line of demarcation between the two.It is not sufficient to take the
pointed arch, for in France a pointed arched barrel vault preceded the
round arched vault; and in the East, as we know, the pointed arch made
its appearance at a much earlier period: that characteristic, therefore,
must not be too rigidly insisted upon.Beyond this general classification, the use of local names, when
available, will always be found most convenient.First, the country, or
architectural province, in which an example is found should be
ascertained, so that its locality may be marked, and if possible with
the addition of a dynastic or regal name to point out its epoch.When
the outline is sufficiently marked, it may be convenient, as the French
do, to speak of the style of the 13th century[214] as applied to their
own country.The terms they use always seem to be better than 1st, or
2nd, Middle Pointed, or even “Geometric,” “Decorated,” or
“Perpendicular,” or such general names as neither tell the country nor
the age, nor even accurately describe the style, though when they have
become general it may seem pedantic to refuse to use them.The system of
using local, combined, and dynastic names has been followed in
describing all the styles hitherto enumerated in this volume, and will
be followed in speaking of those which remain to be described; and as it
is generally found to be so convenient, whenever it is possible it will
be adhered to.In order to carry out these principles, the division proposed for this
part of the subject is—

1st.To begin the history of Christian Art by tracing up the successive
developments of the earliest perfected style, the Byzantine, in the
countries lying to the eastward of the boundary line already defined.Owing to the greater uniformity of race, the thread of the narrative is
far more easily followed to the eastward than we shall find to the
westward of the line.The Byzantine empire remained one and undivided
during the Middle Ages; and from that we pass by an easy gradation to
Russia, where the style continued to be practised till Peter the Great
superseded it by introducing the styles of Western Europe.To treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy,
down to the age of Charlemagne, so long, in fact, as it remained a
debased Roman style influenced only by its connection with the Eastern
Empire.Continuing our description of the various phases of the style as
practised in Italy and in Istria and Dalmatia (the two countries with
which she was so intimately connected) down to the revival of classic
architecture: subdividing it into those sections which are suggested by
the predominant influence of Lombardic, Byzantine, or Gothic art, and
keeping as far as possible to a chronological sequence.To take up the Romanesque style in France, and to follow it through
its various phases whilst it was being gradually absorbed in the
predominant impetus given to its successor, the Gothic style, by the
adoption of the pointed arch in intersecting vaulting during the 12th
century, and then its subsequent development in succeeding centuries,
till it perished under Francis I.

If this arrangement is not quite logical, it is certainly convenient, as
it enables us to grasp the complete history of the style in the country
where most of the more important features were invented and perfected.Having once mastered the history of Gothic art in the country of its
birth, the sequence in which the other branches of the style are
followed become comparatively unimportant.The difficulty of arranging
them does not lie so much in the sequence as in the determination of
what divisions shall be considered as separate architectural provinces.In a handbook, subdivision could hardly be carried too far; in a
history, a wider view ought to be taken.On the whole, perhaps, the
following will best meet the true exigencies of the case:—

4th.Belgium and Holland should be taken up after France as a separate
province during the Middle Ages, while at the same time forming an
intermediate link between that country and Germany.Though not without important ethnographical distinctions, it will
be convenient to treat all the German-speaking countries from the Alps
to the Baltic as one province.If Germany were taken up before France,
such a mode of treatment would be inadmissible; but following the
history of the art in that country, it may be done without either
confusion or needless repetition.Scandinavia follows naturally as a subordinate, and, unfortunately,
not very important, architectural subdivision.From this we pass by an easy gradation to the British Islands,
which in themselves contain three tolerably well-defined varieties of
style, popularly known as the Saxon, the Norman, or round-arched, and
the Gothic, or pointed-arched style of Architecture.Spain might have been made to follow France, as most of its
architectural peculiarities were borrowed from that country; but some
too own a German origin, while on the whole the new lessons to be
learned from a study of her art are so few, that it is comparatively
unimportant in what sequence the country is taken, and therefore it has
been found more convenient to place her last.BOOK I.

The term Byzantine has of late years been so loosely and incorrectly
used—especially by French writers on architecture—that it is now
extremely difficult to restrict it to the only style to which it really
belongs.Wherever a certain amount of  decoration is employed,
or a peculiar form of carving found, the name Byzantine is applied to
churches on the Rhine or in France; although no similar ornaments are
found in the Eastern Empire, and though no connection can be traced
between the builders of the Western churches and the architects of
Byzantium, or the countries subject to her sway.Strictly speaking, the term ought only to be applied to the style of
architecture which arose in Byzantium and the East after Constantine
transferred the government of the Roman Empire to that city.It is
especially the style of the Greek Church as contradistinguished from
that of the Roman Church, and ought never to be employed for anything
beyond its limits.The only obstacle to confining it to this definition
occurs between the ages of Constantine and Justinian.Up to the reign of
the last-named monarch the separation between the two churches was not
complete or clearly defined, and the architecture was of course likewise
in a state of transition, sometimes inclining to one style, sometimes to
the other.After Justinian’s time, the line may be clearly and sharply
drawn, and it would therefore be extremely convenient if the term “Greek
architecture” could be used for the style of the Greek Church from that
time to the present day.If that term be inadmissible, the term “Sclavonic” might be applied,
though only in the sense in which the Gothic style could be designated
as Teutonic.Both, however, imply ethnographic distinctions which it
would not be easy to sustain.The term “Gothic” happily avoids these,
and so would “Greek,” but for the danger of its being confounded with
“Grecian,” which is the proper name for the classical style of the
ancient Greeks.If the employment of either of these terms is deemed
inadvisable, it will be necessary to divide the style into Old and New
Byzantine—the first comprehending the three centuries of transition that
elapsed from Constantine to the Persian war of Heraclius and the rise of
the Mahomedan power, which entirely changed the face of the Eastern
Empire,—the second, or Neo-Byzantine, including all those forms which
were practised in the East from the reappearance of the style, in or
after the 8th century, till it was superseded by the Renaissance.Thus divided, the true or old Byzantine style might be regarded as the
counterpart of the early Romanesque or debased Roman style, except that,
owing to the rapid development in the East, the former culminated in the
erection of Sta.532-558); the Eastern Empire thus forming
a style of its own of singular beauty and perfection, which it left to
its Sclavonic successors to use or abuse as their means or tastes
dictated.The Western Empire, on the contrary, was in a state of decay
ending in a _débâcle_, from which the Romanesque style only partially
emerged during the reign of Charlemagne and his successors with a new
revival in the 11th century.Though the styles of the East and the West became afterwards so
distinctly separate, we must not lose sight of the fact, that during the
age of transition (324-622) no clear line of demarcation can be traced.Constantinople, Rome, and Ravenna were only principal cities of one
empire, throughout the whole of which the people were striving
simultaneously to convert a Pagan into a Christian style, and working
from the same basis with the same materials.[215] Prior to the age of
Constantine one style pervaded the whole empire.The buildings at
Palmyra, Jerash, or Baalbec, are barely distinguishable from those of
the capital, and the problem of how the Pagan style could be best
converted to Christian uses was the same for all.The consequence is,
that if we were at present writing a history which stopped with the
beginning of the 7th century, the only philosophical mode of treating
the question would be to consider the style as one and indivisible for
that period; but as the separation was throughout steadily, though
almost imperceptibly, making its way, and gradually became fixed and
permanent, it will be found more convenient to assume the separation
from the beginning.This method will no doubt lead to some repetition,
but that is a small inconvenience compared with the amount of clearness
obtained.At the same time, if any one were writing a history of
Byzantine architecture only, it would be necessary to include Ravenna,
and probably Venice and some other towns in Italy and Sicily, in the
Eastern division.On the other hand, in a history devoted exclusively to
the Romanesque styles, it would be impossible to omit the churches at
Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Thessalonica, and elsewhere in the East.Under
these circumstances, it is necessary to draw an arbitrary line
somewhere; and for this purpose the western limits of the Turkish Empire
and of Russia will answer every practical purpose.Eastward of this line
every country in which the Christian religion at any time prevailed may
be considered as belonging to the Byzantine province.During the first three centuries of the style (324-622) it will be
convenient to consider the whole Christian East as one architectural
province.When our knowledge is more complete, it may be possible to
separate it into several, but at present we are only beginning to see
the steps by which the style grew up, and are still very far from the
knowledge requisite for such limitations, even if it should hereafter be
discovered that a sufficient number exist.All the great churches with
which Constantine and his immediate successors adorned their new capital
have perished.Like the churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, they were
probably constructed with wooden roofs and even wooden architraves, and
thus soon became a prey to the flames in that most combustible of
capitals.Christian architecture has been entirely swept off the face of
the earth at Antioch, and very few and imperfect vestiges are found of
the seven churches of Asia Minor.Still, the recent researches of De
Vogüé in Northern Syria,[216] and of Texier in Thessalonica[217] show
how much unexpected wealth still remains to be explored, and in a few
years more this chapter of our history may assume a shape as much more
complete than what is now written, as it excels what we were compelled
to be content with when the Handbook was published, 1855.Since therefore, under present circumstances, no ethnographic treatment
of the subject seems feasible, the clearest mode of presenting it will
probably be to adopt one purely technical.For this purpose it will be found convenient, first, to separate the
Neo-Byzantine style from the older division, which, in order not to
multiply terms, may be styled the Byzantine _par excellence_; the first
chapter extending from Constantine, 324, to the Hejira, 622; and the
second from that time to the end of the Middle Ages.In reference to the ecclesiastical architecture of the first division,
it is proposed to treat—

First, of churches of the basilican or rectangular forms, subdividing
them into those having wooden, and those having stone roofs.Secondly, to describe circular churches in the same manner, subdividing
them similarly into those with wooden roofs, and those with stone roofs
or true domes.This subdivision will not be necessary in speaking of the Neo-Byzantine
churches, since they all have stone roofs and true domes.With regard to civil or domestic architecture very little can at present
be said, as so little is known regarding it, but we may hope that, a few
years hence, materials will exist for an interesting chapter on even
this branch of the subject.Churches at Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Thessalonica—Rectangular Churches
  in Syria and Asia Minor, with wooden roofs and stone vaults.Basilicas may be subdivided into two classes—that in which the nave is
divided from the side-aisles by pillars, carrying either entablatures or
arches, as the most purely Romanesque—and that which has piers
supporting arches only, and is transitional between the first style and
the more original forms which were elaborated out of it.Of the former class one of the most authentic and perfect is that
erected at Bethlehem by Helena, the mother of Constantine, in front of
the cave of the Nativity.The nave seems to be a nearly unaltered
example of this age, with the advantage over the contemporary churches
at Rome, that all its pillars and their capitals were made for the
places they occupy, whereby the whole possesses a completeness and
justness of proportion not found in the metropolis.Its dimensions,
though sufficient for effect, are not large, being internally 103 ft.The choir with its three apses does
not seem to be part of the original arrangement, but to have been added
by Justinian when he renovated—Eutychius says rebuilt—the church.My
impression is that a detached circular building, external to the
basilica, originally contained the entrance to the cave.The frescoes
were added apparently in the 11th or 12th century.[218]

One of the principal points of interest connected with this church is,
that it enables us to realise the description Eusebius gives us of the
basilica which Constantine erected at Jerusalem in honour of the
Resurrection.Like this church it was five-aisled, but had galleries;
the apse also was on a larger scale than could well have been possible
in the Bethlehem church, and adorned with twelve pillars, symbolical of
the Apostles.Of this building nothing now remains, and the only portion which could
be claimed as part of Constantine’s work is the western wall of the
Rotunda, which to a height of 15 to 20 ft.was cut out of the solid rock
in order to isolate the Holy Sepulchre in the centre.The so-called
tombs of Absalom and Zachariah in the valley of Jehoshaphat were
detached in a similar way from the rock behind them.[219]


                             THESSALONICA.Eski Djuma, Thessalonica.As before mentioned, it is to Constantinople, or Alexandria, or Antioch,
that we should naturally look to supply us with examples of the style of
the early transition, but as these fail, it is to Thessalonica alone—in
so far as we now know—that we can turn.In that city there are two
ancient examples.One, now known as the Eski Djuma or old mosque
(Woodcut No.274), may belong to the 5th century, though there are no
very exact data by which to fix its age.It consists of a nave,
measuring, exclusive of narthex and bema, 93 ft.across by 120 ft.—very
much the proportion of the Bethlehem church, but having only three
aisles, the centre one 48 ft.Demetrius, is larger, but less simple.It is five-aisled, has two
internal transepts, and various adjuncts.Altogether it seems a
considerable advance towards the more complicated form of a Christian
church.Both these churches have capacious galleries, running above the
side aisles, and probably devoted to the accommodation of the women.Demetrius is most probably among the first years of the
sixth century.[220] The general ordinance of the columns will be
understood from the woodcut (No.Generally they are placed on
elevated square or octagonal bases, or pedestals, as in the tepidaria of
the Thermæ in Rome, and all have a block (known as the dosseret), placed
above the capital, which is supposed to represent the entablature of the
Roman example, but is probably an original feature inserted over the
capital to support the springing of the arch.In this form it is found
very generally in the 5th and 6th centuries, after which it fell into
disuse, an increased depth being given to the abacus of the capital to
take its place.Demetrius at Thessalonica, A.D.So far as we now know, there is only one church of this class at
Constantinople—that known as St.John Studius,—a three-aisled basilica,
125 ft.Its date appears to be tolerably
well ascertained as A.D.463, and from this circumstance, as well as its
being in the metropolis, it shows less deviation from the classical type
than the provincial examples just quoted.The lower range of columns
supporting the gallery still retain the classical outline and support a
horizontal entablature (Woodcut No.277); the upper supporting arches
have very little resemblance to the classical type, and are wanting in
the architrave block or dosseret, which in fact never seems to have been
admired in the capital.The country where—so far at least as we at present know—the Byzantine
Basilica was principally developed was Northern Syria.Already in De
Vogüé’s work on Central Syria some dozen churches are indicated having
the aisles divided from the naves by pillars supporting arches.One of
these only—that at Soueideh—has five aisles, all the rest three.Almost
all have plain semicircular apses, sometimes only seen internally, like
those mentioned further on (page 510), but sometimes also projecting, as
was afterwards universally the fashion.Two at least have square
terminations (Kefr Kileh and Behioh), but this seems exceptional.Most
of them are almost the size of our ordinary parish churches—100 ft.by
60 or thereabouts—and all belong to the three centuries—the 4th, 5th,
and 6th—of which this chapter especially treats.The church at Baquoza may serve as a type of the class both in plan and
section (Woodcuts Nos.by 105; and besides the narthex—not shown in the section—it has four
lateral porches.It has also two square chapels or vestries at the end
of the aisles—an arrangement almost universal in these churches.The most remarkable of the group, however, is that of St.Simeon
Stylites, at Kalat Sema’n, about 20 miles east of Antioch.Its
dimensions are very considerable, being 330 ft.long, north and south,
and as nearly as may be, 300 ft.east and west, across what may be
called the transepts.The centre is occupied by a great octagon, 93 ft.across, on a rock in the centre of which the pillar of that eccentric
saint originally stood.This apparently was never roofed over, but stood
always exposed to the air of heaven.[221]

[Illustration: 278.Plan of Church and Part of Monastic Buildings at
Kalat Sema’n.The greater part of the conventual buildings belonging to this church
still remain in a state of completeness,—a fact which will be startling
to those who are not aware how many of the great religious
establishments of Syria still stand entire, wanting only the roofs,
which were apparently the only parts constructed of wood.The whole of the buildings at Kalat Sema’n seem to have been completed
within the limits of the 5th century, and not to have been touched or
altered since they were deserted, apparently in consequence of the
Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century.The most curious point is that
such a building should have remained so long in such a situation,
unknown to the Western world; for the notices hitherto published have
been meagre and unsatisfactory in the extreme, and De Vogüé is only able
to state that it was visited and described by the historian Evagrius in
the year 560 A.D.In the same province we find also the earliest examples of the use of
pier arches in a church to separate the nave from the aisles.These seem
to have been currently used in Northern Syria in the 6th century, though
not found in the West—at least not used in the same manner—for several
centuries later.Generally three such arches only were employed in the
length of the nave, and they consequently left the floor so open and
free, that it is very questionable if in churches of limited dimensions
the introduction of a much larger number by the Gothic architects was an
improvement.Taking it altogether, it is probable that such a church as
that at Roueiha (Woodcut No.282) would, if literally reproduced, make a
better and cheaper church for an English parish than the Mediæval models
we are so fond of copying.A considerable amount of perspective effect
is obtained by throwing two transverse arches across the nave, dividing
it into three compartments, each including four windows in the
clerestory; and the whole design is simple and solid in a degree seldom
surpassed in buildings of its class.In many of these churches the transverse arches of the nave are omitted;
and when, as at Qalb Louzeh (Woodcut No.284), the clerestory is
accentuated by roofing shafts, the same effect of perspective is
obtained by other means, and perhaps as successfully.It is very
interesting, however, to find that as early as the 6th century the
architects were thoughtfully feeling their way towards those very
principles of design which many centuries afterwards enabled the Gothic
architects to produce their most successful effects.The introduction of
four windows over each great arch, and of a rooting-shaft between each
to support the beams of the roof, was a happy thought, and it is
wonderful it was so completely lost sight of afterwards.Plan of Church at Qalb Louzeh.Apse of Church at Qalb Louzeh.It is probable that the apse (Woodcut No.284) was originally adorned
with paintings or mosaics, or at least that it was intended it should be
so ornamented; but even as it is, it is so well proportioned to the size
of the church, and to its position, and so appropriately ornamented,
that it is better than most of those found in Roman basilicas; and, for
a small church, is a more dignified receptacle for the altar than either
the French chevet or the English chancel.Did our limits admit of it, it would be not only pleasant but
instructive to dwell longer on this subject; for few parts of our
inquiry can be more interesting than to find that, as early as the 6th
century, the Roman basilica had been converted into a Christian church,
complete in all its details, and—internally at least—in a style of
architecture as consistent and almost as far removed from its classical
prototype as the Mediæval Gothic itself.Externally, too, the style was becoming independent of classical models,
though hardly in the same degree.The porches of the churches were
generally formed in two storeys, the lower having a large central arch
of admission, the upper consisting of a colonnade which partially hid,
while it supported, an open screen of windows that admitted a flood of
light into the nave just in the position where it was most effective.Without glass or mullions such a range of windows must have appeared
weak, and would have admitted rain; but when sheltered by a screen of
pillars, it was both convenient and artistic.Elevation of Chapel at Babouda.This mode of lighting is better illustrated at Babouda, where it is
employed in its simplest form.No light is admitted to the chapel except
through one great semicircular window over the entrance, and this is
protected externally by a screen of columns.This mode of introducing
light, as we shall afterwards see, was common in India at this age, and
earlier, all the Chaitya caves being lighted in the same manner; and for
artistic effect it is equal, if not superior, to any other which has yet
been invented.The light is high, and behind the worshipper, and thrown
direct on the altar, or principal part of the church.In very large
buildings it could hardly be applied, but for smaller ones it is
singularly effective.The external effect of these buildings though not so original as the
interior, is still very far removed from the classical type, and
presents a variety of outline and detail very different from the
simplicity of a Pagan temple.One of the most complete is that at
Tourmanin (Woodcut No.287), though that at Qalb Louzeh is nearly as
perfect, but simpler in detail.For a church of the 6th century it is
wonderful how many elements of later buildings it suggests; even the
western towers seem to be indicated, and, except the four columns of the
gallery, there is very little to recall the style out of which it arose.Façade of Church at Tourmanin.There are considerable remains of a wooden-roofed basilica at Pergamus,
which may be even older than those just described; but having been built
in brick, and only faced with stone—the whole of which is gone—it is
difficult to feel sure of the character of its details and mouldings.It
had galleries on either side of the nave, but how these were supported
or framed is not clear.It may have been by wooden posts or marble
pillars, and these would have either decayed or been removed.The two
square calcidica or vestries, which in the Syrian churches terminate the
side-aisles, are here placed externally like transepts, and beyond them
are two circular buildings with domical roofs and square apses.What
their use was is, however, doubtful.In fact, we know so little of the
architecture of that age in Asia Minor that this building stands quite
exceptionally; and very little use can be made of it, either as throwing
light on other buildings, or as receiving illustration from their
peculiarities.But seeing how much has been effected in this direction
of late, we may fully hope that this state of isolation will not long
remain.One other church of the 4th century is known to exist—at Nisibin.It is
a triple church, the central compartment being the tomb of the founder,
the first Armenian bishop of the place.Though much ruined, it still
retains the mouldings of its doorways and windows as perfect as when
erected, the whole being of fine hard stone.These are identical in
style with the buildings of Diocletian at Spalato; and as their date is
well known, they will, when published, form a valuable contribution to
the information we now possess regarding the architecture of this
period.CHURCHES WITH STONE ROOFS.All the buildings above described—with the exception of the chapel at
Babouda—have wooden roofs, as was the case generally with the basilicas
and the temples of the classical age.The Romans, however, had built
temples with aisles and vaulted them as early as the age of Augustus, as
at Nîmes, for instance (Woodcut No.189), and they had roofed their
largest basilicas and baths with intersecting vaults.We should not
therefore feel surprised if the Christians sometimes attempted the same
thing in their rectangular churches, more especially as the dome was
always a favourite mode of roofing circular buildings; and the problem
which the Byzantine architects of the day set themselves to solve was—as
we shall presently see—how to fit a circular dome of masonry to a
rectangular building.One of the earliest examples of a stone-roofed church is that at Tafkha
in the Hauran.It is probably of the age of Constantine, though as
likely to be before his time as after it.Its date, however, is not of
very great importance, as its existence does not prove that the form was
adopted from choice by the Christians: the truth being that, in the
country where it is found, wood was never used as a building material.All the buildings, both domestic and public, are composed wholly of
stone—the only available material for the purpose which the country
afforded.In consequence of this, when that tide of commercial
prosperity which rose under the Roman rule flowed across the country
from the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, the inhabitants had
recourse to a new mode of construction, which was practically a new
style of architecture.This consisted in the employment of arches
instead of beams.These were placed so near one another that flat stones
could be laid side by side from arch to arch.Over these a layer of
concrete was spread, and a roof was thus formed so indestructible that
whole towns remain perfect to the present day, as originally constructed
in the first centuries of the Christian era.[222]

[Illustration: 289.Section on A B, Tafkha.Section on C D, Tafkha.]Half Front Elevation, Tafkha.One example must suffice to explain this curious mode of construction.The church at Tafkha is 50 ft.It is
spanned by four arches, 7 ft.On each side are galleries of
flat slabs resting on brackets, as shown in Woodcuts Nos.289, 291,
which again are supported by smaller transverse arches.At one side is a
tower, but this is roofed wholly by bracketing, as if the architect
feared the thrust of the arch even at that height.The defect of this arrangement as an architectural expedient is the
extreme frequency of the piers, 8 or 10 ft.being the greatest distance
practicable; but as a mechanical expedient it is singularly ingenious.More internal space is obtained with a less expenditure of material and
danger from thrust than from any mode of construction—wholly of
stone—that we are acquainted with; and with a little practice it might
no doubt be much improved upon.The Indian architects, as we shall
presently see, attempted the same thing, but set about it in a
diametrically opposite way.They absolutely refused to employ the arch
under any circumstances, but bracketed forward till the space to be
covered was so limited that a single stone would reach across.By this
means they were enabled to roof spaces 20 or 25 ft.span without arches,
which is about the interval covered with their aid at Tafkha.[223]

[Illustration: 293.Another circumstance which renders these Hauran examples interesting to
the architectural student is that they contain no trace or reminiscence
of wooden construction or adornment, so apparent in almost every other
style.In Egypt, in Greece, in India, in
Persia—everywhere, in fact—we can trace back the principal form of
decoration to a wooden original; here alone all is lithic, and it is
probably the only example of the sort that the whole history of
architecture affords.If there are any churches in the Byzantine province of the age of which
we are treating, whose naves are roofed by intersecting vaults, they
have not yet been described in any accessible work; but great
tunnel-vaults have been introduced into several with effect.One such is
found at Hierapolis, on the borders of Phrygia (Woodcut No.It is
divided by a bold range of piers into three aisles, the centre one
having a clear width of 45 ft.The internal dimensions of the
church are 177 ft.There are three great piers in the length,
which carry bold transverse ribs so as to break the monotony of the
vault, and have between them secondary arches, to carry the galleries.There is another church at the same place, the roof of which is of a
somewhat more complicated form.The internal length, 140 ft., is divided
into three by transverse arches; but its great peculiarity is that the
vault is cut into by semi-circular lunettes above the screen side-walls,
and through these the light is introduced.This arrangement will be
understood from the section (Woodcut No.Taken altogether, there
is probably no other church of its age and class in which the vault is
so pleasingly and artistically arranged, and in which the mode of
introducing the light is so judicious and effective.The age of these two last churches is not very well ascertained.They
probably belong to the 5th, and are certainly not later than the 6th,
century; but, before we can speak with certainty on the subject, more
examples must be brought to light and examined.From our present
knowledge it can hardly be doubted that a sufficient number do exist to
complete the chapter; and it is to be hoped they will be published,
since a history of vaults in the East, independent of domes, is still a
desideratum.CIRCULAR OR DOMICAL BUILDINGS.Circular Churches with wooden roofs and with true domes in Syria and
  Thessalonica—Churches of St.Sergius and Bacchus and Sta.Sophia,
  Constantinople—Domestic Architecture—Tombs.At the time of the erection of the churches described in the last
chapter, a circular domical style was being simultaneously elaborated in
the East, which not only gave a different character to the whole style,
but eventually entirely superseded the western basilican form, and
became an original and truly Byzantine art.Constantine is said to have erected a church at Antioch which, from the
description given by Eusebius, was octagonal in plan.On Mount Gerizim, on or near the site of the Samaritan temple, Justinian
built an octagonal church showing in its multifold chapels a
considerable advance towards Christian arrangements; it has, however
been so completely destroyed that only its foundation can now be traced,
from which the plan (Woodcut No.296) was measured and worked out by Sir
Charles Wilson.At Bosra in the Hauran there is a church of perfectly well-ascertained
date—A.D.512—which, when more completely illustrated, will throw
considerable light on the steps by which a Pagan temple was transformed
into a Christian church.It is a building externally square, but
internally circular (Woodcut No.in
diameter, and was evidently covered with a wooden roof, according to M.
de Vogüé, supported on eight piers.The interest of the plan consists in
its showing the progress made in adapting this form to Christian
purposes, and it is to be hoped that further investigation may enable us
to supply all the steps by which the transformation took place.De Vogüé
is of opinion that there was a central dome carried on piers and columns
similar to the church of SS.Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, with
aisles round and gallery over them, the latter covered with a timber
roof, the holes in which the rafters were fixed being still visible.Owing to want of lateral support the dome fell down, and at a later
period a small basilica church was erected within the enclosure in front
of the apse; the proximity of the piers of this church suggests that it
was covered with stone slabs according to the custom of the country.The
inscription over the principal entrance door states that the church was
dedicated to SS.Sergius and Bacchus, and was completed in the 400th
year of Bosra (511-512 A.D.).Another example exists at Kalat Sema’n, in
Northern Syria, and presents a combination of an octagonal with a
rectangular church very common in Armenia and Georgia.As is generally
the case there, they are very small in dimensions, the whole group only
measuring 120 ft.Their actual destination is not known, but M.
de Vogüé suggests that the triapsal arrangement in the octagonal
building points to its having been erected as a baptistery.This group
is situated about 200 yards from the main buildings illustrated in
Woodcut (No.Section of Double Church at Kalat Sema’n.Plan, Kalat Sema’n.Whether the dome of the Pantheon at Rome (p.320) was erected in the
time of the Antonines, or before the time of Augustus, as was formerly
supposed, it is evident that the Romans had conquered the difficulties
of domic construction long before the transference of the seat of power
to Byzantium; the Pantheon being, up to this hour, the largest (single)
dome ever constructed by the hand of man.Simple and grand as it
undoubtedly is, it had several glaring defects in its design which the
Byzantines set themselves to remedy.The first was that twice the
necessary amount of materials was consumed in its construction.The
second, that the mode of lighting by a hole in the roof, which also
admitted the rain and the snow, was most objectionable before the
invention of glass.The third, that a simply circular plan is always
unmeaning and inconvenient.A fourth, that a circular building can
hardly, by any contrivance, be made to fit on to any other buildings or
apartments.In the Minerva Medica (Woodcut No.229) great efforts were made, but not
quite successfully, to remedy these defects.The building would not fit
on to any others, and, though an improvement on the design of the
Pantheon, was still far from perfect.The first step the Byzantines made was to carry the dome on arches
resting on eight piers enclosing an octagon A (Woodcut No.300); this
enabled them to obtain increased space, to provide nave, choir, and
transepts, and by throwing out niches on the diagonal lines, virtually
to obtain a square hall in the centre.The difference between the
octagon and circle is so slight, that by corbelling out above the
extrados of the arches, a circular base for the dome was easily obtained
B. The next step was to carry the dome on arches resting on four piers,
and their triumph was complete when by the introduction of
pendentives—represented by the shaded parts at D (Woodcut No.301), they
were enabled to place the circular dome on a square compartment.The
pendentives and dome thus projected formed part of a sphere, the radius
of which was the half-diagonal of the square compartment.Constructively
it would probably have been easier to roof the space by an intersecting
vault; and even if of 100 or 150 ft.span it would without difficulty
have been effected.The difference between the intersecting vault and
the dome (as shown in Woodcuts 302 and 303; the former the tomb of Galla
Placidia, built 450 A.D., the latter the chapel of St.Peter Crysologus
attached to the archiepiscopal palace of about the same date, and both
in Ravenna) is perhaps the most striking contrast the history of
architecture affords between mechanical and ornamental construction.Both are capable of being ornamented to the same extent and in the same
manner; but the difference of form rendered the dome a beautiful object
in itself wholly irrespective of ornament, whereas the same cannot
always be said of the intersecting barrel vault.Altogether, the effect
would have been architecturally so infinitely inferior, that we cannot
but feel grateful to the Byzantines that they persevered, in spite of
all mechanical temptations, till they reached the wonderful perfection
of the dome of Sta.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.Chapel in Archiepiscopal Palace, Ravenna.]Among the earliest domical churches found in the East is that of St.It is also, perhaps, the finest example of its
class belonging strictly to that group which has been designated above
as the Eastern Romanesque.As will be seen from the plan it is a circular apartment, 79 ft.in
diameter, surrounded by walls 20 ft.in thickness, into which are cut
seven great niches; two apparently serving as entrances, opposite one of
which is a bema or presbytery of considerable importance and purely
Christian form.The dome is hemispherical, pierced at its base by eight
semi-circular lunettes, and externally covered and concealed by a wooden
roof.This form of roof is first found in the West at Nocera dei Pagani
(p.547), but the dome there is only half the diameter of this one, and
of a very different form and construction.George’s
retains its internal decorations, which are among the earliest as well
as the most interesting Christian mosaics in existence.[224] The
architecture presented in them bears about the same relation to that in
the Pompeiian frescoes which the Jacobæan does to classical
architecture, and, mixed with Christian symbols and representations of
Christian saints, makes up a most interesting example of early Christian
decoration.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]No inscriptions or historical indications exist from which the date of
the church can be fixed.We are safe, however, in asserting that it was
erected by Christians, for Christian purposes, subsequently to the age
of Constantine.If we assume the year 400 as an approximate date we
shall probably not err to any great extent, though the real date may be
somewhat later.Plan of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun (Syria).How early a true Byzantine form of arrangement may have been introduced
we have no means of knowing; but as early as the year 285—according to
De Vogüé—we have a Kalybe[225] at Omm-es-Zeitoun, which contains all the
elements of the new style.It is square in plan, with a circular dome in
its centre for a roof.The wing walls which extend the façade are
curious, but not singular.One other example, at least, is found in the
Hauran, at Chaqqa, and there may be many more.View of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun.Still, in the Hauran they never seem quite to have fallen into the true
Byzantine system of construction, but preferred one less mechanically
difficult, even at the expense of crowding the floor with piers.In the
church at Ezra, for instance, the internal octagon is reduced to a
figure of sixteen sides before it is attempted to put a dome upon it,
and all thought of beauty of form, either internally or externally, is
abandoned in order to obtain mechanical stability—although the dome is
only 30 ft.As the date of this church is perfectly ascertained (510) it forms a
curious landmark in the style just anterior to the great efforts
Justinian was about to make, and which forced it so suddenly into its
greatest, though a short-lived, degree of perfection.As before mentioned, all the churches of the capital which were erected
before the age of Justinian, have perished, with the one exception of
that of St.This may in part be
owing to the hurried manner in which they were constructed, and the
great quantity of wood consequently employed, which might have risked
their destruction anywhere.It is, however, a curious, but
architecturally an important, fact that Byzantium possessed every
conceivable title to be chosen as the capital of the Empire, except the
possession of a good building-stone, or even apparently any suitable
material for making good bricks.Wood seems in all times to have been
the material most readily obtained and most extensively used for
building purposes, and hence the continual recurrence of fires, from
before the time of Justinian down to the present day.That monarch was
the first who fairly met the difficulty; the two churches erected during
his reign, which now exist, are constructed wholly without wood or
combustible materials of any sort—and hence their preservation.The earliest of these two, popularly known as the “Kutchuk Agia Sophia,”
or lesser Sta.Sophia, was originally a double church, or more properly
speaking two churches placed side by side, precisely in the same manner
as the two at Kalat Sema’n (Woodcut No.The basilica was dedicated
to the Apostles Peter and Paul; the domical church, appropriately, to
the Martyrs Sergius and Bacchus.The former has entirely disappeared,
from which I would infer that it was constructed with pillars and a
wooden roof.[226] The latter remains very nearly intact.The frescoes
and mosaics have, indeed, disappeared from the body of the church,
hidden, it is to be hoped, under the mass of whitewash which covers its
walls—in the narthex they can still be distinguished.The existing church is nearly square in plan, being 109 ft.by 92 over
all, exclusive of the apse, and covering only about 10,000 sq.It
has consequently no pretensions to magnificence on the score of
dimensions, but is singularly elegant in design and proportion.Internally, the arrangement of the piers of the dome, of the galleries,
and of the pillars which support them, are almost identical with those
of St.Vitale at Ravenna, but the proportions of the Eastern example are
better, being 66 ft.in height by 52 in diameter, while the other, with
the same diameter, is nearly 20 ft.higher, and consequently too tall to
be pleasing.The details of this church are generally well designed for the purposes
to which they are applied.There is a certain reminiscence of classical
feeling in the mouldings and foliage—in the latter, however, very faint.313) here seems almost to have superseded the
capital, and what was once a classical entablature has retained very
little of its pristine form (No.314), and indeed was used
constructively only, for the support of a gallery, or some such
mechanical requirement.The arch had entirely superseded it as an
ornamental feature long before the age of Justinian.Although the building just described, and others that might be quoted,
probably contain the germs of all that is found in Sta.Sophia, they are
on so small a scale that it is startling to find Justinian attempting an
edifice so grand, and so daring in construction, without more experience
than he appears to have obtained.Indeed so exceptional does this great
structure appear, with our present knowledge, that we might almost feel
inclined at first sight to look upon it as the immediate creation of the
individual genius of its architect, Anthemius of Thralles; but there can
be little doubt that if a greater number of contemporary examples
existed we should be able to trace back every feature of the design to
its origin.The scale, however, on which it was carried out was
certainly original, and required great boldness on the part of the
architect to venture upon such a piece of magnificence.At all events,
the celebrated boast of its founder on contemplating his finished work
was more than justified.When Justinian exclaimed, “I have surpassed
thee, O Solomon,” he took an exaggerated view of the work of his
predecessor, and did not realize the extent to which his building
excelled the Jewish temple.The latter was only equal to a small church
with a wooden roof supported by wooden posts, and covering some 7200 sq.Sophia covers ten times that area, is built of durable
materials throughout, and far more artistically ornamented than the
temple of the Jews ever could have been.But Justinian did more than
accomplish this easy victory.Neither the Pantheon nor any of the
vaulted halls at Rome equal the nave of Sta.Sophia in extent, or in
cleverness of construction, or in beauty of design.Nor was there
anything erected during the ten centuries which elapsed from the
transference of the capital to Byzantium till the building of the great
mediæval cathedrals which can be compared with it.Indeed it remains
even now an open question whether a Christian church exists anywhere, of
any age, whose interior is so beautiful as that of this marvellous
creation of old Byzantine art.Sophia which had been erected by Constantine
was, it seems, burnt to the ground in the fifth year of Justinian, A.D.532, when he determined to re-erect it on the same spot with more
magnificence and with less combustible materials.So rapidly were the
works pushed forward, that in six years it was ready for dedication,
A.D.Twenty years afterwards a portion of the dome fell down in
consequence of an earthquake; but this damage was repaired, and the
church re-dedicated, A.D.563, in the form, probably very nearly, in
which we now find it.In plan it closely approaches an exact square, being 235 ft.north and
south by 250 east and west, exclusive of the narthex and apse.The
narthex itself is a splendid hall, 205 ft.Beyond this there is an exo-narthex
which runs round the whole of the outer court, but this hardly seems to
be part of the original design.Altogether, the building, without this
or any adjuncts which may be after-thoughts, covers about 70,000 sq.ft., or nearly the average area of a mediæval cathedral of the first
class.316) possesses little architectural
beauty beyond what is due to its mass and the varied outline arising
from the mechanical contrivances necessary to resist the thrust of its
internal construction.It may be that, like the early Christian
basilicas at Rome, it was purposely left plain to distinguish it from
the external adornment of Heathen temples, or it may have been intended
to revêt it with marble, and add the external ornament afterwards.Before we became acquainted with the ornamental exteriors of Syrian
churches, the former theory would seem the more plausible, though it can
hardly now be sustained; and when we consider that the second dedication
only took place the year before Justinian’s death, and how soon
troublous times followed, we may fairly assume that what we now see is
only an incomplete design.Whatever may be the case with the exterior,
all the internal arrangements are complete, and perfect both from a
mechanical and an artistic point of view.In such a design as this, the
first requirement was to obtain four perfectly stable arches on which
the dome might rest.The great difficulty was with the two arches
running transversely north and south.These are as nearly as may be 100
ft.span and 120 high to the crown, and 10 ft.Each of them
has a mass of masonry behind it for an abutment, 75 ft.wide, only partially pierced by arches on the ground and gallery floor;
and as the mass might have been carried to any height, it ought, if
properly constructed, to have sufficed for an arch very much wider and
more heavily weighted than that which it supports.Yet the southern wall
is considerably bulged, and the whole of that side thrown out of the
perpendicular.This probably was the effect of the earthquake which
caused the fall of the dome in 559, since no further settlement seems to
have taken place.The
distance between the solid parts of the piers was 75 ft., and this was
filled up with a screen wall supporting the inner side of the arch; so,
unless that was crushed, the whole was perfectly stable.Pendentives
between these four arches ought not to have presented any difficulties.It would, however, have been better, from an architectural point of
view, if they had been carried further up and forward, so as to hang a
weight inside the dome to counteract the outward thrust, as was
afterwards so successfully practised at Beejapore.[227] As it is, the
dome rests rather on the outer edge of the system, without sufficient
space for abutment.In itself the dome is very little lower than a
hemisphere, being 107 ft.Externally, it
would have been better if higher; for internal effect this is
sufficient.Its base is pierced by forty small windows, so small and so
low as not to interfere in any way with the apparent construction, but
affording an ample supply of light—in that climate at least—to render
every part of the dome bright and cheerful.Sophia from E. to W. Scale 100 ft.Beyond the great dome, east and west, are two semi-domes of a diameter
equal to that of the great dome, and these are again cut into by two
smaller domes, so that the building, instead of being a Greek cross, as
usually asserted, is only 100 ft.across in the centre and 125 wide
beyond the central space each way.There is a little awkwardness in the
way in which the smaller semi-domes cut into the larger, and the three
windows of the latter are unconnected with any other part of the design,
which is unpleasing, but might easily be remedied in a second attempt.These very irregularities, however, give a variety and appropriateness
to the design which has probably never been surpassed.A single dome of
the area of the central and two semi-domes would not have appeared
nearly so large, and would have overpowered everything else in the
building.As it is, the eye wanders upwards from the large arcades of
the ground floor to the smaller arches of the galleries, and thence to
the smaller semi-domes.These lead the eye on to the larger, and the
whole culminates in the great central roof.Nothing, probably, so
artistic has been done on the same scale before or since.If, however, the proportions of this church are admirable, the details
are equally so.All the pillars are of porphyry, verd antique, or
marbles of the most precious kinds.The capitals are among the most
admirable specimens of the style.It will be remembered that the
governing line of a classical Corinthian capital is a hollow curve, to
which acanthus-leaves or other projecting ornaments were applied.When
the columns were close together, and had only a beam to support, this
form of capital was sufficient; but when employed to carry the
constructive arches of the fabric its weakness became instantly
apparent.Long before Justinian’s time, the tendency became apparent to
reverse the curve and to incise the ornament.Sophia the
transition is complete; the capitals are as full as elegance would
allow, and all the surfaces are flat, with ornaments relieved by
incision.In the lower tier of arches (Woodcut No.318) this is boldly
and beautifully done, the marble being left to tell its own story.In
the upper tier, further removed from the eye, the interstices are filled
in with black marble so as to ensure the desired effect.All the flat surfaces are covered with a mosaic of marble slabs of the
most varied patterns and beautiful colours; the domes, roofs, and curved
surfaces, with a gold-grounded mosaic relieved by figures or
architectural devices.Though much of the mosaic is now concealed,
enough is left to enable the effect of the whole to be judged of, and it
certainly is wonderfully grand and pleasing.The one thing wanting is
painted glass, like that which adorns the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem,
to render this building as solemnly impressive as it is overpoweringly
beautiful.Sophia is so essentially different from the greater number of
churches, that it is extremely difficult to institute a comparison
between them.With regard to external effect, Gothic cathedrals
generally excel it; but whether by accident or by the inherent necessity
of the style is by no means so clear.In so far as the interior is
concerned, no Gothic architect ever rose to the conception of a hall 100
ft.high, and none ever disposed
each part more artistically to obtain the effect he desired to produce.Where the Byzantine style might profit from the experience subsequently
gained by Gothic architects is in the use of mouldings.The one defect
in the decoration of Sta.Sophia is that it depends too much on colour.It would have been better if the pier-arches, the window-frames, and the
string-courses generally had been more strongly accentuated by moulding
and panellings, but this is a slight defect among so many beauties.A comparison with the great Renaissance cathedrals is more easy, but
results even more favourably to the Byzantine example.Two of these have
domes which are considerably larger—St.Paul’s, London (108), is within a
foot of the same diameter, all the rest are smaller.[228] This, however,
is of less consequence than the fact that they are all adjuncts to the
design of the church.None of them are integral or supported by the rest
of the design, and all tend to dwarf the buildings they are attached to
rather than to heighten the general effect.With scarcely an exception
also all the Renaissance cathedrals employ internally great sprawling
pillars and pilasters, designed for external use by the Romans, which
not only diminish the apparent size of the building but produce an
effect of unreality and sham utterly fatal to true art.In fact, turn it as we will, and compare it as we may with any other
buildings of its class, the verdict seems inevitable that Sta.Sophia—internally at least, for we may omit the consideration of the
exterior, as unfinished—is the most perfect and most beautiful church
which has yet been erected by any Christian people.When its furniture
was complete the verdict would probably have been still more strongly in
its favour; but so few of the buildings described in these pages retain
these adjuncts in anything like completeness that they must be withdrawn
from both sides and our remarks be confined to the architecture, and
that only.Sophia at Thessalonica, according to Greek tradition,
was built by Justinian in the latter part of his reign.[229] It is a
church of considerable dimensions, measuring 140 ft.It possesses also an
upper gallery, and its arrangements generally are well considered and
artistic.There does not seem to be any documentary evidence of its age,
but judging from the details published in Texier, the date ascribed to
it seems probable.This has been further established lately from an
inscription found in the apse, which as well as the dome still retain
their ancient mosaics; the inscription is incomplete, but Messrs.Duchesne and Bayet, in an appendix to their work on Mount Athos, ascribe
it to the second half of the 6th century.The church possesses one
special characteristic: above the pendentives is a low drum, circular
internally,[230] in which windows are pierced, but which, externally, is
carried up square: by this means the angle piers are well weighted and
are thus enabled to resist more effectually the thrust of the arches
carrying the pendentives.The two side walls also, which in Sta.Sophia
at Constantinople were built almost flush with the inner arch, leaving
outside a widely-projecting arch thrown across between the buttresses to
carry the buttresses of the dome, are here placed flush with the outside
of the arch, thus giving increased space to the interior.The publication of the Count De Vogüé’s book has enabled us to realise
the civil and domestic architecture of Syria in the 5th and 6th
centuries with a completeness that, a very short time ago, would have
been thought impossible.Owing to the fact that every part of the
buildings in the Hauran was in stone, and that they were suddenly
deserted on the Mahomedan conquest, never, apparently, to be
re-occupied, many of the houses remain perfectly entire to the present
day, and in Northern Syria only the roofs are gone.Generally they seem to have been two storeys in height, adorned with
verandahs supported by stone columns, the upper having a solid
screen-fence of stone about 3 ft.high, intended apparently as
much to secure privacy to the sleeping apartments of the house as
protection against falling out.In some instances the lower storey is
twice the height of the upper, and contained the state apartments of the
house.In others, as in that at Refadi (Woodcut No.320), it seems to
have been intended for the offices.In the plan of a house at Moudjeleia
(Woodcut No.321) the principal block of the house is in two storeys,
with portico on ground floor and verandah over.The buildings at the
back with their courtyard were probably offices, and those in front by
the side of the main entrance warehouses or stores.In some instances one is startled to find details which we are
accustomed to associate with much more modern dates; as, for instance,
this window (Woodcut No.322) from the palace at Chaqqa, which there
seems no reason whatever for doubting belongs to the 3rd
century—anterior to the time of Constantine!It looks more like the
vagary of a French architect of the age of Francis I.Plan of house at Moudjeleia.]The building known as the Golden Gateway at Jerusalem and attributed to
Justinian, bears in its details many striking resemblances to those of
the 5th and 6th centuries in Central Syria, illustrated in De Vogüé’s
book.It is situated on the east side of the Haram enclosure, and
consists of a vestibule divided by columns into two aisles of three bays
each vaulted with a cupola[231] carried on arches, between which and the
capitals of the columns is found the Byzantine dosseret already referred
to.Within the eastern doorways (said to have been blocked up by Omar)
are two huge monoliths 14 ft.respectively, the
doorposts of an earlier gateway.Externally, on the entrance fronts
(east and west), the entablature of the pilasters is carried round the
circular-headed doorways which they flank; the earliest instance of this
development is found in the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato, and there
is a second example in the Roman gateway to the Mosque of Damascus,
which probably suggested the idea to the Byzantine builders; the sharp
stiff foliage of Greek type with which the ornament is carved on the
Golden Gate agrees in style and character with that in the church of St.Demetrius at Thessalonica dating from the commencement of the 6th
century.(From a Drawing by
Catherwood.Originally published in Fisher’s ‘Oriental Album.’)]

Of similar style and character are the arch-moulds of the double gate on
the south wall of the Haram, and the cupolas of the interior vestibule,
the columns carrying them however being probably of earlier date and
possibly part of the substructure of Herod’s temple.The surface
decoration of these cupolas is similar to that found in Central Syria.The sepulchral remains of Syria, both structural and rock-cut, seem
nearly as numerous as the dwellings of the living, and are full of
interest, not only from their frequently bearing dates, but from their
presenting new types of tombs, or old types in such new forms as
scarcely to be recognizable.Roof of one of the Compartments of the Gate Huldah.The oldest example, that of Hamrath in Souideh, dates from the 1st
century B.C., and consists of a tomb 28 ft.square decorated with
semi-detached Doric columns; the roof is gone, but it was probably
covered with one of pyramidal form like the tomb of Zechariah (Woodcut
No.The tomb of Diogenes at Hass (Woodcut No.326), also square, consisted
of two storeys, with a portico on the ground storey on one side, and a
peristyle on all four sides of the upper storey, above which rose the
central walls carrying a pyramidal roof, not stepped, as in the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, but with projecting bosses on each stone.The same class of roof is found on other tombs, being adopted probably
as the simplest method of covering over the tomb; these tombs date from
the 4th and 5th centuries, and in all cases the sepulchral chambers
within them are vaulted with large slabs of stone carried on stone ribs.Tomb at Hass]

Besides these, there is another class of tomb apparently very numerous,
in which the sepulchral chamber is below the ground, with vaulted
entrance rising to form a podium on which columns either two or four in
number are erected;[232] in the latter case the columns bearing an
entablature with small pyramidal roof; in the former a fragment of
architrave only, the two columns being sometimes tied together one-third
of the way down by a stone band with dentils carved on it: these tombs
are, many of them, dated, and belong to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.With our present limits it is only possible to characterize generally
the main features of the Byzantine style, and to indicate the sources
from which further information may be obtained.In the present instance
it is satisfactory to find that ample materials now exist for filling up
a framework which a few years ago was almost entirely a blank.Any one
who will master the works of De Vogüé, or Texier, or Salzenberg, and
other minor publications, may easily acquire a fair knowledge of the
older Byzantine style of architecture.Once it is grasped it will
probably be acknowledged that there are few more interesting chapters
than that which explains how a perfect Christian Church like that of
Sta.Sophia was elaborated out of the classical edifices of ancient
Rome.It will also probably be found that there are few more instructive
lessons to be learnt from the study of architectural history than the
tracing of the various contrivances which were so earnestly employed,
during the first two centuries of Christian supremacy, in attaining this
result.NEO-BYZANTINE STYLE.Irene, Constantinople—Churches at Ancyra, Trabala, and
  Constantinople—Churches at Thessalonica and in Greece—Domestic
  Architecture.Santa Sophia at Constantinople was not only the grandest and most
perfect creation of the old school of Byzantine art, but it was also the
last.It seems as if the creative power of the Empire had exhausted
itself in that great effort, and for long after it the history is a
blank.We always knew that the two centuries which elapsed between the
ages of Constantine and Justinian were ages of great architectural
activity.We knew that hundreds, it may be thousands, of churches were
erected during that period.With the two subsequent centuries, however,
the case seems widely different.Shortly after Justinian’s death, the
troubles of the Empire, the Persian wars of Heraclius, and, more than
either, the rise of the Mahomedan power in the East, and of the Roman
pontificate under Gregory the Great in the West—all tended so to disturb
and depress the Byzantine kingdom as to leave little leisure and less
means for the exercise of architectural magnificence.It is therefore
hardly probable that we shall ever be in a position to illustrate the
7th and 8th centuries as we now know we can the 5th and 6th.Still,
building must have gone on, because when we again meet the style, it is
changed.One of the very earliest churches of the new school is that of
Sta.Irene at Constantinople, rebuilt as we now find it by Leo the
Isaurian (A.D.It differs in several essential particulars
from the old style, and contains the germ of much that we find
frequently repeated.The change is not so great as might have taken
place in two centuries of building activity, but it is considerable.In
this church we find, apparently for the first time in a complete form,
the new mode of introducing the light to the dome through a
perpendicular drum, which afterwards became so universal that it serves
to fix the age of a building in the East with almost as much certainty
as the presence of a pointed arch does that of a building in the West.As this invention is so important, it may be well to recapitulate the
steps by which it was arrived at.Half Section, half Elevation, of Dome of Sta.The oldest mode of lighting a dome is practised in the Pantheon (Woodcut
No.191), by simply leaving out the central portion.Artistically and
mechanically nothing could be better, but before the invention of glass
it was intolerably inconvenient whenever much rain or snow fell.A
change therefore was necessary, and it is found in the tomb or temple of
Marcellus, built during the reign of Constantine on the Via Prenestina
at Rome.It consists simply of boring four circular holes through the
dome a little above its springing.The next step is seen at Thessalonica
in the church of St.There eight semi-circular
lunettes are pierced in the dome, at its springing, and answer the
purpose very perfectly.Sophia, where
forty windows introduce a flood of light without its ever falling on the
eyes of the spectator.After this it seems to have been considered
desirable not to break the hemisphere of the dome, but to place the
windows in a perpendicular circular rim of masonry—called the drum—and
to introduce the light always through that.Externally there can be no
doubt but that this was an improvement; it gave height and dignity to
the dome in small churches, where, without this elevation, the feature
would have been lost.Internally, however, the advantage is
problematical: the separation of the dome from its pendentives destroyed
the continuity of the roof, and introduced the stilted effect so
objectionable in Renaissance domes.In the Neo-Byzantine churches the
dome became practically a skylight on the roof, the drum increasing in
height and the dome diminishing in dignity as the style progressed.As
all the churches are small, the feature is unobjectionable; but in
larger edifices it would have been found difficult to construct it, and
the artistic result would hardly have been pleasing, even had this
difficulty been got over.Be this as it may, its value as a chronometric
landmark is undoubted.As a rule it may generally be asserted that, in all Christian domes
erected during the old Byzantine period, the light is introduced by
openings in the dome itself.[233] After that time, the light is as
generally admitted through windows in the drum, the dome itself being
cut into only in the rarest possible instances.If these views are correct, the church of St.Clement at Ancyra is a
transitional specimen subsequent to Sta.Sophia, because the dome is
raised timidly (Woodcut No.328) on a low drum pierced with four small
windows; but it is anterior to Sta.Irene, because the dome is still
pierced with twelve larger windows, after the manner of Sta.All the details of its architecture, in so far as
they can be made out, bear out this description.They are further
removed from the classical type than the churches of Justinian, and the
whole plan (Woodcut No.329) is more that which the Greek church
afterwards took than any of the early churches show.Its greatest
defect—though the one most generally inherent in the style—is in its
dimensions.long, over all externally, by 58 ft.Yet this is a fair average size of a Greek church of that age.Another church, very similar, is found at Myra, dedicated to St.Clement in size, and has a double
narthex considerably larger in proportion, but so ruined that it is
difficult to make out its plan, or to ascertain whether it is a part of
the original structure, or a subsequent addition.The cupola is raised
on a drum, and altogether the church has the appearance of being much
more modern than that at Ancyra.A third church of the same class, and better preserved, is found at
Trabala in Lycia.Clement, and similar in
its arrangements to Sta.Sophia, except in the omission of the
semi-domes, which seem never to have been adopted in the provinces,[234]
and indeed may be said to be peculiar to the metropolitan church.Notwithstanding the beauty of that feature, it appears to have remained
dormant till revived by the Turks in Constantinople, and there alone.In this example there are two detached octagonal buildings, either tombs
or sacristies; a form which, except in large detached buildings, does
not seem to have been so common as the circular, till after the time of
Justinian.Returning to the capital, we find one other remarkable peculiarity of
the Neo-Byzantine style in the attempt to allow the external surface of
an ordinary tunnel-vault to retain its form without any ridge whatever.It can hardly be doubted that this is artistically a mistake.With domes
it was early felt to be so, and consequently we always find a flower or
pinnacle in iron, or some such ornament, marking the centre.In this the
Saracenic architects were especially successful—all their domes possess
a central ornament sufficient to relieve them, and generally of the most
beautiful proportions.With the extrados of a circular vault, however,
it is even worse than with a dome.A roof is felt to be a contrivance to
keep off the rain.It may be more or less sloping, according to the
materials of which it is constructed; but to make one part of each ridge
sloping, and the central portion flat, is a discord that offends the
eye, besides looking weak and unmeaning.A pointed arch would avoid the
evil, but a reverse or ogee curve is perhaps the most pleasing.In the
Neo-Byzantine age, however, between the 8th and the 12th centuries, the
eye seems to have got accustomed to it.It is common in the East,
especially at Constantinople and at Venice.Mark’s and elsewhere
it became so familiar a form that it was copied and continued by the
Renaissance architects even to the end of the 16th century.One of the best illustrations of these peculiarities is the church of
Moné tés Choras at Constantinople, now converted into a mosque and
called Kahriyeh Djamisi.The older part of it seems to belong to the
11th century, the side-aisles to the 12th, and though small, it
illustrates the style perfectly.The porch consists of five arches
covered with an intersecting vault, visible both externally and
internally.The last two bays are covered with cupolas which still
retain their mosaics internally, and those of singular beauty and
brilliancy, though, owing to the constructive defects of the
intermediate parts, the wet has leaked through, and the mosaics have
mostly peeled off.Externally the front is ornamented with courses of
stones alternating with two or three layers of tiles, and even in its
ruined state is effective and picturesque.Its principal interest is
that it shows what was the matrix[235] of the contemporary church of St.Subsequent additions have much modified the external
appearance of St.Mark, but there can be very little doubt that
originally it was intended to be very like the façade shown in Woodcut
No.Not far from Moné tés Choras there are two other churches of the same
class and of about the same age.One, the Pantokrator, has been added to
at various times so as to cover a large space of ground, but it consists
consequently of small and ill-assorted parts.It retains, however, a
good deal of its marble pavements and other features of interest.The
other, known as the Fethîyeh Djamisi, is smaller and more complete, and
possesses some mosaics of considerable beauty.Elevation of Church of the Theotokos.(From Lenoir,
‘Architecture Monastique.’) Enlarged scale.]The best example of its class, however, in Constantinople is that known
as the Theotokos.Like those just mentioned it is very small, the church
itself being only 37 ft.by 45, and, though its double narthex and
lateral adjuncts add considerably to its dimensions, it is still only a
very small church.Some parts of it are as old as the 9th or 10th
century, but the façade represented in Woodcut No.333 is certainly not
older than the 12th century.Taking it altogether, it is perhaps the
most complete and elegant church of its class now known to exist in or
near the capital, and many of its details are of great beauty and
perfection.It seems scarcely possible to suppose that the meagre half-dozen of
small churches just enumerated are all that were erected in the capital
between the death of Justinian and the fall of the city.Yet there is no
evidence that the Turks destroyed any.They converted
them into mosques, finding them especially convenient for that purpose,
and they have maintained them with singularly little alteration to the
present day.This deficiency of examples in the capital is to some extent supplied by
those which are found existing at Thessalonica.Three churches belonging
to this age are illustrated in Texier and Pullan’s work.Apse of Church of the Apostles, Thessalonica.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]The first of these is the church of Kazandjita Djami, dedicated to the
Mother of God, a small church measuring only 53 ft.by 37, exclusive of
the apse.Its date is perfectly ascertained—viz., 1028.Next to these comes the church of Elias, A.D.1054, and very similar to
it in style is that of the Apostles (Woodcut No.334), which we may
consequently date with safety in the 11th century, from this
juxtaposition alone, though there are several other examples which
enable us to treat it as a characteristic type of the age.It is a
pleasing and picturesque specimen of Byzantine brickwork.Like all the
churches of the time, it is small, 63 ft.In plan it
very much resembles the Theotokos at Constantinople, but in elevation is
taller and thinner; though whether this arises from any local
peculiarity, or from some difference of age, is not clear.The earthquakes of the capital may have induced a less ambitious
form, as far as height is concerned, than was adopted in the provinces.There can be little doubt but that, if a systematic search were made
among the churches of Greece, many would be brought to light which would
be most useful in completing our knowledge of the Neo-Byzantine
style.[236] At Mount Athos there exists from twenty to thirty
monasteries, each with its Catholicon or principal church and other
chapels.Many of these are of ancient date, ranging between the 10th and
16th centuries, and although some of them may have been restored, in
some cases rebuilt in later times, they have not yet been examined or
illustrated by any competent architect.Brockhaus in his work[237] gives
the plan of three churches, one of which, the Catholicon (dated 1043) of
the Dochiariu Monastery (Woodcut No.335), is further illustrated by a
bird’s-eye view taken from a photograph.The domes and drums over the
narthex and two eastern chapels would seem to be later additions, made
either in consequence of the proximity of the buildings of the monastery
which obscured the light obtainable from windows, or to show better the
wall frescoes, which in the case of the narthex, where no windows ever
existed, must have been quite dark at first.The oldest church (963
A.D.)apparently is that of the Protaton at Caryas, which consists of a
short nave, a transept, and a long choir, and is wanting in that one
feature which is supposed to be characteristic of a Byzantine church,
viz., a dome; the whole building is covered like a basilica with a flat
wooden roof, beneath which are clerestory windows.Photogravures or
woodcuts are given of the churches of Chilandari (1197 A.D.), Xeropotamu
(1028-34 A.D.), the Laura (963 A.D., but rebuilt under Turkish rule),
and woodcuts from photographs in an interesting description of the
Monasteries by Mr.A. Riley,[238] give a good general idea of the work
to be found in Athos, from which it would seem that the chief interest
centres in the sumptuous carvings of the icon and stalls,[239] and in
the frescoes with which most of the interiors of the churches are
painted.For Greece proper we are dependent almost wholly on Couchaud[240] and
Blouet.[241] So far as the illustrations go they suggest that there are
no churches of such dimensions as would ensure dignity, nor are any so
beautiful in outline or detail as to make us regret much that we do not
know more about them.Still they are sufficiently original to be worthy
of study, and when properly known may help to join together some of the
scattered links of the chain which once connected the architecture of
the West and East, but which is at present so difficult to follow out.In Athens there are several churches of considerable interest, and not
without architectural pretension.The
largest is that known as Panagia Lycodemo, or the church of St.Nicodemus, and is only 62 ft.It seems
also to be the oldest, since its dome is partially pierced with windows
inside, though outside there is a distinctly marked drum (Woodcut No.Notwithstanding the smallness of its dimensions, considerable
effect is obtained internally by the judicious arrangement of the parts
and the harmony of proportion which reigns throughout.The exterior is
also pleasing, though the loss of the cornice gives an unfinished look
to the whole, and there is a want of sufficient connection between the
dome and the walls of the building to make them part of one composition.A more beautiful and more interesting example is the church known as the
Catholicon or Cathedral at Athens (Woodcut No.It is a cathedral,
however, only in a Greek sense, certainly not as understood in the Latin
Church, for its dimensions are only 40 ft.It
is almost impossible to judge of its age from its details, since they
are partly borrowed from older classical buildings, or imitations of
classical forms, so fashioned as to harmonize with parts which are old.But the tallness of its dome, the form of its windows, and the internal
arrangements, all point to a very modern date for its erection—as
probably the 13th century as the 11th or 12th.The church of the Virgin at Mistra in the Peloponnesus was built in the
13th century on a hillside overlooking the plain of Sparta, and partly
with materials taken from the remains of the ancient city; but though it
belongs possibly to the same age as the Catholicon at Athens, it differs
considerably from it in style, and bears much more resemblance to the
churches of Apulia and Sicily than either of those described above.(From Couchaud, ‘Églises
Byzantines en Grèce.’) Enlarged scale.]Where arcades are used externally in these Greek churches, they are
generally supported by pillars of somewhat classical look (often old
classic columns and capitals were used up), crowned by capitals of the
square foliaged form, employed to support arches in the early styles all
over Europe; and the windows, when divided, take merely the form of
diminutive arcades.The Byzantines never attained to tracery; all their
early windows are single round-headed openings.These were afterwards
grouped together in threes and fives; and, as in the Gothic style, when
they could be put under one discharging arch, the piers were attenuated
till they became almost mullions, but always supporting constructive
arches, without any tendency to run into interlacing forms like the
Gothic.The universal employment of mural painting in Byzantine
churches, and the consequent exclusion of painted glass, rendered the
use of the large windows which the Gothic architects employed quite
inadmissible; and in such a climate very much smaller openings sufficed
to admit all the light that was required.Tracery would thus, in fact,
have been an absurdity, and the windows were often filled in with
transparent marble slabs pierced with holes, which were either glazed or
occasionally even left open.The Byzantine architects sought to ornament
their windows externally by the employment of tiles or colours disposed
in various patterns, and often produced a very pleasing effect, as may
be seen from the woodcut (No.337) illustrating the apse of the Panagia
Lycodemo at Athens, in the Hebdomon Palace (Woodcut No.342), and other
specimens already quoted.Occasionally we find in these churches projecting porches or balconies,
and machicolations, which give great relief to the general flatness of
the walls.These features are all marked with that elegance peculiar to
the East, and more especially to a people claiming descent from the
ancient Greeks, and possibly having some of their blood in their veins.Sometimes, too, even a subordinate apse is supported on a bracket-like
balcony, so as to form a very pleasing object, as in the accompanying
specimen from Mistra.On the whole the Neo-Byzantine style may be said to be characterised by
considerable elegance, with occasional combinations of a superior order;
but after the time of Justinian the country was too deficient in unity
or science to attempt anything great or good, and too poor to aspire to
grandeur, so that it has no claim to rank among the great styles of the
earth.[242] The old Byzantine style was elevated to a first-class
position through the buildings of Justinian; but from his time the
history of the art is a history of decline, like that of the Eastern
Empire itself and of Greece, down to the final extinction both of the
Empire and the style, under the successive conquests by the Venetians
and the Turks.The only special claim which the Neo-Byzantine style
makes upon our sympathies or attention is that of being the direct
descendant of Greek and Roman art.As such, it forms a connecting link
between the past and present which must not be overlooked, while in
itself it has sufficient merit to reward the student who shall apply
himself to its elucidation.Palace of the Hebdomon, Constantinople.]It is more than probable that very considerable remains of the civil or
domestic architecture of the Neo-Byzantine period may still be
recovered.Most of their palaces or public buildings have continued to
be occupied by their successors, but the habits of Turkish life are
singularly opposed to the prying of the archæologist.Almost the only
building which has been brought to light and illustrated is the palace
of the Hebdomon at Blachernæ in Constantinople, built by Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (913-949).All that remains of it, however, is a block
of buildings 80 ft.by 40 in plan, forming one end of a courtyard; those
at the other end, which were more extensive, being too much ruined to be
restored.The parts that remain probably belong to the 9th century, and
consist of two halls, one over the other, the lower supported by pillars
carrying vaults, the upper free.The façade towards the court (Woodcut
342) is of considerable elegance, being adorned by a mosaic of bricks of
various colours disposed in graceful patterns, and forming an
architectural decoration which, if not of the highest class, is very
appropriate for domestic architecture.One great cause of the deficiency of examples may be the combustibility
of the capital.They may have been destroyed in the various fires, and
outside Constantinople the number of large cities and their wealth and
importance was gradually decreasing till the capital itself sunk into
the power of the Turks in the year 1453.CHAPTER V.

The architectural province of Armenia forms an almost exact pendant to
that of Greece in the history of Byzantine architecture.Both were early
converted to Christianity, and Greece remained Christian without any
interruption from that time to this.Yet all her earlier churches have
perished, we hardly know why, and left us nothing but an essentially
Mediæval style.Nearly the same thing happened in Armenia, but there the
loss is only too easily accounted for.The Persian persecution in the
5th and 6th centuries must have been severe and lasting, and the great
_bouleversement_ of the Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century would
easily account for the disappearance of all the earlier monuments.When,
in more tranquil times—in the 8th and 9th centuries—the Christians were
permitted to rebuild their churches, we find them all of the same small
type as those of Greece, with tall domes, painted with frescoes
internally, and depending for external effect far more on minute
elaboration of details than on any grandeur of design or proportion.Although the troubles and persecutions from the 5th to the 8th century
may have caused the destruction of the greater part of the monuments, it
by no means follows that all have perished.On the contrary, we know of
the church above alluded to (p.428) as still existing at Nisibin and
belonging to the 4th century, and there can be little doubt that many
others exist in various corners of the land; but they have hardly yet
been looked for, at least not by anyone competent to discriminate
between what was really old and what may have belonged to some
subsequent rebuilding or repair.Till this more careful examination of the province shall have been
accomplished, our history of the style cannot be carried back beyond the
Hejira.Even then very great difficulty exists in arranging the
materials, and in assigning correct dates to the various examples.In
the works of Texier,[243] Dubois,[244] Brosset,[245] and Grimm[246] some
forty or fifty churches are described and figured in more or less
detail, but in most cases the dates assigned to them are derived from
written testimony only, the authors not having sufficient knowledge of
the style to be able to check the very fallacious evidence of the
_litera scripta_.In consequence of this, the dates usually given are
those of the building of the first church on the spot, whereas, in a
country so troubled by persecution as Armenia, the original church may
have been rebuilt several times, and what we now see is often very
modern indeed.Among the churches now existing in Armenia, the oldest seems to be that
in the village of Dighour near Ani.There are neither traditions nor
inscriptions to assist in fixing its date; but, from the simplicity of
its form and its quasi-classical details, it is evidently older than any
other known examples, and with the aid of the information conveyed in De
Vogüé’s recent publications we can have little hesitation in assigning
it to the 7th century.[247] The church is not large, being only 95 ft.Internally its design is characterised by
extreme solidity and simplicity, and all the details are singularly
classical in outline.The dome is an ellipse, timidly constructed, with
far more than the requisite amount of abutment.One of its most marked
peculiarities is the existence of two external niches placed in
projecting wings and which were no doubt intended to receive altars.Its
flanks are ornamented by three-quarter columns of debased classical
design.These support an architrave which is bent over the heads of the
windows as in the churches of Northern Syria erected during the 6th
century.Its western and lateral doorways are ornamented by horse-shoe arches,
which are worth remarking here, as it is a feature which the Saracenic
architects used so currently and employed for almost every class of
opening.The oldest example of this form known is in the doorway of the
building called Takt-i-Gero on Mount Zagros.[248] In this little shrine,
all the other details are so purely and essentially classic that the
building must be dated before or about the time of Constantine.The
horse-shoe arch again occurs in the church at Dana on the Euphrates in
540.[249] At Dighour we find it used, not in construction but as an
ornamental feature.The stilting of the arch was evidently one of those
experiments which the architects of that time were making in order to
free themselves from the trammels of the Roman semi-circular arch.The
Saracens carried it much further and used it with marked success, but
this is probably the last occasion in which it was employed by a
Christian architect as a decorative expedient.The six buttresses, with their offsets, which adorn the façade, are
another curious feature in the archæology of this church.If they are
integral parts of the original design, which there seems no reason to
doubt, they anticipate by several centuries the appearance of this form
in Western Europe.West Elevation of Church at Usunlar.One of the oldest and least altered of the Armenian churches seems to be
that of Usunlar, said to have been erected by the Catholicos Jean IV.In plan it looks like a peristylar
temple, but the verandahs which surround it are only low arcades, and
have very little affinity with classical forms.These are carried round
the front, but there pierced only by the doorway.The elevation, as here
exhibited, is simple, but sufficiently expresses the internal
arrangements, and, with an octagonal dome, forms, when seen in
perspective, a pleasing object from every point of view.Both plan and
design are, however, exceptional in the province.A far more usual
arrangement is that found at Pitzounda in Abkassia, which may be
considered as the typical form of an Armenian church.It is said to have
been erected by the Emperor Justinian, and there is nothing in the style
or ornamentation of the lower part that seems to gainsay its being his.But the plan is so like many that belong to a much later age, that we
must hesitate before we can feel sure that it has not been rebuilt at
some more modern date.Its cupola certainly belongs to a period long
after the erection of Sta.327),
when the dome pierced with tall windows had become the fashionable form
of dome in the Byzantine school.Its interior, also, is unusually tall,
and the pointed arches under the dome look like integral parts of the
design, and when so employed belong certainly to a much more modern
date.On the whole, therefore, it seems that this church, as we now see
it, may have been rebuilt in the 9th or 10th century.Whatever its date, it is a pleasing example of the style.Externally it
is devoid of ornament except what is obtained by the insertion of tiles
between the courses of the stone, and a similar relief to the windows;
but even this little introduction of colour gives it a gay and cheerful
appearance, more than could easily be obtained by mouldings or carving
in stone.The upper galleries of the nave and the chapels of the choir are also
well expressed in the external design, and altogether, for a small
church—which it is (only 137 ft.by 75)—it is as pleasing a composition
as could easily be found.The idea that the date of this church is considerably more modern than
Dubois and others are inclined to assign to it, is confirmed by a
comparison of its plan with that at Bedochwinta, which Brosset
determines from inscriptions to belong to the date 1556-1575; and the
knowledge lately acquired tends strongly to the conviction that this
plan of church belongs to a later period in the Middle Ages, though it
is difficult to determine when it was introduced, and it may be only a
continuation of a much earlier form.One other church of this part of the world seems to claim especial
mention, that of Mokwi, built in the 10th century, and painted as we
learn from inscriptions, between 1080 and 1125.It is a large and
handsome church, but its principal interest lies in the fact that in
dimensions and arrangement it is almost identical with the
contemporaneous church of Sta.Sophia at Novogorod, showing a connection
between the two countries which will be more particularly pointed out
hereafter.It is now very much ruined, and covered with a veil of
creepers which prevents its outward form from being easily
distinguished.Mary went back to the bedroom.[250]]

As will be perceived, its plan is only an extension of the two last
mentioned, having five aisles instead of three; but it is smaller in
scale and more timid in execution.The church which it most resembles is
that at Trabala in Syria (Woodcut No.330), which is certainly of an
earlier date than any we are acquainted with further east.Practically
the same plan occurs at Athens (Woodcut No.338), and at Mistra (Woodcut
No.339), but these seem on a smaller scale than at Mokwi, so that it
may be considered as the typical form of a Neo-Byzantine church for four
or five centuries, and it would consequently be unsafe to attempt to fix
a date from its peculiarities.Plan of Church at Etchmiasdin.Interesting as these may be in an historical point of view, the most
important ecclesiastical establishment in this part of the world is that
of Etchmiasdin.Here are four churches built on the spots from which,
according to tradition, rose the two arches or rainbows, crossing one
another at right angles, on which our Saviour is said to have sat when
he appeared to St.They consequently ought to be at the four
angles of a square, or rectangle of some sort, but this is far from
being the case.The principal of these churches is that whose plan is
represented in Woodcut No.It stands in the centre of a large
square, surrounded by ecclesiastical buildings, and is on the whole
rather an imposing edifice.Its porch is modern; so also, comparatively
speaking, is its dome; but the plan, if not the greater part of the
substructure, is ancient, and exhibits the plainness and simplicity
characteristic of its age.The other three churches lay claim to as
remote a date of foundation as this, but all have been so altered in
modern times that they have now no title to antiquity.The idea that the churches at Pitzounda and Bedochwinta must be
comparatively modern is confirmed by comparing their plan with that of
Kouthais, a church which there seems no reasonable ground for doubting
was founded in 1007, and erected, pretty much as we now find it, in the
early part of the 11th century.It has neither coupled piers nor pointed
arches, but is adorned externally with reed-like pilasters and elaborate
frets, such as were certainly employed at Ani in the course of the 11th
century.355) of one of its windows
exhibits the Armenian style of decoration of this age, but is such as
certainly was not employed before this time, though with various
modifications it became typical of the style at its period of greatest
development.Even Etchmiasdin, however, sinks into insignificance, in an
architectural point of view, when compared with Ani, which was the
capital of Armenia during its period of greatest unity and elevation,
and was adorned by the Bagratide dynasty with a series of buildings
which still strike the traveller with admiration, at least for the
beauty of their details; for, like all churches in this part of the
world, they are very small.If, however, the cathedral at Ani is
interesting to the architect from its style, it is still more so to the
archæologist from its date, since there seems no reason to doubt that it
was built in the year 1010, as recorded in an inscription on its walls.This, perhaps, might be put on one side as a mistake, if it were not
that there are two beautiful inscriptions on the façade, one of which is
dated 1049, the other 1059.To this we must add our knowledge that the
city was sacked by Alp Arslan in 1064, and that the dynasty which alone
could erect such a monument was extinguished in 1080.With all this
evidence, it is startling to find a church not only with pointed arches
but with coupled piers and all the characteristics of a complete
pointed-arch style, such as might be found in Italy or Sicily not
earlier than the 13th century.This peculiarity is, however, confined to
the constructive parts of the interior.The plan is that of Pitzounda or
Bedochwinta, modified only by the superior constructive arrangement
which the pointed arch enabled the architects to introduce; and
externally the only pointed arch anywhere to be detected, is in the
transept, where the arch of the vault is simulated to pass through to
the exterior.In the plan and elevation of the building will be observed a peculiarity
which was afterwards almost universal in the style.It is the angular
recess which marks the form of the apses outside without breaking the
main lines of the building.In the lateral elevation of this cathedral
(Woodcut No.358) they are introduced on each side of the portal where
the construction did not require them, in order to match those at the
east end.But in the Cathedral at Samthawis (Woodcut No.359) they are
seen in their proper places on each side of the central apse.Though
this church was erected between the years 1050-1079, we find these
niches adorned with a foliation (Woodcut No.360) very like what we are
accustomed to consider the invention of the 14th century in Europe,
though even more elegant than anything of its class used by the Gothic
architects.At Sandjerli, not far from Ani, is another church, which from
inscriptions translated by M. Brosset, and from sections given by him,
appears to belong to the same date (1033-1044), and to possess coupled
columns and pointed arches like those of the cathedral of Ani, which
indeed it resembles in many points, and which renders the date above
given highly probable.East Elevation of Chapel at Samthawis.The plans above quoted may probably be taken as those most typical of
the style, but in no part of the world are the arrangements of churches
so various.All being small, there were no constructive difficulties to
be encountered, and as no congregation was to be accommodated, the
architects apparently considered themselves at liberty to follow their
fancies in any manner that occurred to them.The consequence is that the
plans of Armenian churches defy classification; some are square, or
rectangles of every conceivable proportion of length to breadth, some
octagons or hexagons, and some of the most indescribable irregularity.Frequently two, three, or four are grouped and joined together.In some
instances the sacred number of seven are coupled together in one design,
though more generally each little church is an independent erection; but
they are all so small that their plans are of comparatively little
importance.No grandeur of effect or poetry of perspective can be
obtained without considerable dimensions, and these are not to be found
in Armenia.(From Layard’s ‘Nineveh and
Babylon.’)]

There are also some examples of circular churches, but these are far
from being numerous.Generally speaking they are tombs, or connected
with sepulchral rites, and are indeed mere amplifications of the usual
tombs of the natives of the country, which are generally little models
of the domes of Armenian churches placed on the ground, though perhaps
it would be more correct to say that the domes were copied from the
tombs than the reverse.The most elegant of all those hitherto made known is one found at Ani,
illustrated in Woodcuts Nos.Notwithstanding the smallness of
its dimensions, it is one of the most elegant sepulchral chapels known.Another on a larger scale (Woodcut No.This tomb shows all the peculiarities of the Armenian
style of the 11th or 12th century.Though so much larger, it is by no
means so beautiful as the last mentioned tomb at Ani.In its
ornamentation a further refinement is introduced, inasmuch as the
reed-like columns are tied together by true love-knots instead of
capitals—a freak not uncommon either in Europe at the same age, or in
the East at the present day, but by no means to be recommended as an
architectural expedient.With scarcely an exception, all the buildings in the Armenian provinces
are so small that they would hardly deserve a place in a history of
architecture were it not for the ingenuity of their plans and the
elegance of their details.The beauty of the latter is so remarkable
that, in order to convey a correct notion of the style, it would be
necessary to illustrate them to an extent incompatible with the scope of
this work.In them too will be found much that has hitherto been
ascribed to other sources.364), for
instance, would generally be put down as Saracenic of the best age, but
it belongs, with a great deal more quite as elegant, to one of the
churches at Ani; and the capital from Gelathi (Woodcut No.365) would
not excite attention if found in Ireland.The interlacing scrolls which
occupy its head are one of the most usual as well as one of the most
elegant modes of decoration employed in the province, and are applied
with a variety and complexity nowhere else found in stone, though they
may be equalled in some works illustrated by the pen.Besides, however, its beauty in an artistic point of view, this basket
pattern, as it is sometimes called, is still more so as an Ethnographic
indication which, when properly investigated, may lead to the most
important conclusions.366, 367, and
368, taken from churches at a now deserted village called Ish Khan, will
serve to explain its more usual forms; but it occurs almost everywhere
in the Armenian architectural province, and with as infinite a variety
of details as are to be found with its employment in Irish manuscripts.Window in small Church at Ish Khan, Tortoom.Jamb of doorway at Ish Khan Church, Armenia.Out of Armenia it occurs in the church at Kurtea el Argyisch in
Wallachia (Woodcut No.385), and is found in Hungary and Styria, and no
antiquary will probably fail to recognise it as the most usual and
beautiful pattern on Irish crosses and Scotch sculptured stones.On the
other hand it occurs frequently in the monolithic deepdans or lamp-posts
and in the temples on the Canarese or West Coast of India, and in all
these instances with so little change of form that it is almost
impossible that these examples should be independent inventions.Still
the gaps in the sequence are so great that it is very difficult to see
how they could emanate from one centre.Few, however, who know anything
of the early architecture of Ireland can fancy that it did come from
Rome across Great Britain, but that it must have had its origin further
east, among some people using groups of churches and small cells,
instead of congregational basilicas.So far, too, as we can yet see, it
is to the East we must look for the original design of the mysterious
round towers which form so characteristic a feature of Irish
architecture, and were afterwards so conspicuous as minars in the East,
and nowhere more so than in Armenia.Recent researches, too, are making
it more and more clear that Nestorian churches did exist all down the
West Coast of India from a very early period, so that it would not be
impossible that from Persia and Armenia they introduced the favourite
style of ornament.All this may seem idle speculation, and it may turn out that the
similarities are accidental, but at present it certainly does not look
as if they were, and if they do emanate from a common centre, tracing
them back to their original may lead to such curious ethnological and
historical conclusions that it is at all events worth while pointing
them out in order that others may pursue the investigation to its
legitimate conclusion.Taken altogether, Armenian architecture is far more remarkable for
elegance than for grandeur, and possesses none of that greatness of
conception or beauty of outline essential to an important architectural
style.It is still worthy of more attention than it has hitherto
received, even for its own sake.Its great title to interest will always
be its ethnological value, being the direct descendant of the Sassanian
style, and the immediate parent of that of Russia.At the same time,
standing on the eastern confines of the Byzantine Empire, it received
thence that impress of Christian art which distinguished it from the
former, and which it transmitted to the latter.It thus forms one of
those important links in the chain of architectural history which when
lost render the study of the subject so dark and perplexed, but when
appreciated add so immensely to its philosophical interest.ROCK-CUT CHURCHES.Churches at Tchekerman, Inkerman, and Sebastopol—Excavations at Kieghart
  and Vardzie.Intermediate between the Armenian province which has just been described
and the Russian, which comes next in the series, lies a territory of
more than usual interest to the archæologist, though hardly demanding
more than a passing notice in a work devoted to architecture.In the
neighbourhood of Kertch, which was originally colonised by a people of
Grecian or Pelasgic origin, are found numerous tumuli and sepulchres
belonging generally to the best age of Greek art, but which, barring
some slight local peculiarities, would hardly seem out of place in the
cemeteries of Etruria or Crete.At a later age it was from the shores of the Palus Mœotis and the
Caucasus that tradition makes Woden migrate to Scandinavia, bearing with
him that form of Buddhism[251] which down to the 11th century remained
the religion of the North—while, as if to mark the presence of some
strange people in the land, we find everywhere rock-cut excavations of a
character, to say the least of it, very unusual in the West.These have not yet been examined with the care necessary to enable us to
speak very positively regarding them;[252] but, from what we do know, it
seems that they were not in any instance tombs, like those in Italy and
many of those in Africa or Syria.Nor can we positively assert that any
of them were viharas or monasteries[253] like most of those in India.Generally they seem to have been ordinary dwellings, but in some
instances appropriated by the Christians and formed into churches.(From Dubois de Montpereux.)]One, apparently, of the oldest is a rectangular excavation at Tchekerman
in the Crimea.in length by 21 in width, with hardly any
decoration on its walls, but having in the centre a choir with four
pillars on each face, which there seems no doubt was originally devoted
to Christian purposes.The cross on the low screen that separates it
from the nave is too deeply cut and too evidently integral to have been
added.But for this it would seem to have been intended for a Buddhist
vihara.(From Dubois de
Montpereux.)]Under the fortress at Inkerman—facing the position held by our
army—there is an excavation undoubtedly of Christian origin.It is a
small church with side-aisles, apse, and all the necessary
accompaniments.Beyond this is a square excavation apparently intended
as a refectory, and other apartments devoted to the use of a monastic
establishment.These again are so like what we find among the Buddhist
excavations in India as to be quite startling.The one point in which
this church differs from a Buddhist chaitya is that the aisle does not
run round behind the altar.This is universally the case in Buddhist,
but only exceptionally so in Christian, churches.Close to Sebastopol is another small church cave with its accompanying
monastery.This one is said to be comparatively modern, and if its
paintings are parts of the original design it may be so, but no certain
data are given for fixing the age of the last two examples.That under
the fortress (Woodcut No.371) seems, however, to be of considerable
antiquity.There is one which in plan is very like those just described at Vardzie,
said to belong to the 12th century, and another, almost absolutely
identical with a Buddhist vihara, at Kieghart in Armenia, which has a
date upon it, A.D.On the banks of the Kour, however, at Ouplous-Tsikhe and Vardzie, are
some excavations which are either temples or monasteries, and which
range from the Christian era downwards.These are generally assumed to
be residences—one is called the palace of Queen Thamar—and they were
evidently intended for some stately purpose.Yet they were not temples
in any sense in which that term would be employed by the Greek or Roman
world.Whatever their destination, these rock-cut examples make, when
taken altogether, as curious a group of monuments as are to be found in
this corner of Asia, and which may lead afterwards to curious
archæological inferences.At present we are hardly in a position to
speculate on the subject, and merely point to it here as one well
meriting further investigation.MEDIÆVAL ARCHITECTURE OF RUSSIA.Churches at Kief—Novogorod—Moscow—Towers.Rurik the Varangian at Novogorod   A.D.850

The long series of the architectural styles of the Christian world which
has been described in the preceding pages terminates most appropriately
with the description of the art of a people who had less knowledge of
architecture and less appreciation of its beauties than any other with
which we are acquainted.During the Middle Ages the Russians did not
erect one single building which is worthy of admiration, either from its
dimensions, its design, or the elegance of its details; nor did they
invent one single architectural feature which can be called their own.It is true the Tartars brought with them their bulbous form of dome, and
the Russians adopted it, and adhere to it to the present day,
unconscious that it is the symbol of their subjection to a race they
affect to despise; but excepting as regards this one feature, their
architecture is only a bad and debased copy of the style of the
Byzantine Empire.There is nothing, in fact, in the architecture of the
country to lead us to doubt that the mass of the population of Russia
was always of purely Aryan stock, speaking a language more nearly allied
to the Sanskrit than any of the other Mediæval tongues of Europe, and
that whatever amount of Tartar blood may have been imported, it was not
sufficient to cure the inartistic tendencies of the race.So much is
this felt to be the case, that the Russians themselves hardly lay claim
to the design of a single building in their country from the earliest
times to the present day.They admit that all the churches at Kief,
their earliest capital, were erected by Greek architects; those of
Moscow by Italians or Germans; while those of St.Petersburg, we know,
were, with hardly a single exception, erected by Italian, German, or
French architects.These last have perpetrated caricatures of revived
Roman architecture worse than are to be found anywhere else.Bad as are
some of the imitations of Roman art found in western Europe, they are
all the work of native artists; are, partially at least, adapted to the
climate, and common-sense peeps through their worst absurdities; but in
Russia only second-class foreigners have been employed, and the result
is a style that out-herods Herod in absurdity and bad taste.Architecture has languished not only in Russia, but wherever the
Sclavonic race predominates.In Poland, Hungary, Moldavia, Wallachia,
&c., although some of these countries have at times been rich and
prosperous, there is not a single original structure worthy to be placed
in comparison with even the second-class contemporary buildings of the
Celtic or Teutonic races.Besides the ethnographic inaptitude of the nation, however, there are
other causes which would lead us to anticipate, _à priori_, that nothing
either great or beautiful was likely to exist in the Mediæval
architecture of Russia.In the first place, from the conversion of Olga
(964) to the accession of Peter the Great (1689), with whom the national
style expired, the country hardly emerged from barbarism.Torn by
internal troubles, or devastated by incursions of the Tartars, the
Russians never enjoyed the repose necessary for the development of art,
and the country was too thinly peopled to admit of that concentration of
men necessary for the carrying out of any great architectural
undertaking.Another cause of bad architecture is found in the material used, which
is almost universally brick covered with plaster; and it is well known
that the tendency of plaster architecture is constantly to extravagance
in detail and bad taste in every form.It is also extremely
perishable,—a fact which opens the way to repairs and alterations in
defiance of congruity and taste, and to the utter annihilation of
everything like archæological value in the building.When the material was not brick it was wood, like most of the houses in
Russia of the present day; and the destroying hand of time, aided no
doubt by fire and the Tartar invasions, have swept away many buildings
which would serve to fill up gaps, now, it is feared, irremediable in
the history of the art.Notwithstanding all this, the history of architecture in Russia need not
be considered as entirely a blank, or as wholly devoid of interest.Locally we can follow the history of the style from the south to the
north.Springing originally from two roots—one at Constantinople, the
other in Armenia—it gradually extended itself northward.It first
established itself at Cherson, then at Kief, and after these at Vladimir
and Moscow, whence it spread to the great commercial city of Novogorod.At all these places it maintained itself till supplanted by the rise of
St.Though the Princess Olga was baptised in 955, the general profession of
Christianity in Russia did not take place till the reign of Vladimir
(981-1015).He built the wooden cathedral at Cherson, which has
perished.At Kief the same monarch built the church of Dessiatinnaya,
the remains of which existed till within the last few years, when they
were removed to give place to a modern reproduction.Basil in the same city, which, notwithstanding modern
improvements, still retains its ancient plan, and is nearly identical in
arrangement and form with the Catholicon at Athens (Woodcut No.372) gives a fair idea of the usual dimensions of
the older churches of Russia.The parts shaded lighter are subsequent
additions.A greater builder than Vladimir was Prince Yaroslaf (1019-1054).Irene at Kief (Woodcut No.373), the ruins of
which still exist.It is a good specimen of the smaller class of
churches of that date.His great works were the cathedrals of Kief and Novogorod, both
dedicated to Sta.Sophia, and with the church at Mokwi quoted above
(Woodcut No.352) forming the most interesting group of Russian churches
of that age.All three belong to the 11th century, and are so extremely
similar in plan, that, deducting the subsequent additions from the two
Russian examples, they may almost be said to be identical.They also
show so intimate a connection between the places on the great commercial
road from the Caucasus to the Baltic, that they point out at once the
line along which we must look for the origin of the style.Of the three, that at Kief[254] (Woodcut No.374) is the largest; but it
is nearly certain that the two outer aisles are subsequent additions,
and that the original church was confined to the remaining seven aisles.As it now stands its dimensions are 185 ft.from north to south, and 136
from east to west.It consequently covers only about 25,000 ft., or not
half the usual dimensions of a Western cathedral of the same class.As
will be perceived, its plan is like that of the churches of Asia Minor,
so far as the central aisles are concerned.In lateral extension it
resembles a mosque, a form elsewhere very unusual in Christian churches,
but which here may be a Tartar peculiarity.At all events it is
generally found in Russian churches, which never adopt the long
basilican form of the West.If their length in an eastern and western
direction ever exceeds the breadth, it is only by taking in the narthex
with the body of the church.East End of the Church at Novogorod.Internally this church retains many of its original arrangements, and
many decorations which, if not original, are at least restorations or
copies of those which previously occupied their places.Externally it
has been so repaired and rebuilt that it is difficult to detect what
belongs to the original work.In this respect the church of Novogorod has been more fortunate.Owing
to the early decline of the town it has not been much modernised.The
interior retains many of its primitive features.Among other furniture
is a pair of bronze doors of Italian workmanship of the 12th century
closely resembling those of San Zenone at Verona.The part of the
exterior that retains most of its early features is the eastern end,
represented in the Woodcut No.It retains the long reed-like shafts
which the Armenians borrowed from the Sassanians, and which penetrated
even to this remote corner.Whether the two lower circular apses shown
in the view are old is by no means clear: but it is probable that they
are at least built on ancient foundations.The domes on the roof, and
indeed all the upper part of the building, belong to a more modern date
than the substructure.The cathedral of Tchernigow, near Kief, founded 1024, retains perhaps
more of its original appearance externally than any other church of its
age.Like almost all Russian churches it is square in plan, with a dome
in the centre surrounded by four smaller cupolas placed diagonally at
the corners.To the eastward are three apses, and the narthex is flanked
by two round towers, the upper parts of which, with the roofs, have been
modernised, but the whole of the walls remain as originally erected,
especially the end of the transept, which precisely resembles what we
find in Greek Churches of the period.(From Blasius, ‘Reise in
Russland.’)]

To the same age belong the convent of the Volkof (1100) and of Yourief
at Novogorod, the church of the Ascension, and several others at Kief.All these are so modernised as, except in their plans, to show but
slight traces of their origin.Another of the great buildings of the age was the cathedral of Vladimir
(1046).It is said to have been built, like the rest, by Greek artists.The richness and beauty of this building have been celebrated by early
travellers, but it has been entirely passed over by more modern writers.From this it is perhaps to be inferred that its ancient form is
completely disguised in modern alterations.The ascendency of Kief was of short duration.Early in the 13th century
the city suffered greatly from civil wars, fires, and devastations of
every description, which humbled her pride, and inflicted ruin upon her
from which she never wholly recovered.Vladimir was after this the residence of the grand dukes, and in the
beginning of the 14th century Moscow became the capital, which it
continued to be till the seat of empire was transferred by Peter the
Great to St.During these three centuries Moscow was no
doubt adorned with many important buildings, since almost every church
traces its foundation back to the 14th century; but as fires and Tartar
invasions have frequently swept over the city since then, few retain any
of the features of their original foundation, and it may therefore
perhaps be well to see what can be gleaned in the provinces before
describing the buildings of the capital.As far as can be gathered from the sketch-books of travellers or their
somewhat meagre notes, there are few towns of Russia of any importance
during the Middle Ages which do not possess churches said to have been
founded in the first centuries after its conversion to Christianity;
though whether the existing buildings are the originals, or how far they
may have been altered and modernised, will not be known till some
archæologist visits the country, directing his attention to this
particular inquiry.Although the Russians probably built as great a
number of churches as any nation of Christendom, yet like the Greek
churches they were all undoubtedly small.Kief is said, even in the age
of Yaroslaf, to have contained 400 churches; Vladimir nearly as many.Moscow, in the year 1600, had 400 (thirty-seven of which were in the
Kremlin), and now possesses many more.Many of the village churches still retain their ancient features; the
example here given of one near Novogorod belongs probably to the 12th
century, and is not later than the 13th.It retains its shafted apse,
its bulb-shaped Tartar dome, and, as is always the case in Russia, a
square detached belfry—though in this instance apparently more modern
than the edifice itself.378 is the type of a great number
of the old village churches, which, like the houses of the peasants, are
of wood, generally of logs laid one on the other, with their round ends
intersecting at the angles, like the log-huts of America at the present
day.As architectural objects they are of course insignificant, but
still they are characteristic and picturesque.Village Church near Tzarskoe Selo.Internally all the arrangements of the stone churches are such as are
appropriate for pictorial rather than for sculptural decoration.The
pillars are generally large cylinders covered with portraits of saints,
and the capitals are plain, cushion-like rolls with painted ornaments.The vaults are not relieved by ribs, or by any projections that could
interfere with the  decorations.In the wooden churches the
construction is plainly shown, and of course is far lighter.In them
also colour almost wholly supersedes carving.The peculiarities of these
two styles are well illustrated in the two Woodcuts, Nos.379 and 380,
from churches near Kostroma in Eastern Russia.Both belong to the Middle
Ages, and both are favourable specimens of their respective classes.In
these examples, as indeed in every Greek church, the principal object of
ecclesiastical furniture is the _iconostasis_ or image-bearer,
corresponding to the rood-screen that separates the choir from the nave
in Latin churches.The rood-screen, however, never assumed in the West
the importance which the iconostasis always possessed in the East.There
it separates and hides from the church the sanctuary and the altar, from
which the laity are wholly excluded.Within it the elements are
consecrated, in the presence of the priests alone, and are then brought
forward to be displayed to the public.On this screen, as performing so
important a part, the Greek architects and artists have lavished the
greatest amount of care and design, and in every Greek church, from St.Mark’s at Venice to the extreme confines of Russia, it is the object
that first attracts attention on entering.It is, in fact, so important
that it must be regarded rather as an object of architecture than of
church furniture.The architectural details of these Russian churches must be pronounced
to be bad; for, even making every allowance for difference of taste,
there is neither beauty of form nor constructive elegance in any part.The most characteristic and pleasing features are the five domes that
generally ornament the roofs, and which, when they rise from the
_extrados_, or uncovered outside of the vaults, certainly look well.Too
frequently, however, the vault is covered by a wooden roof, through
which the domes then peer in a manner by no means to be admired.The
details of the lower part are generally bad.381)
of a doorway of the Troitska monastery, near Moscow, is sufficiently
characteristic.Its most remarkable feature is the baluster-like
pillars, of which the Russians seem so fond.These support an arch with
a pendant in the middle—a sort of architectural _tour de force_ which
the Russian architects practised everywhere and in every age, but which
is far from being beautiful in itself, or from possessing any
architectural propriety.The great roll over the door is also
unpleasant.Indeed, as a general rule, wherever in Russian architecture
the details are original, they must be condemned as ugly.At Moscow we find much that is at all events curious.It first became a
city of importance about the year 1304, and retained its prosperity
throughout that century.During that time it was adorned by many
sumptuous edifices.In the beginning of the 15th century it was taken
and destroyed by the Tartars, and it was not till the reign of Ivan III.(1462-1505) that the city and empire recovered the disasters of that
period.It is extremely doubtful if any edifice now found in Moscow can
date before the time of this monarch.In the year 1479 this king dedicated the new church of the Assumption of
the Virgin, said to have been built by Aristotile Fioravanti, of
Bologna, in Italy, who was brought to Russia expressly for the purpose.382) gives a good idea of the arrangement of
a Russian church of this age.Small as are its dimensions—only 74 ft.by
56 over all externally, which would be a very small parish church
anywhere else—the two other cathedrals of Moscow, that of the Archangel
Michael and the Annunciation, are even smaller still in plan.Like true
Byzantine churches, they would all be exact squares, but that the
narthex being taken into the church gives it a somewhat oblong form.In
the Church of the Assumption there is, as is almost universally the
case, one large dome over the centre of the square, and four smaller
ones in the four angles.[255] The great iconostasis runs, as at Sta.Sophia at Kief, quite across the church; but the two lateral chapels
have smaller screens inside which hide their altars, so that the part
between the two becomes a sort of private chapel.This seems to be the
plan of the greater number of the Russian churches of this age.Doorway of the Troitzka Monastery, near Moscow.]Plan of the Church of the Assumption, Moscow.]View of the Church of Vassili Blanskenoy, Moscow.]But there is one church in Moscow, that of Vassili (St.Basil) Blajenny,
which is certainly the most remarkable, as it is the most
characteristic, of all the churches of Russia.It was built by Ivan the
Terrible (1534-1584), and its architect was a foreigner, generally
supposed to have come from the West, inasmuch as this monarch sent an
embassy to Germany under one Schlit, to procure artists, of whom he is
said to have collected 150 for his service.If, however, German workmen
erected this building, it certainly was from Tartar designs.Nothing
like it exists to the westward.It more resembles some Eastern pagoda of
modern date than any European structure, and in fact must be considered
as almost a pure Tartar building.Still, though strangely altered by
time, most of its forms can be traced back to the Byzantine style, as
certainly as the details of the cathedral of Cologne to the Romanesque.The central spire, for instance, is the form into which the Russians had
during five centuries been gradually changing the straight-lined dome of
the Armenians.The eight others are the Byzantine domes converted by
degrees into the bulb-like forms which the Tartars practised at Agra and
Delhi, as well as throughout Russia.The arrangement of these domes will
be understood by the plan (Woodcut No.383), which shows it to consist
of one central octagon surrounded by eight smaller ones, raised on a
platform ascended by two flights of stairs.Beneath the platform is a
crypt.For the general appearance the reader must be referred to Woodcut
No.384, for words would fail to convey any idea of so bizarre and
complicated a building.At the same time it must be imagined as painted
with the most brilliant colours; its domes gilt, and relieved by blue,
green, and red, and altogether a combination of as much barbarity as it
is possible to bring together in so small a space.To crown the whole,
according to the legend, Ivan ordered the eyes of the architect to be
put out, lest he should ever surpass his own handiwork; and we may feel
grateful that nothing so barbarous was afterwards attempted in Europe.View of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.(From ‘Jahrbuch
der Central Com.’)]

[Illustration: 386.Plan of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.Tower of Ivan Veliki, Moscow, with the Cathedrals of
the Assumption and the Archangel Gabriel.]Though not strictly speaking in Russia itself, there is at Kurtea
d’Argyisch, in Wallachia, 90 miles north-west from Bucharest, a church
which is so remarkable, so typical of the style, that it cannot be
passed over.It was erected in the first years of the 16th century
(1517-1526) by a Prince Nyagon, and is, so far as is at present known,
the most elaborate example of the style.All its ornamental details are
identical with those found at Ani and other places in Armenia, but are
used here in greater profusion and with better judgment than are to be
found in any single example in that country.In outline it is not so
wild as the Vassili Blanskenoy, but the interior is wholly sacrificed to
the external effect, and no other example can well be quoted on which
ornamental construction is carried to so great an extent, and generally
speaking in such good taste.The twisted cupolas that flank the
entrances might as well have been omitted, but the two central domes and
the way the semi-domes are attached to them are quite unexceptionable,
and altogether, with larger dimensions, and if a little more spread out,
it would be difficult to find a more elegant exterior anywhere.long by 50 wide it is too small for architectural effect,
but barring this it is the most elegant example of the Armeno-Russian or
Neo-Byzantine architecture which is known to exist anywhere, and one of
the most suggestive, if the Russians knew how to use it.[256]


                                TOWERS.Next in importance to the churches themselves are the belfries which
always accompany them.The Russians seem never to have adopted separate
baptisteries, nor did they affect any sepulchral magnificence in their
tombs.From the time of Herodotus the Scythians were great casters of
metal, and famous for their bells.The specimens of casting of this sort
in Russia reduce all the great bells of Western Europe to comparative
insignificance.It of course became necessary to provide places in which
to hang these bells: and as nothing, either in Byzantine or Armenian
architecture, afforded a hint for amalgamating the belfry with the
church, they went to work in their own way, and constructed the towers
wholly independent of the churches.Of all those in Russia, that of Ivan
Veliki, erected by the Czar Boris, about the year 1600, is the finest.It is surmounted by a cross 18 ft.high, making a total height of 269
ft.from the ground to the top of the cross.It cannot be said to have
any great beauty, either of form or detail: but it rises boldly from the
ground, and towers over all the other buildings of the Kremlin.With
this tower for its principal object, the whole mass of building is at
least picturesque, if not architecturally beautiful.388) the belfry is shown as it stood before it was blown up by the
French.It has since been rebuilt, and with the cathedrals on either
hand, makes up the best group in the Kremlin.Besides the belfries, the walls of the Kremlin are adorned with towers,
meant not merely for military defence, but as architectural ornaments,
and reminding us somewhat of those described by Josephus as erected by
Herod on the walls of Jerusalem.389),
built by the same Czar Boris who erected that last described, is a good
specimen of its class.It is one of the principal of those which give
the walls of the Kremlin their peculiar and striking character.These towers, however, are not peculiar to the Kremlin of Moscow.Every
city in Russia had its Kremlin, as every one in Spain had its Alcazar,
and all were adorned with walls deeply machicolated, and interspersed
with towers.Within were enclosed five-domed churches and belfries, just
as at Moscow, though on a scale proportionate to the importance of the
city.It would be easy to select numerous illustrations of this.They
are, however, all very much like one another, nor have they sufficient
beauty to require us to dwell long on them.Their gateways, however, are
frequently important.Every city had its _porta sacra_, deriving its
importance either from some memorable event or from miracles said to
have been wrought there, and being the triumphal gateways through which
all processions pass on state occasions.The best known of these is that of Moscow, beneath whose sacred arch
even the Emperor himself must uncover his head as he passes through; and
which, from its sanctity as well as its architectural character, forms
an important feature among the antiquities of Russia.So numerous are the churches, and, generally speaking, the fragments of
antiquity in this country, that it would be easy to multiply examples to
almost any extent.Those quoted in the preceding pages are,
architecturally, the finest as well as the most interesting from an
antiquarian point of view, of those which have yet been visited and
drawn; and there is no reason to believe that others either more
magnificent or more beautiful still remain undescribed.This being the case, it is safe to assert that Russia contains nothing
that can at all compare with the cathedrals, or even the parish
churches, of Western Europe, either in dimensions or in beauty of
detail.Every chapter in the history of architecture must contain
something to interest the student: but there is none less worthy of
attention than that which describes the architecture of Russia,
especially when we take into account the extent of territory occupied by
its people, and the enormous amount of time and wealth which has been
lavished on the multitude of insignificant buildings to be found in
every corner of the empire.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.Division and Classification of the Romanesque and Gothic Styles of
  Architecture in Italy.If a historian were to propose to himself the task of writing a
tolerably consecutive narrative of the events which occurred in Italy
during the Middle Ages, he would probably find such difficulties in his
way as would induce him to abandon the attempt.Venice and Genoa were as
distinct states as Spain and Portugal.Florence, the most essentially
Italian of the republics, requires a different treatment from the half
German Milan.Even such neighbouring cities as Mantua and Verona were
separate and independent states during the most important part of their
existence.Rome was, during the whole of the Middle Ages, more European
than Italian, and must have a narrative of her own; Southern Italy was a
foreign country to the states of the North; and Sicily has an
independent history.The same difficulties, though not perhaps to the same degree, beset the
historian of art, and, if it were proposed to describe in detail all the
varying forms of Italian art during the Middle Ages, it would be
necessary to map out Italy into provinces, and to treat each almost as a
separate kingdom by itself.In this, as in almost every instance,
however, the architecture forms a better guide-line through the tangled
mazes of the labyrinth than the written record of political events, and
those who can read her language have before them a more trustworthy and
vivid picture of the past than can be obtained by any other means.The great charm of the history of Mediæval art in England is its unity.It affords the picture of a people working out a style from chaos to
completeness, with only slight assistance from those in foreign
countries engaged in the same task.In France we have two elements, the
old Southern Romanesque long struggling with the Northern Celtic, and
unity only obtained by the suppression of the former, wherever they came
in contact.In Italy we have four elements,—the Roman, the Byzantine,
the Lombardic, and the Gothic,—sometimes existing nearly pure, at others
mixed, in the most varying proportions, the one with the other.In the North the Lombardic element prevailed; based on the one hand on
the traditions of Imperial Rome, and in consequence influenced in its
art by classical forms; and, on the other, inspired in all its details
by a vast accumulation of Byzantine work.In the 5th and 6th centuries
this work (chiefly confined to columns, screens, and altar pieces) was
executed by Greek artists sent on from Constantinople.The 7th century
seems to have been quite barren so far as architecture was concerned;
but in the 8th century, owing either to the Saracen invasion or to the
emigration caused by the persecution of the Iconoclasts in 788, the
Byzantine influence became again predominant, but no longer with that
same purity of design as we find in the earlier work of the 5th and 6th
centuries.In the South, the Byzantine forms prevailed, partly because the art was
there based on the traditions of Magna Grecia, and more, perhaps, from
the intimate connection that existed between Apulia and the Peloponnesus
during the Middle Ages.Between the two stood Rome, less changed than either North or South—the
three terms, Roman, Romano-Byzantine, and Renaissance comprise all the
variation she submitted to.In vain the Gothic styles besieged her on
the north and the Byzantine on the south.Their waves spent themselves
on her rock without producing much impression, while her influence
extended more or less over the whole peninsula.It was distinctly felt
at Florence and at Pisa on the north and west, though these conquests
were nearly balanced by the Byzantine influence which is so distinctly
felt at Venice or Padua on the east coast.The great difficulty in the attempt to reconcile these architectural
varieties with the local and ethnographical peculiarities of the
people—a difficulty which at first sight appears all but insuperable—is,
that sometimes all three styles are found side by side in the same city.This, however, constitutes, in reality, the intrinsic merit of
architecture as a guide in these difficulties.What neither the language
of the people nor their histories tell us, their arts proclaim in a
manner not to be mistaken.Just in that ratio in which the Roman,
Byzantine, or Lombardic style prevails in their churches, to that extent
did either of these elements exist in the blood of the people.Once
thoroughly master the peculiarities of their art, and we can with
certainty pronounce when any particular race rose to power, how long its
prevalence lasted, and when it was obliterated or fused with some other
form.There is no great difficulty in distinguishing between the Byzantine and
the other two styles, so far as the form of dome is concerned.The
latter is almost always rounded externally, the former almost always
straight-lined.Again: the Byzantine architects never used intersecting
vaults for their naves.If forced to use a pointed arch, they did so
unwillingly, and it never fitted kindly to their favourite circular
forms; the style of their ornamentation was throughout peculiar, and
differed in many essential respects from the other two styles.It is less easy always to discriminate between the Gothic and Lombardic
in Italy.We frequently find churches of the two styles built side by
side in the same age, both using round arches, and with details not
differing essentially from one another.There is one test, however,
which is probably in all cases sufficient.Every Gothic church had, or
was intended to have, a vault over its central aisle.The importance of the distinction is apparent
throughout.The Gothic churches have clustered piers, tall
vaulting-shafts, external and internal buttresses, and are prepared
throughout for this necessity of Gothic art.The early Christian
churches, on the contrary, have only a range of columns, generally of a
pseudo-Corinthian order, between the central and side aisles; internally
no vaulting-shafts, and externally only pilasters.Had these architects
been competent, as the English were, to invent an ornamental wooden
roof, they would perhaps have acted wisely; but though they made several
attempts, especially at Verona, they failed signally to devise any mode
either of hiding the mere mechanical structure of their roofs or of
rendering them ornamental.Vaulting was, in fact, the real formative idea of the Gothic style, and
it continued to be its most marked characteristic during the continuance
of the style, not only in Italy, but throughout all Europe.As it is impossible to treat of these various styles in one sequence,
various modes of precedence might be adopted, for each of which good
reasons could be given; but the following will probably be found most
consonant with the arrangement elsewhere adopted in this work:—

First, to treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy
down to the age of Charlemagne, and to trace out its history down to the
11th century, in order to include all that work executed by Greek
artists or copied from it by Lombardic artists; a phase which might
appropriately be termed the Byzantine-Lombardic style.Secondly, to follow the history of the formation of the round-arched
style in Lombardy and North Italy, which constitutes the real Lombardic
style.Thirdly, to take up the Byzantine-Romanesque style as it was practised
in the centre and South of Italy; because it follows chronologically
more closely the art of the North of Italy.Fourthly, to follow the changes which the influence of the Gothic style
exercised in the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy.Sicily will demand a chapter to herself; not only because a fourth
element is introduced there in the Saracenic—which influenced her style
almost as much as it did that of the South of Spain—but because such
pointed Gothic as she possesses was not German, like that of Northern
Italy, but derived far more directly from France, under either the
Norman or Angiovine dynasties.Gothic architecture in Palestine also
requires a chapter, and is best described here owing to its close
resemblance to the style in the South of Italy.EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE-LOMBARDIC STYLES.Paul’s—Ravenna—St.Mark’s,

                               BASILICAS.Like the study of all modern history, that of Christian architecture
commences with Rome; and not, as is sometimes supposed, where the
history of Rome leaves off, but far back in the Empire, if not, indeed,
almost in the Republic.As has already been pointed out, the whole history of the art in
Imperial Rome is that of a style in course of transition, beginning with
a purely Pagan or Grecian style in the age of Augustus, and passing into
one almost wholly Christian in the age of Constantine.At the first epoch of the Empire the temple architecture of Rome
consisted in an external arrangement of columns, without arches or
vaults, and was wholly unsuited for the purposes of Christian worship.Towards the end of the period it had become an internal architecture,
making use of arches and vaults almost entirely to the exclusion of the
columnar orders, except as ornaments, and became so perfectly adapted to
Christian requirements, that little or no essential change in it has
taken place from that time to the present day.A basilica of the form
adopted in the first century after Constantine is as suited now as it
was then to the forms and ceremonies of the Christian ritual.The fact seems to be, that during the first three centuries after the
Christian era an immense change was silently but certainly working its
way in men’s minds.The old religion was effete: the best men, the most
intellectual spirits of the age, had no faith in it; and the new
religion with all its important consequences was gradually supplying its
place in the minds of men long before it was generally accepted.There is thus no real distinction between the Emilian or Ulpian
basilicas and those which Constantine erected for the use of the early
Christian republic.Nor is it possible, in such a series as the
Pantheon, the Temple of Minerva Medica, and the Church of San Vitale at
Ravenna, to point out what part really belongs to Pagan and what to
Christian art.It is true that Constantine fixed the epoch of completed transition, and
gave it form and substance; but long before his time Paganism was
impossible and a reform inevitable.The feeling of the world had
changed—its form of utterance followed as a matter of course.Viewed in this light, it is impossible to separate the early history of
Christian art from that of Imperial Rome.The sequence is so immediate
and the change so gradual, that a knowledge of the first is absolutely
indispensable to a right understanding of the second.One of the most remarkable facts connected with the early history of the
Christian religion is, that neither its Founder nor any of His more
immediate successors left any specific directions either as to the
liturgical forms of worship to be observed by His followers, nor laid
down any rules to be observed in the government of the newly established
Church.Under these circumstances it was left almost wholly to those to
whose care the infant congregation was entrusted to frame such
regulations for its guidance as the exigencies of the occasion might
dictate, and gradually to appoint such forms of worship as might seem
most suitable to express the purity of the new faith, but at the same
time with a dignity befitting its high mission.In Judea these ceremonies, as might naturally be expected, were strongly
tinctured with the forms of the Mosaic dispensation; but it appears to
have been in Africa, and more especially in the pomp-loving and
ceremonious Egypt, that fixed liturgies and rites first became an
integral part of the Christian religion.In those countries far from the
central seat of government, more liberty of conscience seems to have
been attained at an early period than would have been tolerated in the
capital.Before the time of Constantine they possessed not only
churches, but a regularly established hierarchy and a form of worship
similar to what afterwards obtained throughout the whole Christian
world.The form of the government of the Church, however, was long
unsettled.At first it seems merely to have been that the most respected
individuals of each isolated congregation were selected to form a
council to advise and direct their fellow-Christians, to receive and
dispense their alms, and, under the simple but revered title of
Presbyters, to act as fathers rather than as governors to the scattered
communities by which they were elected.The idea, however, of such a
council naturally includes that of a president to guide their
deliberations and give unity and force to their decisions; and such we
soon find springing up under the title of Bishops, or Presbyter Bishops,
as they were first called.During the course of the second century the
latter institution seems gradually to have gained strength at the
expense of the power of the Presbyters, whose delegate the Bishop was
assumed to be.In that capacity the Bishops not only took upon
themselves the general direction of the affairs of the Church, but
formed themselves into separate councils and synods, meeting in the
provincial capitals of the provinces where they were located.These
meetings took place under the presidency of the Bishop of the city in
which they met, who thus assumed to be the chief or metropolitan.These
formed a new presbytery above the older institution, which was thus
gradually superseded—to be again surpassed by the great councils which,
after the age of Constantine, formed the supreme governing body of the
Church; performing the functions of the earlier provincial synods with
more extended authority, though with less unanimity and regularity than
had characterised the earlier institution.It was thus that during the first three centuries of its existence the
Christian community was formed into a vast federal republic, governed by
its own laws, administered by its own officers, acknowledging no
community with the heathen and no authority in the constituted secular
powers of the State.But at the same time the hierarchy admitted a
participation of rights to the general body of the faithful, from whom
they were chosen, and whose delegation was still admitted to be their
title to office.When, in the time of Constantine, this persecuted and scattered Church
emerged from the Catacombs to bask in the sunshine of Imperial favour,
there were no buildings in Rome, the plan of which was more suited to
their purposes than that of the basilicas of the ancient city.Though
designed and erected for the transaction of the affairs of the heathen
Empire, they happened to be, in consequence of their disposition and
immense size, eminently suited for the convenience of the Christian
Church, which then aspired to supersede its fallen rival and replace it
by a younger and better institution.[257]

In the basilica the whole congregation of the faithful could meet and
take part in the transaction of the business going on.The bishop
naturally took the place previously occupied by the prætor or quæstor,
the presbyters those of the assessors.The altar in front of the apse,
where the pious heathen poured out libations at the commencement and
conclusion of all important business, served equally for the celebration
of Christian rites, and with the fewest possible changes, either in the
form of the ceremonies or in the nature of the business transacted
therein, the basilica of the heathen became the ecclesia or place of
assembly of the early Christian community.In addition, however, to the rectangular basilica, which was essentially
the place of meeting for the transaction of the business of the Church,
the Christian community early adopted a circular-formed edifice as a
ceremonial or sacramental adjunct to the basilica.These were copied
from the Roman tombs above described, and were in fact frequently built
for the sepulchres of distinguished persons; but they were also used at
a very early date as baptisteries, as well as for the performance of
funereal rites.It does not appear that baptism, the marriage rites, or
indeed any of the sacraments, were performed in the earliest ages in the
basilica, though in after ages a font was introduced even into
cathedrals.The rectangular church became ultimately the only form used.In the earlier ages, however, a complete ecclesiastical establishment
consisted of a basilica, and a baptistery, independent of one another
and seldom ranged symmetrically, though the tendency seems to have been
to place the round church opposite the western or principal entrance of
the basilica.Though this was the case in the capital and other great cities, it was
otherwise before the time of Constantine in the provinces.There the
Christian communities existed as members of a religious sect long before
they aspired to political power or dreamt of superseding the secular
form of government by combination among themselves.In the remote parts
of the Empire, in the earliest ages, they consequently built for
themselves churches which were temples, or, in other words, houses of
prayer, designed for and devoted wholly to the celebration of religious
rites, as in the Pagan temples, and without any reference to the
government of the community or the transaction of the business of the
assembly.If any such existed in Italy or any other part of Europe, they
either perished in the various persecutions to which the Christians were
exposed when located near the seat of government, or they became
hallowed by the memories of the times of martyrdom, and were rebuilt in
happier days with greater magnificence, so that little or no trace of
the original buildings now remains.So long, therefore, as our
researches were confined to European examples, the history of Christian
architecture began with Constantine; but recent researches in Africa
have shown that, when properly explored, we shall certainly be able to
carry the history of the early Christian style in that country back to a
date at least a century before his time.In Syria and Asia Minor so many
early examples have come to light that it seems probable that we may,
before long, carry the history of Byzantine art back to a date nearly
approaching that of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.It is,
however, only so recently that the attention of ecclesiologists has been
directed to the early examples of Christian architecture, that it is not
yet possible to grasp completely the whole bearing of the subject; but
enough is known to show how much the progress of research may modify the
views hitherto entertained on the subject.Meanwhile too much attention
can hardly be bestowed upon it, as it is by means of these early
specimens of architectural art that we shall probably be best able to
recover the primitive forms of the Christian liturgical observance.One of the most ancient as well as interesting of the African churches
which has yet been brought to light is that at Djemla.It is a simple
rectangle, internally 92 ft.by 52, divided longitudinally with three
aisles, the centre one of which terminates in a square cella or choir,
which seems to have been enclosed up to the roof; but the building is so
ruined that this cannot be known for a certainty.Though so exceptional,
it is not difficult to see whence the form was derived.If we take such
a plan, for instance, as that of the Maison Carré at Nîmes (Woodcut No.187), and build a wall round and put a roof over it, so as to make a
building which was originally appropriated to external worship suitable
for internal religious purposes, we should have exactly such a result as
this.The cella must be diminished in extent, the pillars more widely
spaced, and the front row converted into a wall in which the entrances
would be usually placed.In this instance the one entrance, for some
local reason, is lateral.The whole floor of the church is covered with
a mosaic so purely classical in style of execution as to leave no doubt
as to its early date.A more common form is shown in the annexed woodcut, representing a small
church at Announa, likewise in Algeria, about 45 ft.square, divided
into three aisles and with a projecting apse.If we turn to the plan of
the Temple of Mars Ultor (Woodcut No.186), we see at once whence this
form was derived.It only requires the lateral columns to be brought
slightly forward to effect the requisite change.When the building was
to be used by a congregation, and not merely for display, the pillars
would require to be more widely spaced.A third form, from Ibrim in Nubia, shows the peculiarity of the apse
being internal, which became very fashionable in the Eastern, though not
so much so in the Western, churches, but still sufficiently so to make
its introduction at this early age worthy of notice.The building is
small, being only 57 ft.in length externally, but is remarkable for
being built with something of the solidity of the Egyptian edifices
among which it stands.The next example which it may be necessary to quote to make this early
form intelligible, is that of the church of St.Reparatus, near
Orleansville—the ancient Castellum Tingitanum.According to an
inscription still existing, it was erected A.D.252,[258] but the second
apse seems to have been added at a later date, to contain the grave of
the saint.As it now stands, it is a double-apsed basilica 80 ft.long
by 52 broad, divided into five aisles, and exhibiting on a miniature
scale all the peculiarities of plan which we have hitherto fancied were
not adopted until some centuries later.In this instance both the apses
are internal, so that the side-aisles are longer than the centre one, no
portion of them appearing to have been cut off for chalcidica or
vestries, as was very generally the case in this age.Another example, very much like this in arrangement, but on a larger
scale, is found at Ermet, the ancient Hermonthis in Egypt.by 90, and, if the plan in the great French work[259]
is to be depended upon, is one of the most complete examples of its
class.It has four ranges of columns, taken apparently from more ancient
examples, and two apses with all the usual appurtenances.Plan of Church at Ibrim in Nubia.Another two-aisled and single apse church, measuring 100 ft.by 65,
called Dyer Abou Taneh, is represented in the same work;[260] but
perhaps the most interesting of these churches is that known as the
White Convent, situated on the edge of the Libyan Desert, above Siout.by 122, and is enclosed in a solid wall,
surmounted by an Egyptian cornice, so that it looks much more like an
ancient temple than a Christian church.Originally it had six doors, but
all are now walled up, except one in the centre of the southern face;
and above, a series of small openings, like loopholes, admitted light to
apartments which apparently occupied the upper storey of lateral
corridors.Light to the church was, of course, admitted through the
clerestory, which could easily be done; and altogether as a fortified
and mysterious abode, and place of worship of ascetics, it would be
difficult to find a more appropriate example.The age of this church is not very well ascertained; popularly it is,
like so many others, ascribed to Sta.Helena, and the double aisles and
triapsal arrangements are so like her church at Bethlehem, that there is
no _à priori_ improbability in the assumption.The plan, however, is
more complicated and complete, and its external form bespeaks of
troublous times, so that altogether it is probably a century or two (the
monks say 140 years) more modern.Like other churches of its class,
ancient materials have been so used up with those prepared at the time,
that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the dates of such buildings.If, however, any one with sufficient knowledge would make a special
study of these Egyptian churches, he would add one of the most
interesting chapters to our history of early Christian Architecture, and
explain many ritual arrangements whose origin is now involved in
mystery; but for this we must wait.The materials are not at present
available, all travellers in Egypt being so attracted by the surpassing
interest of the Pagan remains of that country, as hardly to find time
for a glance at the Christian antiquities.[261]

[Illustration: 394.It was probably in a great measure owing to the influence of these
provincial examples that the arrangements of the metropolitan basilicas
were not long allowed to retain the form above described, though more
was probably due to the change which was gradually taking place in the
constitution of the governing body of the Church.The early arrangements
of the Christian basilica, as copied from the secular forms of the Pagan
places of assembly, soon became unsuited to the more exclusively
religious purposes to which they were to be appropriated.The now
dominant hierarchy of Rome soon began to repudiate the republicanism of
the early days of the Church, and to adopt from the East the convenient
doctrine of the absolute separation of the congregation into clergy and
laity.To accommodate the basilica to this new state of things, first
the apse was railed off and appropriated wholly to the use of the
clergy: then the whole of the dais, or raised part in front of the apse
on which the altar stood, was separated by pillars, called cancelli, and
in like manner given up wholly to the clergy, and was not allowed to be
profaned by the presence of the unordained multitude.The last great change was the introduction of a choir, or enclosed space
in the centre of the nave, attached to the bema or _presbytery_, as the
raised space came to be called.Round three sides of this choir the
faithful were allowed to congregate to hear the Gospels or Epistles read
from the two pulpits or _ambones_, which were built into its enclosure,
one on either side; or to hear the services which were read or sung by
the inferior order of clergy who occupied its precincts.The enclosure of the choir was kept low, so as not to hide the view of
the raised presbytery, or to prevent the congregation from witnessing
the more sacred mysteries of the faith which were there performed by the
higher order of clergy.Another important modification, though it entailed no architectural
change, was the introduction of the bodies of the saints in whose honour
the building was erected into the basilica itself, and depositing them
in a confessional or crypt below the high altar.There is every reason to believe that a separate circular building, or
proper tomb, was originally erected over the grave or place of
martyrdom, and the basilica was sanctified merely by its propinquity to
the sacred spot.Afterwards the practice of depositing the relics of the
saint beneath the floor became universally the rule.At about the same
time the baptistery was also absorbed into the basilica; and instead of
standing opposite the western entrance, a font placed within the western
doors supplied its place.This last change was made earlier at Rome than
elsewhere.It is not known at what exact period the alteration was
introduced, but it is probable that the whole was completed before the
age of Gregory the Great.It was thus that in the course of a few centuries the basilicas
aggregated within themselves all the offices of the Roman Church, and
became the only acknowledged ecclesiastical buildings—either as places
for the assembly of the clergy for the administration of the sacraments
and the performance of divine worship, or for the congregation of the
faithful.None of the basilican churches, either of Rome or the provinces, possess
these arrangements exactly as they were originally established in the
fourth or fifth century.The church of San Clemente, however, retains
them so nearly in their primitive form that a short description of it
may tend to make what follows more easily intelligible.This basilica
seems to have been erected in the fourth or fifth century over what was
supposed to be the house in which the saint of that name resided.Recently a subterranean church or crypt has been discovered, which must
of course be more ancient than the present remains.[262] Above this
subterranean church stands the edifice shown in the accompanying plan
(Woodcut No.395), nearly one-third less in size, being only 65 ft.wide
internally, against 93 of the original church, though both were about
the same length.Plan of the Church of San Clemente at Rome.(From
Gutensohn and Knapp.to 1 in]

It is one of the few that still possesses an _atrium_ or courtyard in
front of the principal entrance, though there can be but little doubt
that this was considered at that early age a most important, if not
indeed an indispensable, attribute to the church itself.As a feature it
may have been derived from the East, where we know it was most common,
and where it afterwards became, with only the slightest possible
modifications, the mosque of the Moslems.It would seem even more
probable, however, that it is only a repetition of the _forum_, which
was always attached to the Pagan basilica, and through which it was
always entered; and for a sepulchral church at least nothing could be
more appropriate, as the original application of the word forum seems to
have been to the open area that existed in front of tombs as well as of
other important buildings.[264]

In the centre of this atrium there generally stood a fountain or tank of
water, not only as an emblem of purity, but that those who came to the
church might wash their hands before entering the holy place—a custom
which seems to have given rise to the practice of dipping the fingers in
the holy water of the piscina, now universal in all Catholic countries.The colonnade next the church was frequently the only representative of
the atrium, and then—perhaps indeed always—was called the _narthex_, or
place for penitents or persons who had not yet acquired the right of
entering the church itself.From this narthex three doorways generally opened into the church,
corresponding with the three aisles; and if the building possessed a
font, it ought to have been placed in one of the chapels on either the
right or left hand of the principal entrance.The choir, with its two pulpits, is shown in the plan—that on the
left-hand side being the pulpit of the Epistle, that on the right of the
Gospel.The railing of the _bema_ or presbytery is also marked, so is
the position of the altar with its canopy supported on four pillars, and
behind that the throne of the bishop, with the seats of the inferior
clergy surrounding the apse on either side.Besides the church of San Clemente there are at least thirty other
basilican churches in Rome, extending in date from the 4th to the 14th
century.Their names and dates, as far as they have been ascertained,
are set forth in the accompanying list, which, though not altogether
complete, is still the best we possess, and is sufficient for our

Three of these, St.Paul’s, and the Lateran church, have
five aisles, all the rest three, with only one insignificant exception,
Sta.Balbina, which has no side-aisles.Agnes and the old part
of St.Lorenzo, have their side-aisles in two storeys, all the rest are
only one storey in height, and the side-aisles generally are half the
width of the central aisle or nave.Some of the more modern churches
have the side-aisles vaulted, but of those in the list all except the
two last have flat wooden ceilings over the central compartment, and
generally speaking the plain ornamental construction of the roof is
exposed.It can scarcely be doubted that originally they were ceiled in
some more ornamental manner, as the art of ornamenting this new style of
open construction seems to have been introduced at a later date.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Maria sopra Minerva might perhaps be
more properly classed among the buildings belonging to the Italian
Gothic style; but as it is the only one in Rome that has any claim to
such a distinction, it is hardly worth while making it an exception to
the rest.The San Agostino might also be called a Renaissance specimen.It certainly is a transitional specimen between the pillared and
pilastered styles, which were then struggling for mastery.It may either
be regarded as the last of the old race or the first of the new style,
which was so soon destined to revolutionise the architectural world.Of the other examples the oldest was the finest.This great basilica was
erected in the reign of Constantine, close to the circus of Nero, where
tradition affirmed that St.It
unfortunately was entirely swept away to make room for the greatest of
Christian temples, which now occupies its site; but previous to its
destruction careful measurements and drawings were made of every part,
from which it is easy to understand all its arrangements—easier perhaps
than if it had remained to the present day, and four centuries more of
reform and improvements had assisted in altering and disfiguring its
venerable frame.As will be seen in the plan (Woodcut No.396), drawn to the usual scale,
it possessed a noble atrium or forecourt, 212 ft.by 235, in front of
which were some bold masses of building, which, during the Middle Ages,
were surmounted by two belfry-towers.in
width by 380 in length, covering, without its adjuncts, an area of above
80,000 English feet, which, though less than half the size of the
present cathedral, is as large as that covered by any mediæval cathedral
except those of Milan and Seville.across (about twice the average width of a Gothic nave), and nearly the
same as that of the basilica of Maxentius and the principal halls of the
greater thermæ.For some reason or other this dimension seems to have
been a modulus very generally adopted.The bema or sanctuary, answering
to the Gothic transept, extended beyond the walls of the church either
way, which was unusual in early Christian buildings.The object here
seems to have been to connect it with the tombs on its north side.The
arrangement of the sanctuary was also peculiar, having been adorned with
twelve pillars supporting a gallery.These, when symbolism became the
fashion, were said to represent the twelve apostles.This certainly was
not their original intent, as at first only six were put up—the others
added afterwards.The sanctuary and choir were here singularly small and
contracted, as if arranged before the clergy became so numerous as they
afterwards were, and before the laity were excluded from this part of
the church.The general internal appearance of the building will be understood from
the following woodcut (No.397), which presents at one view all the
peculiarities of the basilican buildings.The pillars separating the
central from the side aisles appear to have been of uniform dimensions,
and to have supported a horizontal entablature, above which rose a
double range of panels, each containing a picture—these panels thus
taking the place of what was the triforium in Gothic churches.Over
these was the clerestory, and again an ornamental belt gave sufficient
elevation for the roof, which in this instance showed the naked
construction.On the whole perhaps the ratio of height to width is
unexceptionable, but the height over the pillars is so great that they
are made to look utterly insignificant, which indeed is the great defect
in the architectural design of these buildings, and, though seldom so
offensive as here, is apparent in all.The ranges of columns dividing
the side-aisles were joined by arches, which is a more common as well as
a better arrangement, as it not only adds to the height of the pillars,
but gives them an apparent power of bearing the superstructure.At some
period during the Middle Ages the outer aisles were vaulted, and Gothic
windows introduced into them.This change seems to have necessitated the
closing of the intermediate range of clerestory windows, which probably
was by no means conducive to the general architectural effect of the
building.Peter, before its
destruction in the 15th century.Externally this basilica, like all those of its age, must have been
singularly deficient in beauty or in architectural design.The sides
were of plain unplastered brick, the windows were plain arch-headed
openings.The front alone was ornamented, and this only with two ranges
of windows somewhat larger than those at the sides, three in each tier,
into which tracery was inserted at some later period, and between and
above these, various figures and emblems were painted in fresco on
stucco laid on the brickwork.The whole was surmounted by that singular
coved cornice which seems to have been universal in Roman basilicas,
though not found anywhere else that I am aware of.The two most interesting adjuncts to this cathedral were the two tombs
standing to the northward.According to the mediæval tradition the one
was the tomb of Honorius and his wives, the other the church of St.Their position, however, carefully centred on the spina of the
circus of Nero, where the great apostle suffered martyrdom, seems to
point to a holier and more important origin.My own conviction is that
they were erected to mark the places where the apostle and his
companions suffered.It is besides extremely improbable that after the
erection of the basilica an emperor should choose the centre of a circus
for the burying-place of himself and his family, or that he should be
permitted to choose so hallowed a spot.They are of exactly the usual
tomb-form of the age of Constantine, and of the largest size, being each
100 ft.The first was destroyed by Michael Angelo, as it stood on the site
required for his northern tribune, the second by Pius VI., in 1776, to
make way for the present sacristy, and Rome thus lost, through pure
carelessness, the two oldest and most sacred edifices of the Christian
period which she possessed.The most eastern had been so altered and overlaid, having been long used
as a sacristy,[266] that it might have been difficult to restore it; but
its position and its antiquity certainly entitled it to a better fate.The church of San Paolo fuori le Mura was almost an exact counterpart of
St.Peter’s both in design and dimensions.The only important variations
were that the transept was made of the same width as the central nave,
or about 80 ft., and that the pillars separating the nave from the
side-aisles were joined by arches instead of by a horizontal architrave.Both these were undoubted improvements, the first giving space and
dignity to the bema, the latter not only adding height to the order, but
giving it, together with lightness, that apparent strength requisite to
support the high wall placed over the pillars.Paul’s, at Rome, before
the fire.]The order too was finer and more important than at St.Peter’s,
twenty-four of the pillars being taken from some temple or building (it
is generally said the mausoleum of Hadrian) of the best age of Rome,
though the remaining sixteen were unfortunately only very bad copies of
them.in height, or one-third of the whole
height of the building to the roof.Peter’s they were only a
fourth, and if they had been spaced a little farther apart, and the arch
made more important, the most glaring defect of these buildings would in
a great measure have been avoided.Long before its destruction by fire in 1822 this church had been so
altered as to lose many of its most striking peculiarities.The bema or
presbytery was divided into two by a longitudinal wall.The greater
number of its clerestory windows were built up, its atrium gone, and
decay and whitewash had done much to efface its beauty, which
nevertheless seems to have struck all travellers with admiration, as
combining in itself the last reminiscence of Pagan Rome with the
earliest forms of the Christian world.It certainly was the most
interesting, if not quite the most beautiful, of the Christian
buildings, of that city.[267]

The third five-aisled basilica, that of St.John Lateran, differs in no
essential respect from those just described except in dimensions; it
covers about 60,000 ft., and consequently is inferior in this respect to
the other two.It has been so completely altered in modern times that
its primitive arrangements can now hardly be discerned, nor can their
effect be judged of, even assuming that they were peculiar to it, which,
however, is by no means certain.Like the other two, it appears to have been originally erected by
Constantine, who seems especially to have affected this five-aisled
form.The churches which he erected at Jerusalem and Bethlehem both have
this number of aisles.From the similarity which exists in the design of
all these churches we might easily restore this building, if it were
worth while.Its dimensions can easily be traced, but beyond this
nothing remains of the original erection.Of those with three aisles by far the finest and most beautiful is that
of S. Maria Maggiore, which, notwithstanding the comparative smallness
of its dimensions, is now perhaps the best specimen of its class
remaining.in width by 250 to the
front of the apse; the whole area being about 32,000 ft.: so that it is
little more than half the size of the Lateran church, and between
one-third and one-fourth of that of the other two five-aisled churches.Notwithstanding this, there is great beauty in its internal colonnade,
all the pillars of which are of one design, and bear a most pleasing
proportion to the superstructure.The clerestory too is ornamented with
pilasters and panels, making it a part of the general design; and with
the roof, which is panelled with constructive propriety and simplicity
combined with sufficient richness, serves to make up a whole which gives
a far better and more complete idea of what a basilica either was
originally, or at least might have been, than any other church at Rome.It is true that both the pilasters of the clerestory and the roof are
modern, and in modern times the colonnade has been broken through in two
places; but these defects must be overlooked in judging of the whole.Another defect is that the side-aisles have been vaulted in modern
times, and in such a manner as to destroy the harmony that should exist
between the different parts of the building.In striving to avoid the
defect of making the superstructure too high in proportion to the
columns, the architect has made the central roof too low either for the
width or length of the main aisle.Still the building, as a whole, is—or
rather was before the completion of the rebuilding of St.Paul’s—the
very best of the older wooden-roofed churches of Christendom, and the
best model from which to study the merits and defects of this style of
architecture.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)](From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Another mode of getting over the great defect of high walls over the
pillars was adopted, as in St.Agnese, of using a
gallery corresponding with the triforium of Gothic churches.Lorenzo, where this feature first occurs, it would seem to have been
derived from the Eastern Empire, where the custom of providing galleries
for women had long been established; this is rendered probable by the
fact that the sculpture of the capitals carrying the arches of the
triforium is of pure Byzantine character, and by the adoption of what is
virtually a dosseret,[268] or projecting impost above the capital to
carry the arches, which at their springing are considerably wider and
deeper than the abacus of the capital.According to M. Cattaneo[269] the
earliest part of this church is the Eastern end, built by Constantine
(see plan, Woodcut No.403), which first consisted of nave, aisles, and
a Western apse.In the Pontificate of Sixtus III.(432-440) an immense
basilica was added on the Western side with an Eastern apse built back
to back with the original apse; and later on, in 578-590, galleries were
added to the Western church by Pope Pelagius II.In 1226-1227, when Honorius III.restored the whole building, he removed
the two apses, continued the new arcade up to the early Western wall,
and raised the choir of the early church to its present elevation
(Woodcut No.Agnes the galleries may
have been suggested if not required by the peculiarity of the ground,
which was higher on one side than on the other; but whether this was the
true cause of its adoption or not, the effect was most satisfactory, and
had it been persevered in so as to bring the upper colonnade more into
harmony of proportion with the other, it would have been attended with
the happiest results on the style.Whether it was, however, that the
Romans felt the want of the broad plain space for their paintings, or
that they could not bring the upper arches into proportion with the
classical pillars which they made use of, the system was abandoned
almost as soon as adopted, and never came into general use.It should be observed that this arrangement contained the germs of much
that was afterwards reproduced in Gothic churches.The upper gallery,
after many modifications, at last settled into a triforium, and the
pierced stone slabs in the windows became tracery—but before these were
reached a vaulted roof was introduced, and with it all the features of
the style were to a great extent modified.Lorenzo (fuori le
Mura).]Pudentiana is one of the very oldest
and consequently one of the most interesting of those in Rome.It stands
on substructions of ancient Roman date, which probably formed part of
the Thermæ of Novatus or the house of the Senator Pudens, who is
mentioned by St.Paul at the end of his Second Epistle to Timothy, and
with whom he is traditionally said to have resided during his sojourn in
Rome.The vaults beneath the church certainly formed part of a Roman
mansion, so apparently do those buildings, shown on the plan, and placed
behind and on one side of the sanctuary; but whether these were used for
Christian purposes before the erection of the church in the fourth
century is by no means certain.In plan the church remains in all
probability very much as originally designed, its most striking
peculiarity being the segmental form of the apse, which may possibly
have arisen from some peculiar arrangement of the original building.It
was not, however, found to be pleasing in an architectural point of
view, and was not consequently again employed.The annexed section probably represents very nearly the original form of
the nave, though it has been so encrusted with modern accretions as to
render it difficult to ascertain what the first form really was.The
shafts of the pillars may have been borrowed from some older edifice,
but the capitals were clearly designed to support arches, and must
therefore be early Christian (fourth century?), and are among the most
elegant and appropriate specimens of the class now extant.In some instances, as in San Clemente, above alluded to, in San Pietro
in Vincula, and Sta.Maria in Cosmedin, the colonnade is divided into
spaces of three or four intercolumniations by piers of solid masonry,
which give great apparent solidity and strength to the building, but at
the expense of breaking it up into compartments more than is agreeable,
and these destroy that beauty of perspective so pleasing in a continuous
colonnade.This defect seems to have been felt in the Santa Praxede,
where three of these piers are introduced in the length of the
nave,[271] and support each a bold arch thrown across the central aisle.The effect of this might have been most happy, as at San Miniato, near
Florence; but it has been so clumsily managed in the Roman example, as
to be most destructive of all beauty of proportion.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Church of San
Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Some of the principal beauties as well as some of the most remarkable
defects of these basilican churches arise from the employment of columns
torn from ancient temples: where this has been done, the beauty of the
marble, and the exquisite sculpture of the capitals and friezes, give a
richness and elegance to the whole that go far to redeem or to hide the
rudeness of the building in which they are encased.But, on the other
hand, the discrepancy between the pillars—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
columns being sometimes used side by side—destroys all uniformity, and
the fragmentary character of the entablatures they support is still more
prejudicial to the continuity of the perspective, which should be the
greatest charm of these churches.By degrees, the fertile quarries of
ancient Rome seem to have become entirely exhausted; and as the example
of St.Paul’s proves, the Romans in the fourth century were incapable of
manufacturing even a bad imitation, and were at last forced to adopt
some new plan of supporting their arcades.Nereo ed
Achilleo is, perhaps, the most elegant example of this class, the piers
being light octagons; but the most characteristic, as well as the most
original, is the San Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane, shown in section and
elevation in Woodcut No.It so far deviates from the usual
basilican arrangements as to suggest a later date.It has the same
defect as all the rest—its pier arches being too low, and for which
there is no excuse here—but both internally and externally it shows a
uniformity of design and a desire to make every part ornamental that
produces a very pleasing effect, notwithstanding that the whole is
merely of brick, and that ornament is so sparingly applied as barely to
prevent the building sinking into the class of mere utilitarian
erections.Among the most pleasing architectural features, if they may be so
called, of these churches, are the mosaic pavements that adorn the
greater number.These were always original, being designed for the
buildings in which they are used, and following the arrangement of the
architecture surrounding them.The patterns too are always elegant, and
appropriate to the purpose; and as the colours are in like manner
generally harmoniously blended, they form not only a most appropriate
but most beautiful basement to the architecture.A still more important feature was the great mosaic picture that always
adorned the semi-dome of the apse, representing most generally the
Saviour seated in glory surrounded by saints, or else some scene from
the life of the holy personage to whom the church was dedicated.These mosaics were generally continued down to nearly the level of the
altar, and along the whole of the inner wall of the sanctuary in which
the apse was situated, and as far as the triumphal arch which separated
the nave from the sanctuary, at which point the mosaic blended with the
frescoes that adorned the upper walls of the central nave above the
arcades.All this made up an extent of polychromatic decoration which in
those dark ages, when few could read, the designers of these buildings
seem to have considered as virtually of more importance than the
architectural work to which it was attached.Any attempt to judge of the
one without taking into consideration the other, would be forming an
opinion on hearing but half the evidence; but taken in conjunction, the
paintings go far to explain, and also to redeem, many points in which
the architecture is most open to criticism.During the whole period of the development of early Christian
architecture in Rome, the city of Ravenna, owing to her close connection
with the Eastern empire, almost rivalled in importance the old capital
of the world, and her churches were consequently hardly less important
either in number or in richness than those we have just been describing.It is true she had none so large as the great metropolitan basilicas of
St.The one five-aisled church she possessed—the
cathedral—has been entirely destroyed, to make way for a very
contemptible modern erection.From the plans, however, which we possess
of it, it seems to have differed very considerably from the Roman
examples, most especially in having no trace of a transept, the building
being a perfectly regular parallelogram, half as long again as its
breadth, and with merely one great apse added at the end of the central
nave.Its loss is the more to be regretted, as it was, besides being the
largest, the oldest church in the city, having been erected about the
year 400, by Archbishop Ursus.The baptistery that belonged to it has
been fortunately preserved, and will be described hereafter.Besides a considerable number of other churches which have either been
lost or destroyed by repair, Ravenna still possesses two first-class
three-aisled basilicas—the San Apollinare Nuovo,[272] originally an
Arian church, built by Theodoric, king of the Goths (A.D.493-525); and
the S. Apollinare in Classe, at the Port of Ravenna, situated about
three miles from the city, commenced A.D.538, and dedicated 549 A.D.Of
the two, the first-named is by far the more considerable, being 315 ft.long by 115 in width externally, while the other only measures 216 ft.As will be seen by the plan, S. Apollinare in Classe
is a perfectly regular basilica with twelve pillars on each side of the
nave, which is 50 ft.The apse is raised to allow of a crypt
underneath, and externally it is polygonal, like the Byzantine apse.Arches in Church of San Apollinare Nuovo.[273])]

The great merit of these two basilicas, as compared with those of Rome,
arises from the circumstance of Ravenna having possessed no ruined
temples whose spoils could be used in the construction of new buildings.On the other hand the Goths had no architectural forms of their own; the
architects and workmen therefore who were brought over from
Constantinople reproduced the style with which they were best acquainted
in the East, with such alterations in plan as the liturgies of the
church required, such modifications in construction as the materials of
the country necessitated, and such ideas in architectural design as were
suggested by the examples in Rome with which Theodoric was well
acquainted, having not only restored some of the churches there, but
insisted that the primitive style should be adhered to.The simple
basilican form of church with nave, and aisles without galleries over,
and a single apse, was based on numerous examples existing in Rome, to
which source may be ascribed the external blind arcades of the aisle and
nave walls.[274] From Woodcut 410, representing the arches of the nave
of St.Apollinare Nuovo, it will be seen that an elegance of proportion
is revealed and a beauty of design shown in the details of the
capitals[275] and the dosserets which surmount them, which are quite
foreign to any Roman examples.The great triforium frieze above the
arches, and the wall space above them between the clerestory windows,
covered with mosaics, executed 570 A.D.by Greek artists from
Constantinople, suggest a completeness of design which had not been
reached in Rome.All this is still more apparent in Woodcut No.411,
taken from the arcade where the nave joins the apse in St.Apollinare in
Classe, which shows a further advance in the working out of a new style,
based partially on Roman work, but carried out by Byzantine artists.Part of Apse in S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.Externally these buildings appear to have remained to the present hour
almost wholly without architectural embellishment.It was considered
sufficient for ornamental purposes to make the brick arches necessary
for the construction slightly more prominent and important than was
actually required.As if impelled by some feeling of antagonism to the
practice of the heathens, the early Christians seem to have tried to
make the external appearance of their buildings as unlike those of their
predecessors as was possible.Whether this was the cause or not, it is
certain that nothing can well be less ornamental than these exteriors;
and even the _narthex_,[276] which in the Apollinare in Classe afforded
an excellent opportunity for embellishment, could not be less ornamental
if it were the entrance to a barn instead of to a church of such
richness and beauty as this in all its internal arrangements.The restoration of portions of the Cathedral of St.Mark during the past
twenty years, and the careful examination of various documents in the
archives of that city have led to the discovery that the work attributed
to Doge Pietro Orseolo, 976-78, consisted mainly in the re-construction
of the basilican church erected by the Doge Jean Participazio in 829-32,
and burnt in 976.Mark the
Evangelist, brought from Alexandria in 828 (when the Mohametans pulled
down the church of St.Mark in that town), determined Jean’s brother
Justinian to build a church which should be worthy of their reception.He died, however, before the work was commenced, but left a large sum of
money for the purpose.This church was built on the old site situated
between the Ducal Palace and the church of St.Theodore, which, up to
that time, had served as the Ducal chapel.The width of the church would
seem to have been the same as that of the present nave and aisles.Its
west end formed part of the existing wall behind the present vestibule,
but some difference of opinion seems to exist as to its eastern end, and
whether it coincided with the actual apses.Though nominally built in
976-78 the decoration of Orseolo’s church was probably carried on in
succeeding years, and much of the sculptural work in the present
building dates from the first half of the 11th century.In 1063, under
the Doge Domenico Contarini, the church of St.Theodore, according to M.
Cattaneo,[277] was pulled down and some of its materials used in the new
cathedral.Portions also of the Ducal Palace were destroyed to give
increased space on the south side for the Transept, the portion known as
the Treasury only being preserved.[278] The record of the new church
states that it was built similar in its artistic construction to that at
Constantinople erected in honour of the twelve apostles.[279] The
arrangement and the design of the church thus extended were probably due
to a Greek architect, though much of the work, according to M. Cattaneo,
was afterwards carried out by a Lombard sculptor, Mazulo, who designed
the atrium and tower of the abbey of Pomposa (about 30 miles from
Venice), where the carving is of the same character or style as that in
St.across the transepts; externally these dimensions are increased
to 260 × 215, and the whole area to about 46,000 square ft., so that
although of respectable dimensions it is by no means a large church.The

barrel vaults about 15 ft.extends under

monolithic columns 5 ft.high: the whole height from floor to the

probably followed the erection of the church, which was not consecrated
till 1111, when Ordelapo Faliero was Doge.Externally this apse is
polygonal, as in Byzantine churches, the upper storey being set back to
allow of a passage round.The narthex or vestibule in front of the
church, which extends also on north and south of the nave aisles up to
the transepts, and the rooms over the north narthex and over part of the
baptistery, must have followed the erection of the church; in fact, the
principal front could not have been completed without them.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali di Europa.’)]

Externally the original construction was in brick, with blind arcades,
niches, and a simple brick cornice such as is found in Lombardic work.It was not till the commencement of the 13th century that the decoration
of the front and sides with marble was undertaken; the arches were
encased with marble slabs carried on ranges of columns, those of the
narthex being placed one above the other.The shafts, capitals and bases
were brought from other buildings, having been imported from Altinum,
Aquileia, Heraclea, Ravenna, and from other places in Dalmatia, Syria,
and the East.It is possible that the porches of the churches of St.Trophime at Arles may have suggested this method of
decoration, of which no prototype exists in the East.The capitals are
of all periods, from the 4th to the 11th centuries, the entablature
blocks and the stylobates being specially worked for the building.The
rose window of the south transept and others of similar style were
inserted about the commencement of the 14th century, the baptistery and
the chapel of St.Isidore[280] being encased with marbles in the middle
of the same century, and the decoration of the upper part of the arches
of the west, towards the end of the 14th century.As will be seen by the
north and south fronts section (Woodcut No.416) the original brick
domes were surmounted by timber domes covered with lead, and of
considerable height.These were probably added in the middle of the 13th
century.[281] The rood loft dates from the end of the same century.The
earlier mosaics in the domes date from the 12th century, and the marble
casing of the lower portion of the walls and the richly decorated
pavement from the 12th and 13th centuries.The work of decoration was
carried on through succeeding centuries with occasional restorations, so
that the church itself constitutes a museum with almost every phase of
work in mosaic from the 12th to the 18th centuries.Though from a strictly architectural point of view the disposition of
the design is not equal to those of some of our northern cathedrals
(except perhaps for the greater beauty of Byzantine domical
construction), it is impossible to find fault with plain surfaces when
they are covered with such exquisite gold mosaics as those of St.Mark’s, or with the want of accentuation in the lines of the roof, when
every part of it is more richly adorned in this manner than any other
church of the Western world.Then too the rood screens, the pulpit, the
pala d’oro and the whole furniture of the choir are so rich, so
venerable, and on the whole so beautiful, and seen in so exquisitely
subdued a light, that it is impossible to deny that it is perhaps the
most impressive interior in Western Europe.Front at Périgueux, with
almost identical dimensions and design (Woodcut No.562), is cold,
scattered, and unmeaning, because but a structural skeleton of St.Mark’s without its adornments.The interior of a 13th-century Gothic
church is beautiful, even when whitewashed; but these early attempts had
not yet reached that balance between construction and ornament, which is
necessary to real architectural effect.The same is true of the exterior; if stripped of its ornament and
erected in plain stone it would hardly be tolerable, and the mixture of
florid 14th-century foliage and bad Italian Gothic details with the
older work, would be all but unendurable.But marble, mosaic, sculpture,
and the all-hallowing touch of age and association, disarm the critic,
and force him to worship when his reason tells him he ought to blame.Mark’s must have been admired in the days of its freshness,
the Gothic feeling seems to have been so strong in Northern Italy in the
11th and 12th centuries as to prevent its being used as a model.The one
prominent exception is San Antonio, Padua (1237-1307), which is
evidently a copy of St.Mark’s, but with so much Gothic design mixed up
with it as to spoil both.Length was sought to be obtained by using
seven domes instead of five, and running an aisle round the apse.The
side-aisles were covered with intersecting vaults, and pointed arches
were occasionally introduced when circular would have harmonised better
with the general design.Externally the enveloping porch was omitted—not even the Pisan
modification of it introduced, though it might have been employed with
the happiest effect.The consequence of all this jumble is, that San
Antonio is externally one of the most unsatisfactory churches in Europe,
though possessing a quaint Oriental look from the grouping of its dome
with the minaret-like spires which adorn it.The inside is not so bad,
though a roof of only five bays over a quasi-Gothic church, 200 ft.in
length, distorts the proportion, and with the ill-understood details of
the whole, spoils what narrowly escaped being one of the most successful
interiors of that part of Italy.Both Dalmatia and Istria formed part of the Gothic kingdom of Theodoric:
we find therefore the same Byzantine influence exerted as in Ravenna; an
influence which increased when the first-named country was retaken by
Justinian in 535, and the second in 539 A.D.At Parenzo in Istria there is a basilica, built in the year 543 A.D.by
the Bishop Euphrasius, and consequently contemporary with the examples
at Ravenna already described.This church still retains its atrium,
baptistery, and other accompaniments, which those at Ravenna have lost.It consists of a basilica in three aisles, with an apse at the end of
each, and an atrium in front, beyond which is situated the baptistery;
and in front of this again a tower, though this latter feature seems to
be of more modern date.On one side at the east end is a chapel or
crypt; this, Mr.Jackson[282] suggests, may have been “the martyrium or
confessio of the basilica where the remains of the saintly patrons of
the church were preserved and venerated.” “According to strict rule,”
Mr.Jackson observes, “the confessio should be in a crypt under the
choir as at Aquileja and Zara, but Parenzo lies so low that excavation
would be difficult, and here as in other cases the martyrium may have
been placed in an adjoining building.”[283]

Internally the church is 121 ft.in length by 32 in width, and possesses
all the usual arrangements of a church of that date.The columns are
borrowed from some earlier edifice, but the capitals are all original,
and were carved for the church.They are all of pure Byzantine type, and
are surmounted by that essentially Byzantine feature the dosseret.The
central apse, though circular inside, is polygonal outside, which is
another characteristic of Byzantine work.Like Torcello it has still
preserved its semicircle of marble seats for the clergy, with the
episcopal throne in the middle.Externally the façade retains portions
of the ancient mosaics with which it was decorated, and although
internally the nave has lost its early decorations, the lofty dado of
the apse inlaid with slabs of porphyry and serpentine interspersed with
mosaics of opaque glass, onyx and mother-of-pearl, bears witness to its
original splendour, the cypher of Euphrasius denoting its execution to
be coeval with the building of the church, and therefore some centuries
earlier than the mosaics of the baldachino, which are dated 1277.Church at Parenzo in Istria.Jackson for the description of two churches
at Grado: the Duomo and St.Maria delle Grazie; the former a fine
basilican church with nave and aisles and a deep central apse, circular
inside and polygonal externally.[284] The twenty columns of the nave are
all taken from earlier edifices, and of the capitals which surmount them
five are Roman and twelve of pure Byzantine workmanship, based on the
Roman composite capital, but treated in a quite original way.The
capitals are not surmounted by the dosseret, but in the other church of
St.Maria delle Grazie some have the dosseret and others are without it,
though all of the same period.The chief glory of the church, however,
lies in its magnificent marble pavement (measured and illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work), the greater portion of which is still preserved.Maria delle Grazie is a small basilican church of six bays
with fragments of similar pavement to those in the Duomo.The apse here
is masked on the exterior by two sacristies on each side which entirely
enclose it; similar examples are found in De Vogüé’s work of “Central
Syria” (Woodcuts Nos.The churches of Parenzo and Grado appear to be the only examples
remaining of early Romano-Byzantine work on this side of the Adriatic.Maria de Canneto at Pola, consecrated in 546 A.D., was destroyed in
the 14th and 15th centuries and its materials carried off to Venice for
the adornment of the churches there.As edifices of the age of
Justinian, and as showing the relative position of the various parts
that made up an ecclesiastical establishment in those early times, the
churches of Parenzo and Grado are singularly deserving of the attention
of those to whom the history of art is a matter of interest.The church at Torcello, in the Venetian Lagune, is the last example it
will be necessary to quote in order to make the arrangements of the
early basilicas intelligible.It was originally erected in the seventh
century; of this church, according to M. Cattaneo, the only portion
remaining, if we except a fragment of the ancient baptistery, is the
central apse.In 864, the church would seem to have been reconstructed,
and to this period belong the two side apses, the apsidal crypt with new
windows pierced through the old wall and the external walls: it is
possible that the original nave of the seventh century was retained till
1008, when it was rebuilt by the Doge Pietro Orseolo, on the occasion of
his son being raised to the Bishopric of Torcello.Thirteen of the
capitals of the nave date from this period, one may be earlier, and five
belong to the second half of the 12th century.The whole width of the
church is 71 ft.A screen of six pillars
divides the nave from the sanctuary.Perhaps, however, the most
interesting part of this church is the interior of its apse, which still
retains the bishop’s throne, surrounded by six ranges of seats for his
presbytery, arranged like those of an ancient theatre.It presents one
of the most extensive and best preserved examples of the fittings of the
apse, and gives a better idea of the mode in which the apses of churches
were originally arranged than anything that is to be found in any other
church, either of its age or of an earlier period.404), this church possesses a small
side chapel, a vestry or sanctuary, on the Gospel side of the altar, and
the remains of the ancient baptistery may still be traced in front of
the west door.This was a square block, externally, measuring 37 ft.each way; internally an octagon, with the angles cut into hemispherical
niches.A portion of its eastern side only remains, and this is now
hidden behind the modern baptistery, in which, under a board in the
pavement, can be seen the foundations of the second baptistery of the
12th century.In the rear of the church stood the campanile, and across
a narrow passage the conventual buildings; in front of which now stands
the beautiful little church of Sta.Fosca, the whole making up a group
of nearly unrivalled interest considering its small dimensions.Other examples might be quoted differing in some slight respect from
those just given, but the above are probably sufficient to explain the
general arrangements of the early basilican churches and the style of
their architecture, so long as this worked on the old tradition of the
Romano-Byzantine style; in other words, so long as it continued in Italy
to be a distinction from the Roman style without any foreign admixture
beyond that introduced direct from Byzantium.It might be instructive to
speculate on what the style might have become if left alone to develope
itself on its native soil, but it would be extremely difficult to make
the subject clear without a much larger amount of illustration than is
admissible, and which in such a history as this would be out of place.Simultaneously with the elaboration of the rectangular form of church by
the Italians, the Byzantines were occupied with the same task; but,
being freer from the trammels of tradition and less influenced by
examples, they early arrived at forms much more divergent from those of
the classical period than those of Italy, and their style, reacting on
the Italian, produced that very beautiful combination of which Pisa
Cathedral is a type, and St.Mark’s at Venice an extreme example.This
style generally pervaded the whole south of Italy, with the exception of
Rome; and, from the elements of which it was composed, may fairly be
designated Byzantine Italian.Apse of Basilica at Torcello.]While this was going on in the south, the Longobards, and other
Barbarians who invaded the north of Italy, seized on this type and
worked it out in their own fashion.They, however, conceived the desire
to give a more permanent character to their churches by covering them
over with stone vaulted roofs, which led to most important modifications
of the style.It may probably be correct to assert that no
Romano-Byzantine or early Romanesque church has, or ever had, a vaulted
nave.On the other hand, there is hardly a Barbarian church which the
builders did not aspire to vault, though they were frequently unable to
accomplish it.It was this vaulting mania which led to the invention of
compound piers, pointed arches, buttresses, pinnacles, and all the
numerous peculiarities of the Gothic style; and which, reacting on
northern Italy, produced the Ghibelline or Italian-Gothic style.No exact boundary can be drawn between these two: modifications of style
varied, as Byzantine or Gothic influences ebbed or flowed, during the
Middle Ages.Venice and Pisa, and all Calabria, were generally
influenced by their intercourse with the East, while the whole of the
north of Italy and away from the coast as far down as Sienna and Orvieto
the strong hand of the Teuton made itself felt.Yet Italy cannot be said to have been successful in either style.Her
superior civilisation enabled her to introduce and use an elegance of
detail unknown north of the Alps; but she did not work out the basilican
type for herself: she left it to others to do that for her, and
consequently never perfectly understood what she undertook, or why it
was done.The result is that, though great elegance is found in parts,
Italy can hardly produce a single church which is satisfactory as a
design; or which would be intelligible without first explaining the
basework of those true styles from which its principal features have
been borrowed.Costanza—Churches at Perugia, Nocera,
  Ravenna, Milan—Secular Buildings.In addition to the Pagan basilicas and temples, from which the
arrangements of so many of the Christian edifices were obtained, the
tombs of the Romans formed a third type, from which the forms of a very
important class of churches were derived.The form which these buildings retained, so long as they remained mere
sepulchres appropriated to Pagan uses, has been already described (pp.That of Cæcilia Metella and those of Augustus and Hadrian
were what would now be called “chambered tumuli;” originally the
sepulchral chamber was infinitesimally small as compared with the mass,
but we find these being gradually enlarged till we approach the age of
Constantine, when, as in the tombs of the Tossia Family, that called the
Tomb of Helena (Woodcut No.227) and many others of the same age, they
became miniature Pantheons.The central apartment was all in all; the
exterior was not thought of.Still they were appropriated to sepulchral
rites, and these only, so long as they belonged to Pagan Rome.The case
was different when they were erected by the Christians.No association
could be more appropriate than that of these sepulchral edifices, to a
religion nursed in persecution, and the apostles of which had sealed
their faith with their blood as martyrs; and when the Sacrament for the
dying and the burial service were employed, it was in these circular
churches that it was performed.But besides the viaticum for the
departing Christian, the Church provided the admission sacrament of
baptism for those who were entering into communion, and this was, in
early days at least, always performed in a building separate from the
basilica.It would depend on whether marriage was then considered as a
sacrament or a civil contract, whether it was celebrated in the basilica
or the church; but it seems certain that the one was used almost
exclusively as the business place of the community, the other as the
sacramental temple of the sect.This appears always to have been the
case, at least when the two forms existed together, as they almost
always did in the great ecclesiastical establishments of Italy.When the
church was copied from a temple, as in the African examples above
described, it is probable it may have served both purposes.But too
little is known of the architecture of this early age, and its
liturgies, to speak positively on the subject.The uses and derivation of these three forms of churches are so distinct
that it would be extremely convenient if we could appropriate names to
distinguish them.The first retains most appropriately the name of
basilica, and with sufficient limitation to make it generally
applicable.The word _ecclesia_, or _église_, would equally suffice for
the second but that it is not English, and has been so indiscriminately
applied that it could not now be used in a restricted sense.The word
kirk, or as we soften it into church, would be appropriate to the
third,[286] but again it has been so employed as to be inapplicable.We
therefore content ourselves with employing the words Basilica, Church,
and Round Church, to designate the three, employing some expletive when
any confusion is likely to arise between the first two of the series.The most interesting feature of the early Romanesque circular buildings
is that they show the same transitional progress from an external to an
internal columnar style of architecture which marked the change from the
Pagan to the Christian form of sacred edifice.It is perhaps not too
much to assert that no ancient classic building of circular form has any
pillars used constructively in its interior.[287] Even the Pantheon,
though 143 ft.in diameter, derives no assistance from the pillars
that surround it internally—they are mere decorative features.The same
is true of the last Pagan example we are acquainted with—the temple or
tomb which Diocletian erected in his palace at Spalato (Woodcut No.The pillars do fill up the angles there, but the building would be
stable without them.The Byzantine architects also generally declined to
avail themselves of pillars to support their domes, but the Romanesque
architects used them almost as universally as in their basilicas.Another very striking peculiarity is the entire abandonment of all
external decoration.Roman circular temples had peristyles, like those
at Tivoli (Woodcut No.193) and that of Vesta in Rome.Even the Pantheon
is as remarkable for its portico as its dome, so is that known as the
Torre dei Schiavi,[288] but it is only in the very earliest of the
Christian edifices that we find a trace of the portico, and even in them
hardly any attempt at external decoration.The temples of the Christians
were no longer shrines to contain statues and to which worship might be
addressed by people outside, but had become halls to contain the
worshippers themselves while engaged in acts of devotion.The tomb of the Empress Helena (Woodcut No.227) is one of the earliest
examples of its class.It has no pillars internally, it is true, but it
likewise has none on the exterior—the transition was not then complete.The same is the case with the two tombs on the Spina of the Circus of
Nero (Woodcut No.They too were astylar, and their external
appearance was utterly neglected.When from these we turn to the Tomb or Baptistery of Constantine, built
some time afterwards (Woodcut No.422), we find the roof supported by a
screen of eight columns, two storeys in height, and through all its
alterations can detect the effort to make the interior ornamental.It
has, however, a portico, but this again is practically an interior, both
ends being closed with apsidal terminations, so that it really forms a
second apartment, rather than a portico.In both these respects it is in
advance of the building next to it in age that we know of—the Octagon at
Spalato—which it otherwise very much resembles.The eight internal
pillars instead of being mere ornaments have become essential parts of
the construction, and the external peristyle has disappeared, leaving
only the fragment of a porch.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The tomb which the same Emperor erected to contain the remains of his
daughter Constantia, is another example of the same transitional style.The interior in this instance is vaulted, but so timidly that
twenty-four pillars are employed to sustain a weight for which half that
number would have been amply sufficient.In the square niche opposite
the entrance stood the sarcophagus of the princess, now in the Vatican.The roof of the aisle is adorned with paintings of the vintage and
scenes of rural life, which, like all those on the tombs of Pagan Rome,
have no reference to the sepulchral uses to which the building was
dedicated.The whole internal diameter of the tomb is 73 ft., that of
the dome 35.In front of the building is a small crypto-porticus similar in
arrangement to that of her father’s tomb, and beyond this is an oblong
space with circular ends, and surrounded on all sides by arcades; its
dimensions were 535 ft.by 130, and, though so ruined as hardly to allow
of its arrangements being restored, it is interesting as being perhaps
the only instance of the “_forum_,” which it is probable was left before
all tombs in those times, and traces of which may perhaps be found
elsewhere, though as yet they have not been looked for.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)The only other important circular building within the walls of Rome of
this early age is that known as S. Stefano Rotondo.Though there is
nothing to fix its date with any precision, it is almost certain that it
belongs to the fifth century of the Christian era.in
diameter, and its roof was supported by two ranges of columns,
circularly disposed in its interior; and on the first or inner range
rested a horizontal architrave like that of St.In the outer
one the pillars support arches like those of St.[290] All the
pillars are taken from older buildings.The outer aisle was divided into
eight compartments; but in what manner, and for what purpose, it is not
now easy to ascertain, owing to the ruined state of the building, and to
its having been so much and so frequently altered since it was first
erected.Nor can it be determined exactly how it was roofed; though it
is probable that its arrangements were identical with those of the great
five-aisled basilicas, which it closely resembles, except in its
circular shape.This is more clear in another church of the same age, that of Sti.Angeli, at Perugia, which is very similar in its disposition.Of this
building a section is here shown, as given by M. Isabelle—perhaps not
quite to be depended upon in every respect, but still affording a very
fair representation of what the arrangements of the circular wooden
roofed churches were.Its dimensions are much less than those of San
Stefano, being only 115 ft.in diameter; but it is more regular, the
greater part of its materials being apparently original, and made for
the place they occupy.In the church of San Stefano, the tomb-shaped
circular form was probably used as symbolical of his martyrdom.That at
Perugia was most likely originally a baptistery, or it may also have
been dedicated to some martyr; but in the heart of Etruria this form may
have been adopted for other reasons, the force of which we are hardly
able at the present day to appreciate, though in all cases locality is
one of the strongest influencing powers in so far as architectural forms
are concerned.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Plan of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.Double the
usual scale, or 50 ft.At Nocera dei Pagani, on the road between Naples and Salerno, there is
an extremely beautiful circular church, built undoubtedly for the
purpose of a baptistery, and very similar in plan and general
arrangement to the tomb of Constantia, now known as the Baptistery of
Sta.Agnese, though somewhat larger being 80 ft.Its
principal merit is the form of its dome, which is not only correct in a
scientific point of view, but singularly graceful internally.Externally
this building for the first time introduces us to a peculiarity which
had as much influence on the western styles as any of those pointed out
above.540), the early Romanesque architects
never attempted to vault their rectangular buildings, but they did
frequently construct domes over their circular edifices.But here again
they did not make the outside of the dome the outline of their
buildings, as the Romans had always done before the time of Constantine,
and as the Byzantines and Saracens invariably did afterwards; but they
employed their vault only as a ceiling internally, and covered it, as in
this instance, with a false wooden roof externally.It may be difficult
to determine how far this was a judicious innovation; but this at least
is certain, that it had as much influence on the development of the
Gothic style as the vaulting mania itself.In the 10th and 11th
centuries many attempts were made to construct true roofs of stone, but
unsuccessfully; and from various causes, which will be pointed out
hereafter, the idea was abandoned, and the architects were forced to
content themselves with a stone ceiling, covered by a wooden roof,
though this became one of the radical defects of the style, and one of
the principal causes of the decay and destruction of so many beautiful
buildings.Section of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Ravenna possesses several circular buildings, almost as interesting as
those of the capital; the first being the baptistery of St.John
belonging to the original basilica, and consequently one of the oldest
Christian buildings of the place.Externally it is a plain octagonal
building, 40 ft.Internally it still retains its mosaic and
other internal features added in the 5th century, which are singularly
elegant and pleasing.Its design is somewhat like that of the temple at
Spalato, but with arcades substituted everywhere for horizontal
architraves; the century that elapsed between these two epochs having
sufficed to complete the transition between the two styles.Far more interesting than this is the great church of St.Vitale, the
most complicated, and at the same time, perhaps, the most beautiful, of
the circular churches of that age.In design it is nearly identical with
the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople (see Woodcut No.311), from
which it was undoubtedly copied, and probably by Greek artists from that
town.It was built in the reign of Justinian by St.Ecclesius,
archbishop of the see, and was consecrated in 547, eight years after the
taking of Ravenna by Justinian’s generals.The principal difference of
the plan lies in its being enclosed within an octagon instead of a
square, as in St.Sergius, probably to mask the irregularity of the main
entrance from a street which did not run in the direction of any of the
cardinal points.The recesses are loftier in proportion than those of
St.Sergius, and in the lower storey arcades take the place of beams.The aisles being covered with timber roofs, it was necessary to raise
the walls of the octagon higher than those of St.Sergius, and small
arches take the place of the usual pendentives: the springing of the
dome, which is 50 ft.in diameter, is on the level of the sill of the
windows the arches of which therefore form penetrations into the dome.The church is built in bricks with thick mortar joints, the dome being
constructed in an ingenious manner with hollow pots fitted the end of
one into the mouth of the other; the lightness of this vault has enabled
the builders to dispense with the immense arches and buttresses found in
St.Similar construction with pots had been
employed in the East for domes and roofs,[291] and they form as
permanent a method as stone itself, in addition to the stability,
facility of construction, and lightness which such an expedient affords.Internally a good deal has been done in modern times to destroy the
simplicity of the original effect of the building; but still there is a
pleasing result produced by alternating the piers with circular columns,
and a lightness and elegance about the whole design that render it
unrivalled in the western world among churches of its class.This seems
to have been admitted by its contemporaries as much as it is in modern
times.Charlemagne at all events copied it for his own tomb at
Aix-la-Chapelle, and the architects of many other circular buildings of
that age appear to have derived their inspiration from this one.The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, had it not been so much altered in
modern times, would take precedence of San Vitale in almost every
respect.The date of its erection is not known, though it certainly must
be as early as, if not earlier than, the time of Justinian.Down to the
8th century it was the cathedral of the city.It was burnt to the ground
in 1071, and restored in 1119; the dome then erected fell in 1571, on
which it underwent its last transformation from the hands of Martino
Bassi and Pellegrini, who so disfigured its ancient details as to lead
many modern inquirers to doubt whether it was really so old as it was
said to be.Its plan, however, seems to have remained unchanged, and shows a further
progress towards what afterwards became the Byzantine style than is to
be found either in St.It is in fact the
earliest attempt to amalgamate the circular church with one of a square
shape; and except that the four lateral colonnades are flat segments of
circles, and that there is a little clumsiness in the angles (due
possibly to the additions made in 1119 and 1571, when the plan of the
dome was changed to an octagon, the original dome being probably
circular, and carried on four spherical pendentives), it is one of the
most successful designs handed down from that early age.The dome as it now stands is octagonal, which the first dome certainly
could not have been.Its diameter is 70 ft., nearly equal to that of the
Minerva Medica, and the whole diameter of the building is internally 142
ft.(From Quast,
‘Altchristlichen,’ &c.)In front of the church, in the street, is a handsome colonnade of
pillars, borrowed from some ancient temple—it is said from one dedicated
to Hercules; this leads to a square atrium, now wholly deprived of its
lateral arcades; and this again to a façade, which has been strangely
altered in modern times.Opposite this, to the eastward of the church,
is an octagonal building, apparently intended as a tomb-house; and on
the north side a similar one, though smaller.On the south is the
baptistery, about 45 ft.in diameter, approached by a vestibule in the
same manner as that of Constantine at Rome, and as in the tomb of his
daughter Constantia: all these, however, have been so painfully altered,
that little remains besides the bare plan of the building; still there
is enough to show that this is one of the oldest and most interesting of
the Christian churches of Italy.The building now known as the baptistery at Florence is an octagon, 108
ft.Like the last-mentioned church, it was
originally the cathedral of the city, and was erected to serve as such
apparently in the time of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.If this
was so, it certainly had not originally its present form, and most
probably those columns which now stand ranged round the walls at that
time stood in the centre, as in the Roman examples.If the original roof
was of wood, it was probably in two storeys, like that of the baptistery
of Constantine, or it may have been a dome of more solid materials, like
that of the Sta.At the same time when the new cathedral was built, the older edifice
appears to have been remodelled both internally and externally by
Arnolpho da Lapo, and both its form and decoration so completely
changed, that it must now be considered rather as a building of the 13th
century than of the 6th, in which it seems originally to have been
erected.[292]

[Illustration: 433.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Baptistery at
Novara.The baptistery of Novara, which may date from the time of Charlemagne,
is interesting in that it contains the germ of those external galleries
under the roof which form not only one of the most common but also one
of the most beautiful features of the later Lombard and Rhenish
churches.433) it will easily be seen
what was the motive and use of this arrangement, the first trace of
which dates perhaps as far back as the baptistery of Nocera (Woodcut No.428); for wherever a wooden roof was placed over a circular vault, it is
evident that the external walls must be carried up higher than the
springing of the arch.But it was by no means necessary that this
additional wall should be so solid as that below it, and it was
necessary to introduce light and air into the space between the stone
and the wooden roofs.Add to this the incongruity of effect in placing a
light tiled wooden roof on a massive solid wall, and it will be evident
that not only did the exigencies of the building, but the true
principles of taste, demand that this part should be made as light as
possible.Such openings as those found in the baptistery at Novara
suggested an expedient which provided for these objects.This was
afterwards carried to a much greater extent.At first, however, it seems
only to have been used under the roofs of the domes with which the
Italians almost universally crowned the intervention of naves and
transepts, and round the semidomes of the apses; but so enamoured did
they afterwards become of this feature, that it is frequently carried
along the sides of the churches under the roof of the nave and of the
aisles, and also—where it is of more questionable taste—under the
sloping naves of the roof of the principal façade.There is nothing in the Lombardian and Rhenish styles so common or so
beautiful as these galleries, the arcades of which have all the shadow
given by a cornice without its inconvenient projection, while the little
shafts with their elegant capitals and light archivolts have a sparkle
and brilliancy which no cornice ever possessed.Indeed so beautiful are
they, that we are not surprised to find them universally adopted; and
their discontinuance on the introduction of the pointed style was one of
the greatest losses sustained by architectural art in those days.It is
true they would have been quite incompatible with the thin walls and
light piers of pointed architecture, but it may be safely asserted that
no feature which these new styles introduced was equally beautiful with
those galleries which they superseded.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.There can be little doubt that many other similar buildings belonging to
this age still exist in various parts of Italy; for it is more than
probable that, at a time when the city was not of sufficient importance,
or the congregation so numerous as to require the more extended
accommodation of the basilica, almost all the earlier churches were
circular.They either, however, have perished from lapse of time, or
have been so altered as to be nearly unrecognisable.We here, in
consequence, come again to a break in the chain of our sequence; and
when we again meet with any circular buildings in Italy, their features
are so distinctly Gothic or Byzantine, that they must be classed with
one or other of these modifications.The true Romano-Byzantine style had
nearly come to an end when Alboin the Lombard had made himself master of
the greater part of Italy about the year 575.Before leaving this branch of the subject there are two small buildings
at Ravenna which it is impossible to pass over, though their direct
bearing on the history of this subject is not so apparent as it is in
the case of other buildings just described.The first and earliest is
the tomb of Galla Placidia (Woodcut No.302), now known as the church of
SS.Nazario and Celso, and must have been erected before the year 450.It is singular among all the tombs of that age from the abandonment in
it of the circular for a cruciform plan.Such forms, it is true, are
common in the chambers of tumuli and also among the catacombs, while the
church which Constantine built in Constantinople and dedicated to the
Apostles, meaning it however as a sepulchral church, was something also
on this plan.Notwithstanding, however, these examples, this must be
considered as an exceptional form, though its diminutiveness (it being
only 35 ft.by 30 internally) might perhaps account for any caprice.Its
great interest to us consists in its retaining not only its primitive
architectural form (which is that of a dome carried on pendentives, and
one of the few instances in which both dome and pendentives form part of
one sphere), but its polychromatic decorations nearly in their original
state of completeness (Woodcut 302).The three arms of the cross forming
the receptacles for the three sarcophagi is certainly a pleasing
arrangement, but is only practicable on a small scale.Capital of Pillars forming peristyle round
Theodoric’s Tomb.Elevation of Tomb of Theodoric, Ravenna.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)]

Far more interesting than this—architecturally at least—is the tomb of
Theodoric, the Gothic king, now known as Santa Maria Rotunda.The lower
storey is a decagon externally, enclosing a cruciform crypt.in diameter, each face being ornamented by a deep niche.These
support a flat terrace, on which originally stood a range of small
pillars supporting arches which surrounded the upper storey.These have
all been removed, though their form can be restored from fragments
found, and as shown in Woodcut No.On the face of the tomb itself
are the sinkings for the architraves and vaults which they supported.The most singular part of the building is the roof, which is formed of
one great slab hollowed out into the form of a flat dome—internally 30
ft.in diameter—and which certainly forms one of
the most unique and appropriate coverings for a tomb perhaps anywhere to
be found.Near the edge are a series of projecting bosses, which
evidently were originally used as handles, by means of which the immense
mass was raised to its present position.In the centre of the dome is a
small square pedestal, on which, it is said, once stood the urn which
contained the ashes of its founder.The model of this building seems probably to have been the Mole of
Hadrian, which Theodoric saw, and must have admired, during his
celebrated visit to Rome.The polygonal arrangements of the exterior,
and the substitution of arcades for horizontal architraves, were only
such changes as the lapse of time had rendered indispensable.But the
building of the ancient world which it most resembles is the Tour Magne
at Nîmes.In both cases we have the polygonal basement containing a
great chamber, and above this externally the narrow ledge, approached by
flying flights of steps.We cannot now tell what crowned the French
example, though the fact of an urn crowning the tomb at Ravenna points
to an identical origin, but we must obtain a greater number of examples
before we can draw any positive conclusions as to the origin of such
forms.Meanwhile, however, whether we consider the appropriateness of
the forms, the solidity of its construction, or the simplicity of its
ornaments and details, this tomb at Ravenna is not surpassed by any
building of its class and age.Though the investigation of the early history of these circular forms of
churches is not so important as that of the rectangular basilicas, it is
extremely interesting from the influence they had on the subsequent
development of the style.In Italy it is probable that one-half of the
early churches were circular in plan; and one such is still generally
retained attached to each cathedral as a baptistery.Except for this
purpose, however, the form has generally been superseded: the
rectangular being much easier to construct, more capable of extension,
and altogether more appropriate to the ritual of the Christian
community.In France the circular form was early absorbed into the
basilica, forming the Chevet or apse.In Germany its fate was much the
same as in Italy, but its supersession was earlier and more complete.In
England some half-dozen examples are known to exist, and in Spain they
have yet to be discovered.Had the Gothic architects applied themselves to the extension and
elaboration of the circular form with the same zeal and skill as was
displayed in that task by their Byzantine brethren, they might probably
have produced something far more beautiful than even the best of our
mediæval cathedrals; but when the Barbarians began to build, they found
the square form with its straight lines simpler and easier to construct.It thus happened that, long before they became as civilised and expert
as the Easterns were when they commenced the task, the Westerns had
worked the rectangular form into one of considerable beauty, and had
adapted it to their ritual, and their ritual to it.It thus became the
sacred and appropriate form, and the circular or domical forms were
consequently never allowed a fair trial in Western Europe.Very few remains of secular buildings in the early Christian style are
now to be found in Italy.The palace of Theodoric at Ravenna, though
sadly mutilated, is perhaps the best and most perfect.In all its
details it shows a close resemblance to that of Diocletian at Spalato,
but more especially so to the Porta Aurea and the most richly and least
classically decorated parts of that edifice, but much intermixed with
mouldings and details which would seem to belong to a later style.Another building, though perhaps of earlier date, is that which is now
called the Palazzo delle Torre at Turin, and which still retains the
architectural ordinance of the exterior of a Roman amphitheatre, but so
modified by common sense that the pilasters are frankly accepted as
purely decorative features, having only a slight projection.A similar
style of work is found at Bordeaux in what is known as the “Palais
Gallien,” but which in reality is a fragment of an amphitheatre built by
the Emperor Gallienus (260-268 A.D.).The example at Turin is built with
brick of large dimensions 15 in.by 11 in., which, coupled with its
character and style, has led M. Cattaneo to ascribe it to the 3rd or 4th
century of our era; the paucity of contemporary examples, however,
renders it extremely difficult to trace the exact history of the style
at this age.Palazzo delle Torre, Turin.(From Osten’s ‘Bauwerke
in der Lombardei.’)]

In so progressive an art as architecture it is always very difficult,
sometimes impossible, to fix the exact date when one style ends and
another begins.In an art so pre-eminently ecclesiastical as
architecture was in those days, it will probably be safer to look in the
annals of the Church rather than in those of the State for a date when
the debased-Roman expired, giving birth, phœnix-like, to the Romanesque.Viewed from this point there can be little doubt but that the reign of
Gregory the Great (A.D.590 to 603) must be regarded as that in which
the Latin language and the Roman style of architecture both ceased to be
generally or even commonly employed.After this date we wander on through five centuries of tentative efforts
to form a new style, and in the age of another Gregory—the VII.—we find
at last the Romanesque style emancipated from former traditions, and
marching steadily forward with a well-defined aim.What had been
commenced under the gentle influence of a Theodelinda at Florence in the
year 600, was completed in the year 1077 under the firmer guidance of a
Matilda at Canossa.LOMBARD AND ROUND-ARCHED GOTHIC.Chapel at Friuli—Churches at Piacenza and Novara—St.Ambrogio, Milan—Cathedral, Piacenza—Churches at Verona—Churches at
  Toscanella—Circular Churches—Towers.When, in the early centuries of the Christian era, the great mass of
Gothic barbarism moved up the Valley of the Danube towards the west, one
great division followed that river to its source, and thence penetrated
into and settled in the Valley of the Rhine.Though sufficiently
numerous to be able almost wholly to obliterate all traces of former
civilisation, they had virtually no style of their own, and it seems
probable that the edifices left by the Romans sufficed for the early
wants of the people.The other great division of the horde turned to the Sömmering Alps and,
penetrating into Italy by way of Udine and Conegliano, settled in the
Valley of the Po.They may have been as numerous as the others; but
Italy in those days was far more densely peopled than Germany, and the
inhabitants were consequently able to resist obliteration far more
successfully than on the north of the Alps, and even where the new
element prevailed most strongly its influence was far less felt than in
the more sparsely-peopled Rhenish provinces.This was generally more
apparent along the coast than in the interior.Venice did not exist, and
Ravenna, though overwhelmed, became the great centre of Romano-Byzantine
art.The
Barbarian influence was strongly felt at Siena, more feebly at Orvieto;
but there it was stopped by the influence of Rome, which throughout the
Middle Ages remained nearly uncontaminated.Notwithstanding the almost insuperable barrier of the Alps which
stretched between them and the different influences to which they were
subjected, the connection between the northern and southern hordes
remained intimate during the whole of the Middle Ages.Milan was as much
German as Italian; and, indeed, except from a slightly superior degree
of elegance in the southern examples, it is sometimes extremely
difficult to distinguish between the designs of Lombard and of Rhenish
churches.As the Middle Ages wore on, however, the breach between the
two styles widened; and there is no difficulty, in the later pointed
schools, in seeing how Italy was gradually working itself free from
German influence, till at last they became distinct and antagonistic
nationalities, practising two styles of art, which had very little in
common the one with the other.Whoever the Barbarians were who in the 5th and 6th centuries swarmed
into Italy—Austro-Goths, Visi-Goths, or Lombards—they certainly did not
belong to any of the great building races of the world.Few people ever
had better opportunities than they of employing their easily-acquired
plunder in architectural magnificence, if they had any taste that way;
but, though we hear everywhere of the foundation of churches and the
endowment of ecclesiastical establishments during the Carlovingian
period, not one important edifice of that age has come down to our time.The monumental history of the early Romanesque style is as essentially a
blank in Italy as it is in Saxon England.One or two circular buildings
remain tolerably entire; some small chapels let us into the secrets of
the style, but not one important edifice of any sort attests the
splendour of the Lombard kingdom of Northern Italy.Aryans they must
have been, and it was not till the beginning of the 11th century, when
their blood was thoroughly mixed with that of the indigenous inhabitants
and a complete fusion of races had taken place, that we find buildings
of a monumental character erected, which have come down to the present
day.Among the smaller monuments of the age none has been preserved more
complete and less altered than the little chapel at Friuli; which,
though extremely small (only 18 ft.by 30 inside the walls), is
interesting, as retaining all its decorations almost exactly as they
were left by Gertrude, duchess of Friuli, who erected it in the 8th
century.It shows considerable elegance in its details, and the
sculpture is far better than it afterwards became, though perhaps its
most remarkable peculiarity is the intersecting vault that covers
it—_pulchre testudinatum_, as the old chronicle terms it.This is one
proof among many, how early that feature was introduced which afterwards
became the formative principle of the whole Gothic style, and was as
essentially its characteristic as the pillars and entablatures of the
five orders were the characteristics of the classical styles of Greece
and Rome.As before remarked, it is this necessity for a stone roof that
was the problem to be solved by the architects, and to accomplish which
the style took almost all those forms which are so much admired in it.From this example of the Carlovingian era we are obliged to pass to the
11th and 12th centuries, the first great building age of the Lombards.It is true that there is scarcely a single important church in Pavia, in
Verona, or indeed in any of the cities of Lombardy, the original
foundation of which cannot be traced back to a much earlier period.Before the canons of architectural criticism were properly understood,
antiquaries were inclined to believe that in the buildings now existing
they saw the identical edifices erected during the period of the Lombard
sway.Either, however, in consequence of the rude construction of the
earlier buildings, or because they were too small or too poor for the
increased population and wealth of the cities at a later period, every
one of the original churches has disappeared and been replaced by a
larger and better-constructed edifice, adorned with all the improvements
which the experience of centuries had introduced into the construction
of religious edifices.Judging from the rudeness of the earliest churches which we know to have
been erected in the 11th century, it is evident that the progress made,
up to that period, was by no means equal to what was accomplished during
the next two centuries.[294]]

This will appear from the plan and section of St.Antonio at Piacenza
(Woodcuts Nos.440 and 440a), built in the first years of the 11th
century, and dedicated in 1014 by Bishop Siegfried.Section of Church of San Antonio at Piacenza.Plan and section of Baptistry at Asti.Its arrangement is somewhat peculiar; the transepts are near the west
end, and the octagonal tower rising from the intersection is supported
on eight pillars, the square being completed by four polygonal piers.The principal point, however, to observe is, how completely the style
has emancipated itself from all Roman tradition.A new style has grown
up as essentially different from the early Christian as the style of
Cologne or of York Cathedral.The architect is once more at liberty to
work out his own designs without reference to anything beyond the
exigencies of the edifices themselves.The plan, indeed, is still a
reminiscence of the Basilica; but so are all the plans of Mediæval
cathedrals, and we may trace back the forms of the pillars, the piers,
and the arches they support, to the preceding style.All these were
derived from Roman art, but the originals are forgotten, and the new
style is wholly independent of the old one.The whole of the church too
is roofed with intersecting vaults, which have become an integral part
of the design, giving it an essentially different character.On the
outside buttresses are introduced—timidly, it is true, but so
frequently, as to make it evident that already there existed no
insuperable objection to increase either their number or depth, as soon
as additional abutment was required for wider arches.The windows, as in all Italian churches, are small, for the Italians
never patronised the art of painting on glass, always preferring
frescoes or paintings on opaque grounds.In their bright climate, very
small openings alone were requisite to admit a sufficiency of light
without disturbing that shadowy effect which is so favourable to
architectural grandeur.Being a parochial church, this building had no baptistery attached to
it; but there is one at Asti (Woodcut No.441) so similar in style and
age, that its plan and section, if examined with those of San Antonio,
will give a very complete idea of Lombard architecture in the beginning
of the 11th century, when it had completely shaken off the Roman
influence, but had not yet begun to combine the newly-invented forms
with that grace and beauty which mark its more finished examples.One
peculiarity of this building is the gloom that reigns within, there
being absolutely no windows in the dome, and those in the aisles are so
small, that even in Italy the interior must always have been in
comparative darkness.The cathedral of Novara, which in its present state is one of the most
important buildings of the 11th century in the North of Italy, shows the
style still further advanced.The coupling and grouping of piers are
here fully understood, and the divisions of the chapels which form the
outer aisle are, in fact, concealed buttresses.The Italians were never
able to divest themselves of their partiality for flat walls, and never
liked the bold external projections so universally admired on the other
side of the Alps.They therefore gladly had recourse to this expedient
to conceal them; and when this was not available they used metallic ties
to resist the thrust of the arches—an expedient which is found even in
this example.As will be seen from the annexed plan, the atrium
connecting the basilica with the baptistery is retained, which seems to
have been an arrangement almost universal in those early times.The half
section, half elevation of the front (Woodcut No.443) shows very
distinctly how far the invention of the new style had then gone; for
except some Corinthian pillars, borrowed from an older edifice, no trace
of debased-Roman architecture is to be found in it.The design of the
façade explains what it was that suggested to the Pisan architects the
form to which they adapted their Romanesque details.In both styles the
arcade was the original model of the whole system of ornamentation.In
this case it is used first as a discharging arch, then as a mere
repetition of a useful member, and lastly without pillars, as a mere
ornamental string-course, which afterwards became the most favourite
ornament, not only in Italy, but throughout all Germany.Elevation and Section of the Façade of the Cathedral
at Novara.Interesting as such an example is to the architectural antiquary who is
tracing back and trying to understand the forms of a new style, it would
be difficult to conceive anything much uglier and less artistic than
such a façade as this of Novara or that of San Antonio, last quoted.Their sole merit is their history and their expression of rude energy,
so characteristic of the people who erected them.The church of San Michele at Pavia, which took its present form either
at the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, is one of the
most interesting of this age, and presents in itself all the
characteristics of a perfect round-arched Gothic church.Indeed there is
hardly any feature worth mentioning which was invented after this date
except the pointed arch—a very doubtful improvement—and window tracery,
which the Italians never cordially adopted or understood.444) shows the general arrangement of San Michele in its
present state.The researches of M. de Dartein,[295] however, have shown
that, when first built, the nave was covered over with two square
quadripartite vaults, as might in fact have been divined from the
difference in size[296] of the centre and two other piers.The existing
oblong vaulted compartments date from the 15th century, when secondary
shafts were carried up above the ground storey shafts of piers 1 and 3.The section, however, shows that well-marked vaulting shafts spring from
floor to roof, that the pier arches in the wall are probably distinct
and well understood, and that the angles of these piers are softened and
ornamented by shafts and other subordinate members.Altogether, it is
evident that that subdivision of labour (if the expression may be used)
which was so characteristic of the true Gothic style had here been
perfectly understood, every part having its own function and telling its
own story.To complete the style only required a little experience to
decide on the best and most agreeable proportions in size and solidity.In a century from the date of this church the required progress had been
made; a century later it had been carried too far, and the artistic
value of the style was lost in mere masonic excellence.San Michele and
the other churches of its age fail principally from over-heaviness of
parts and a certain clumsiness of construction, which, though not
without its value as an expression of power, wants the refinement
necessary for a true work of art.Externally, one of the most pleasing
features of this church is the apse with its circular gallery.In
Italian churches the gallery is usually a simple range of similar
arcades; here, however, it is broken into three great divisions by
coupled shafts springing from the ground, and these again subdivided by
single shafts running in like manner through the whole height of the
apse.The gallery thus not only becomes a part of the whole design,
instead of looking like a possible afterthought, but an agreeable
variety is also given, which adds not a little to the pleasing effect of
the building.View of the Apse of San Michele, Pavia.(From Du
Somerard, ‘Les Arts au Moyen-Age.’)]

There are at least two other churches in Pavia, which, though altered in
many parts, retain their apsidal arrangements tolerably perfect.One of
these, that of San Teodoro (1150), may be somewhat later than the San
Michele, and has its gallery divided into triplets of arcades by bold
flat buttresses springing from the ground.In the other, San Pietro in
Cielo d’Oro, dating from 1132, the arcade is omitted round the apse,
though introduced in the central dome.It has besides two subordinate
apses of graceful design, but inferior to the other examples.Though Milan must have been rich in churches of this age, the only one
now remaining tolerably entire is San Ambrogio, which is so interesting
as almost to make amends for its singularity.Historical evidence shows
that a church existed here from a very early age.It was rebuilt in the
9th century by Bishop Angelbert, aided by the munificence of Louis the
Pious, and an atrium was added by Bishop Anspertus; but except the apse
and “the canons’” tower, nothing remains of even that church, all the
rest having been rebuilt in the 11th or 12th century.During the late
restoration the bases of some of the columns of the 9th-century church
were discovered, and one of them is now visible in the pulpit enclosure.The disposition of the building will be understood from the annexed
plan, which shows both the atrium and the church.The former is
virtually the nave; in other words, had the church been erected on the
colder and stormier side of the Alps, a clerestory would have been added
to the atrium, and it would have been roofed over; and then the plan
would have been nearly identical with that of a Northern cathedral.The third (sexpartite) bay was revaulted in the 14th century with two
oblong quadripartite vaults, but these are now replaced by sexpartite
vaulting.The dome is probably an addition of the end of the 12th
century, and it is raised over what would otherwise have been the fourth
bay of the church.As it is, the atrium (Woodcut No.446) is a highly
pleasing adjunct to the façade, removing the church back from the noisy
world outside, and by its quiet seclusion tending to produce that
devotional feeling so suitable to the entrance of a place of worship.The façade of the building itself, though, like the atrium, only in
brick, is one of the best designs of its age; the upper loggia, or open
gallery, of five bold but unequal arches, producing more shadow than the
façade at Pisa, without the multitude of small parts there crowded
together, and with far more architectural propriety and grace.As seen
from the atrium, with its two towers, one on either flank, it forms a
composition scarcely surpassed by any other in this style.As now restored, the simplicity and line effect of the vaulted interior
is remarkable, and it is also a museum of ecclesiological antiquities of
the best class.The silver altar of Angilbertus (A.D.835) is unrivalled
either for richness or beauty of design by anything of the kind known to
exist elsewhere, and the _baldacchino_ that surmounts it is also of
singular beauty: so are some of its old tombs, of the earliest Christian
workmanship.Its mosaics, its pulpit, and the bronze doors, not to
mention the brazen serpent—said to be the very one erected by Moses in
the wilderness—and innumerable other relics, make this church one of the
most interesting of Italy, if not indeed of all Europe.Atrium of San Ambrogio, Milan.[297])]

Generally speaking, the most beautiful part of a Lombard church is its
eastern end.The apse with its gallery, the transepts, and above all the
dome that almost invariably surmounts their intersection with the choir,
constitute a group which always has a pleasing effect, and is very often
highly artistic and beautiful.The sides of the nave, too, are often
well designed and appropriate; but, with scarcely a single exception,
the west end, or entrance front, is comparatively mean.The building
seems to be cut off at a certain length without any appropriate finish,
or anything to balance the bold projections towards the east.The French
cathedrals, on the contrary, while they entirely escape this defect by
means of their bold western towers, are generally deficient in the
eastern parts, and almost always lack the central dome or tower.The
English Gothic architects alone understood the proper combination of the
three parts.The Italians, when they introduced a tower, almost always
used it as a detached object, and not as a part of the design of the
church.In consequence of this the façades of their churches are
frequently the least happy parts of the composition, notwithstanding the
pains and amount of ornament lavished upon them.Façade of the Cathedral at Piacenza.(From Chapuy,
‘Moyen-Âge Monumental.’)]

The elevation of the cathedral at Piacenza is a fair illustration of the
general mode of treating the western front of the building, not only in
the 11th and 12th centuries, but afterwards, when a church had a façade
at all—for the Italians seem to have been seldom able to satisfy
themselves with this part of their designs, and a great many of their
most important churches have, in consequence, not even now been
completed in this respect.Instead of recessing their doors, as was the practice on this side of
the Alps, the Italians added projecting porches, often of considerable
depth, and supported by two or more slight columns, generally resting on
the backs of symbolical animals.No part of these porches, as an
architectural arrangement, can be deemed worthy of any commendation;
for, in the first place, a column planted on an animal’s back is an
anomaly and an absurdity, and the extreme tenuity of the pillars, as
compared with the mass they support, is so glaring that even its
universality fails in reconciling the eye to the disproportion.In the
present instance the porch is two storeys in height, the upper being a
niche for sculpture.Its almost exact resemblance to the entrance porch
below is therefore a defect.Above there is generally a gallery,
sometimes only in the centre; sometimes, as in this instance, at the
sides, though often carried quite across; and in the centre above this
there is almost invariably a circular window, the tracery of which is
frequently not only elaborately but beautifully ornamented with foliage
and various sculptural devices.Above this there is generally one of those open galleries mentioned
before, following the <DW72> of the roof, though frequently, as in this
instance, this is replaced by a mere belt of semicircular arches,
suggesting an arcade, but in reality only an ornament.Almost every important city in Lombardy shows local peculiarities in its
style, arising from some distinction of race or tradition.The greater
number of these must necessarily be passed over in a work like the
present, but some are so marked as to demand particular mention.Among
these that of Verona seems the most marked and interesting.This Roman
city became the favourite capital of Theodoric the Goth—Dietrich of
Berne, as the old Germans called him—and was by him adorned with many
noble buildings which have either perished or been overlooked.There is
a passage in the writings of his friend Cassiodorus which has hitherto
been a stumbling-block to commentators, but seems to find an explanation
in the buildings here, and to point to the origin of a mode of
decoration worth remarking upon.In talking of the architecture of his
day he speaks of “the reed-like tenuity of the columns making it appear
as if lofty masses of building were supported on upright spears, which
in regard to substance look like hollow tubes.”[298] It might be
supposed that this referred exclusively to the metal architecture of the
use of which we find traces in the paintings at Pompeii and
elsewhere.[299] But the context hardly bears this out, and he is
probably alluding to a stone or marble architecture, which in the
decline of true art had aspired to a certain extent to imitate the
lightness which the metallic form had rendered a favourite.To return to Verona:—The apse of the cathedral seems to have belonged to
an older edifice than that to which it is now attached, as was often the
case, that being the most solid as well as the most sacred part of the
building.449) it is ornamented with
pilasters, classical in design, but more attenuated than any found
elsewhere; so that I cannot but believe that this is either one of the
identical buildings to which Cassiodorus refers, or at least an early
copy from one of them.(From Hope’s ‘History
of Architecture.’)]

At a far later age, in the 12th century, the beautiful church of San
Zenone shows traces of the same style of decoration (Woodcut No.450),
pilasters being used here almost as slight as those at the cathedral,
but so elegant and so gracefully applied as to form one of the most
beautiful decorations of the style.Once introduced, it was of course
repeated in other buildings, though seldom carried to so great an extent
or employed so gracefully as in this instance.Indeed, whether taken
internally or externally, San Zenone may be regarded as one of the most
pleasing and perfect examples of the style to be found in the North of
Italy.The cathedral at Modena is another good example, though not possessing
any features of much novelty or deserving special mention.That of Parma
is also important, though hardly so pleasing.Indeed, scarcely any city
in the Valley of the Po is without some more or less-perfect churches of
this date, none showing any important peculiarities that have not been
exemplified above, unless perhaps it is the apse of the church of San
Donato on the Murano near Venice, which is decorated with a richness of
marble decoration to which the purer Gothic style never attained, and
which entitles this church to rank rather with the Byzantine than with
the Lombard buildings of which we are treating, or a style so curiously
exceptional as to make it one of the most interesting churches,
historically, to be found in the North of Italy.Façade of San Zenone, Verona.Recent discoveries in Syria[300] have proved almost beyond a doubt that
the carved slabs with which it is adorned externally were borrowed from
some desecrated building on the coast of Syria—destroyed probably by the
Moslems—and brought to Venice, probably at the time when the church
acquired the remains of San Donato, in the beginning of the 12th
century.Whether brought then or at an earlier period, they belong to
the age of Justinian, certainly came from the East, and, mixed up with
Italian details of the period, make up an exterior as picturesque as it
is interesting to the student of the history of art in those days.It is extremely difficult to draw a line between the pointed and
round-arched Gothic styles in Italy.The former was so evidently a
foreign importation, so unwillingly received and so little understood,
that it made its way but slowly.Even, for instance, in the church at
Vercelli, which is usually quoted as the earliest example of the pointed
style in Italy (built 1219-1222), there is not a pointed arch nor a
trace of one on the exterior.All the windows and openings are
round-headed, and, except the pier-arches and vaults, nothing pointed
appears anywhere.Even at a later date than this the round arch,
especially as a decorative form, is frequently placed above the pointed
one, and always used in preference to it.Instead, therefore, of
attempting to draw a line where none exists in reality, it will be
better now to pass on from this part of the subject, and to take up the
older style at a point from which we can best trace the formation of the
new.The latter does not essentially differ from the former, except in
the introduction of the French form of the pointed arch and its
accompaniments.It remains only to say a few words on the peculiarities
which the round form of churches took in the hands of the early Lombard
architects, as well as on the campanile, which forms so striking a
feature in the cities of Northern Italy.On the boundary-line which separates the Guelfic from the Ghibelline
influence, there exist at Toscanella, near Viterbo, two churches of
great beauty of detail; but which, as might almost be predicated from
their situation, defy any attempt at classification.They are not
Gothic, for they have no vaults, nor does their style suggest any
vaulting contrivances.They are scarcely debased Roman, for the tracery
of their circular windows, their many-shafted doors, and generally their
details are such as to indicate a Northern rather than a Roman affinity;
and the Byzantine sculpture which is found in the pulpit was probably
taken from an earlier church—though an Italian Byzantine influence can
be traced in much of its decoration.Under these circumstances, it is
better to treat them as exceptional, than to attempt to give them a name
which might mislead without conveying any correct information.Maria, was erected in the
beginning of the 13th century (1206?), but is so unlike most buildings
of that age, that it is usually ascribed to the 6th or 7th.On a close
examination, however, all its details are found to be full of advanced
Romanesque forms.The pillars are rude Corinthian, with a Lombardic
abacus.They are widely spaced, having no vault to support; and the
mouldings of the arches are what we should call “Transitional Early
English.”

[Illustration: 451.Externally the façade is too plain to be quite pleasing, but this arises
from its depending originally on painting for its decoration—some traces
of which still remain, but the greater part has perished.Its three
doorways are richly and beautifully ornamented with shafts and
sculptured foliage, quite equal in detail to anything of the class to be
found in Italy, and its great circular window would not be thought out
of place at Chartres or Lincoln.Pietro is probably a century later than that of Sta.Maria, and its façade is richer and more elegant—a difference arising
more from those details being in this instance carved which in the
earlier church were painted.The design, however, deserves attention for
its historical, perhaps, even more than its artistic claims; for it was
this class of façade that Palladio and the architects of the
cinque-cento period seized upon, and, applying pilasters and pediments
of classical type, converted it into the fashionable churches which are
to be found in every part of Europe.[301]

[Illustration: 453.Elevation of the Exterior of Sta.The difficulty which the Italians never entirely conquered, was how to
amalgamate the sloping lines of the roofs of the aisles with the
horizontal lines of the rest of the façade.The gallery over the central
doorway enabled them very nearly to accomplish it in these Toscanella
churches, and if the same string-courses had been carried all across,
the whole might have been harmonised; but it was just missed, and, what
is strange, more so in the second than in the first example.In the earliest times of Christian architecture, as we have already
seen, the circular form of church was nearly as frequent as that derived
from the Roman basilica.In process of time the latter was found to be
much better adapted to the extended requirements of Christianity.Hence
in the 11th and 12th centuries, when so many of the early churches were
rebuilt and enlarged, most of the old circular buildings disappeared.Enough, however, remain to enable us to trace, though imperfectly, what
their arrangements were.Among those which have been illustrated, perhaps the most interesting is
that known as the church of San Stefano at Bologna, or rather the
circular centre of that congeries of seven churches usually known by
that name.It is one of those numerous churches of which it is impossible to
predicate whether it was originally a baptismal or a sepulchral edifice.In old times it bore both names, and may have had both destinations, but
latterly, at all events, the question has been settled by the compromise
usually adopted in such cases, of dedicating it to the first martyr, to
whom a sepulchral form of building is especially appropriate.Plan of the Duomo, Brescia.Elevation of Duomo at Brescia.Notwithstanding a considerable amount of ancient remains mixed up in the
details, no part of the present church seems older than the Carlovingian
era; while, on the other hand, its extreme irregularity and clumsiness
of construction point to a period before the 11th century.Its general
form is that of an extremely irregular octagon, about 60 ft.in
diameter, in the centre of which stands a circlet of columns, some
coupled, some single, supporting a semicircular dome.The circumscribing
aisle is covered with the usual intersecting ribbed vault of the 10th
century, but the whole is so rude as scarcely to deserve mention except
for its antiquity.The Duomo Vecchio of Brescia is ascribed to the 8th or 9th century, but
this date according to Cattaneo[302] can only be ascribed to an earlier
basilica church, the crypt of which still exists on the east side of the
Duomo.As will be seen from the plan, it is a large church, 125 ft.across over all, and is covered by a dome 65 ft.in diameter internally
supported by eight piers of plain design.The mode in which light is
introduced into the central compartment illustrates the various
tentative expedients by which the architects in that age attempted to
accomplish their object.First, there is a range of small windows in the
dome below the springing of the dome.In the dome itself there are four
circular sides, and, as if the architect felt that he was doing
something unusual and inartistic, he managed externally to confuse these
with the rudiments of the roof gallery.(From Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)
Scale 50 ft.It is not clear whether originally it had or was intended to have an
apse between its two round towers—where the foundations of some
buildings can still be traced; but these may be the remains of the early
church referred to.Turning from these, we find the round-arched Gothic style completely
developed in the church of San Tomaso in Limine, near Bergamo.From the
annexed plan it will be seen that the circular part is the nave or
entrance, as in Germany and England, in contradistinction to the French
mode of arrangement, where the circular part is always the sanctum, the
rectangular the nave or less holy place.In the centre stand eight pillars, supporting a
vaulted gallery, which forms a triforium or upper storey, and, with the
dome and its little cupola, raise the whole height to about 50 ft.A
small choir with a semicircular niche projects eastward.The dimensions of the building are so small that it hardly deserves
notice, except as a perfect example of the style of the 11th or 12th
century in Lombardy, and for a certain propriety and elegance of design,
in which it is not surpassed, internally at least, by any building of
its age.It is to be regretted that the idea was never carried out (at
any rate no example remains) on such a scale as to enable us to judge of
the effect of such a domical arrangement as is here attempted.The great
defect of all one-storeyed domes is their lowness, both internally and
more especially externally.This method of building a dome in two
storeys would seem calculated to obviate the objection; but though
common in small sepulchral chambers, it has never been tried on a scale
sufficiently large to enable us to judge of its real effect.After this
period the circular shape was so completely superseded by the
rectangular, that no further improvement took place in it.There is perhaps no question of early Christian archæology involved in
so much obscurity as that of the introduction and early use of towers.The great monumental pillars of the Romans—as, for instance, those of
Trajan and Antoninus—were practically towers; and latterly their tombs
began to assume an aspiring character like that at St.231), or those at Palmyra and elsewhere in the East, which show a marked
tendency in that direction.But none of these can be looked upon as an
undoubted prototype of the towers attached to the churches of the
Christians.At Ravenna, as early as the age of Justinian, we find a circular tower
attached to St.Apollinare in Classe (Woodcut No.412), and in the other
churches of that place they seem even then to have been considered
necessary adjuncts.[303] At the same time it is by no means clear that
they were erected as bell-towers; indeed the evidence is tolerably clear
that bells were not used in Christian churches till the time of Pope
Adrian I., some two centuries later.There is, I
think, no trace of their being sepulchral monuments, or that they were
designed or used as tombs; and unless they were, like the _sthambas_ of
the Buddhists, pillars of victory, or towers erected to mark sacred or
remarkable spots, it is difficult to say what they were, or where we are
to look for an analogy.Be this as it may, the oldest circular towers with which we are
acquainted are those of Ravenna; while the last of the series is the
famous leaning one at Pisa, commenced in the year 1174.The gradations
between these two extremes must have been the same that marked the
changes in the architecture of the churches to which they are attached;
but the links are more completely wanting in the case of the towers than
in that of the churches.[304]

[Illustration: 459.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)]Apollinare in Classe, above referred to, the most
perfect of those of Ravenna, is a simple brick tower (see Woodcut No.412), nine storeys in height, the lower windows being narrow single
openings; above there are two, and the three upper storeys are adorned
with four windows of three lights each.In Rome, as far as we know, the first tower attached to a church was
that said to have been built by Pope Adrian I. in front of the atrium of
St.Peter’s; but there are no examples now existing in Rome which can be
said to be earlier than the 11th century, and that date applies only to
the lower portion of them.In the 12th and 13th centuries they became
common, and we find them attached to the churches of S. Lorenzo without
the walls, S. Croce in Gerusalemme, SS.Giovanni e Paolo, S. Giorgio in
Velabro (13th century), and others.All these are square in plan and
extremely similar in design, no improvement and scarcely any change
having taken place between the first and the last, as if the form were
an old and established one when we find it first adopted.Maria in Cosmedin (Woodcut No.459) is perhaps one of the best
and most complete.Its dimensions are small, its breadth being little
more than 15 ft., and its height only 110; but notwithstanding this
there is great dignity in the design, and, in a city where buildings are
not generally tall, its height is sufficient to give it prominence
without overpowering other objects,—a characteristic which renders these
Roman towers not only beautiful structures in themselves, but
appropriate ornaments to the buildings to which they are attached.The chief interest of these towers is derived from the numerous progeny
to which they gave birth: for though there is scarcely an instance of a
square Romanesque tower beyond the walls of Rome during the period in
which this style flourished, the form was seized upon with avidity by
the Gothic architects in all the countries of Europe; and whether as a
detached campanile (as in Italy), or as an integral part of the building
(as we soon find it employed on this side of the Alps), it forms the
most prominent, and perhaps also the most beautiful, feature in the
aspiring architecture of the Middle Ages.There is certainly no architectural feature which the Gothic architects
can so justly call their own as the towers and spires which in the
Middle Ages were so favourite, so indispensable a part of their churches
and other edifices, becoming in fact as necessary parts of the external
design as the vaults were of the internal decoration of the building.It is true, as before remarked, that we neither know where they were
first invented, nor even where they were first applied to Christian
churches—those of Rome and Ravenna being evidently not the earliest
examples; nor have they any features which betray their origin—at least
none have yet been pointed out, though it is not impossible that a
closer examination would bring some such to light.They certainly are as
little classical, in form or details, as anything that can well be
conceived; and belong to an undefined Romanesque style.Those of which we have already spoken are all church-towers—_campaniles_
or bell-towers attached to churches.But this exclusive distinction by
no means applies to the Gothic towers.Mark at Venice,
for instance, and the Toraccio at Cremona, are evidently civic
monuments, like the belfries of the Low Countries—symbols of communal
power wholly distinct from the church, their proximity to which seems
only to arise from the fact of all the principal buildings being grouped
together.This is certainly the case with a large class of very ugly
buildings in Italy, such as those attached to the town-halls of Florence
and Siena, or the famous Asinelli and Garisenda towers at Bologna.They
are merely tall square brick towers, with a machicolated balcony at the
top, but possessing no more architectural design than the chimney of a
cotton factory.Originally, when lower, they may have been towers of
defence, but afterwards became mere symbols of power.A third class, and by far the most numerous, of these buildings are
undoubtedly ecclesiastical erections; they are either actually attached
to the churches, or so placed with regard to them as to leave no doubt
on the matter.There is not, however, I believe, in all Italy a single
example of a tower or towers forming, as on this side of the Alps, an
integral part of the design.Sometimes they stand detached, but more generally are connected with
some angle of the building, the favourite position being the western
angle of the southern transept.Occasionally we find one tower placed at
the angle of the façade, but this is seldom the case when the tower and
the church are of the same age.It is so in the cathedral at Lucca, and
San Ambrogio at Milan; in the latter of which a second tower has been
added more recently to balance the older one.It does also happen as in
the instance of Novara, before quoted (Woodcut No.443), that two towers
are actually parts of the original design; this, however, is certainly
the exception, not the rule.In design the Italian campaniles differ very considerably from those on
this side of the Alps.They never have projecting buttresses, nor assume
that pyramidal form which is so essential and so beautiful a feature in
the Northern examples.In plan the campanile is always square, and
carried up without break or offset to two-thirds at least of its
intended height.This, which is virtually the whole design (for the
spire seems an idea borrowed from the North), is generally solid to a
considerable height, or with only such openings as serve to admit light
to the stairs or inclined planes.Above the solid part one round-headed
window is introduced in each face, and in the next storey two; in the
one above this three, then four, and lastly five, the lights being
merely separated by slight shafts, so that the upper storey is virtually
an open loggia (see Woodcut No.There is no doubt great beauty and
propriety of design in this arrangement; in point of taste it is
unobjectionable, but it wants the vigour and variety of the Northern
tower.So far as we can judge from drawings and such ancient examples as
remain, the original termination was a simple cone in the centre, with a
smaller one at each of the angles.At Verona an octagonal lantern is added, and at Modena and Cremona the
octagon is crowned by a lofty spire, but these hardly come within the
limits of the epoch of which we are now treating.So greatly did the
Italians prefer the round arch, that even in their imitation of the
Northern styles they used the pointed shape only when compelled—a
circumstance which makes it extremely difficult, particularly in the
towers, to draw the line between the two styles; for though pointed
arches were no doubt introduced in the 13th and 14th centuries, the
circular-headed shape continued to be employed from the age of the
Romanesque to that of the Renaissance.One of the oldest and certainly the most celebrated of the Gothic towers
of Italy, is that of St.Mark’s at Venice, commenced in the year 902; it
took the infant republic three centuries to raise it 180 ft., to the
point at which the square basement terminates.On this there must
originally have been an open loggia of some sort, no doubt with a
conical roof.The present superstructure was added in the 16th century;
but though the loggia is a very pleasing feature, it is overpowered by
the solid mass that it surmounts, and by the extremely ugly square
extinguisher that crowns the whole.Its locality and its associations
have earned for it a great deal of undue laudation, but in point of
design no campanile in Italy deserves it less.The base is a mere
unornamented mass of brickwork, slightly fluted, and pierced
unsymmetrically with small windows to light the inclined plane within.Its size, its height, and its apparent solidity are its only merits.These are no doubt important elements in that low class of architectural
excellence of which the Egyptian pyramids are the type; but even in
these elements this edifice must confess itself a pigmy, and inferior to
even a second-class pyramid on the banks of the Nile, while it has none
of the beauty of design and detail displayed by the Giralda of Seville,
or even by other Italian towers in its own neighbourhood.The campanile at Piacenza (Woodcut No.448) is, perhaps, more like the
original of St.Mark’s than any other, and certainly displays as little
beauty as any building of this sort can possess.That of San Zenone at Verona is far more pleasing.It is, indeed, as
beautiful both in proportion and details as any of its age, while it
exemplifies at once the beauties and the defects of the style.Among the
first is an elegant simplicity that always is pleasing, but this is
accompanied by a leanness and poverty of effect, when compared with
Northern examples, which must rank in the latter category.Jackson, in his work on Dalmatia and Istria, gives illustrations of
several towers in those countries which, in beauty of design, excel many
of the Italian examples.The Romanesque style would seem to have had a
much longer duration on the east side of the Adriatic than in Italy.Thus the tower of Spalato, a lofty campanile of six storeys in height,
commenced in the beginning of the 13th century and not terminated till
1416 (except the upper octagon and spire), is virtually in the same pure
Romanesque style throughout.Jackson notes also the continued
influence of Roman work of the 3rd century, by which it is surrounded,
and that fragments of ancient material, columns and capitals, have been
used up in its construction.The campaniles of Zara and in the island of
Arbe are both fine examples of Romanesque design.CHAPTER V.

It would be easier to define the limits and character of the styles of
Italian Mediæval Architecture in the centre and south of Italy by a
negative than a positive title.To call them the “non-Gothic” styles
would describe them correctly, but would hardly suffice to convey a
distinct idea of their peculiarities.Romanesque, or even Italian
Romanesque, would not be sufficient, because that term fails to take
cognizance of the foreign element found in them.That element is the
Byzantine, derived partly from the continued relations which such cities
as Venice or Pisa maintained during the Middle Ages with the Levant, and
partly from the intercourse which the inhabitants of Magna Gracia kept
up across the Adriatic with the people on its eastern shores.To such a
mixture of styles the term Byzantine-Romanesque would be quite
appropriate; and although there are in Apulia churches, such as Molfetta
and St.Angelo, which look more like Levantine designs than anything to
be found in other parts of Europe (except perhaps such buildings as St.Front, Périgueux, and one or two exceptional buildings in the South of
France), and in a very detailed description of Italian styles it might
be expedient to attempt a further subdivision with other specific terms,
for the present it will probably suffice to describe the various
non-Gothic styles of the centre and southern half of Italy in local
sections without attempting any very minute classification of their
variations.As the Italians had no great national style of their own,
and both in the North and South were principally working under foreign
influences, it is in vain to look for any thread that will conduct the
student straight through the labyrinth of their styles.Italian unity is
the aspiration of the present century; during the Middle Ages it did not
exist either in politics or art.The Old and New Cathedrals at Naples.Although Naples is in the very centre of its province, where we
naturally first look for examples of the style, there are few cities in
Italy which contain so little to interest the architect or the
antiquary.Still she does possess one group of churches, which, by their
juxtaposition, at least serve to illustrate the progress of the style
during the Middle Ages.Restituta—shaded
dark in the plan (Woodcut No.460)—may be as old as the 4th or 5th
century, and retains its original plan and arrangement, though much
disfigured in details.The baptistery, a little behind the apse on its
left, is certainly of the date indicated, and retains its mosaics, which
seem to be of the same age.of Anjou commenced the new cathedral at
right angles with the old, his French prejudices being apparently
shocked at the incorrect orientation of the older church.It is a
spacious building, 300 ft.long, arranged, as Italian churches usually
were at that age, with a wooden roof over the nave and intersecting
vaults over the side-aisles.Opposite the entrance of the old cathedral
is a domical chapel of Renaissance design, so that the group contains an
illustration of each of the three ages of Italian art.Section of San Miniato, near Florence.The church of San Miniato (Woodcuts Nos.461-463), on a hill overlooking
Florence, is one of the earliest (1013), as well as one of the most
perfect, of the Byzantine-Romanesque style.in length by 70 in width, divided longitudinally into aisles, and
transversely into three nearly square compartments by clustered piers
supporting two great arches which run up to the roof.The whole of the
eastern compartment is occupied by a crypt or under-church open to the
nave, above which are the choir and apse, approached by flights of steps
in the aisles.The entire arrangement, together with the division of the
nave into three compartments, is most satisfactory, and the proportions
of the whole are very appropriate.The pillars themselves are so nearly
classical in design that they almost seem to have been taken from some
ancient building, and the architraves and stringcourses are all well
designed and fitted to the places they occupy.The principal ornament of
the interior is an inlaid pattern of simple design, sufficient to
relieve the monotony of the interior, but without producing any
confusion.The exterior depends principally, like the interior, for its
effect on  panelling, but has a range of blind arches running
round the sides and across the front.The façade, however, is very badly
designed: either it was one of the earliest examples, and the architects
had not learned how to combine the sloping roofs of the aisles with the
upper part of the façades, or it has been altered in more modern times;
but for this slight defect it would be difficult to find a church in
Italy containing more of classic elegance, with perfect appropriateness
for the purposes of Christian worship.There must have been several, probably many, buildings in the same style
erected in Tuscany during the first half of the 11th century.Otherwise
it is almost impossible to understand how so complete a design as that
of Pisa Cathedral could have been executed.It was commenced apparently
in 1006, but it was not till 1063, after the plundering of Palermo,
according to Reber,[305] that the means were provided for the
extraordinary richness of the design, the magnificence of which had at
that time no parallel among the ecclesiastical edifices of Italy; the
work was suspended in 1095, and could only be resumed by means of
pecuniary aid given to the undertaking by the Byzantine emperor.After
the consecration of the cathedral in 1103, the interior decorations were
carried on until the 15th century.Internally its design is evidently
based on that of the basilicas of Rome and Ravenna, except that instead
of the range at the latter place of figures in mosaic, it has a splendid
triforium gallery and in plan strongly marked projecting transepts.Its
great merit, however, as a design arises from the fact that the builders
had learned to proportion the parts to one another so as to get greater
magnificence with very much smaller dimensions.The size, for instance,
of the nave of San Paolo fuori le Mure at Rome is 290 ft.by 215; these
dimensions are nearly double those at Pisa, where they are 173 ft.Yet, in consequence of the greater relative height of the nave and
the better spacing of the pillars and proportion of the parts, the
interior of Pisa is more pleasing and more impressive than the Roman
church.Its effect, too, is immensely increased by the truly Mediæval
projection of the transepts.In no church in Italy is there such poetry
of perspective as in looking anglewise across the intersection, and
seldom anywhere a more satisfactory interior than that of this church.(From Chapuy’s
‘Moyen-Age Monumental.’)]

The exterior, too, is almost equally pleasing.The side-aisles are
adorned with a range of blind arches running all round, adorned with
parti- marble, inlaid either in courses or in patterns.Above
this is a gallery, representing the triforium, carried all round, and in
the façades formed into an open gallery; a second open gallery
represents the sloping roof of the aisles, a third the clerestory, a
fourth the <DW72>s of the great roof.The difficulty here, as in almost
all Italian designs, is caused by the sloping roofs; but, with this
exception, the whole makes up a rich and varied composition without any
glaring false construction, and expresses with sufficient clearness the
arrangements of the interior.The dome is of later design, and, being
oval in plan, cannot be said to be pleasing in outline.The Italians were evidently delighted with their new style.It was
repeated with very little variation at Lucca, in the church of San
Michele (1188), only that the arcades stood free on the sides as well as
on the front.The façade of San Martino, in the same city, is in the
same style; so is that of the cathedral at Pistoja, and so is Sta.The arrangement was probably suggested by the porticoes of
Pagan temples; and were it not for the awkwardness caused by the sloping
line of the roofs, it might be characterised as one of the most
successful inventions of the age.In some instances, as in the façade of the Cathedral at Zara in Dalmatia
(Woodcut No.Jackson[306] was not begun
before the 13th century, the consecration taking place in 1285, the
difficulties of the design of the façade are to a great extent conquered
by reducing the arcades to mere decorative panelling, and more than this
by separating the design of the centre from that of the aisles by a bold
square pilaster.This is exactly the feature we miss at Pisa and Lucca,
where the want of it imparts a considerable degree of weakness to the
whole design.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia and Montenegro.’)]

The plan of the Zara Cathedral (Woodcut No.466) is that usually adopted
in churches of this class; but it possesses a lady chapel and
baptistery, placed laterally in a somewhat unusual manner.Its
dimensions are small, being only 170 ft.The east end of this church, its doorways and windows, show, as might be
expected from its locality, a greater tendency towards Romanesque art
than can be found on the western shores of the Peninsula, but in
internal arrangements it belongs wholly to the Italian style.The cathedral at Trau, also in Dalmatia, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s
work, is a fine example, which is not only built in one consistent style
throughout, but possesses the still rarer advantage of being completed
outside as well as inside, “instead,” as Mr.Jackson observes, “of
presenting, like so many Italian churches, a rough face of unfinished
brickwork or masonry awaiting in vain the splendid veneer of marble or
sculpture that never comes.” The main part of the church was built in
the first half of the 13th century.The floor is of the basilica type,
with nave (five bays, vaulted) and aisles, centre and side apses, and a
magnificent narthex, the full width of nave and aisles, with a sumptuous
portal of pure Romanesque design (1240), which is perhaps finer than any
example in Italy, and is only rivalled in its decorative sculpture by
those of the French portals.Jackson is of opinion that Dalmatian
art took a great departure under Hungarian rule, and followed more in
the direction of the purer Romanesque style than in that of the
Byzantine.The artists were foreigners, invited not only from Germany
but also from France.Villars d’Honecourt recounts his having been sent
for, and “French influence,” Mr.Jackson states, “may be detected in
some other churches in Hungary.” The portal of the church at Jak, in
Hungary, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work, is French in character, with
a profusion of orders carved with the zigzag fret and dentil very
similar to the later Norman work, and includes capitals “à crochet” such
as belong to French 12th-century work.The series of trefoil-headed
niches, with figures in them which rise above the doorway, are French in
character, and remind one of the façade of St.Père-sous-Vezelay.At
Cattaro, in Dalmatia, and at Veglia, in one of the islands of the
Quarnero, are other examples of fine Romanesque work of the 12th
century.Further south on the mainland of Italy, at Troja, we find a singularly
elegant cathedral church (1093-1115?)Its flanks and apse are perhaps even more elegant than anything in
the neighbourhood of Pisa.So is the lower part of its façade, which is
adorned with a richness and elegance of foliage characteristic of the
province where it is found; and the cornice that crowns the lower storey
is perhaps unmatched by any similar example to be found in Italy, either
for beauty of sculptural decoration or for appropriateness of profile.The upper part of the façade differs, however, considerably from that of
the examples just quoted.A great rose-window, of elegant but
ill-understood tracery, takes the place of the arcades, and, with the
sculptured arch over it, completes all that remains of the original
design.The plain pieces of walling that support the central window are
parts of a modern repair.As a general rule, all the churches in the South of Italy are small.This one at Troja is arranged in plan like that at Pisa, with bold
projecting transepts, but its length is only 167 ft., and the width of
its nave 50, while in the Northern cathedral these dimensions are nearly
double—310 ft.by 106—and the area four times as great.This is true of
all, however elegant they may be—they are parish churches in dimensions
as compared with their Northern rivals.Many also, as the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.469), have their apses
internal, which detracts very much from the meaning of the design, and
does away with the apsidal terminations, which are perhaps the most
beautiful features in the external design of Italian churches; while
they lack the great traceried windows which go so far to replace the
absence of the apse in English design.The annexed elevation of the east
end at Bari (Woodcut No.470) gives a fair idea of the general
arrangement of that part in the churches in Apulia.It is novel, and the
two tall towers with a central dome combine with elegant details to make
up a whole which it is impossible not to admire though it will not bear
comparison with the more artistic arrangements of Northern architects.Where the apse[308] is allowed to be seen externally, it is sometimes,
as at San Pellino (Woodcut No.471), an object of great beauty and
originality, but such examples are rare in the province, and the designs
suffer in proportion.(From a Sketch by
A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]In the richer churches, as at Pisa, a blind arcade is carried round the
flanks, sometimes with an open gallery under the eaves, as in German
churches, but this was far from being universally the case; on the
contrary, it would be difficult, as a typical example of the style, to
select one more characteristic than the flank of the church of Caserta
Vecchia (1100-1153) (Woodcut No.The windows are small but
numerous, and mark the number of bays in the interior.The transept is
slightly projected, and ornamented with an arcade at the top, and above
this rises a dome such as is found only in Calabria or Sicily.The tower
was added afterwards, and, though unsymmetrical, assists in relieving a
design which would otherwise run the risk of being monotonous.West Front of the Church of San Nicolo in Bari.(From a Sketch by A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]It was, however, on their entrance façades that the architects of
Southern Italy lavished their utmost care.The central doorways are
usually covered with rich hoods, supported by pillars resting on
monsters somewhat like those found in the North of Italy.Above this is
either a gallery or one or two windows, and the whole generally
terminates in a circular rose-window filled with tracery.As exemplified
in the front of Bittonto Cathedral (Woodcut No.473), such a composition
is not deficient in richness, though hardly pleasing as an architectural
composition.The same arrangement, on about the same scale, occurs at Bari, Altamura,
and Ruvo; and on a somewhat smaller scale in the churches of Galatina,
Brindisi, and Barletta.The great and peculiar beauty of the cathedral
at Bittonto is its south front, one angle of which is shown in the
woodcut; but which becomes richer towards the east, where it is adorned
with a portal of great magnificence and beauty.The richness of its open
gallery (under what was the roof of the side-aisles) is unsurpassed in
Apulia, and probably by anything of the same kind in Italy.View of the Interior of San Nicolo, Bari.The façade of San Nicolo at Bari (1197) is something like the last
mentioned, except that handsome Corinthian columns have been borrowed
from some older building, and add to the richness of the design, though
they hardly can be said to belong to the composition.Internally this
church seems to have displayed some such arrangement as that of San
Miniato (Woodcuts No.Instead, however, of improving upon it,
as might be expected from the time that had elapsed since the previous
one was erected, the Southern architect hardly knew the meaning of what
he was attempting.He grouped together the three pillars next to the
entrance, and threw arches across the nave from them, but these arches
neither support the roof nor aid the construction in any other way.They
do add to the perspective effect of the interior, but it is only by a
theatrical contrivance very rare in the Middle Ages, and by no means to
be admired when found.Most of these Apulian churches possess crypts almost as important as
that of San Miniato, some more so; and the numerous pillars in some of
these give rise to effects of perspective only to be found elsewhere in
such buildings as the Mosque at Cordova, or the cisterns at
Constantinople.As in the annexed example, from the cathedral at
Otranto, it is wonderful what space and what variety may be attained
with small dimensions by the employment of numerous points of support.This was the secret of most of the best effects produced by the Northern
architects; but the Italians never understood it, or practised it,
except in crypts.Perhaps it may have been that they thought it
necessary to sacrifice architectural effect to the exigencies of public
worship.Whether this were the cause or not, the result, as already
pointed out, was fatal to the architectural effect of many of their
designs, especially in the Northern province.In Southern Italy this is seldom the case, but the difference arose from
the fact that the naves of the churches had never vaulted roofs, and
were consequently separated from the aisles by single pillars instead of
composite piers.This took away all temptation to display mechanical
dexterity, and left the architect free to produce the best artistic
effect he was able to design with the materials at his command.Window in the South Side of the Cathedral Church at
Matera.No one who takes the pains to familiarise himself with the architecture
of these Southern Italian churches, can well fail to be impressed with
their beauty.That beauty will be found, however, to arise not so much
from the dimensions or arrangement of their plans, or the form of their
outline, as from the grace and elegance of their details.Every feature
displays the feeling of an elegant and refined people, who demanded
decoration as a necessity, though they were incapable of rising to any
great architectural conception.They excelled as ornamentists, though at
best only indifferent architects.It is impossible to render this evident in such a work as the present;
but besides the examples already given, a window (Woodcut No.478) from
the cathedral church at Matera (1270) will explain how unlike the style
of decoration is to anything with which we are familiar in the North,
and at the same time how much picturesque effect may be produced by a
repetition of similar details.The church itself has this peculiarity,
that its west front is plain and unimportant, and that all the
decoration is lavished on the south side, which faces the piazza.There
are two entrances on this face, that towards the east being, as usual,
the richer.Above these is a range of richly-ornamented windows, one of
which—a little out of the centre—is far more splendid than the rest
(Woodcut No.From this it is said that letters and rescripts from
the Greek patriarch at Constantinople used to be read, and it is perhaps
as elaborate a specimen of the mode of decoration used in these churches
as can be found in the province.Doorway of Church of Pappacoda, Naples.Daniel journeyed to the hallway.The same exuberance of decoration continued to be employed down to the
latest period of the art, and after Northern forms had been introduced
by the Angiovine dynasty at Naples.The doorway from the church at
Pappacoda (Woodcut No.479) is a type of many to be found in that city
and elsewhere in the architectural province.True, it is overdone to
such an extent that much of the labour bestowed upon it must be
considered as thrown away; but if a love of art induced people to labour
so lovingly in it, it is hard to refuse them the admiration which their
enthusiasm deserves.Another class of ornamental detail in which this province is especially
rich is that of bronze doors, of which some six or seven examples still
remain.Of these perhaps the finest are those of the cathedral at Trani.They were made in 1160, and for beauty of design, and for the exuberance
and elegance of their ornaments, are unsurpassed by anything of the kind
in Italy, or probably in the world.Another pair of doors of almost
equal beauty, made in 1119, belongs to the cathedral at Troja (Woodcut
No.468), and a third, which is still in a very perfect state,
constructed at Constantinople, in the year 1076, for the church of Mont
San Angelo; and is consequently contemporary with the doors of Sta.Sophia, Novogorod, and San Zenone, Verona, and so similar in design as
to form an interesting series for comparison.Other churches in the same style as those mentioned above are found at
Canosa, Giovenazzo, Molo, Ostuni, Manduria, and other places in the
province.Those of Brindisi, from which we should expect most, have been
too much modernised to be of value as examples; but there is in the town
a small circular church of great beauty, built apparently by the Knights
Templars, and afterwards possessed by the Knights of St.It is now
in ruins, but many of the frescoes which once adorned its walls still
remain, as well as the marble pillars that supported its roof.Being at
some distance from the harbour, the Knights of St.John built another
small church near the port, which still remains nearly unaltered.Although throughout the Middle Ages Rome went on building large
churches, it was in the debased-Roman style already referred to, fitting
together Roman pillars with classical details of more or less purity,
but hardly, except in their cloisters, deserving the name of a style.Perhaps the most original, as it certainly is one of the most beautiful,
things the Romans did, is the cloister of St.There the
little arcades, supported by twisted columns, and adorned with mosaics,
are as graceful and pleasing as anything of that class found elsewhere;
and as they are encased in a framework of sufficient strength to take
off all appearance of mechanical weakness, their unconstructive forms
are not unpleasing.The entablature, which is the ruling feature in the
design, retains the classical arrangement in almost every detail, and in
such purity as could only be found in Rome in the 13th century, when
this cloister appears to have been erected; but the style never extended
beyond the limits of that city, and thus has little bearing on the
thread of our narrative.The cloister of the Benedictine monastery adjoining the basilica of St.Paul’s outside the walls, is another example of the same kind in which
the columns present almost every variety of form; spiral, twisted,
fluted, and sometimes two or three of these combined, many of them, as
well as the entablature, being covered with mosaics.As already remarked, the architects of the southern half of the Italian
peninsula were generally content to adopt the Romanesque plan of
covering their naves with a wooden roof—for when an intersecting vault
is found it is clearly a French or German interpolation—but they often
employed one dome, generally over the altar, and used it as an ornament
both external and internal.The two illustrations already given of the
domes at Bari (Woodcut No.470) and Caserta Vecchia (Woodcut No.472)
show the form these usually took in the province.They belong to a type
not unusual in the East, but unknown to the Gothic architects of Europe.When called upon to roof their churches with stone, they almost
invariably adopted the domical in preference to the vaulted form, as at
Molfetta (1162), where they make a pleasing form of roof, not unlike
that of Loches Cathedral (Woodcut No.The great defect of domes
when thus employed is their height, which generally throws the whole of
the building out of proportion; and unless light is introduced through
openings in the drum, or in the dome itself, they are dark and gloomy.This is certainly the case at Molfetta, but otherwise the church seems
well designed and of pleasing proportions.To be successful, domes
should be low and flat internally; and any height required externally
must be given by a false dome, as at St.Mark’s, or as done by the
Renaissance architects generally.This was not so much felt when the building was square, and covered by
only one dome, like the baptistery or tomb of Mont St.Angelo, where
effect of space on the floor was not aimed at so much as a combination
of external dignity with limited dimensions in plan, and was attained by
the arrangement adopted.As will be observed, the pointed arch, as in
the tower at Gaeta (Woodcut No.489), is used in the basement, but above
this round arches with balusters for pillars, such as we should call
Saxon, though their age here may be the 12th century.Among the little bits of Orientalism that crop up here and there all
over the province, one of the most pleasing is the little tomb of
Bohemund at Canosa (1111).It is charming to find in Italy an Eastern
Kibleh with its dome, erected to contain the remains of a Christian
king.Though elegant, however, the dome is not fitted to the square, as
it would have been in more experienced hands, and the whole design is
somewhat badly put together.Its bronze doors are among its chiefest
ornaments, and are elegant, though inferior to numerous examples of the
same class in the churches of the province.Many other examples of Byzantine domical forms might be quoted as
existing in Southern Italy.It is not, however, so much in the forms as
in the details that the Eastern influence is felt, and that no less in
the churches which retain the basilican form of Ravenna than in those
which assume the domical form of Constantinople.The buildings of the Southern Province cannot certainly compete with
those of the Northern either in size or in daring mechanical
construction, but in detail they are frequently more beautiful, while
their forms are more national and less constrained.Their great
interest, however, in the eyes of the student, consists in their forming
a link between the Eastern and Western worlds, and thus joining together
two styles which we have hitherto been too much in the habit of
considering as possessing no point of contact.One of the best known, as well as one of the largest examples of this
class of buildings in Italy, is the baptistery at Pisa (seen partially
on the left side of Woodcut No.Internally it is, as nearly as may
be, 100 ft.in diameter, and the walls are about 8 ft.The dome itself, however, is only 60 ft.in diameter, and is
supported on four piers and eight pillars.These serve to separate the
central space from the aisle which runs round it, and which is two
storeys in height, but singularly ill-proportioned and clumsy in detail.The worst part of the design, however, is the dome, if dome it can be
called.Internally it is conical in form, and thrust through an external
hemispherical dome in a manner more clumsy and unpleasing than any other
example of its class.Externally, these defects are to some extent
atoned for by considerable richness and beauty of detail.It had
originally only one range of blind arcades, with three-quarter columns,
surmounted by an open arcade; an arrangement exactly similar to that of
the two lower storeys of the cathedral and the leaning tower (Woodcut
No.A considerable amount of pointed Gothic decoration was
afterwards added, which, though somewhat incongruous, is elegant in
itself, and hides to some extent the original defects of the design.But
the outline of the building and its whole arrangements are so radically
bad, that no amount of ornament can ever redeem them.Taken altogether, the Pisan baptistery is so very peculiar, that it
would be interesting if its design could be traced back to some
undoubted original.That this is possible will hardly be doubted by any
one at all familiar with the subject; meanwhile, the building most like
it that has been illustrated is the little church of San Donato, at
Zara.at the beginning of the 9th century, with materials taken
from ancient buildings, some of them of the best period of Roman
architecture.The two monolithic columns in front of the triple
sanctuary, and which are 30 ft.in height, bear testimony to the size
and importance of the temple they originally adorned, and the great
thickness of the walls and the size of the piers suggest a wealth of
material at the disposal of the builders.The rectangular building on
the south side Mr.Jackson considers to be coeval with the church; and
the chamber over it, which was on the same level and originally opened
on to the gallery round the aisles, formed a second church intended for
the use of the catechumens.The church is so built round that it is
impossible to say what its external appearance may have been.Both from
its resemblance to the Pisan baptistery and its own merits, it is an
interesting addition to our knowledge of those circular churches which
were such favourites with all the Christian architects in the
Carlovingian period.The resemblance in this instance is the more
remarkable, because the façade of the cathedral at Zara (Woodcut No.467) is in the Pisan style, only slightly modified by local
peculiarities.From what we already know, it seems undoubted that there
was a close connection—architecturally, at least—between Pisa and Zara.If this were fully investigated, it would probably throw considerable
light on the origin of the Pisan style, which has hitherto seemed so
exceptional in Italy, and also explain how the Byzantine element came to
be so strongly developed in what at first sight appears to be a
Romanesque style of art.Ground and Upper Storey of San Donato, Zara.The typical example of a tower in the Italian style is the celebrated
leaning tower at Pisa, partly seen in Woodcut No.It is, indeed, so
far as we at present know, the only one which carries out that
arrangement of numerous tiers of superimposed arcades which is so
characteristic of the style.The lower storey is well designed as a
solid basement for the superincumbent mass; its walls are 13 ft.in
thickness, and it is adorned with 15 three-quarter columns: its height
being 35 ft.The six storeys above this average 20 ft.in height, and
are each adorned with an open arcade.The whole is crowned by a smaller
circular tower, 27 ft.in height, in which the bells are hung.The
entire height is thus 182 ft.; the mean diameter of the main portion,
52.There is no doubt that it was originally intended to stand
perpendicular, though the contrary has been asserted; but before the
commencement of the fifth storey the foundations had given way, and the
attempts to readjust the work are plainly traceable in the upper
storeys, though without success.out of the
perpendicular,[309] which, though not sufficient to endanger its
stability, is enough to render it very unsightly.Even without this
defect, however, its design can hardly be commended; an arrangement of
six equal arcades, with horizontal entablatures, is not an expedient
mode of adorning a building, where elevation is the element of success.The introduction of strongly-marked vertical lines, or some variation in
the design of the arcades, would have greatly improved the design: and
so the Italians seem to have thought, for it was never repeated, and the
Pisan tower remains a solitary example of its class.Nothing at all resembling it occurs in the southern parts of the
province, though it must be admitted that they contain very few really
important towers of any sort.Perhaps the earthquakes to which a great portion of the country is
liable may have deterred the architects from indulging in structures of
great altitude; but it must be added that the idea of belfry or tower
did not enter into their municipal arrangements, and their towns are not
consequently illustrated by such towers as those of Venice, Cremona, or
Verona in the north.Of those which do exist that of Gaeta is perhaps as
picturesque as any.It was erected 1276-1290, and is both characteristic
of the style and elegant in outline.As will be observed, the lower
storey has pointed arches, while those above are all round; an
arrangement which, though to our eyes it may appear archæologically
wrong, is certainly constructively right, and the effect is very
pleasing, from the height and dignity given to the entrance.The two towers of the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.470) are not so
happy in design as this.They are too tall for their other dimensions,
and want accentuation throughout; while the change from the lower to the
upper storey is abrupt and ill-contrived.The tower at Caserta Vecchia
(Woodcut No.472) is low and squat in its proportions, and unfortunately
too typical of the towers in this land of earthquakes.As a rule, it may be asserted that the southern province of Italy is
singularly deficient in examples of civil or domestic architecture.Great monastic establishments existed there during the Middle Ages which
must have possessed buildings befitting their magnificence; but these
have either perished and been rebuilt, or have been so restored that
their original forms can hardly be recognised.There are, indeed,
cloisters at Amalfi and Sorrento; much more remarkable, however, for the
beauty of their situation than for their architecture, which is
extremely rude and clumsy.There are no chapter-houses: no halls or
conventual buildings of any sort.In this respect, the province forms a
remarkable contrast with Spain in the same age; though it must be
confessed that the North of Italy is also very deficient in conventual
buildings of the Middle Ages, the most magnificent and beautiful
belonging more to the Renaissance than to the Mediæval period.At Ravello there is the Casa Ruffolo, a picturesque palace of the 13th
century, still nearly entire: a strange mixture of Gothic and Saracenic
taste, but so exceptional, that it would not be fair to quote it as a
type of any style.It seems to owe its peculiarities more to the taste
of some individual patron or architect rather than to any national taste
or form of design.There are, however, several Hohenstauffen castles of tolerable
preservation, more or less typical of the domestic arts of the day in
which they were erected.One of the best preserved of these is that of
Castel del Monte, erected by Frederick II., 1240-44.It is an octagon in
plan, with octagonal turrets at each angle.across
its extreme breadth, and surrounds a courtyard 57 ft.Both
storeys are vaulted, and all the details throughout are good and
pleasing.The whole is an admixture of Italian taste, superimposed on a
German design; but it will be observed how little removed the
architectural details of the entrance are, even at that early age, from
the style of the Renaissance.This is, indeed, the great characteristic
of the architectural objects in Southern Italy.Though they adopted
Christian forms, they never abandoned the classical feeling in details;
and it is this which mainly renders them worthy of study.Whether
considered in regard to dimensions, outline, or constructive
peculiarities, their churches will not bear a moment’s comparison with
those of the North; but in elegance of detail they often surpass purely
Gothic buildings to such a degree as to become to some extent as worthy
of study as their more ambitious rivals.Part Section, part Elevation, of Castel del Monte.POINTED ITALIAN GOTHIC.Fresco paintings—Churches at Vercelli, Asti, Verona, and Lucca—Cathedral

Before the commencement of the 13th century, the Italians had acquired
such mastery over the details of their round-arched style, and had
worked it into such originality and completeness, that it is surprising
that they should so easily have abandoned it for that form of Pointed
Gothic which they afterwards adopted.It is true the Italians never rose
to the conception of such buildings as the great Rhenish cathedrals,
like those of Spires and Worms, or the old churches at Cologne; nor did
they perhaps even rival the quasi-classical grace and elegance of the
Provençal churches; but at Verona, Modena, and indeed throughout the
North of Italy, they had elaborated a complete round-arched style, all
the details of which were not only appropriate and elegant, but seemed
capable of indefinite development in the direction in which they were
proceeding.They had also before their eyes the Romanesque style of Pisa
and Lucca with all its elegance, and the example of Rome, where the
architects steadily refused to acknowledge the pointed arch during the
whole of the Mediæval period.Yet in the beginning of the 13th
century—say 1220, when the cathedrals of Amiens, Salisbury, and Toledo
were designed—Italy too was smitten with admiration for the pointed
arch, and set to work to adapt it to her tastes and uses.It would be difficult to account for this, were we not aware how deeply
the feelings that gave rise to the Ghibelline faction were rooted in the
Italian soil.In all the cities, except Rome, the cause of the
Ghibellines was throughout the Middle Ages identified with that of
freedom and local independence, in opposition to that of the Guelfs,
which symbolised the supremacy of the Pope and the clerical party.Knowing how strenuously this was resisted, we naturally expect to find
it expressed in the architecture of the country.Two, indeed, of the
great churches of Italy, Assisi (1228) and Milan (1385), were erected by
Germans in the German style of the day; but these are exceptional.The
form which the pointed-arched style took on its introduction, was that
of adaptation to the Italian style, in a manner which the Italians
thought more consonant with beauty and convenience than that adopted
north of the Alps.The elegance of
the details employed by a refined and cultivated people, and based on
classical traditions, goes far to redeem, in most instances, the defects
of their designs; but they never grasped the true principles of Gothic
art, and the fatal facility of the pointed arch led them more astray
after mechanical clevernesses than even the Germans.Still, it is an
original style, and, however imperfect, is well worthy of study.Before proceeding to describe the style more in detail, it may be well
to point out one of the principal causes which led to the more marked
features of difference between the Gothic architecture of Italy and that
of Germany and France.This was the distaste of the Italians for the
employment of painted glass, or at least their want of appreciation of
its beauties when combined with architecture.It will be explained in a future chapter how all-important painted glass
was to the elaboration of the Gothic style.But for its introduction,
the architecture of France would bear no resemblance to what it was, and
is.In Italy, indeed, the people loved polychromy, but always of the
opaque class.They delighted to cover the walls of their churches with
frescoes and mosaics, to enrich their floors with the most gorgeous
pavements, and to scatter golden stars over the blue ground of their
vaults; but rarely, if ever, did they fill, or design to fill, their
windows with painted glass.Perhaps the glare of an Italian sun may have
tended to render its brilliancy intolerable; but more probably the
absence of stained glass is owing to its incompatibility with
fresco-painting, the effect of which would be entirely destroyed by the
superior brightness of the transparent material.The Italians were not
prepared to relinquish the old and favourite mode of decoration in which
they so excelled.This adherence to the ancient method of ornamentation
enabled them, in the 15th and 16th centuries, to surpass all the world
in the art of painting, but it was fatal to the proper appreciation of
the pointed style, and to its successful introduction into the land.The first effect of this tendency was that the windows in Italian
churches were small, and generally devoid of tracery, with all its
beautiful accompaniments.The walls, too, being consequently solid, were
sufficient, by their own weight, to abut the thrust of the arches: so
that neither projecting or flying buttresses nor pinnacles were needed.The buildings were thus deprived externally of all the aspiring vertical
lines so characteristic of true Gothic.The architects, to relieve the
monotony arising from the want of these features, were forced to recur
to the horizontal cornices of the classical times, and to cover their
walls with a series of panelling which, however beautiful in itself, is
mere ornament—both unmeaning and inconsistent.Internally, too, having no clerestory to make room for, and no
constructive necessities to meet, they jumped to the conclusion that the
best design is that which covers the greatest space with the least
expenditure of materials, and the least encumbrance of the floor.With
builders this is a golden rule, but with architects it is about the
worst that can possibly be adopted.The Germans were not free from this
fault, but the Italians carried it still further.If on four or five
piers they could support the vault of a whole nave, they never dreamed
of introducing more.A French architect, though superior in constructive
skill, would probably have introduced eight or ten in the same space.An
Italian aimed at carrying the vaults of the side-aisles to the same
height as that of the nave, if he could.A Northern architect knew how
to keep the two in their due proportion, whereby he obtained greater
height and greater width in the same bulk, and an appearance of height
and width greater still, by the contrast between the parts, at the same
time that he gave his building a character of strength and stability
perhaps even more valuable than that of size.In the same manner the Northern architects, while they grouped their
shafts together, kept them so distinct as to allow every one to bear its
proportional part of the load, and perform its allotted task.The
Italians never comprehended this principle, but merely stuck pilasters
back to back, in imitation of the true architects, producing an
unmeaning and ugly pier.The same incongruities occur in every part and
every detail.It is a style copied without understanding, and executed
without feeling.The elegance of the sculptured foliage and other
details sometimes goes far to redeem these faults; for the Italians,
though bad architects, were always beautiful carvers, and, as a Southern
people, were free from the vulgarities sometimes apparent farther north,
and never fell into the wild barbarisms which too often disfigure even
the best buildings on this side of the Alps.Besides, when painting is
joined to sculpture in churches, the architecture may come to occupy a
subordinate position, and thus escape the censure it deserves.Unfortunately there are only two examples of any importance in this
style that retain all their painted decorations—St.Francis at Assisi,
and the Certosa near Pavia.From this circumstance they are perhaps the
most admired in Italy.In others the spaces left for colour are still
plain and blank.We see the work of the architect unaided by the
painting which was intended to set it off, and we cannot but condemn it
as displaying at once bad taste and ignorance of the true Gothic
feeling.One of the earliest, or perhaps the very first Italian edifice into
which the pointed arch was introduced, is the fine church of St.Andrea
at Vercelli, commenced in the year 1219 by the Cardinal Guala Bicchieri,
and finished in three years.This prelate, having been long legate in
England, brought back with him an English architect called, it is said,
Brigwithe, and entrusted him with the erection of this church in his
native place.(From Osten’s
‘Baukunst in Lombardei.’) Scale 100 ft.In plan, it is certainly very like an English church, terminating
squarely towards the east, and with side chapels to the transepts,
arranged very much as we find them at Buildwas, Kirkstall, and other
churches of this class and size, only that here they are polygonal,
which was hardly ever the case in England.But with the plan all
influences of the English architect seem to have ceased, and the
structure is in purely Italian style.Externally the pointed arch
nowhere appears, all the doors and windows being circular-headed; while
internally it is confined to the pier-arches of the nave and the
vaulting of the roof.The façade is flanked at its angles by two tall,
slender, square towers; and the intersection of the nave and transept is
covered by one of those elegant octagonal domes which the Italians knew
so well how to use, and which is in fact the only original feature in
their designs.The external form of this church is interesting, as
displaying the germs of much that two centuries afterwards was so
greatly expanded by a German architect in the design of Milan cathedral.A few years later, in 1229, a church was commenced at Asti, the tower of
which was finished in 1266.This allowed time for a more complete
development of the pointed style, which here prevails not only
internally, but externally.Tall pointed windows appear in the flanks,
and even the doorways assume that form, in their canopies, if not in
their openings.493) is a later addition, and a
characteristic specimen of the style during the 14th century.This
church is also one of the earliest examples in which those elegant
terra-cotta cornices of small intersecting arches seem to have been
brought to perfection.(From Chapuy, ‘Moyen-Âge
Monumental.’)]

The most remarkable church of this age is that of St.Francis at Assisi,
commenced in 1228, and finished, in all essentials at least, in 1253.It
is said to have been built by a German named Jacob, or Jacopo.Certainly
no French or English architect would have designed a double church of
this class, though, on the other hand, no Italian could have drawn
details so purely Northern as those of the upper church.In the lower
church there are hardly any mouldings to mark the style, but its
character is certainly rather German than Italian.This church depends
for its magnificence and character much more on painting than on
architecture.In the first place it is small, the upper church being
only 225 ft.width; and though the lower one has
side-aisles which extend the width to 100 ft., yet the upper church is
only 60 ft.in height, and the lower about 30, so that it is far too
small for much architectural magnificence.None of its details are equal
to those of contemporary churches on this side of the Alps.The whole
church is covered with fresco paintings in great variety and of the most
beautiful character, which justly render it one of the most celebrated
and admired of all Italy.On this side of the Alps without its frescoes,
it would hardly attract any attention.It is invaluable as an example of
the extent to which the polychromatic decoration may be profitably
carried, and of the true mode of doing it; and also as an illustration
of the extent to which the Italians allowed a foreign style and mode of
ornamentation to be introduced into their country.One of the purest and most perfect types of an Italian Gothic church is
that of Sta.Anastasia at Verona, commenced apparently in 1260.It is
not large, being only 285 ft.in length externally; but its arrangements
are very complete, and very perfect if looked at from an Italian point
of view.The square of the vault of the nave is the modulus, instead of
that of the aisles, as in true Gothic churches: owing to which the
pier-arches are further apart than a true artist would have placed them;
there are also no buttresses externally, but only pilasters.The
consequence of this is, that the arches have to be tied in with iron
rods at the springing, which internally adds very much to the appearance
of weakness, caused in the first instance by the wide spacing and
general tenuity.These bad effects are aggravated by the absence of a
string-course at the springing of the vault; and by the substitution of
a circular hole for the triforium, and a hexafoiled opening of very
insignificant dimensions for the glorious clerestory windows of Northern
churches.Altogether, though we cannot help being pleased with the
spaciousness and general elegance of design, it is impossible not to
feel how very inferior it is to that of churches on this side the Alps.One Bay, externally and internally, of the Church of
San Martino, Lucca.]The church of San Martino at Lucca, built about a century after Sta.Anastasia (middle of 14th century), presents a strikingly happy
compromise between the two styles.The pier-arches are still too wide—23
ft.in the clear; but the defect is remedied to some extent by the
employment of circular instead of pointed arches, and the triforium is
all that can be desired; the clerestory, however, is as insignificant as
it must be where the sun is so brilliant and painted glass inadmissible.It would be easy to point out other defects; but, taking it altogether,
there are few more elegant churches than this, and hardly one in Italy
that so perfectly meets all the exigencies for which it was designed.(From the ‘Églises
principales d’Europe.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedrals of Siena and Orvieto (the former commenced in 1243, the
latter in 1290) are perhaps, taken altogether, the most successful
specimens of Italian pointed Gothic.They are those at least in which
the system is carried to the greatest extent without either foreign aid
or the application of distinctly foreign details.These two buildings,
moreover, both retain their façades as completed by their first
architects, while the three great churches of this style—the cathedrals
of Florence, Bologna, and Milan—were in this respect left unfinished,
with many others of the smaller churches of Italy.The church at Siena
illustrates forcibly the tendency of the Italian architects to adhere to
the domical forms of the old Etruscans, which the Romans amplified to
such an extent, and the Byzantines made peculiarly their own.I cannot
but repeat my regret that the Italians alone, of all the Western
Mediæval builders, showed any predilection for this form of roof.On
this side of the Alps it could have been made the most beautiful of
architectural forms.In Italy there is no instance of more than moderate
success—nothing, indeed, to encourage imitation.Even the example now
before us is no exception to these remarks, though one of the boldest
efforts of Italian architects.In plan it ought to have been an octagon,
but that apparently would have made it too large for their skill to
execute, so they met the difficulty by adopting a hexagon, which, though
producing a certain variety of perspective, fits awkwardly with the
lines of columns, and twists the vaults to an unpleasant extent.Still,
a dome of moderate height, and 58 ft.in diameter, covering the centre
of the church, and with sufficient space around to give it dignity, is a
noble and pleasing feature, the merit of which it is impossible to deny.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.Combined with the rich colouring and gorgeous furniture of the church,
it makes up a whole of great beauty.The circular pier-arches, however,
and the black and white stripes by which the exterior is marked, detract
considerably from the effect of the whole—at least in the eyes of
strangers, though the Italians still consider it a beauty.The façade of
this cathedral is represented in Woodcut No.It consists of three
great portals, the arches of which are equal in size, though the centre
doorway is larger than those at the sides.Above is the invariable
circular window of the Italian architects, and the whole is crowned by
steep triangular gables.Beneath the cathedral, or rather under the
choir, is the ancient baptistery, now the church of St.John the
Baptist; its front is in a much purer style of Gothic than the
cathedral.[310]

[Illustration: 498.Façade of the Cathedral at Siena.]The carved architectural ornaments of the façade are rich and elaborate
in the extreme, though figured sculpture is used to a much less extent
than in Northern portals of the same age.It is also observable that the
strong horizontal lines do not harmonise with the aspiring character of
pointed architecture.The cathedral of Orvieto is smaller and simpler, and less rich in its
decorations, than that at Siena, with the exception of its façade, which
is adorned with sculpture and painting.Indeed the three-gabled front
may be considered the typical one for churches of this class.The
façades intended to have been applied to the churches at Florence,
Bologna, Milan, and elsewhere, were no doubt very similar to that
represented in Woodcut No.As a frontispiece, if elaborately
sculptured and painted, it is not without considerable appropriateness
and even beauty; but, as an architectural object, it is infinitely
inferior to the double-towered façades of the Northern cathedrals, or
even to those with only one great tower in the centre.It has besides
the defect of not expressing what is behind it; the central gable being
always higher than the roof, and the two others merely ornamental
appendages.Indeed, like the Italian Gothic buildings generally, it
depended on painting, sculpture, and carving for its effect, far more
than on architectural design properly so called.Among the greatest and most complete examples of Italian Gothic is the
church of Sta.Maria dei Fiori, the cathedral of Florence, one of the
largest and finest churches produced in the Middle Ages—as far as mere
grandeur of conception goes, perhaps the very best, though considerably
marred in execution from defects of style, which are too apparent in
every part.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The building of the church was commenced in the year 1294 or 1298 (it is
not quite clear which), from the designs and under the superintendence
of Arnolfo di Lapo, for unfortunately in this style we know the names of
all the architects, and all the churches show traces of the caprice and
of the misdirected efforts of individuals, instead of the combined
national movement which produced such splendid results in France and
England.It is not known how far Arnolfo had carried the building when
he died, in 1310, but probably up to the springing of the vaults.After
this the works proceeded more leisurely, but the nave and smaller domes
of the choir were no doubt completed as we now find them in the first
twenty years of the 14th century.The great octagon remained unfinished,
and, if covered in at all, it was only by a wooden roof of domical
outline externally, which seems to be that represented in the fresco in
the convent of San Marco, till Brunelleschi commenced the present dome
in 1420, and completed it in all essential parts before his death, which
happened in 1444.The building may therefore be considered as
essentially contemporary with the cathedral of Cologne, which it very
nearly equals in size (its area being 84,802 ft., while that of Cologne
is estimated at 91,000), and, as far as mere conception of plan goes,
there can be little doubt but that the Florentine cathedral far
surpasses its German rival.Nothing indeed can be finer than its general
ground-plan.A vast nave leads to an enormous dome, extending into the
triapsal arrangement so common in the early churches of Cologne, and
which was repeated in the last and greatest effort of the Middle Ages,
or rather the first of the new school—the great church of St.In the Florentine church all these parts are better subordinated
and proportioned than in any other example, and the mode in which the
effect increases and the whole expands as we approach from the entrance
to the sanctum is unrivalled.Like all inexperienced architects, Arnolfo seems to have
thought that largeness of parts would add to the greatness of the whole,
and thus used only four great arches in the whole length of his nave,
giving the central aisle a width of 55 ft.of that of Cologne, and the height about the same; and
yet, in appearance, the height is about half, and the breadth less than
half, owing to the better proportion of the parts and to the superior
appropriateness in the details on the part of the German cathedral.At
Florence the details are positively ugly.The windows of the side-aisles
are small and misplaced, those of the clerestory mere circular holes.The proportion of the aisles one to another is bad, the vaults
ill-formed, and altogether a colder and less effective design was not
produced in the Middle Ages.The triapsal choir is not so objectionable
as the nave, but there are large plain spaces that now look cold and
flat; the windows are too few and small, and there is a gloom about the
whole which is very unsatisfactory.It is nearly certain that the
original intention was to paint the walls, and not to colour the
windows, so that these defects are hardly chargeable to the original
design, and would not be apparent now were it not that in a moment of
mistaken enthusiasm the Florentines were seized with a desire to imitate
the true style of Gothic art, and rival Northern cathedrals in the glory
of their painted glass.This, in a church whose windows were designed
only of such dimensions as were sufficient to admit the requisite
quantity of white light, was fatal.Notwithstanding the beauty of the
glass itself, which seems to have been executed at Lubeck, 1434, from
Italian designs, it is so completely out of place that it only produces
irritation instead of admiration, and has certainly utterly destroyed
the effect and meaning of the interior it was intended to adorn.Section of Dome and part of Nave of the Cathedral at
Florence.Part of the Flank of Cathedral at Florence.]Dome at Chiaravalle, near Milan.Externally the façade was never finished,[311] and we can only fancy
what was intended from the analogy of Siena and Orvieto.The flanks of
the nave are without buttresses or pinnacles, and, with only a few
insignificant windows, would be painfully flat except for a veneer of
 marbles disposed in panels over the whole surface.For an
interior or a pavement such a mode of decoration is admissible; but it
is so unconstructive, so evidently a mere decoration, that it gives a
weakness to the whole, and most unsatisfactory appearance to so large a
building.This is much less apparent at the east end, where the outline
is so broken, and the main lines of the construction so plainly marked,
that the mere filling in is comparatively unimportant.This is the most
meritorious part of the church, and, so far as it was carried up
according to the original design, is extremely beautiful.Even the
plainness and flatness of the nave serve as a foil to set off the
varying outline of the choir.Above the line of the cornice of the
side-aisles there is nothing that can be said to belong to the original
design except the first division of the drum of the dome, which follows
the lines of the clerestory.It has long been a question what Arnolfo
originally intended, and especially how he meant to cover the great
octagonal space in the centre.All knowledge of his intentions seems to
have been lost within a century after his death: at least, in the
accounts of the proceedings of the commission which resulted in the
adoption of Brunelleschi’s design for the dome, no reference is made to
any original design as then existing, and no one appears to have known
how Arnolfo intended to finish his work.Judging from the structure as
far as he carried it, and with the knowledge we now possess of the
Italian architecture of that age, we can easily conjecture what his
design for its completion may have been.Internally, it probably
consisted of a dome something like the present, but flatter, springing
from the cornice, 40 ft.lower than the present one, and pierced with
large openings on each of its eight faces.Section of Eastern portion of Church at Chiaravalle.(From Gruner’s ‘Terra Cotta Architecture in Italy.’) Scale 50 ft.Externally, two courses were open to him.The first and most obvious was
to hide the dome entirely under a wooden roof, as is done in St.George’s, Thessalonica (Woodcut No.305), or in the baptistery in front
of the cathedral, and is done in half the baptisteries in Italy—as at
Parma, for instance (Woodcut No.Had he done this, the span of the
dome might have been very much larger, without involving any
constructive difficulties, and the three towers over the choir and
transepts might have sufficed to relieve its external appearance
sufficiently for architectural effect.On the whole, however, I am
rather inclined to believe that something more ambitious than this was
originally proposed, and that the design was more like that of
Chiaravalle near Milan, built in 1221, and one of the most complete and
perfect of this class of dome now existing in Italy.Its external
appearance may be judged of from Woodcut 502, and its constructive
details from the section, Woodcut No.If the basement is sufficiently solid—and that at Florence is more than
sufficient for any superstructure of the sort—it is evident the
architect can dispose of such masses of masonry, that he can counteract
any thrust or tendency to spread that can exist in any dome of this
sort; and instead of being only 136 ft.across, 150 or 160 might easily
have been attempted.Instead of 375 ft., which is the height of the
present dome from the floor to the top of the cross externally, it might
even with the present diameter have been carried up to at least 500 ft.,
or as high as the church was long,—70 to 100 ft.Had this been done, the three smaller semi-domes must have been intended
to be crowned with miniature octagonal spires of the same class with the
great dome, and between these the vast substructures show that it was
intended to carry up four great spires, probably to a height of 400 ft.Had all this been done (and something very like it seems certainly to
have been intended), neither Cologne Cathedral, nor any church in
Europe, ancient or modern, would have been comparable to this great and
glorious apse.As it is, the plain, heavy, simple outlined dome of
Brunelleschi acts like an extinguisher, crushing all the lower part of
the composition, and both internally and externally destroying all
harmony between the parts.It has deprived us of the only chance that
ever existed of witnessing the effect of a great Gothic dome; not indeed
such a dome as might with the same dimensions have been executed on this
side of the Alps, but still in the spirit, and with much of the poetry,
which gives such value to the conceptions of the builders in those days.But for this change of plan, the ambition of the Florentines might have
been in some measure satisfied, whose instructions to the architect
were, that their cathedral “should surpass everything that human
industry or human power had conceived of great and beautiful.”

About a century later (1390), the Bolognese determined on the erection
of a monster cathedral, which, in so far as size went, would have been
more than double that at Florence.According to the plans that have come
down to us, it was to have been about 800 ft.long and 525 wide across
the transepts; at the intersection was to have been a dome 130 ft.in
diameter, or only 6 ft.less than that at Florence; and the width of
both nave and transepts was to have been 183 ft.: so that the whole
would have covered about 212,000 ft., or nearly the same area as St.Peter’s at Rome, and three times that of any French cathedral!Of this
vast design, only about one-third (Woodcut No.ft., was
ever carried out; but that fragment is quite sufficient to enable us to
judge of the merits or defects of this style in its state of greatest
perfection.The only other building in the same style on a sufficient
scale to admit of comparison with this is the nave of the cathedral at
Florence just described, but that is nearly as may be only half of its
dimensions, or 36,000 ft.The chapels, too, at
Bologna add practically a fifth aisle, giving great variety and richness
to the perspective.The varied heights and proportions of the central
and side aisles are singularly pleasing, and there being six arches at
Bologna instead of only four as at Florence, and twelve side chapels
where none exist in the other example, go far to redeem the lean
mechanical look which is the great defect of this style.The great
advantage San Petronio has over the Florentine church is in the size and
number of its windows, and these not being filled with stained glass the
whole church has a bright and pleasing effect that contrasts most
favourably with the gloom of its great rival.Notwithstanding this, the
nave of San Petronio cannot be considered as a successful work of art.In the first place it is too mechanically perfect.The area of the
points of support as compared with the voids is, as far as can be made
out from such plans as exist, about one-twelfth, which would be a merit
in a railway station, but something more is wanted in a monumental
building.In the next there is a singular deficiency of either
constructive or constructed ornament.On this side of the Alps an
architect with vaulting shafts, string-courses, galleries, and fifty
other expedients, would have relieved the bareness of the walls.At
Bologna it probably was intended they should be painted, and this never
having been executed may account for most of its apparent defects.In Gothic architecture one of two systems seems indispensable: either
painted glass with strongly-marked carved mouldings over the whole of
the interior, or white glass with flat surfaces suitable for opaque
paintings.Few cathedrals are complete in both respects at the present
day, but in their imperfect state the Northern system has an immense
advantage over the Southern.The architecture of our cathedrals is
complete and beautiful even in ruins.An Italian church without its
 decoration is only a framed canvas without harmony or meaning.Were San Petronio as complete in its  decoration as the Certosa
at Pavia or Monreale at Palermo, it might stand a fair competition with
the best interiors on this side of the Alps.As it is, it is only a
splendid example of ornamental but unornamented construction, and, as
was attempted to be explained in the Introduction, both elements are
wanted for success in architectural design.Section of San Petronio, Bologna.The exterior of the church is in too unfinished a state to enable us to
judge of what its effect might have been if completed, but many of its
details, especially of the façade, are of very great beauty, in many
respects superior to what is to be found on this side of the Alps.Its
central dome, however, never could have been a feature worthy of so vast
a church.In diameter it is equal, or nearly so, to that of Florence,
but the points of support are so small, and so far apart, that it must
have been mainly if not wholly of wood.No such towering structure as
Arnolfo’s vast substructures show that he intended, could have stood on
the slim supports of the Bolognese church.[312]

[Illustration: 506.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali d’Europa.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedral of Milan—at once the most remarkable and one of the
largest and richest of all the churches erected in the Middle Ages—was
commenced in the year 1385, by order of Gian Galeazzo, first Duke of
Milan, and consecrated in 1418, at which date all the essential parts
seem to have been completed, though the central spire was not finished
till about the year 1440, by Brunelleschi.The design is said to have been furnished by a German architect,
Heinrich Arlez von Gemunden, or as the Italians call him, “da
Gamondia,”—a statement which is corroborated by the fact that the
details and many of the forms are essentially Northern; but it is
equally certain that he was not allowed to control the whole, for all
the great features of the church are as thoroughly Italian as the
details are German: it is therefore by no means improbable that Marco da
Campione, as the Italians assert, or some other native artist, was
joined with him or placed over him.In size it is, except Seville, the largest of all Mediæval cathedrals,
covering 107,782 ft.In material it is the richest, being built wholly
of white marble, which is scarcely the case with any other church, large
or small; and in decoration it is the most gorgeous—the whole of the
exterior is covered with tracery, and the amount of carving and statuary
lavished on its pinnacles and spires is unrivalled in any other building
of Europe.It is also built wholly (with the exception of the façade)
according to one design.Yet, with all these advantages, the appearance
of this wonderful building is not satisfactory to any one who is
familiar with the great edifices on this side of the Alps.Cologne is
certainly more beautiful; Rheims, Chartres, Amiens, and Bourges leave a
far more satisfactory impression on the mind; and even the much smaller
church of St.Ouen will convey far more pleasure to the true artist than
this gorgeous temple.The cause of all this it is easy to understand, since all or nearly all
its defects arise from the introduction of Italian features into a
Gothic building; or rather, perhaps, it should be said, from a German
architect being allowed to ornament an Italian cathedral.Petronio at Bologna as our standard of
comparison, it will be seen that the sections (Woodcuts Nos.505, 507)
are almost identical both in dimensions and in form, except that at
Milan the external range is a real aisle instead of a series of side
chapels; but, at the same time, it will be perceived that the German
system prevailed in doubling the number of the piers between the nave
and side-aisles.So far, therefore, the German architect saved the
church.The two small clerestories, however, still remain; and although
the design avoids the mullionless little circles of Bologna, there is
only space for small openings, which more resemble the windows of an
attic than of a clerestory.The greater quantity of light being thus
introduced by the tall windows of the outer aisle, the appearance is
that of a building lighted from below, which is fatal to architectural
effect.The model still preserved on the spot shows that the German architect
designed great portals at each end of the transepts.This, however, was
overruled in favour of two small polygonal apses.Instead of the great
octagonal dome which an Italian would have placed upon the intersection
of the whole width of the nave and transepts, German influence has
confined it to the central aisle, which is perhaps more to be regretted
than any other mistake in the building.The choir is neither a French
chevet nor a German or Italian apse, but a compromise between the two, a
French circlet of columns enclosed in a German polygonal termination.This part of the building, with its simple forms and three glorious
windows, is perhaps an improvement on either of the models of which it
is compounded.[313] (From
Wiebeking.)This is the nearest approach to the French chevet arrangement to be
found in all Italy.It is extremely rare in that country to find an
aisle running round the choir, and opening into it, or with the circlet
of apsidal chapels which is so universal in France.The Italian church
is not, in fact, derived from a combination of a circular Eastern church
with a Western rectangular nave, but is a direct copy from the old Roman
basilica.The details of the interior of Milan cathedral are almost wholly German
(Woodcut No.The great capitals of the pillars, with their niches
and statues, are the only compromise between the ordinary German form
and the great deep ugly capitals—fragments, in fact, of classical
entablatures—which disfigure the cathedrals of Florence and Bologna, and
so many other Italian churches.Had the ornamentation of these been
carried up to the springing of the vault, they would have been
unexceptionable; as it is, with all their richness, their effect is
unmeaning.Externally, the appearance is in outline not unlike that of Sta.Maria
dei Fiori; the apse is rich, varied, and picturesque, and the central
dome (excepting the details) similar, though on a smaller scale, to what
I believe to have been the original design of the Florentine church.The
nave is nearly as flat as at Florence, the clerestory not being visible;
but the forest of pinnacles and flying buttresses and the richness of
the ornamentation go far to hide that defect.The façade was left
unfinished, as was so often the case with the great churches of Italy.Pellegrini was afterwards employed to finish it, and a model of his
design is still preserved.It is fortunate that his plan was not carried
out.The façade was finished, as we now see it, from the designs of
Amati, by order of Napoleon.It is commonplace, as might be expected
from its age, but inoffensive.The doorways are part of Pellegrini’s
design, and the Mediæval forms being placed over those of the
cinque-cento, produce a strangely incongruous effect.For the west front
several original designs are still preserved.One of these, with two
small square towers at the angles, as at Vercelli and elsewhere, was no
doubt the Italian design.509) is preserved
by Bassi:[314] had this been executed, the façade would have been about
one-third (viz.Had the height of
the towers been in the same proportion, they would have been the tallest
in the world.In that case the effect here, as at Cologne, would have
been to shorten and overpower the rest of the building to a painful
extent.A design midway between the two, with spires rising to the same
height as the central one, or about 360 ft., would perhaps have the
happiest effect.At any rate, the want of some such features is greatly
felt in the building as it stands.The Certosa, near Pavia, was commenced about the same date (1396) as the
cathedral at Milan.It is seldom that we find two buildings in the
Middle Ages so close to one another in date and locality, and yet so
dissimilar.There is no instance of such an occurrence on this side of
the Alps, till modern times; and it shows that in those days the
Italians were nearly as devoid of any distinct principles of
architecture as we have since become.View of the Certosa, near Pavia.The great difference between Pavia and Milan is that the former shows no
trace of foreign influence.Petronio, and
by no means so complete or consistent in design.Nothing, in fact, can
be more painful than the disproportion of the parts, the bad drawing of
the details, the malformation of the vaults, and the meanness of the
windows; though all these defects are completely hidden by the most
gorgeous colouring, and by furniture of such richness as to be almost
unrivalled.So attractive are these two features to the majority of
spectators, and so easily understood, that nine visitors out of ten are
delighted with the Certosa, and entirely forget its miserable
architecture in the richness and brilliancy of its decorations.Externally the architecture is better than in the interior.From its
proximity to Pavia, it retains its beautiful old galleries under the
roof.Its circular apses, with their galleries, give to this church, for
the age to which it belongs, a peculiar character, harmonising well with
the circular-headed form, which nearly all the windows and openings
present.Even in the interior there are far more circular than pointed
arches.The most beautiful and wonderful part of the building is the façade.This was begun in 1473, and is one of the best specimens in Italy of the
Renaissance style.It would hardly, therefore, be appropriate to mention
it here, were it not that the dome over the intersection of the nave and
transepts is of the same age and style, but reproduces so exactly
(except in details) what we fancy the Mediæval Italian Gothic dome to
have been, that it may be considered as a feature of the earlier ages.502, it will be seen how like it is to that of
Chiaravalle in outline.Daniel travelled to the garden.It is less tall, however, and, if translated
into the details of the great church at Florence, would fit perfectly on
the basement there prepared for such a feature.Like many other churches in Northern Italy, the principal parts of the
Certosa are built in brick, and the ornamental details executed in
terra-cotta.Some of the latter, especially in the cloisters, are as
beautiful as any executed in stone in any part of Italy during the
Middle Ages; and their perfect preservation shows how suitable is the
material for such purposes.It may not be appropriate for large details
or monumental purposes, but for the minor parts and smaller details,
when used as the Italians in the Middle Ages used it, terra-cotta is as
legitimate as any material anywhere used for building purposes; and in
situations like the alluvial plains of the Po, where stone is with
difficulty obtainable, its employment was not only judicious but most
fortunate in its results.It would be a tedious and unprofitable task to attempt to particularise
all the churches which were erected in this style in Italy, as hardly
one of them possesses a single title to admiration beyond the very
vulgar one of size.To this Santa Croce, at Florence, adds its
association with the great men who lie buried beneath it, and Sta.Maria
Novella can plead the circumstance—exceptional in that city—of
possessing a façade;[315] but neither of these has anything to redeem
its innate ugliness in the eyes of an architect.There are two great churches of this period at Venice, the San Giovanni
e Paolo (1246-1420) and the Frari (1250); they are large and richly
ornamented fabrics, but are both entirely destitute of architectural
merit.(From Hope’s ‘Architecture.’)
Scale 50 ft.A much more beautiful building is the cathedral at Como, the details of
which are so elegant and so unobtrusively used as in great measure to
make up for the bad arrangement and awkward form of the whole.In design
it is, however, inferior to that of the Duomo at Ferrara (Woodcut No.The latter does not display the richness of the façades of Siena
or Orvieto, nor the elegance of that last named; but among the few
Italian façades which exist, it stands pre-eminent for sober propriety
of design and the good proportions of all its parts.The repose caused
by the solidity of the lower portions, and the gradual increase of
ornament and lightness as we ascend, all combine to render it harmonious
and pleasing.It is true it wants the aspiring character and bold relief
of Northern façades; but these do not belong to the style, and it must
suffice if we meet in this style with a moderate amount of variety,
undisturbed by any very prominent instances of bad taste.The true type of an Italian façade is well illustrated in the view of
St.Francesco at Brescia (Woodcut No.512), which may be considered the
germ of all that followed.Whether the church had three aisles or five,
the true Italian façade in the age of pointed architecture was always a
modification or extension of this idea, though introduced with more or
less Gothic feeling according to the circumstances of its erection.At Florence there is a house or warehouse, converted into a church,—Or
(horreum) San Michele, which has attracted a good deal of attention, but
more on account of its curious ornaments than for beauty of design—which
latter it does not, and indeed can hardly be expected to, possess.Maria della Spina at Pisa owes its celebrity to
the richness of its niches and canopies, and to the sculpture which they
contain.In this the Italians were always at home, and probably always
surpassed the Northern nations.It was far otherwise with architecture,
properly so called.This, in the age of the pointed style, was in Italy
so cold and unmeaning, that we do not wonder at the readiness with which
the Italians returned to the classical models.They are to be forgiven
in this, but we cannot so easily forgive _our_ forefathers, who
abandoned a style far more beautiful than that of Italy to copy one
which they had themselves infinitely surpassed; and this only because
the Italians, unable either to comSprehend or imitate the true
principles of pointed art, were forced to abandon its practice.Unfortunately for us, they had in this respect in that age sufficient
influence to set the fashion to all Europe.(From Street’s
‘Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages.’)]

Of late work in Dalmatia the most remarkable is the Cathedral of
Sebenico (described in Mr.Jackson’s work), built entirely in stone and
marble, and without any brick or timber in its construction.It is a
cruciform building, covered over by a waggon-vault of stone, visible
both inside and outside.It was commenced from the design of Messer
Ambrosia, a Venetian architect, in 1435, to whom may be attributed the
nave and aisles up to the string-course above nave arches.The work was
continued after 1441 by another architect, Messer Giorgio, also from
Venice, who died in 1475, leaving the building still incomplete.The
style of the work is late Venetian Gothic, influenced in its later
portions by the Renaissance revival.The cloisters of the Badia at
Curzola, and of the Dominican and Franciscan convents at Ragusa, are
also beautiful specimens of late Italian Gothic.Sandra went to the bedroom.----------------------------

  Max Müller, who is the _facile princeps_ of the linguistic school in
  this country—in an inaugural lecture which he delivered when, it was
  understood, he was appointed to a chair in the Strasburg
  University—gave up all that has hitherto been contended for by his
  followers.He admitted that language, though an invaluable aid, did
  not suffice for the purposes of the investigation, and that the
  results obtained by its means were not always to be depended upon.Footnote 17:

  The term “Persistent Varieties” has recently been introduced, instead
  of “race,” in ethnological nomenclature, and, if scientific accuracy
  is aimed at, is no doubt an improvement.It is an advantage to have a
  term which does not even in appearance prejudge any of the questions
  between the monogenists and polygenists, and leaves undecided all the
  questions how the variations of mankind arose.But it sounds pedantic;
  and “race” may be understood as meaning the same thing.Footnote 18:

  The whole of this subject has been carefully gone into by the Author
  in a work entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ published in 1872, to which
  the reader is referred.Footnote 19:

  All round the shores of the Mediterranean are found the traces of an
  art which has hitherto been a stumbling-block to antiquarians.Egyptian cartouches and ornaments in Assyria, which are not Egyptian;
  sarcophagi at Tyre, of Egyptian form, but with Phœnician inscriptions,
  and made for Tyrian kings; Greek ornaments in Syria, which are not
  Greek; Roman frescoes or ornaments, and architectural details at
  Carthage, and all over Northern Africa, which however are not Roman.In short, a copying art something like our own, imitating everything,
  understanding nothing.Franks for the
  suggestion that all this art may be Phœnician, in other words,
  Semitic, and I believe he is right.Footnote 20:

  The derivation of the two words Heathen and Pagan seems to indicate
  the relative importance of these two terms very much in the degree it
  is here wished to express.Heathen is generally understood to be
  derived from ἔθνος, a nation or people; and Pagan from _Pagus,
  Pagani_, a village, or villagers.Both are used here not as terms of
  reproach, but as indicative of their being non-Christian, which is
  what it is wished to express, and was the original intention of the
  term.Footnote 22:

  By a singular coincidence, China has been suffering from a Hyksos

  This will be best understood by looking at the section (Woodcut 7), in
  which it will be seen that the so-called coping or casing-stones were
  not simply triangular blocks, filling up the angles formed by the
  receding steps, and which might have been easily displaced, but stones
  from 7 to 10 feet in depth, which could not have been supported unless
  the work had been commenced at the bottom.On the other hand, it is
  difficult to understand how the casing-stones for the upper portion
  could have been raised up the sloping portion completed.It is
  probable, therefore, that the casing was commenced at the angles and
  was carried up in vertical planes, thus leaving a causeway of steps in
  the middle of each face, which diminished in width as the work
  proceeded; this causeway, a few feet wide only, on each face being
  then encased from the top downwards after the apex blocks had been
  laid.—ED.Footnote 31:

  I have ventured to restore the roof of the cella with a sikra (ziggur
  or ziggurah, according to Rawlinson’s ‘Five Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.395, et passim), from finding similar roofs at Susa, Bagdad,
  Keffeli, &c. They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some
  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it
  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which
  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic
  architecture.Footnote 73:

  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,
  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess
  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the
  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a
  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which
  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,
  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200
  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20
  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,
  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole
  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.
  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives
  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the
  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more
  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously
  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general
  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:

  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all
  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information
  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The
  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference
  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since
  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings
  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom
  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than
  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,
  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the
  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire
  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded
  to.Footnote 78:

  Published in 1862, in the ‘Athenæum’ journal, No.Footnote 79:

  This plan, with all the particulars here mentioned, are taken from
  Layard’s work, which is the only authority on the subject, so that it
  is not necessary to refer to him on every point.The plan is reduced
  to the usual scale of 100 ft.to 1 inch, for easy comparison with the
  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:

  The whole of the information regarding Khorsabad is taken from M.
  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et
  l’Assyrie,’ by M. Victor Place.Footnote 81:

  These particulars are all borrowed from M. Place’s great work, ‘Ninive
  et l’Assyrie,’ folio.Footnote 82:

  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this
  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the
  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis
  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the
  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published
  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on
  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent
  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general
  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over
  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never
  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been
  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such
  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and
  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time
  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were
  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of
  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because
  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such
  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the
  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so
  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them
  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in
  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were
  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of
  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two
  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.According to M. Place they formed
  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would
  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry
  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the
  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The
  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high
  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the
  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls
  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:

  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,
  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand
  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their
  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side
  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had
  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:

  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or
  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase
  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained
  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor
  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just
  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was
  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:

  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having
  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a
  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:

  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the
  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before
  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:

  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:

  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;
  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:

  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric
  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:

  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note
  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by
  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s
  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to
  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians
  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,
  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the
  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,
  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:

  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from
  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is
  mentioned.Footnote 93:

  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and
  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its
  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:

  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is
  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,
  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to
  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily
  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller
  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:

  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square
  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at
  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations
  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the
  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features
  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear
  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the
  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by
  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld
  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain
  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the
  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which
  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the
  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the
  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the
  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have
  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its
  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the
  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:

  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,
  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add
  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion
  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of
  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left
  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the
  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and
  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:

  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;
  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,
  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:

  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which
  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four
  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,
  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed
  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or
  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the
  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the
  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit
  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:

  Since the article on the Temple in Smith’s ‘Dictionary of the Bible’

  from recent explorations and recently discovered analogies have, I
  believe, been able to settle, within very narrow limits of doubt, all
  the outstanding questions with reference to this celebrated building.I have in consequence written and published a monograph of the Temple,
  but have deemed it more expedient to leave the illustrations here as

  “Toward the centre of the monument two large stones were found leaning
  at an angle the one against the other, and forming a sort of tent,
  like in Woodcut 124, under which was presently discovered a small
  statue of Minerva seated on a chariot with four horses, and an urn of
  metal filled with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones.This urn, which is
  now in the possession of the Comte de Choiseul, is enriched in
  sculpture with a vine branch, from which is suspended bunches of
  grapes done with exquisite art.”—‘Description of the Plain of Troy,’

  One of the most interesting facts brought to light in Dr.Schliemann’s
  excavations is that between the age of the “Ilium Vetus” of Homer,
  rich in metals and in arts, and the “Ilium Novum” of Strabo, a people
  ignorant of use of the metals, and using only bone and stone
  implements, inhabited the mound at Hissarlik which covered both these
  cities.This discovery is sufficient to upset the once fashionable
  Danish theory of the three ages—Stone, Bronze, and Iron—but,
  unfortunately, adds nothing to our knowledge of architecture.These
  people, whoever they were, built nothing, and must consequently be
  content to remain in the “longa nocte” of those who neglect the Master
  Art.Footnote 119:

  This tomb is considered by M. Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)
  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:
  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their
  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all
  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with
  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked
  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it
  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”
  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,
  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large
  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:

  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut
  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be
  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:

  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to
  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the
  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick
  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls
  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no
  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative
  features, of which so many others are found in the style.Footnote 130:

  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the
  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks
  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration
  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,
  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was
  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring
  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:

  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of
  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described
  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another
  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,
  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is
  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of
  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the
  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:

  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:

  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than
  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this
  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden
  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and
  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the
  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson
  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further
  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries
  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;
  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera
  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The
  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in
  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at
  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,
  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to
  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up
  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the
  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the
  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the
  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,
  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of
  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes
  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric
  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:

  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his
  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the
  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti
  Society.Footnote 139:

  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian
  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and
  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly
  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of
  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:

  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some
  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural
  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and
  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other
  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed
  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at
  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:

  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:

  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an
  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles
  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was
  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in
  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his
  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter
  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the
  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his
  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on
  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another
  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to
  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof
  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned
  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by
  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the
  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple
  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the
  lighting of the temples of antiquity in this way—that a few great
  dipteral hypæthral temples existed, but that the Greek and Roman
  temples had as a rule no light from above, and were only lighted from
  the door.”—ED.]Footnote 143:

  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,
  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole
  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his
  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,
  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,
  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open
  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the
  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,
  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the
  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light
  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting
  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have
  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the
  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems
  simply impossible.Footnote 149:

  “Universo Templo longitudo est ccccxxv.Columnæ
  centum viginti septem a singulis regibus factæ, lx.pedum altitudine:
  ex iis xxxvi.cælatæ, una a Scopa.”—H.Wood places two in the pronaos and two in the posticum, thus
  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a
  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the
  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to
  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:

  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls
  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have
  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various
  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were
  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of
  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best
  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors
  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek
  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a
  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing
  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:

  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this
  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on
  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also
  refer to the restoration suggested by M. Pullan in the work published
  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with
  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns
  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite
  repugnant to any student of Greek architecture.—ED.]Footnote 155:

  A diagram is given in ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art’ p.459,

  These two temples, like almost all the others of Rome, have recently
  been renamed by the Roman or rather German antiquaries.The Jupiter
  Tonans is now the Temple of Saturn, and the Jupiter Stator is decreed
  to have been the Temple of Castor and Pollux.The names by which they
  are currently known has been adhered to, as the architecture is of
  more importance here than the archæology.Footnote 167:

  When the first edition of this work was written I believed the rotunda
  to have been added to the portico by Severus; and if this were so it
  would get over many of the difficulties arising from its size and the
  character of its brickwork.My personal examination, however, has
  forced me very unwillingly to give up this hypothesis.It certainly
  is, however, very astonishing that such a vault should have been
  attempted at so early an age.[There seems to be some probability that Mr.Fergusson’s first belief
  was correct, and that the Rotunda was built by Hadrian, bricks with
  the stamp of his period having been found in the casing and in the
  bond courses in the solid concrete both of the drum and in the dome.The discovery is due to M. Chedanne, one of the “Grand Prix” students
  in the Villa Medici, who had selected the subject for his “Envoi de
  Rome,” and was allowed to superintend certain repairs and restorations
  which were required in the Pantheon.It would seem that the portico
  erected by Agrippa preceded a temple with cella of the ordinary form,
  the pavement of which has been found nearly seven feet below the floor
  of the present church.From this it follows that when the Rotunda was
  erected in the first half of the second century, the portico, which is
  undoubtedly of Agrippa’s time, must have been taken down and rebuilt
  on to it, and this explains Mr.Fergusson’s reasons for insisting that
  the portico was built on to the Rotunda.The theory as to the Pantheon
  forming part of Agrippa’s bath is thus disposed of.Independently of
  that, however, Prof.Middleton has pointed out that the discoveries
  made in 1882, by the removal of the block of houses at the back,
  showed that there was no connection whatever between the two
  buildings.Traces exist of the original marble lining, and of cornices
  which were continued round the dome, showing that originally the
  complete circuit was exposed to view.Middleton
  states, “if further proof were wanting to contradict the theory that
  the Pantheon was over the Calidarum or Laconicum of the bath, this is
  supplied by the fact that there is no trace of any hypocaust under the
  floor, but merely an ancient drain to carry away the rain-water that
  fell through the opening in the dome.The Pantheon, too, is on the
  north side of the Thermæ—a very improbable position for the Laconicum,
  or hot room, which was usually placed on the sunny side of the
  buildings.”—ED.]Footnote 170:

  The bronze plates which were removed by Pope Urban VIII.in 1626 to
  make cannon, and also for the great Baldachino in St.Peter’s, were
  taken from the portico; the coffers of the interior of the dome were
  decorated, according to Prof.Middleton, with mouldings in stucco
  painted and gilt.Footnote 171:

  This building is commonly called a temple, though it is not known to
  what deity it was dedicated.My own impression is that it was a tomb,
  or at least a funereal monument of some sort.Footnote 172:

  Owing to a misreading of Vitruvius’s statement respecting the temple
  it had always been classed as decastyle.Penrose’s researches
  published in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Institute of British
  Architects,’ vol.Footnote 173:

  See ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ where the reasons for this
  arrangement will be found stated at length.[See note on page
  272.—ED.]Footnote 174:

  Canina, in his restoration, shows a flat roof with coffers, so there
  is probably no exact authority for its form, though it seems to be
  generally agreed that the centre was not hypæthral.Footnote 175:

  This basilica is generally represented as having an apse at either
  end; but there is no authority whatever for this, and general analogy
  would lead us rather to infer that it was not the case.Middleton, however, is of opinion that an apse existed at both ends,
  and shows the same in his restoration of the plan of Trajan’s
  form.—‘The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ by J. H. Middleton, Fig.Footnote 176:

  One of the pillars of this basilica remained _in situ_ till the year
  1614, when it was removed by Carlo Maderno, by order of Paul V., and
  re-erected in the piazza of St.M. Maggiore, where it now stands as a
  monumental column, supporting a statue of the Virgin.The column, with
  its base and capital, is as nearly as may be 60 ft.in height; the
  whole monument, as it now stands, 140 ft.Footnote 177:

  As it was sunk slightly below the pavement of the peristyle, and
  drains leading from it were traced by Mr.Ashpitel, it was probably
  hypæthral.Footnote 178:

  The theatres of Curio and Scaurus were in timber, except the
  proscenium of the latter, which was partly decorated with marble and
  mosaics.The Theatre of Pompey, B.C.54, was in stone, and parts of it
  still exist (Prof.The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by
  Julius Cæsar, but not completed till 13 B.C., when it was opened by
  Augustus.It was subsequently restored after a fire by Vespasian, but
  the purity and simplicity of the architecture, and the refinement of
  the details, in comparison with those of the Colosseum, 70-80 A.D.,
  are in favour of the earlier date assigned to it.Middleton
  quotes another theatre, that of Cornelius Balbus (13 B.C.), built to
  the north-west of the Theatre of Marcellus.Middleton the Amphitheatre of Sutrium is of Roman
  origin, and but little earlier than the Colosseum at Rome.“There is
  really no evidence,” he says (p.76), “that amphitheatres were built
  by the Etruscans; and there can be little doubt that they were purely
  Roman inventions.”

Footnote 180:

  At the Crystal Palace it has always been found necessary to allow 6

  Considerable difference of opinion seems to exist as to the extent of
  the velaria which sheltered the arena; this was supported by masts
  fixed outside the upper part of the walls, resting on brackets, 14 ft.below the cornice, which was cut away to allow the mast to fit close
  against the wall.M. Gérôme suggests, in his well-known picture of the
  Roman gladiators, that the velaria extended over a portion of the
  arena only.Middleton states, “The awning did not, as has been
  sometimes supposed, cover the whole amphitheatre, a thing which would
  have been practically impossible, owing to the enormous strain of so
  long a bearing, far beyond what any ropes could bear.It simply sloped
  down over the spectators in the cavea, leaving the whole central arena
  uncovered.” In case of rain, however, this might have been
  inconvenient, and it would not have protected the spectators from the
  sun, supposing that the performances lasted the whole day.Besides,
  there is no reason why the masts should have been carried so high
  above the wall, as shown in the restoration in Prof.Middleton’s book,
  p.Alma Tadema is of opinion that the velarium extended over
  the whole arena, and was suspended on a principle similar to that of a
  suspension bridge, the ridge, or highest portion lying between the
  foci of the ellipse.This accounts in a much more satisfactory way for
  the height of the masts, and would afford facilities for the draining
  off of the rain on to the top of the gallery round.Footnote 182:

  These baths have been carefully measured by M. Blouet, who has also
  published a restoration of them.This is, on the whole, certainly the
  best account we have of any of these establishments.Middleton this magnificent hall appears to have
  been what Spartianus calls the _cella soliaris_, the ceiling of which
  he says was formed of interlaced bars of gilt bronze.When the
  excavations in this hall were being made, many tons of fragments of
  iron girders were found.Aitchison)
  compound girders, formed of two T bars riveted together, and then
  cased in bronze.A sort of lattice-work ceiling had been formed with
  these bronze-cased girders, the panels being probably filled in with
  concrete made of light pumice-stone, worked with fine stucco reliefs,
  painted and gilt.Middleton is of opinion that the central part
  over the swimming-bath was left open for the admission of light.In
  the upper part of the walls deep sinkings to receive the ends of the
  great girders which supported the ceiling are clearly visible.George’s Hall at Liverpool is the most exact copy in modern times
  of a part of these baths.The Hall itself is a reproduction both in
  scale and design of the central hall of Caracalla’s baths, but
  improved in detail and design, having five bays instead of only three.With the two courts at each end, it makes up a suite of apartments
  very similar to those found in the Roman examples.The whole building,
  however, is less than one-fourth of the size of the central mass of a
  Roman bath, and therefore gives but little idea of the magnificence of
  the whole.Footnote 187:

  The left-hand wing of this arch has since been restored by M.
  Viollet-le-Duc, and the right-hand wing cleared of the square building
  in front of it.Footnote 188:

  These two buildings are described further on (p.544) as Christian
  edifices.Footnote 189:

  Professor Middleton states: “This building appears to be a nymphæum,
  or a part of some baths of about the time of Gallienus (263-268
  A.D.).” It was known in the Middle Ages as the “Terme de Gallucio.”
  The site of the real Temple of Minerva Medica was discovered in 1887
  (according to the same authority) between the new Via Macchiavelli and
  the Via Buonarroti, about 7 ft.Footnote 191:

  M. de Saulcy has recently attempted to prove that these tombs are
  those of the kings of Judah from David downwards.Their architecture
  is undoubtedly as late as the Christian era, and the cover of the
  sarcophagus which is now in the Louvre under the title of that of
  David is probably of the same date as these tombs, or if anything more
  modern.Footnote 192:

  Though the dates of all these tombs at Cyrene are so uncertain, there
  seems little doubt that if any one thoroughly versed in the style were
  to visit the place, he could fix the age of all of them with
  approximate correctness.The one difficulty is, that a chronometric
  scale taken from the buildings at Rome, or even in Syria, will not
  suffice.Local peculiarities must be taken into account and allowed
  for, and this requires both time and judgment.Footnote 194:

  [The domical construction of the vaults of the two great cisterns
  erected by Constantine, the Binbirderek, or thousand-and-one columns,
  and the Yeri Batan Seraï, both in Constantinople, suggests that there
  already existed in the East a method of vaulting entirely different
  from that which obtained in Rome, and which may have been a
  traditional method handed down even from Assyrian times.—ED.]Footnote 216:

  A great deal of very irrelevant matter has been written about these

  before the time of Roman supremacy in the country.The very earliest
  now existing are probably subsequent to the destruction of Jerusalem
  by Titus.Footnote 223:

  The constructive dimensions of the porch at Chillambaram (p.History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, 1876.)are very similar to
  those of this church: both have flat stone roofs, but in the Indian,
  though a much more modern example, there is no arch.Footnote 224:

  The Renaissance dome which fits best to the church on which it is
  placed is that of Sta.Maria at Florence; but, strange to say, it is
  neither the one originally designed for the place, nor probably at all
  like it.All the others were erected as designed by the architects who
  built the churches, and none fit so well.Footnote 229:

  [The apses on each side of central apse are said to be additions to
  the original structure.The triple apses in Greek churches are found,
  according to Dr.Freshfield (‘Archæologia,’ vol.44), only in churches
  erected subsequent to Justin II.Sergius at Bosra the side apses have been added afterwards.—ED.]Footnote 230:

  The two eastern cupolas have been raised in Arab times, and a
  cylindrical drum inserted with windows pierced in them to give more
  light to the interior.Footnote 232:

  There are numerous examples of this class of structure in North Syria,
  but whether they are memorials or tombs is not known.See ‘Reisen
  Kleinasien und Nord Syria’ by Karl Humann and Otto Puchstein.Footnote 233:

  [This rule cannot be made a hard and fast one.Procopius states that
  in the central dome of the Church of the Apostles, Constantinople,
  “the circular building standing above the arches is pierced with
  windows, and the spherical dome which over-arches it seems to be
  suspended in the air.” In the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople
  the walls of the octagon, which are pierced with windows, are carried
  up to the vault, and in the church of Sta.Sophia at Thessalonica the
  windows are pierced in an upright dome cylindrical internally.In all
  these cases, however, there is a marked distinction between these
  examples and those of the lofty cylindrical drums which were employed
  in the Neo-Byzantine churches.Fergusson’s rule, therefore, with
  these exceptions, may be taken as absolute.—ED.]Footnote 234:

  Even if it should be asserted that this is no proof that the
  inhabitants of these countries were Buddhists in those days, it seems
  tolerably certain that they were tree-worshippers, which is very
  nearly the same thing.Procopius tells us that “even in his day these
  barbarians worshipped forests and groves, and in their barbarous
  simplicity placed the trees among their gods.” (‘De Bello Gotico,’

  The particulars and illustrations of this church are taken from a
  paper by Heinrich Keissenberger, in the ‘Jahrbuch der K. K. Commission
  für Enthaltung der Baudenkmale,’ 1860.A model of it, full size, was
  exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.Footnote 257:

  [It has been assumed that the Roman basilicas were taken possession of
  by the early Christians for their own religious services, but as Mr.G. G. Scott points out in his ‘Essay on the History of English Church
  Architecture,’ “there is no well-authenticated instance of the
  conversion of any Pagan basilica into a Christian church, whilst there
  are abundant examples of Pagan temples converted into Christian
  sanctuaries” (see Texier and Pullan’s ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ pp.Scott observes, “on the face of it
  improbable, if we reflect that the conversion of the government to
  Christianity had no tendency to render the existing basilicas less
  necessary for legal business, after the peace of the church, than they
  had been before that event.Christianity, unfortunately, could not
  abolish the litigious instincts of our nature, and after fifteen
  centuries of the gospel the legal profession still flourishes.” The
  buildings which were rendered useless by the official recognition of
  the new faith were not the basilicas but the temples, the fact being
  that the class of building known as a basilica (a term never used by
  either the writers or architects of Byzantine times), with its wide
  central nave and aisles with galleries over them lighted by clerestory
  or side windows, and covered with a timber roof, constituted the
  simplest and most economical building of large size which could be
  constructed to hold a vast assembly of worshippers; especially as the
  only features which can be looked upon as having any architectural
  pretensions, viz., the columns and their capitals, could be taken
  wholesale from temples and other Roman buildings.The semicircular
  apse, which alone in the Roman basilica served as a court of law,
  became the tribune for the bishop and presbyters.Scott is even inclined to assign an earlier and more independent
  origin for the basilican form.According to his theory the germ of the
  Christian basilica was a simple oblong aisleless room divided by a
  cross arch, beyond which lay an altar detached from the wall.This
  germ was developed by the addition of side aisles, and sometimes an
  aisle returned across the entrance, and over these upper aisles were
  next constructed and transepts added, together with the oratories or
  chapels in various parts of the building.Butler, in his work on
  ‘The Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt,’ accepts this theory, as the
  churches of Egypt are rich in evidence that favours it.At the same
  time, the first great basilica erected by Constantine, viz., the
  Vatican (St.Peter’s), and the Lateran, (St.John Lateran), are of too
  great importance to warrant the suggestion that their origin should be
  sought for in the very small though possibly earlier examples in Egypt
  or the East.—ED.]Footnote 258:

  This probably refers to its foundation, for M. Cattaneo, in his work
  ‘L’architecture en Italie, 1890,’ judging by its ornamental detail,
  places the church in the second half of the seventh century.Footnote 259:

  ‘Antiquités,’ vol.Footnote 260:

  _Eodem_, vol.Alfred J. Butler’s work, already referred to, has thrown
  considerable light on the subject, though, as he was unable to visit
  any of the Coptic churches up the Nile, we are still left in doubt as
  to the age of the convent near Siout and other buildings.From
  comparison of the plans and descriptions given in Denon, Curzon and
  Pococke of these buildings, with those in Cairo and Old Cairo, Mr.Butler ascribes them to the fourth century, that which in fact is
  claimed for them as having been founded by Sta.On this
  subject he says, p.365: “Were there no more of evidence besides to
  determine the truth of this tradition, the plan of the Haikal (the
  central of the three chapels in a Coptic church) would decide it
  beyond question.The persistence with which certain churches are
  ascribed to Sta.Helena by a people utterly ignorant of history and
  architecture is in itself remarkable, and it is still more remarkable
  to find that these churches are always marked by a particular form of
  Haikal.Indeed, so regular is the coincidence, that a deep apsidal
  haikal with recesses all round it and columns close against the wall
  may be almost infallibly dated from the age of Sta.Helena.”

Footnote 262:

  The older church has been so altered and ruined by the subsequent
  rebuildings that it is extremely difficult to make out its history.It
  seems, however, to have been built originally above the site of an old
  Mithraic temple, which has recently been cleared out, and probably
  before the time of Gregory the Great.It was apparently rebuilt, or
  nearly so, by Adrian I., 772, and burnt by Robert Guiscard, 1084.The
  upper church seems to have been erected by Paschal, 1099-1118.The
  question is, to what age do the frescoes found on the walls of the
  older church belong?Some of the heads and single figures may, I
  fancy, be anterior even to the time of Adrian; but the bulk of the
  paintings seem certainly to have been added between his age and 1084,
  and nearer the latter than the former date.If it had not been
  entirely ruined in 1084 Paschal would not have so completely
  obliterated it a century afterwards.A considerable quantity of the
  materials of the old church were used in the new, which tends further
  to confuse the chronology.Footnote 263:

  The dates here given generally refer to the building now existing or

  giving a full quotation from Eusebius of Constantine’s basilica at
  Jerusalem, in which he points out that the orientation of primitive
  times is the reverse of that which has become general in later times,
  continues his enquiry into the evidence afforded by the numerous early
  basilicas in Rome itself.Of about fifty churches of early date, in
  forty of them the sanctuary is placed at the western end, and of the
  remaining ten (one of which is the great church of St.Paolo fuori le
  Mura), there are only seven which appear to have retained their
  original form, and which have an eastward sanctuary.The exact orientation of the sanctuary in each case has been added to
  the list.—ED.]Footnote 266:

  and four other domes.Procopius speaks of the church being surrounded
  within by columns placed both above and below, probably referring to
  galleries similar to those in St.Mark’s the columns exist in one storey only, and the main wall is
  carried up at the back of the aisles to give increased size inside.Footnote 280:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The same polygonal form is found in the apses of St.Apollinare in Classe, St.Apollinare in Nuovo, St.Vitale, all in Ravenna, and St.Footnote 285:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the
  6th century church there are eight rows, so that the apse looks like a
  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as
  the prototype of the most characteristic Lombard towers.—ED.]Footnote 305:

was there to comment on his embarrassment.Then he leaned back in his
chair and went slowly over in thought the experiences of that eventful
night in his house.Why, this slip of a girl--a half-breed Indian at
best--this mere baby--!But he glanced up at the great electric wall
clock, and wished it were then twelve-fifteen.*       *       *       *       *

At noon Ames, jauntily swinging his light walking stick, strolled
casually into the office of the Express.His air was one of supreme
confidence in his own powers.And
the knowledge rendered him unafraid of God, man, or beast.He had met
and conquered everything mundane, excepting this young girl.But that
thought was now delightful to him.In her he had unearthed a real
novelty, a ceaseless interest.She scratched and nettled him; but she was as nothing in his grasp.The first thing that impressed him on entering the office was the air
of prosperity which hung over the place.The environment, he mentally
commented, was somewhat unusual for a newspaper plant.Order, quiet,
and cleanliness were dominant notes in the prevailing harmony.He
first walked back into the pressroom to see if the same conditions
prevailed there.Then he retraced his steps, and at length came to a
halt before a door bearing the inscription, "Miss Ariza," on the
glass.Turning the knob, he peered curiously in.The room was small, but light and airy.Its furnishings were new, and
its walls had been freshly tinted.A few pictures of good quality hung
about them.At the desk, bending
over a new typewriter, sat Carmen."I beg pardon," said Ames, hesitating in the doorway."You don't mind if I finish
this article, do you?""It's got
to go to the compositors right away.""Certainly--don't stop," replied Ames easily."When we talk I want
your undivided attention.""Oh, you're sure to get it," she returned, laughing.He sat back in his chair and watched her closely.Yet, there was just a slight tint in her skin, he thought.Perhaps the report that she was a mulatto was not wholly unfounded,
although the strain must have been greatly mixed.He wanted to bend over and take it in his own.Then he suddenly remembered what the Beaubien had once told him--that
she always seemed to be a better woman in this girl's presence.Could he go on persecuting the
harassed woman?But he wouldn't, if--

"There!"said the girl, with what seemed to be a little sigh of
relief.She pressed a button, and handed the typewritten sheets to the
boy who responded.Then, turning to Ames:

"You've come to apologize, haven't you?Well, he certainly had not had any such intention when he
came in.In fact, he knew not just why he was there."You see, Congressman Wales didn't vote for the unaltered schedule.And so everything's all right, isn't it?""No vote has been taken," he said, a dull anger
rising within him."Oh, you are mistaken," replied the girl."The bill was voted out of
committee an hour ago.Here's the wire,
showing the alterations made.Ames read the message, and handed it back.Beyond the clouding of his
features he gave no indication of his feelings."So, you see," continued the girl, "that incident is closed--for all
time, isn't it?"Then:

"Rather odd, isn't it?"he commented, turning quite away from that
subject, and glancing about, "that one with the high ideals you
profess should be doing newspaper work.""There is nothing so
practical as the ideal, for the ideal is the only reality.""Well, just what, may I ask, are you trying to do here?""Run a newspaper on a basis of _practical_ Christianity," she
answered, her eyes dancing."Just as all business will have to be
conducted some day."she said, "to the carnal mind."The laughter abruptly ceased, and he looked keenly at her.But there
was no trace of malice in her fair face as she steadily returned the
look.Well, I'll wager you won't get a dollar back on your investment
for years."We are not measuring our profits
in money!""And your investment--let's see," he mused, trying to draw her out."You've put into this thing a couple of hundred thousand, eh?""I'll tell you," she said, "because money is the only
measure you have for estimating the worth of our project.Hitt has
put more than that amount already into the Express."Quite a little for you people to lose, eh?""You will have to change your tone if you remain here, Mr.You who owe your fellow-men what you can
never, never repay?Ames, there is no man in this whole wide
world, I think, who is so terribly, hopelessly in debt as you!"Why, I don't owe a dollar to any man!"she queried, bending a little closer to him."You do not owe
Madam Beaubien the money you are daily filching from her?Gannette the money and freedom of which you robbed him?You do not owe anything to the thousands of miners and mill hands who
have given, and still give, their lives for you?You do not owe for
the life which you took from Mrs.You do not owe for
the souls which you have debauched in your black career?For the human
wreckage which lies strewn in your wake?Haynerd
for the Social Era which you stole from him?"Ames remained rigid and quiet while the girl spoke.And when she had
finished, and they sat looking squarely into each other's eyes, the
silence was like that which comes between the sharp click of lightning
and the crash of thunder which follows.If it had been a man who thus
addressed him, Ames would have hurled him to the floor and trampled
him.As it was, he rose slowly, like a black storm-cloud mounting
above the horizon, and stood over the girl.She looked up into his face dauntlessly and smiled."Sit down," she
quietly said.Don't threaten, please," she
continued."It wouldn't do any good, for I am not a bit afraid of you.A faint smile began to play about Ames's mouth.Then he twitched his
shoulders slightly."I--I got up," he said, with an assumption of
nonchalance, "to--to read that--ah, that motto over there on the
wall."He went slowly to it and, stooping, read aloud:

               "Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,
               Defend the truth, combat the wrong!You'll find no scepter like the pen
               To hold and sway the hearts of men.""That was written by your Eugene Field," offered the girl."Now read
the one on the opposite side.It is your _Tekel Upharsin_."He went to the one she indicated, and read the spiritual admonition
from Bryant:

          "Leave the vain, low strife
          That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power--
          The passions and the cares that wither life,
          And waste its little hour.""Now," continued the girl, "that is only a suggestion to you of the
real handwriting on the wall.I put it there purposely, knowing that
some day you would come in here and read it."Ames turned and looked at her in dumb wonder, as if she were some
uncanny creature, possessed of occult powers.Then the significance of
her words trickled through the portals of his thought."You mean, I suppose," he said, "that if I am not persuaded by the
second motto I shall feel the force of the first, as it sways you,
eh?"Ames," she replied steadily, "that the world is entering
upon a new era of thought, and that your carnal views and methods
belong to a day that is past.This century has no place for them; it
wearies of the things you represent; you are the epitome of that evil
which must have its little hour of night before the reality dawns.""Am I to understand," he
asked, "that the Express, under its new management, is about to turn
muck-raker, and shovel mud at us men of wealth?""We are not considering the Express now, Mr."It
is I alone who am warning you.""Do Hitt and Haynerd bring against me the charges which you voiced a
moment ago?And do you intend to make the columns of your paper spicy
with your comments on my character and methods?I verily believe you
are declaring war!""We are in the business of declaring truth, Mr.It will not shield you when
you are the willing tool of evil, nor will it condone your methods at
any price."Very well," he replied with a bantering smile."I came over
here this noon to get the policy of your paper.Ames," she returned, "is the challenge which evil
always finds in good."I like a good enemy, and an honest one.Who's your general, Hitt or Haynerd?"Then he recovered himself, and
laughed."Do you know," he said, bending close to her, "I admire you _very_
much.Now let's see if we can't get
together on terms of peace.The world hasn't used you right, and I
don't blame you for being at odds with it.I've wanted to talk with
you about this for some time.The pin-headed society hens got jealous
and tried to kill you.But, if you'll just say the word, I'll set you
right up on the very pinnacle of social prestige here.I'll take you
by the hand and lead you down through the whole crowd of 'em, and
knock 'em over right and left!I'll make you the leading woman of the
city; I'll back the Express; we'll make it the biggest newspaper in
the country; I'll make you and your friends rich and powerful; I'll
put you in the place that is rightfully yours, eh?He was bending ever nearer, and his hand closed over hers when he
concluded.His eyes were looking eagerly into her face, and a smile,
winning, enticing, full of meaning, played about his lips.Carmen returned his smile, but withdrew her hand."I'll join you," she
said, "on one condition.""Go; sell that thou hast; and give to the poor.Then come, take up the
cross, and follow--my leader."He straightened up, and a sneer curled his lips."I suppose," he
coarsely insinuated, "that you think you now have material for an
illuminating essay on my conversation."The man's facial muscles twitched slightly under the sting, but he
retained his outward composure."My dear girl," he said, "it probably
has not occurred to you that the world regards the Express as utterly
without excuse for existence.It says, and truly, that a wishy-washy
sheet such as it, with its devitalized, strained, and bolted reports
of the world's vivid happenings, deserves to go under from sheer lack
of interest.The experiment has been tried before, and has signally
failed.But, say the word,
and--"

"And your money, as well as your business ideals, will be ours?"Ames," she said, "you have no ideals.No man who amasses millions
by taking advantage of the world's inhuman and pernicious social
system can have ideals worthy of the name.To apply your methods, your
thought, to the Express would result in sinking its moral tone into
the dust.As for your money--"

"Commit suicide, then!"cried the man, yielding to his rising anger."Let the Express go down, carrying you and your spineless associates
with it!But, remember, you will be the sole cause of its ruin, and
theirs!"Carmen rose quietly and opened the office door."Your half hour is up,
Mr.Ames," she said, glancing at the little clock on her desk; "and I
must return to my work."For a moment the huge man stood looking down darkling upon the girl.He would have given his soul if he could have clasped that slender
form in his arms!A sudden impulse assailed him, and bade him fall
upon his knees before her, and ask her forgiveness and guidance.She
stood waiting--perhaps just for that, and always with that same smile
into which no one had ever yet read aught but limitless love.Carmen hastened to answer the call.Yes--yes--the cotton schedule was reported out
quite changed--yes, an hour ago!"*       *       *       *       *

"Dearie," said the Beaubien at evening, as Carmen seated herself in
that woman's lap and wound her arms about her neck, "I am afraid for
you.""Well, mother dearest," replied the girl, giving her a tighter
squeeze, "that is a sheer waste of time.If you haven't anything more
to occupy you than fear, you'd better come down to the office, and
I'll set you to work.""But--you have defied him--as he says, declared war--"

"No, dearest, not that.It is the carnal mind, using him as a channel,
that has declared war against good.But evil is not power; nor has it
been given power by God.My one thought is this: Am I doing that which
will result in the greatest good to the greatest number?Not as evil would
want to be served, but as good.If my mental attitude is right, then
God's law becomes operative in all that I do, and I am protected."I know, dearie, but--there's the telephone!Oh, I do hope they don't
want you!"Carmen answered the call, and returned with the announcement that
Haynerd was in distress."Sidney Ames is--not there," she said.Now don't worry,
dearest; I--I won't go alone."A moment later she gave the
Beaubien a kiss, and hurried out into the night.In half an hour she
stood at Haynerd's desk."Here I
am, tied down, depending on Sid, and he's drunk!"Haynerd looked up at her, and hesitated."Mass meeting, over on the
East Side.Here's the address," taking up a slip of paper."Open
meeting, I'm told; but I suspect it's an I. W. W. affair.he
said, replying to a telephone call.The Ames mills at
Avon closed down this afternoon?He hung up the receiver and turned to Carmen."That's what this
meeting is about," he said significantly."Four thousand hands
suddenly thrown out at the Avon mills.Sidney Ames slouched into the editor's office and sank heavily into a
chair."Look here," he said, in
sudden desperation, "that fellow's got to be sobered up, now!Or
else--"

Another call came, this time from the Beaubien.Haynerd eagerly gave the
address over the 'phone, and bade him start at once."Now," he said, nodding at Carmen, and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the intoxicated reporter, "it's up to you."Carmen rose at once and went to the lad."Come, Sidney," she said,
taking his hand.The boy roused dully, and shuffled stupidly after the girl into her
own little office.Carmen switched on the lights and closed the door.Then she went to
the limp, emaciated form crumpled up in a chair, and sat down beside
it."Sidney," she said, taking his hand, "there is but one habit--the
habit of righteousness.That is the habit that you are going to wear
now."Outside, the typewriters clicked, the telephones tinkled, and the
linotypes snapped.There were quick orders; men came and went
hurriedly; but there was no noise, no confusion.Haynerd toiled like a
beaver; but his whole heart was in his work.Carmen's little room voiced the sole discordant note that night.And
as the girl sat there, holding the damp hand of the poor victim, she
thanked her God that the lad's true individuality was His pure
thought of him.*       *       *       *       *

At dawn Sidney Ames awoke.A rosy-tinted glow lay over the little
room, and the quiet form at his side seemed an ethereal presence.A
gentle pressure from the hand that still clasped his brought a return
of his earthly sense, and he roused up.The gentle voice sounded to him like distant music."I--you--you brought me in here last night--but--" His hands closed
about the little one that lay in his grasp."You--haven't sat
here--with me--all night?"With a low moan the boy buried his face in her arms, and burst into a
flood of bitter tears."It isn't real, Sidney," she whispered, twining an arm about his neck.For some moments the lad sobbed out his shame and misery.Carmen
stroked his fair hair, and drew him closer to her, while tears of love
and pity coursed down her own cheeks.he cried,
struggling to his feet, while his eyes shone with a wild light.He started for the door, but Carmen darted past him and stood with her
back against it, facing him.she cried, holding her
hands against him._God reigns
here!_"

She turned the lock as he hesitated; then took his arm and led him,
trembling and shivering, back to his chair."We are going to meet this, Sidney, you and I," she whispered, bending
over the shaking form.The suffering lad shook his head and buried his face in his hands."You can't," he moaned; "you can't--I'm _gone!_" His voice died into a
tremble of hopeless despair, of utter surrender.She had faced many trying situations in her brief
life-experience; but, though she met it with dauntless courage and
knew its source, the insidious suggestion now persisted that the eyes
of her people were upon her, and that by this would stand or fall
their faith.Aye, the world was watching her now, keen-eyed and
critical.Would she give it cause to say she could not prove her faith
by her works?And then came the divine message that bade her "Know that I am
God!"--that bade her know that responsibility lay not upon her
shoulders, but upon the Christ for whom she was now called to
witness.To see, or permit the world to see, this mountainous error,
this heaped-up evil, as real and having power, meant a denial of the
Christ and utter defeat.It meant a weary retracing of her own steps,
and a long night of spiritual darkness to those whose eyes had been
upon her."Sidney," she said, turning to the sunken boy at her side, "you are
right, the old man _is_ gone.And now we are going to create 'new
heavens and a new earth, and the former shall not be remembered nor
come into mind'--as thought.Underneath are the everlasting arms, and
you have sunk down, down, down, until at last you rest upon them, and
you find that you haven't sunk at all, and that you couldn't possibly
get away from that infinite Love that is always drawing you to
itself!"She put her arm again about the lad, and drew him toward her."Listen,
Sidney dear, I am standing with you--and with me is omnipotent God!His arm is not shortened, that it can not save you from the pit of
spiritual oblivion into which human thought would seem to make you
think you had fallen, engulfed by the senses."The boy raised his head and looked at her through his bloodshot eyes.he whispered hoarsely; "you don't understand--"

"It is just because I _do_ understand, Sidney, that I am able to help
you," she interrupted quickly."It--it isn't only whiskey--it's--" his head sank again--"it's--morphine!"It's got the false thought that seems to call itself 'you,'" she
said.We'll
cling to them no longer, but shake them off for good.For good, I
said, Sidney--and that means, for _God_!"If there were a God, I shouldn't be
where I am now.""Then I will know it for you," she softly answered."And you are now
right where you belong, in Him.My
parents didn't teach it to their children.And when I tried to learn,
my father kicked me into the street!""Then, Sidney, I'll teach you.For I am in the world just to show what
love will do.""My father--it's his fault--all his fault!"cried the boy, flaring up
and struggling to rise.It's his fault
that I'm a sot and a drug fiend!""It is hate, Sidney, that manifests in slavery, in sodden brains, and
shaking nerves.You don't hate your father; the hate is against your
thought of him; and that thought is all wrong."I used to drink--some, when I lived at home," the boy went on, still
dwelling on the thoughts that held him chained."But he could have
saved me.And then I fell in love--I thought it was love, but it
wasn't.The woman was--she was years older than I. When she left the
city, I followed her.And when I found out what she was, and came back
home, my father threw me out--cut me off--God!""Never mind, Sidney," the girl whispered.But
she realized that the boy must voice the thoughts that were tearing
his very soul, and she suffered him, for it uncovered to her the
hidden sources of his awful malady."And then I drank, drank, drank!""And I lay in the
gutters, and in brothels, and--then, one day, Carlson told me to come
and work for him.And so I went to a
doctor, and he--God curse him!--he injected morphine into my arm to
sober me.And that taught me that I could drink all I wanted to, and
sober up on morphine.But then I learned--I found--"

He stopped, and began to fumble in his pockets.His eyes became wilder
as he searched.He caught her wrist and twisted
it painfully."I am not
afraid to see evil seem to have power!"Then aloud: "I know what you
are searching for, Sidney.Listen, and I will give it
to you.It is in love--right here--the Christ-principle, that is bigger far
than the demons that seem to tear you!I have _all_ power from God,
and you, evil, _can not touch me_!"The boy started at the ringing voice, and loosened his grasp.Then he
sank back into his chair, shaking as with palsy.We
don't have to struggle--we don't have to fight--we only have to
_know_.All that you are wrestling with is the world-wide belief that
there is a power apart from God!_There is none!_ Any claim that there
is such a power is a lie!There is no power or intelligence in whiskey or morphine!The Christ-principle will save you!There
is nothing beyond its reach, not even your problem!"It is a problem, that's all, Sidney," she went on, as he became
calmer.Will you put yourself in my charge,
in my care, and let me meet it for you?"She bent over him and looked
eagerly into his drawn face."We are not going to fight," she continued."We are not going to
resist evil as the world does, and so make it real.I know, dear, just
how pressing your need is.I know how
awfully real it seems to you.But trust me, as I trust the Christ.For a few moments they sat together, hand in hand."I am going to
take you home with me.I am going to keep you right with me, right
under my thought.I'm going to be the mirror, constantly with you,
that reflects infinite love to you every moment.Don't think of anything
else now, excepting that God has your hand and is leading you."She took his arm and drew him, unresisting, yet uncomprehending, to
the door.As she opened it, she looked up into his face and smiled.she cried, shifting her grasp to his hand.And I shall not turn you over to yourself again until the problem
is solved!"Hitt met them as they came out of the room."Well," he said, "I've
kept Madam Beaubien informed as well as I could."We'll be back at three--perhaps."*       *       *       *       *

But at three that afternoon the Beaubien telephoned to Hitt that
Carmen would not be down."She will not leave the boy," the woman said."She holds him--I don't
know how.And I know he is trying desperately to help her.But--I
never saw any one stand as she does!Lewis is here, but he doesn't
interfere.We're going to put a bed in his room, and Sidney will sleep
there.Haynerd stormed; but the tempest was all on the surface."I know, I
know," he said, in reply to Hitt's explanation."That boy's life is
more to her than a million newspapers, or anything else in the
universe just at present.The devil can't look her in the
face!I--I wish I were--What are you standing there for?In the little Beaubien cottage that afternoon the angry waves of human
fear, of human craving, of hatred, wrath, and utter misery mounted
heaven-high, and fell again.As the
night-shadows gathered, Sidney Ames, racked and exhausted, fell into a
deep sleep.Then Carmen left his bedside and went into the little
parlor, where sat the Beaubien and Father Waite."Here," she said, handing a hypodermic needle and a vial of tablets to
the latter.And now," she continued, "you must
work with me, and stand--firm!Sidney's enemies are those of his own
mental household.We have got to
uproot from his consciousness the thought that alcohol and drugs are a
power.Hatred and self-condemnation, as well as self-love, voiced in a
sense of injury, are other mental enemies that have got to be driven
out, too.It is all mental, every
bit of it!You have got to know that, and stand with me.We are going
to prove the Christ-principle omnipotent with respect to these seeming
things."But," she added, after a moment's pause, "you must not watch this
error so closely that it can't get away.For if
you do, you make a reality of it--and then, well--"

"The case is in your hands, Carmen," said Father Waite gently."We
know that Jesus would cure this boy instantly, if he were here--"

"Well--the Christ _is_ here!""Put
away your 'ifs' and 'buts.'"And these," he said, holding out the
needle and vial, "shall we have further use for them?""It will be given us what we are to do and say," she returned.CHAPTER 9


Four weeks from that crisp morning when Carmen led the bewildered,
stupified lad to her home, she and Sidney sat out upon the little
porch of the cottage, drinking in the glories of the winter sun.January was but half spent, and the lad and girl were making the most
of the sudden thaw before the colder weather which had been predicted
might be upon them.What these intervening weeks had been to Carmen, none might have
guessed as she sat there with the sunlight filtering in streamlets of
gold through her brown hair.But their meaning to the boy might have
been read with ease in the thin, white face, turned so constantly
toward his fair companion.They were deeply, legibly written there,
those black nights, when he would dash out into the hall, determined
to break through the windows of the nearest dram shop and drink,
drink, drink, until the red liquor burst from his eyes, his mouth, his
nostrils!Those ghastly nights, when Carmen would stand before him,
her arms outspread across the door, and beat back the roaring devils
within him!Those long days of agonized desire for the vicious drug
which had sapped his manhood!Those fell hours, when low curses poured
from his burning lips upon her and upon all mankind!Those cold,
freezing sweats, and the dry, cracking fever!Those hours when, with
Carmen always by his side, he tramped mile after mile through drifts
and ice, until he dropped at length from sheer exhaustion, only to
awake, hours later, to find that the girl had brought him home, safe,
unharmed!--

And then, oh, the "Peace, be still!"which he began to hear, faint at
first, but growing in volume, until, at last, it became a mighty,
thunderous command, before which the demons paled and slunk away,
never to return!Oh, the tears of agony that had given way to tears of
joy, of thanksgiving!Oh, the weakness that had been his strength!And, oh, the devotion of this fair girl--aye, and of her associates,
too--but all through her!Had she proved her God before the eyes of
the world?Day after day, clad in the impenetrable armor
of her love, she had stood at this struggling lad's side, meeting the
arrows of death with her shield of truth!Night after night she had
sat by his couch, her hand crushed in his desperate grasp, flouting
the terror that stalked before his delirious gaze!What work she had
done in those long weeks, none would ever know; but the boy himself
knew that he had emerged from the valley of the shadow of death with a
new mind, and that she had walked with him all the dark, cloud-hung
way.As they sat there in the bright sunlight that morning, their thought
was busy with the boy's future.Old plans, old ambitions, had seemed
to lift with the lifting of the mortal curse which had rested upon
him, and upward through the ashes of the past a tender flower of hope
was pushing its way.The last tie which
bound him to his family had been severed by his own father two weeks
before, when the shadow of death fell athwart his mother's brilliant
path.J. Wilton Ames, delicate in health when recalled from
abroad, and still suffering from the fatigue of the deadly social
warfare which had preceded her sudden flight from her husband's
consuming wrath, had failed to rally from the indisposition which
seized her on the night of the grand Ames reception.For days she
slowly faded, and then went quickly down under a sharp, withering
attack of pneumonia.A few brief weeks after the formal opening of the
Ames palace its mistress had sighed away her blasted hopes, her vain
desires, her petty schemes of human conquest and revenge, and had gone
to face anew her problems on another plane of mortal thought.It was
rumored by the servants that, in her last hours, when she heard the
rustle of the death angel's wings beside her, a great terror had
stricken her, and she had called wildly for that son whom she had
never cared to know.It was whispered that she had begged of her
husband to seek the lad and lead him home; that she had pleaded with
him to strive, with the boy, to find the better things of life; that
she had begged him to warn and be warned of her present sufferings, as
she lay there, stripped of every earthly aid, impoverished in heart,
in soul, in mind, with her hands dusty and begrimed with the ashes of
this life's mocking spoils.What truth lay hidden in her mad ravings about the parentage of
Carmen, and her confused, muttered references to Monsignor Lafelle, no
one knew.But of those who stood about her bedside there was none who
could gainsay the awed whisperings of the servants that this haughty
leader of the great city's aristocracy had passed from this life into
the darkness beyond in pitiable misery and terror.The news of his mother's death had come at a time when the boy was
wild with delirium, at an hour when Waite, and Hitt, and Carmen stood
with him in his room and strove to close their ears against the
shrieking of the demon that was tearing him.Hitt at once called up
Willett, and asked for instructions.A few minutes later came the
message that the Ames house was forever barred against the wayward
son.And it was not until this bright winter morning, when the lad
again sat clothed and in his right mind, that Carmen had gently broken
the news to him."I never knew her," the boy had said at length, rousing from his
meditations."Few of the rich people's children know their parents.I
was brought up by nurses and tutors.I never knew what it was to put
my arms around my mother, and kiss her.And often I would plan to surprise her by suddenly running into her
arms and embracing her.But then, when I would see her, she was always
so far away, so cold, so beautifully dressed.And she seldom spoke to
me, or to Kathleen, until we were grown up.And by that time I was
running wild.And then--then--"

"There!"admonished Carmen, reaching over and taking his hand."That's
in our little private cemetery, you know.The old error is dead, and
we are not going to dig it up and rehearse it, are we?""I'm like a little baby," he said sadly."I'm just
beginning to live.And you are my mother, the only one I've ever
known.""Let me be your sister," she said."We are so
near of an age, you know.""You are my angel," he murmured."What have I told you
so often that Jesus said?'Of mine own self I can do nothing.'It was--" her voice sank to a whisper--"it was the
Christ-principle.It worked through him as a channel; and it worked
through me.""You're going to teach me all about that," he said, again pressing her
hand to his lips."You won't cast me adrift yet, will you, little
sister?"Why, you're still mine, you
know!I haven't given you back to yourself yet, have I?But now let's
talk about your work.If you want to write, you are going to, and you
are going to write _right_.""Back to the Express," she said lightly."I haven't written a word for
it now for a month.And how dear, funny old Ned has scolded!""You--you dropped everything--your work--all--for a poor, worthless
hulk like me," he sighed."Sidney dear," the girl replied.Everything I do is '_as unto Him_.'I would have done the same for
anybody, whether I knew the person or not.I saw, not you, but the
human need--oh, such a need!And the Christ-principle made me a human
channel for meeting it, that is all.Drop my work, and my own
interests!Why, Sidney, what is anything compared with meeting human
needs?Didn't Jesus drop everything and hurry out to meet the sick and
the suffering?Was money-making, or society, or personal desire, or
worldly pleasure anything to him when he saw a need?You don't seem to
understand that this is what I am here for--to show what love will
do.""I--I guess I know only the world's idea of love.""And that is love's counterfeit, self-love, sentimentalism,
sex-mesmerism, and all that," she added."But now, back to your work
again.You're going to write, write, write!My, but the world is
hungry for _real_ literature!Your yearning to meet that need is a
sign of your ability to do it.But, remember, everything that comes to
you comes from within.You are, in fact, a miner; and your mine is
your mind; and that is unlimited, for God is the only mind, infinite
and omnipresent.We
never fear a real thing; we fear only our false thoughts of things.Always those thoughts are absolutely wrong, and we wake up and find
that we were fearing only fear-thoughts themselves.Now destroy the chains of fear which limit your thought,
and God will issue!"Well," without waiting for his reply, "now you have reached that
plane of thought where you don't really care for what the world has to
offer you.You have ceased to want to be rich, or famous.You are not
afraid to be obscure and poor.You have learned, at least in part,
that the real business of this life lies in seeking good, in
manifesting and expressing it in every walk, and in reflecting it
constantly to your fellow-men.Having learned that, you are ready to
live.Remember, there is no luck, no such thing as chance.The cause
of everything that can possibly come to you lies within yourself.The thought that you allow to enter
your mentality and become active there, later becomes externalized.Be, oh, so careful, then, about your thought, and the basis upon which
it rests!For, in your writing, you have no right to inflict false
thought upon your credulous fellow-mortals.""But," he replied, "we are told that in literature we must deal with
human realities, and with things as they are.The human mind exists,
and has to be dealt with.""The human mind does not exist, Sidney, except as supposition.The world still awaits the one who will show
it things as they _really_ are.Human realities, so-called, are the
horrible, ghastly unrealities of carnal thought, without any basis of
the divine Christ-principle.I know, we are told that the great books
of the world are those which preserve and interpret its life.is
it true greatness to detail, over and over again in endless recital,
the carnal motives of the human mind, its passions and errors, its
awful mesmerism, its final doom?Yes, perhaps, on one condition: that,
like a true critic, you picture human concepts only to show their
unreality, their nothingness, and to show how they may be overcome.""But most books--"

"Ah, yes, most books are written only to amuse the dispirited human
mind for a brief hour, to make it forget for a moment its troubles.They are literary narcotics; they are sops to jaded appetites, that's
all.A book, for example, that pictures an injured man discovering a
great treasure, and then using it to carry out his schemes of
revenge--well, what influence for good has such a work?It is only a
stimulus to evil, Sidney.But had it shown him using that great wealth
to bless his persecutors and turn them from their mesmerism to real
life and good--"

"Such things don't happen in this world, Carmen.""But they could, and should, Sidney dear.Then will come the new literature, the literature of _good_!And it
will make people think, rather than relieve them from the ennui of
solid thought, as our present novels do.The intellectual palate then
will find only insipidity in such books as pour from our presses now.The ability to converse glibly about authors who wallow in human
unrealities will then no longer be considered the hall-mark of
culture.Culture in that day will be conformity to truth.""Little sister," he said,
"you are a beautiful idealist.""But," came her quick reply, "are you not a living illustration of the
practicability of my idealism, Sidney?"The boy choked, and tears filled his eyes.Carmen stole an arm about
him."The most practical man who ever lived, Sidney dear, was Jesus.He had ideas that differed very
radically from other people's, but he did not hide them for fear of
giving offense.He was not afraid to shock people with the truth about
themselves.He tore down, yes; but he then reconstructed, and on a
foundation of demonstrable truth.He was not afraid to defy the
Rabbis, the learned, and the puffed-up.He did not bow abjectly before
the mandarins and pedagogues.Had he done so, and given the people
what they wanted and were accustomed to, they would have made him a
king--and his mission would have been a dead failure!""And for that they slew him," returned the boy."It is the cowardly fear of slaughter, Sidney, that keeps people from
coming out and standing for what they know to be right to-day.You are
not one of those cravens.""But the people who do that, Carmen, are called demagogues and
muck-rakers!""And the muck-rakers, Sidney, have made a sorry mess,
haven't they?They destroy without ruth, but seldom, if ever, put
forth a sane suggestion for the betterment of conditions.They traffic
in sensationalism, carping criticism, and abuse.'To find fault,' said
Demosthenes, 'is easy, and in every man's power; but to point out the
proper remedy is the proof of a wise counselor.'The remedy which I
point out, Sidney, is the Christ-principle; and all I ask is that
mankind seek to demonstrate it, even as Jesus bade us do.He was a
success, Sidney, the greatest success the world has ever known.Because he followed ideals with utter loyalty--because he voiced
truth without fear--because he made his business the service of
humanity.He took his work seriously, not for money, not for human
preferment, but for mankind.And his work bears the stamp of
eternity.""You're _not_ afraid, Sidney!""Oh, why
does the human mind always look for and expect that which it does not
want to see come or happen!"The boy laughed heartily at the quick sally of her delightfully
quotidian thought."You didn't let me finish," he said."I was going
to say that I'm afraid if I write and speak only of spiritual things I
shall not be understood by the world, nor even given a hearing.""Well, don't use that word 'afraid.'how the human mind clings to
everything, even words, that express its chief bogy, fear."And yet, has anything, written or
spoken, ever endured as his spiritual teachings?The present-day novel
or work of fiction is as fleeting as the human thought it attempts to
crystallize.Of the millions of books published, a handful endure.Those are they which illustrate the triumph of good over evil in human
thought.And the greatest of such books is the Bible.""Well, I'm hunting for a subject now."It will drive you to the task of transcribing it.Sidney--perhaps I can give you the subject!Perhaps I am the channel for this, too!""Well," bending over closer to her,
"what is it, little sister?"The girl looked out over the dripping shrubs and the soft snow.She saw a man, a priest, she knew not
where, but delving, plodding, digging for the truth which the human
mind has buried under centuries and centuries of material _debris_.She saw him, patiently bearing his man-made burden, striving to shield
a tender, abandoned girl, and to transfer to her his own great worldly
knowledge, but without its dross.She saw the mighty sacrifice, when
the man tore her from himself, and thrust her out beyond the awful
danger in which he dwelt.It was love--aye, the love that alone makes men great, the love
that lays down human life in self-immolating service.I will tell
you the whole beautiful story.It is an illustration of the way love
works through human channels.And perhaps--perhaps, some day, the book
may reach him--yes, some day.And it will tell him--oh, Sidney, it
will tell him that I know, and that I love him, love him, love him!"*       *       *       *       *

In the office of the manager of the Express three heads were close
together that morning, and three faces bore outward evidence of the
serious thought within."Miss Wall tells me, Ned," Hitt was saying, "that her father used to
be associated with Ames, and that, at his demise, he left his estate,
badly entangled, for Ames to settle.Now it transpires that Ames has
been cunning enough to permit Miss Wall to draw upon his bank almost
without limit, he making up any deficit with his own personal notes.""I think I see the shadow of his fine hand!""And now," resumed Hitt, "she is given to understand that Ames has
been obliged by the bank examiner to withdraw his personal notes as
security for her deficits, and that the revenue from her estate must
be allowed to accrue to the benefit of the Ames bank until such time
as all obligations are met.""In other words, Elizabeth is simply
cut off!"And now, another thing: Madam Beaubien's lawyer called on
her to-day, and informed her that Hood had gone into court and secured
an injunction, tying up all revenue from her estate until it can be
unraveled."Ames is out to do up
the Express, eh?""There is no doubt of it, Ned," returned Hitt seriously."And to
utterly ruin all connected with it.""Then, by God, we'll fight him to the last ditch!""I think you forget, Ned, that we have a lady with us," nodding toward
Miss Wall, "and that you are seriously trying to reform, for Carmen's
sake.""I beg your pardon, Elizabeth," said Haynerd meekly."I really am
trying to be decent, you know.But when I think of Ames it's like a
red rag to a bull!""Of course," Hitt continued, "oil still flows from our paternal wells.But in order to raise money at once I shall be obliged either to sell
my oil holdings or mortgage them.They have got to take care of us all
now, including Madam Beaubien."There's another anomaly: while Ames is trying to
ruin us, that girl is saving his son."I--I beg your pardon,
Elizabeth.The fact is, either you or I will have to retire from this
meeting, for I'm getting mad.I like to hear your sulphurous
language to-day.It helps to express my own feelings," replied the
woman."The circulation of the Express," Hitt went on, "is entirely
artificial.Our expense is tremendous, and our revenue slight.And
still Carmen insists on branching out and putting into practical form
her big ideas.Limitation is a word that is not in her vocabulary!""Hitt, can't we fight Ames with his own fire?"Ames is very cunning," answered Hitt."When he learned that the
cotton schedule had been altered in the Ways and Means Committee, he
promptly closed down his Avon mills.Then
he resumed, but on half time.I presume
he will later return to full time, but with a reduced scale of wages.This
way: he will force a strike at Avon--a February strike--four thousand
hands out in the cold.Meantime, he'll influence every other spinner
in the country to do likewise.Now, can
Congress stand up against that sort of argument?And, besides, he will
grease the palms of a large number of our dignified statesmen, you may
be sure!"Hitt," said Miss Wall, "I suggest that you send Carmen to Avon at
once.I know of no one who can get to the bottom of things as she can.Let her collect the facts regarding the situation down there, and
then--"

"Send her first to Washington!""Have her hang
around the lobbies of the Capitol for a while, and meet a lot of those
old sap-heads.What information she won't succeed in worming out of
them isn't in 'em, that's all!""But," objected Hitt, "if she knew that we would use her information
for a personal attack upon Ames, she'd leave us.""There's no objection to her getting the facts, anyway, is there?"demanded Haynerd, waxing hot again.I'll put a mortgage on my Ohio holdings at once.""I don't think I would be afraid," suggested Miss Wall."We might not
use the information Carmen may collect in Avon or Washington, but
something, I am sure, is bound to come out of it.Something always
comes out of what she does."All well and good," put in Haynerd."And yet, if she finds anybody
down there who needs help, even the President himself, she'll throw
the Express to the winds, just as she did in Sidney's case."No, that's true, Ned, for while we preach she's off somewhere
practicing.We evolve great truths, and she applies and demonstrates
them.But she has saved Sidney--her Christ did it through her.And she
has given the lad to us, a future valuable man.""Sure--if we are to _have_ any future," growled Ned."See here," retorted Hitt, brindling, "have we in our numerous
gatherings at Madam Beaubien's spoken truth or nonsense?If you
believe our report, then accept and apply it.Now who's to go to Avon
with Carmen?"Why, if those Magyars down there
discovered he was Ames's son, they'd eat him alive!"Then, turning to his
companions:

"Waite says he wants a meeting to-night.He'd like to report on his
research work.No
telling when we may get together again, if the girl--" He became
suddenly silent, and sat some time looking vacantly out through the
window."She goes to Avon to-morrow," he abruptly announced, "alone."His
thought had been dwelling on that'something not ourselves' which he
knew was shielding and sustaining the girl.CHAPTER 10


"We have now arrived at a subject whose interest and significance for
us are incalculable," said Father Waite, standing before the little
group which had assembled in their usual meeting place in the first
hours of the morning, for only at that time could Hitt and Haynerd
leave the Express."We have met to discuss briefly the meaning of that
marvelous record of a whole nation's search for God, the Bible.As
have been men's changing concepts of that'something not ourselves
that makes for righteousness,' so have been individuals, tribes, and
nations.The Bible records the development of these concepts in
Israel's thought; it records the unquenchable longings of that people
for truth; it records their prophetic vision, their sacred songs,
their philosophy, their dreams, and their aspirations.To most of us
the Bible has long been a work of profound mystery, cryptical,
undecipherable.And largely, I now believe, because we were wont to
approach it with the bias of preconceived theories of literal, even
verbal, inspiration, and because we could not read into it the record
of Israel's changing idea of God, from a wrathful, consuming Lord of
human caprice and passions, to the infinite Father of love, whom Jesus
revealed as the Christ-principle, which worked through him and through
all who are gaining the true spiritual concept, as is this girl who
sits here on my right with the lad whom you have seen rescued by the
Christ from the pit of hell."His voice choked when he referred to Carmen and Sidney.But he quickly
stifled his emotion, and went on:

"In our last meeting Mr.Hitt clearly showed us how the so-called
human mind has seemed to develop as the suppositional opposite of the
mind that is God; and how through countless ages of human reckoning
that pseudo-mind has been revealing its various types, until at
length, rising ever higher in the scale of being, it revealed its
human man as a mentality whose consciousness is the suppositional
activity of false thought, and which builds, incessantly, mental
concepts out of this kind of thought and posits them within itself as
material objects, as its own body, its universe, its all.And he
showed us how, little by little, that human mind's interpretations of
the infinite mind's true ideas became better, under the divine
infiltration of truth, until at last there developed a type, now known
to us as the Jewish nation, which caught a clearer glimpse of truth,
and became conscious of that'something not ourselves' which makes
for right-thinking, and consequent correct mental concepts and
externalizations.This, then, was the starting point of our religion.These first glimpses of truth, and their interpretations, as set forth
in the writings of the early Jewish nation, constitute the nucleus of
our Bible."But were these records exact statements of truth?The
primitive human mind could only lisp its wonderful glimpses of truth
in legend and myth.And so in fable and allegory the early Israelites
sought to show the power of good over evil, and thereby stimulate a
desire for right conduct, based, of course, on right-thinking.And
thus it is that the most significant thing in their sacred records is
their many, many stories of the triumph of the spiritual over the
material.Their right-thinking
became externalized outwardly in material abundance and physical
comfort.But the people's understanding was not sufficiently great to
shield them from the temptation which material wealth and power always
constitute.The mist of
materialism spread over it.Those wonderful flashes of truth ceased to
dart across their mental horizon.Their god became a magnified concept
of the human man, who dickered with them over the construction of his
temples, and who, by covenants, bribes, and promises, induced them to
behave themselves.And at length the beautiful vision
faded quite away."Then followed four hundred human years, during which the vicissitudes
of the Hebrew nation were many and dark.But during those long
centuries there developed that world wonder, a whole nation's united
longing for a deliverer!The prophets promised a great change in their
fallen fortunes.Though
their concept of Him had grossly degenerated, yet the deliverer would
come, he _must_!In the depths of their night--in the midst of the
heaviest darkness that ever lay over the world--there arose a great
light.Through the densest ignorance of the human mind filtered the
Christ-principle, and was set forth by the channel through which it
came, the man Jesus.Had there been a conference among God, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, to debate the sending of salvation to mankind, as
recorded by the poet Milton?what a crude, materialistic
conception.Had God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son?But God _is_ Love, infinite, unchanging.And His unique Son, the
Christ-principle, available to all mankind, was 'before Abraham.'Had
a great, dimly perceived principle been demonstrated, namely, that,
if we yearn long and earnestly for the right, it comes?Had the Jewish
nation 'demonstrated' the Christ?Had their centuries of looking and
expecting resulted in a saviour being manifested to them?It was a
period in the unfolding of human thought when civilization had reached
its lowest depths.Morality had evaporated to the dregs.Rome was
become the world's harlot.A few years more, and Nero would drag his
vulpine immorality across the stage.Paganism was virtue in comparison
with the lust of men in that dark hour.And yet, in the very midst of
it, appeared the most venerated, the most beloved man in all history,
bearing the Christ-message like a flaming torch!"'Always our being is descending into us,' said Emerson.But our true
being can be none other than infinite mind's idea of itself.Our true
individuality must be the way that mind regards us.And thus it was
that Israel's true being descended, filtering in through the thick
mists of error.That true being was the deliverer, _par excellence_,
for it was the message of truth that bade men deny themselves, their
carnal selves, and know but the one God, infinite mind.That was the
grace sufficient for them, that would have solved their problems, that
would have enabled them to lay off the 'old man' and his woes and
afflictions, and put on the 'new man,' divine mind's image.But the
carnal mind sought a material kingdom.It wanted, not spirit, but
matter.It cruelly rejected the message-bearer, and sought to kill his
message by slaying him on the cross.And thereby the Jewish nation
rent itself asunder, and sank into carnal oblivion.Ah, how they have
been cursed by the crucifixion of Jesus!"Men ask to-day: Did Jesus really live?Or is he a mythical character,
like the gods of pagan Rome?Let us ask, in making our reply, how
truth comes to mankind?Then the great sayings attributed to Jesus at least came from a human
being.Let us go further: it is the common history of mankind that
truth comes to the human mind only after a period of preparation.Not
conscious preparation, necessarily, but, rather, a preparation forced
by events.The truth of a mathematical principle can not come to me
unless I am prepared to receive it.And the greatest good comes to men
only after they have learned the nothingness of the material ambitions
and aims which they have been pursuing.By its own rottenness the
world had been made fallow for truth.The awfulness of its own
exposure in its rampant, unlicensed revels, had shown as never before
the human mind's absolute nothingness--its nothingness as regards real
value, permanence, and genuine good--in that first century of our
so-called Christian era.And when the nothingness of the carnal mind
was made plain, men saw the reality of the truth, as revealed in the
Christ, back of it all.The divine message was whispered to a human
mentality.And that mentality expanded under the God-influence, until
at last it gave to the sin-weary world the Christ-principle of
salvation.Let us call that human mentality, for convenience, the man
Jesus."And now, was he born of a virgin?It
was common enough in his day for virgins to pretend to be with child
by the Holy Ghost; and so we do not criticise those who refuse to
accept the dogma of the virgin birth.But a little reflection in the
light of what we have been discussing throws a wonderful illumination
upon the question.If matter and material modes are real, then we must
at once relegate the stories of the virgin birth, the miracles, the
resurrection, and the ascension to the realm of myth.If the so-called
laws of matter are real, irrefragable laws, then we indulgently, pass
by these stories as figments of heated imaginations.But, regarding
matter as a human, mortal concept, entirely mental, and wholly subject
to the impress and influence of mind, and knowing, as we do now, that
_mental concepts change with changed thought_, we are forced to look
with more favor upon these questions which for centuries caused men to
shed their fellows' blood.Hitt pointed out in our last meeting that mortal beings are
interpretations in mortal or human mind of the infinite mind, God, and
its ideas.The most perfect human interpretation of God's greatest
idea, Man, was Christ Jesus.The _real_ selfhood of every one of us is
God's idea of us.The world calls it the
'soul,' the 'divine essence,' and the 'immortal spark.'The Christ was
the real, spiritual selfhood of the man Jesus.So the Christ is the
real selfhood of each of us.It is not
conceived and brought forth in conformity with human modes.Now was
this great fact externalized in the immaculate conception and birth?It does not grow and decay and pass away in death.It is the 'unique'
Son of God which is back of each one of us.But the world has seen it
only once in its fullness, and then through the man Jesus."Something happened in that first century of the so-called Christian
era--something of tremendous significance.It was the
birth of the Christ-idea into the human consciousness.Was the
Christ-idea virgin-born?Aye, that it was, for God, infinite Mind,
alone was its origin and parent.The speculation which has turned
about that wonderful first century event has dealt with the human
channel through which the Christ-idea flowed to mankind.But let us
see what light our deductions throw even upon that."Referring all things to the realm of the mental, where we now
know they belong, we see that man never fell, but that Israel's idea
of God and man did fall, woefully.We see that the Christ-principle
appeared among men; we see that to-day it works marvels; we must
admit that throughout the ages before Jesus it had done so; we
know now that the great things which Israel is recorded to have
done were accomplished by the Christ-principle working through
men, and that when their vision became obscured they lost the
knowledge of that principle and how to use it.History records the
working of great deeds by that same Christ-principle when it was
re-born in our first century; and we also can see how the obscuring
of the spiritual by the material in the Emperor Constantine's time
caused the loss of the Church's power to do great works.We are
forced to admit the omnipotence, immanence, and eternality of the
Christ-principle, for it is divine mind, God himself.Moses, Elisha,
Elijah, the ancient prophets, all had primitive perceptions of truth,
and all became channels for the passing of the Christ-principle to
mankind in some degree.But none of these men ever illustrated that
principle as did the man Jesus.He is the most marvelous manifestation
of God that has ever appeared among mankind; so true and exact was
the manifestation that he could tell the world that in seeing him
they were actually seeing the Father.It is quite true that many
of his great sayings were not original with him.Great truths have
been voiced, even by so-called pagans, from earliest times.But he
demonstrated and made practical the truth in these sayings.And he
exposed the nothingness of the human mental concept of matter by
healing disease, walking the waves, and in other wonderful ways.It
is true that long before his time Greek philosophers had hit upon the
theory of the nothingness of matter.Plato had said that only ideas
were real.But Jesus--or the one who brought the Christ-message--was
the clearest mentality, the cleanest human window-pane, to quote
Carmen, that ever existed.Through him the divine mind showed with
almost unobscured fullness.God's existence had been discerned and
His goodness proved from time to time by prophets and patriarchs, but
by no means to the extent that Jesus proved it.There were those
before him who had asserted that there was but one reality, and that
human consciousness was not the real self.There were even those who
believed matter to be created by the force of thought, even as in
our own day._But it remained for Jesus to make those ideas
intensely practical, even to the overcoming and dissolution of his
whole material concept of the universe and man._ And it remained
for him to show that the origin of evil is in the lie about God.It
was his mission to show that the devil was 'a man-killer from the
beginning,' because it is the supposition that there is power apart
from God.It was his life purpose to show mankind that there is
nothing in this lie to cause fear, and that it can be overcome by
overcoming the false thought which produces it.By overcoming that
thought he showed men the evanescent nature of sickness and death.And sin he showed to be a missing of the mark through lack of
understanding of what constitutes real good."Turn now again to the Bible, that fascinating record of a whole
people's search for God and their changing concept of Him.Note that,
wherever in its records evil seems to be made real, it is for the
purpose of uncovering and destroying it by the vigorous statements of
truth which you will almost invariably find standing near the
exposition of error.So evil seemed very real in the first century of
our era; but it was uncovered by the coming of Jesus.The exposure of
evil revealed the Christ, right at hand.""But," protested Haynerd, "let's get back to the question of the
virgin birth.""But let us first consider what
human birth is.""Now you are touching my lifelong
question.If I am immortal, where was I before I was born?""Of which 'I' are you speaking, Ned?""The real
'I' is God's image and likeness, His reflection.It was never born,
and never dies.And therefore it will
cease to be.The human mind makes its own laws, and calls them laws of
nature, or even God's laws.Because
God is both Father and Mother to His children, His ideas, the human
mind has decreed in its counterfeiting process that it is itself both
male and female, and that the union of these two is necessary in order
to give rise to another human mind.Do you see how it imitates the
divine in an apish sort of way?And so elements of each sex-type of
the human mind are employed in the formation of another, their
offspring.The process is wholly mental, and is one of human belief,
quite apart from the usage of the divine Mind, who'spake and it was
done,' mentally unfolding a spiritual creation.The real 'you,' Ned,
has always existed as God's idea of Himself.It will come to light as the material 'you' is put off.The
material 'you' did not exist before it was humanly born.It was
produced in supposition by the union of the parent human minds, which
themselves were reflections of the male and female characteristics of
the communal mortal mind.It thus had a definite, supposititious
beginning."And so I'm doomed to annihilation, eh?"Your mortal sense of existence, Ned, certainly is doomed to
extinction.Oh, it doubtless
will not all be destroyed when you pass through that change which we
call death.It may linger until you have passed through many such
experiences.And so it behooves you to set about getting rid of it
as soon as possible, and thus avoid the unpleasant experience of
countless death-throes.You see, Ned, an error in the premise will
appear in the conclusion.Now you are starting with the premise that
the human 'you' is real.All that you reflect of divine mind will
endure permanently, but whatever you reflect of the lie regarding
that mind will pass away.Human beings know nothing of their origin,
nor of their existence._Because there is nothing to know
about them; they are entirely supposititious!_ Paul says, in his
letter to the Romans: 'They which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God.'The birth of the children of the
flesh is wholly a human-mind process.The infant mentality thus
produced knows nothing whatsoever of itself.It has no knowledge; is
not founded on truth.It will later manifest hereditary beliefs,
showing the results of prenatal mesmerism.Then it will receive the
general assortment of human thought and opinion--very little of it
based on actual truth--which the world calls education.Then it
learns to regard itself as an individual, a separate being.And soon
it attributes its origin to God.But the prenatal error will appear
in the result.The being manifests every gradation of human thought;
it grows; it suffers and enjoys materially; it bases its very
existence upon matter; it manifests the false activity of human
thought in material consciousness; and then it externalizes its
beliefs, the consentaneous human beliefs, upon its body and in its
environment; and finally, the activity of the false thought which
constitutes its consciousness ceases--and the being dies.Yes, its
death will be due to sin, to '_hamartio_,' missing the mark.And that, Ned, is human life, so-called."Death is not in any sense a cessation of life.The being who dies
never knew what it was to live.Death is the externalization of
human, mortal beliefs, which are not based upon real knowledge, truth.Paul said: 'They that are after
the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit the things of the spirit.'In other words, mankind are striving
terribly, desperately, to keep alive a sense of material, fleshly
existence.They are foredoomed to failure,
despite the discovery of antitoxins.In the book of Job we read: 'The
spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life.'Where, then, is the reality in prenatal mesmerism and the
drag of heredity?It is all supposition, all a part of the one lie,
the'man-killer.'"The change called death comes to all mortals.It is the culmination
of the human mind's sense of limitation.It does not usher them into
immortal, illimitable bliss.It but leaves them upon another seeming
plane of mortal thought, there to drag out another sense of existence,
unless they have so learned the lesson which Jesus taught as to enable
them to overcome death.Why, then, do we waste our time
in trivial things; in the heaping up of useless money; in the vain
strife for sensual pleasures?The mortal will live and die, and live
and die, until at last he is beaten into line and forced to
demonstrate the Christ-principle.Hadn't we better begin that right
here and now?Wishing to die doesn't solve our problems.Suicide only
makes us start again, worse off than before.We shall overcome death
when we have overcome sin, for the physical manifestation called death
is but the externalization in conscious experience of spiritual
death--lack of a demonstrable understanding of Life, Truth, Spirit,
which is God, unlimited good.""And the Church, Protestant and Catholic, with their ceremonies, their
Masses, and--"

"They have woefully missed the mark, Ned.But I see protest rising in our good friends, Doctor Siler and
Reverend Moore, so I will hasten on, for we have much ground still to
cover."Now, knowing that birth is a humanly mental process, is it possible
that the man Jesus was 'born of a virgin'?Quite so; but, more, _no
man ever conceived and born in the way human beings are generated has
ever begun to approach Jesus in degree of spirituality_.If he had
been born in human ways, is it likely that he would ever have
developed such intense spirituality?Well, not in a brief thirty-three
years or so!And, on the other hand, if he had come into the world in
some way other than by being born of a woman, would he have been
understandable at all to the human mind?He would have
been wholly in the realm of the mental, far above human perception.If
he had been conceived by the union of the two sexes, as is the
mortal-mind mode of generation, would he not have been too material to
have so quickly developed that spirituality which made him the light
of the world at the age of thirty-three?The theory of the virgin birth at least seems to meet the
need of a sort of middle course, whereby the man should not be too
human to be the channel for the great measure of spirituality with
which he was endowed, and yet should be human enough to be appreciable
to other human minds."Remember, the Jesus who has been reported to us must have regarded
matter as unreal, as nothingness.And
they as plainly show that he came from the Father.His whole life was
such as to render the virgin birth almost a necessity, as I see it.And from a study of the Gospels I
simply can not avoid the conclusion that his knowledge of the allness
of God rendered matter such a nonentity to him that he overcame all
material laws, overcame the world of matter, and even at the last
dematerialized his material body.It's an astonishing thought--and
yet, who can show that it is not true?There are some things that
reason insists on our accepting, despite the paucity of human
records."Waite," said Doctor Morton, "that the Gospels
according to Mark and John make no mention of the virgin birth."And I will go further: Biblical
research during the past few years seems to have established the
conclusion that Mark's Gospel antedates the others, but that prior to
it there existed a collection of sayings by Jesus, called the _Logia_.This collection of sayings seems to have been originally written in
Aramaic, the language Jesus spoke.Now Matthew Arnold tells us that
the Gospel narratives passed through at least fifty years of oral
tradition before they became fixed in the form in which we now have
them.Of course it is quite possible that the story of the virgin
birth arose during those fifty years, for we can imagine how the life
of Jesus was then discussed!Matthew and Luke alone speak of the
virgin birth.Mark's Gospel we believe to have been written by Mark
himself.And we believe that Papias, who wrote about the middle of the
second century, spoke truly when he said: 'Mark having become (or
having been) Peter's interpreter, wrote all that he remembered (or all
that Peter related) though he did not (record) in order that which
was said or done by Christ.'In other words, even as Renan admits,
the Gospel of Mark must be taken as authentically his.Now Matthew's
Gospel depends for most of its data upon Mark and the Collection of
sayings.Mark's Gospel does not mention the virgin birth; the
Collection probably did.Also, Matthew probably did not write the
Gospel attributed to him; but he almost certainly did write the
Collection of sayings, from which in part the present Gospel according
to Matthew was compiled.Luke's Gospel was undoubtedly written by the
physician Luke, Paul's companion, and depended largely for its data
upon Mark's Gospel and the Collection of Matthew.Yet we can not say
that the omission of mention in the Gospels according to Mark and John
of the virgin birth renders the story a legend, in view of our own
present great knowledge of the constitution of matter, of material
laws, and of the fact that the virgin birth is at least rendered
credible by the subsequent very extraordinary career of Jesus.Moreover, remember that our New Testament is a small book, and that it
is quite probable that a great mass of literature existed on the
subject of Jesus and his work, and that it is possible that other of
the disciples wrote treatises, perhaps many of them.How many of these
touched on the subject of the virgin birth we may never know.But this conclusion at least we must accept: the
validity of the story of the virgin birth does _not_ rest with the
four Gospels which have come down to us out of the great mass of
literature which probably once existed.Rather is the probability of
the immaculate conception a function of our present knowledge of
matter, its pseudo-laws, and the great fact that the entire life of
Jesus as reported in all the Gospels lends weight to the belief that
his birth was not in the ordinary mortal-mind manner.""And I," said Carmen, "can not see that the origin of the human
channel through which the Christ-principle flowed to mankind is of any
consequence.Jesus said that it
existed before Abraham."It has been said that the
immaculate conception was the result of Mary's realization that real
man is the son of God.Certainly Jesus
did seem to manifest some such metaphysical idea.Perhaps Mary was a
woman of tremendous force of character.Perhaps it did come to her
that her son should be the Messiah of his race.Jesus certainly did
acquire the messianic consciousness--and thereby upheaved the world.But, whatever the human mode of birth, certainly the Christ-principle
was brought into the world because of the world's tremendous need.It is only the confusing of the Christ with the
man Jesus that is so largely responsible for the weakness of orthodox
theology."But now, referring again to the Bible, let me say that the Pentateuch
is composed of a variety of documents written by various authors.We
have no positive proof that Moses had aught to do with its authorship,
although parts of it may be based on data which either he originated
or sanctioned.The books of Samuel exhibit a plurality of sources.The
book of Isaiah was written to record the sayings of at least two
persons, both men of marvelous spiritual vision.The Song of Solomon
was originally probably a Persian love-poem.The book of Job
illustrates the human-mind problem of suffering, and the utter
inadequacy of philosophy to heal it.It is a ringing protest against
conventional theology."But it is with the New Testament that we are particularly concerned,
for we believe it to contain the method of salvation from human ills.None of the original documents are extant, of course.And yet, the
most searching textual criticism goes to show that the New Testament
books as we have them to-day are genuine reproductions of the original
documents, with but very little adulteration of erroneous addition by
later hands.I have already spoken of the first
three Gospels.The book of Acts certainly was written by the author of
the third Gospel, Luke.First Peter was composed by the disciple
Peter, or was written under his sanction.The Gospel of John and the
book of First John were written by one and the same author--but
whether by the disciple John or not, I can not say.If this great
disciple did not write the Fourth Gospel, at least his influence seems
to be felt all through it.The probability is that he knew what was in
it, and approved of it, although the actual composition may have been
by another, possibly a very learned Greek.To me, the Fourth Gospel is
the most masterly work ever composed by man.The criticism that John, being a Jew, could not have composed
it, falls before the greater truth that, having become a Christian, he
was no longer a Jew.For how could he have been
other, seeing that he had lived with Jesus?"And now as to Paul, who contributes about one-third of the New
Testament.I have mentioned the letters to the Thessalonians,
Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans as indisputably his.To these we
can add, with scarcely less weight of authenticity, Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.As to the Epistles to Timothy
and Titus, there is still doubt.These letters were written to the
various Churches chronologically, as I have mentioned them.It has
been said that Jesus was way over the heads of his reporters.But--and
here is the important fact for us--Paul's letters exhibit a
marvelous spiritual growth in the man, and show him at last to be the
grand master-metaphysician of the Christian era.Has it ever
occurred to you that what the Gospels tell about is almost wholly
spiritual?The material is all but neglected by their composers.Indeed, with the questions of time and place, the Gospel narrators
seemed to have been but slightly concerned.But with the delineation
of the Christ--ah!In the light of
this great truth the apparent lack of harmony in the Gospel
narratives loses significance.And how little there is in the
Gospels of theology, of institution, of organization!How trifling are
creed and doctrine, how little are Catholicism and Protestantism,
compared with the stupendous fact that God is, and that His truth,
the Christ-principle, is still here to-day and available!"And so with Paul, he was expounding the'method and secret' of the
Christ.And he first had to work up to it himself.He may have
thought, when he wrote his first letter to the Thessalonians, that the
man Jesus would come again in the skies, with great pomp and
surrounded by the Saints.But in his second letter he states plainly
that the Christ will come when the 'old man' is laid off.Not much
occasion for misunderstanding there, I think.Indeed, after Jesus so
clearly stated that the kingdom of heaven was within men, the marvel
is that there could have arisen any confusion whatsoever on the
subject of the second coming of the Christ.""I believe," interposed Reverend Moore, "that the Epistle to the
Hebrews contains statements of belief in a judgment after death, in a
heaven, a hell, and everlasting life, not wholly consistent with your
remarks.""The Epistle to the Hebrews," returned Father Waite, "was not written
by Paul, nor is it quite consistent with his letters.But, read Paul's
wonderful eighth chapter of Romans.Read his third chapter of First
Corinthians.Read all his letters in the order in which I have
mentioned them, which was as they were written, and you can not fail
to grasp his marvelous expanding perception of the Christ-principle;
the nothingness of the material concept; the impotence of the lie that
opposes God, and constitutes all evil; and the necessity of
right-thinking if one would work out his salvation from the errors
that assail mankind.Paul shows that he passed through a 'belief
period,' and that he emerged into the light of demonstrable
understanding at last.If men had followed him they never could have
fallen into the absurd theological beliefs of foreordination, infant
damnation, the resurrection of the flesh, and all the other
theological horrors and atrocities of the centuries."Yes, the Bible is, as Arnold said, based on propositions which all
can verify.The trouble is, _mankind have not tried to verify them_!They have relegated all that to the life beyond the grave.I fear a
sorry disappointment awaits them, for, even as Paul says, they will be
after the change called death only what they were before.It is like
recovering from a case of sickness, for sickness and death are alike
manifestations of mortal thought.We awake from each still human,
still with our problems before us.We must break the mesmerism of the
belief that the practical application of Jesus' teachings must be
relegated to the realm of death, or to the unattainable.We must apply
the Christ-principle, and learn to hit the mark, for sin is always
weakness, never strength."And remember this: having acquired a knowledge of the Christ, we are
bidden to acknowledge him--that is, to _act-our-knowledge_.Many of
the world's philosophers have worked out great truths.But they have
rested content with that.Many scientists, knowing that matter is
unreal, nevertheless conduct themselves _as if it constituted the one
and only real fact of existence_!Then its
opposite _can not_ be real.The human mentality holds the belief that
there is something apart from God, spirit.Mary moved to the garden.That belief becomes
objectified in the human mentality as matter.And within matter is
contained all evil of every sort and name.Evil is not, as the
philosophers would have us believe, a lower form of good.It is not
'good in the making.'It is always error, the direct opposite of
truth.And if truth is real and eternal, error can not be.See the
grave mistake in which Emerson became enmeshed.He said: 'There seems
to be a necessity in spirit to manifest itself in material forms.'Now
follow that out to its logical conclusion.If spirit is synonymous
with God, then God manifests Himself in both good and evil, fair and
foul, life and death--and which is good, and which bad?No, my friends, rather accept Jesus' statement
that evil is the lie, of which no man need be afraid, and which all
must and shall overcome.And the 'old man,' with all his material
concepts of nature and the universe, must and will be laid off, thus
revealing the spiritual man, the image and likeness of the one divine
Mind."Now, just a few words about miracles, the great stumbling block to
the acceptance of the Gospels.Are they, together with the entire
Gospel narrative, legendary?If so, they must have arisen during
those fifty years between Jesus and the recording of the narratives.But this very period is covered by Paul's letters, which record his
thought.And even the most relentless of Bible critics admit the
genuineness of Paul's authorship of the Epistles to the Romans,
the Corinthians, the Thessalonians, and the Galatians.If the
Gospel narratives are legends, they grew up and found acceptance in
fifty years.A pretty fair miracle in itself, when we take into
consideration the inherent incredulity of the human mind!As Dean
Farrar says: 'Who would have _invented_, who would have merely
_imagined_, things so unlike the thoughts of man as these?'"Now Paul must have been acquainted with men who had seen and known
Jesus.And we are forced to admit that Paul was a very strong, sane
man.These legends could not have grown up in his day and been
accepted by him.And as long as there were men living who had known
Jesus--and that must have been as late as the last quarter of the
first century--the true events of Jesus' life could hardly have given
way to a set of childish legends.As a matter of recorded fact, the
various Christian Churches had accepted Jesus within thirty years of
the crucifixion.And, too, the words of Paul and the Synoptists were
written at a time when the sick were still being healed and even the
dead raised by the practical application of Jesus' teachings.Hence,
miracles did not astonish them."Our own inability to perform the works attributed to Jesus is hardly
sufficient ground for denying the belief that he really did them.Certainly that the greater portion of the New
Testament was written by a few fishermen, a publican, and a tentmaker
is one of the most stupendous miracles on record!And the miracle of
miracles is Jesus Christ himself!Because Jesus is reported to have
healed the sick, raised the dead, and walked the waves, all in
opposition to material laws--the so-called laws of nature--the world
says the reports are fantastic, that they are fables, and that his
reporters were hypnotized, deluded!And yet I tell you that he did not
break a single law!He did act in defiance of the so-called testimony
of the physical senses, which has always been accepted by mankind as
law.We now know what that sense-testimony is--human, mortal thought.And because he did so,
he instantaneously healed the sick.A miracle expresses, not the
beliefs of the human mind, but the law of God, infinite mind, and
makes that law conceivable to the human mentality.God's laws are
_never_ set aside, for by very definition a law is immutable, else it
ceases to be law.But when the human mind grows out of itself
sufficiently to perceive those laws and to express them to its
fellow-minds, the result is called a miracle.Moreover, the ability to
perform miracles is but a function of spirituality.A miracle is a
sign of one's having advanced to such a degree of spirituality as to
enable him to rise above material consciousness and its limitations,
which are called laws.The consciousness that knows no evil will
perform miracles.These works
were the'signs following,' and attested their knowledge of the
allness of God.Carmen--"

"Lewis!"Carmen _knew_ that no power opposed to God
could hold Sidney.She broke a human-mind, so-called law, a limitation.She
proved God's law of harmony and holiness--wholeness--to be omnipresent
and omnipotent.And, mark me, friends, _every one of us must learn to
do likewise_!Not only must the Church obey Jesus and do the works
which he did, but every individual will have to do them himself.""His works were done for a special reason, Mr.Waite," interposed
Reverend Moore."They were to testify to his messiahship.Father Waite silently regarded the minister for some moments.Then he
went on gently:

"It seems incredible that the plain teachings of Jesus could have
been so warped and twisted as they have been by orthodox theology.Why should even the preachers themselves
condemn the one who seeks to obey Christ?Moore, the real man
is God's highest idea of Himself.The human mind makes mental concepts
of God's man.And Jesus was the grandest concept of God's idea of
Himself that the human mind has ever constructed by means of its
interpretations.One of his grandest
characteristics was his implicit obedience to his vision of the
Father.And he demanded just as implicit obedience from us.But he
bade us, again and again, _heal the sick and raise the dead_!"And Asa had his physicians to whom he turned--with the result
that he'slept with his fathers.'There is no more ironical statement
in the whole Bible than that.We turn to our physicians because we
have no faith in God._Materia medica_ physicians do _not_ heal the
sick.They sometimes succeed in causing the human mind temporarily to
substitute a belief of health for a belief of disease that is all.But Jesus and the early Christians healed by true prayer--the prayer
of affirmation, the prayer that denied reality to evil, and affirmed
the omnipotence of God.And that was done through an understanding of
God as immutable law, or principle."demanded Reverend Moore, with a note
of contempt in his voice."I prefer my own concept of God, as one who
hears our petitions, and pities us, and not as a lifeless principle!"Moore," replied Father Waite, "in that He is
'_that by which all is_.'And in order to be such He must be, as the
Bible says, 'the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.'He must be
immovable, regardless of human pleading and petition.And so true
prayer, the prayer that draws an answer, is not an objective appeal to
Him, but is an intelligent application of the Christ-principle to all
our problems and needs.Such prayer will remove mountains in
proportion to the understanding and motive back of it.And such prayer
does not seek to inform the Almighty of the state of affairs here
among men, informing Him that evil is real and rampant, and begging
that He will stoop down and remove it.It is the prayer that manifests
man's oneness with the infinite mind as its image, reflecting a
knowledge of the allness of good and the consequent unreality and
powerlessness of evil, the lie about it.It was healing by such
prayer, Mr.Moore, that the Episcopal Synod rejected only recently.Instead of doing the healing themselves by means of the principle
given them, they still plead with God, the immovable and immutable, to
do it for them, provided the very uncertain science of _materia
medica_ fails."The true method of prayer was employed by the early Christians, until
the splendid vision of the Christ became obscured and finally lost to
the Church by its bargaining with Constantine for a mess of pottage,
namely, temporal power.Then began to rise that great worldly
institution, the so-called Holy Church.In the first half of the sixth
century Justinian closed the schools of philosophy at Athens.For a
while Judaizing Christianity continued its conflict with Gnosticism.And then both merged themselves into the Catholic form of faith, which
issued forth from Rome, with Christian tradition grafted upon
paganism.Theology and ritualism divided the gospel of healing the
sick and saving the sinner into two radically different systems,
neither of which is Christian, and neither of which can either heal or
save.Since then, lip-service and ceremonial have taken the place of
healing the sick and raising the dead.The world again slipped back
steadily from the spiritual to the material, and to-day ethics
constitutes our religion, and stupid drugs hold sway where once sat
enthroned the healing Christ-principle."Waite, that I have Catholic leanings myself,"
said Doctor Siler."I don't like to hear either my religion or my
profession abused.""My criticism, Doctor," replied Father Waite, "is but an exposure of
the entrenched beliefs and modes of the human mind.""But, sir, the Church is a great social force, and a present
necessity.""The worth of a belief as a social force, Doctor, must be ascertained
from its fruits.The Roman Church has been an age-long instigator of
wars, disorders, and atrocious persecutions throughout the world.Its
assumption that its creed is the only religious truth is an insult to
the world's expanding intelligence.Its arrogant claim to speak with
the authority of God is one of the anomalies of this century of
enlightenment.Its mesmeric influence upon the poor and ignorant is a
continuous tragedy."Are you unmindful of the Church's schools and
hospitals?"Nor am I ignorant of the fact that the success of
Christianity is _not_ measured by hospitals.Rather, their continuance
attests the lamentable failure of its orthodox misinterpretation.I do not want to see this splendid country
forced into the iron shackles of priestcraft."cried Haynerd, pounding the table with his
fist."The time has passed when a man can say, 'My church, be she
right or wrong, but my church!'and insist that it shall be forced
upon us, whether we like it or not!""Doctor," continued Father Waite, "the Romanist has always missed the
mark.He prayed to a God of love to give him power to exterminate
heretics--those who differed with him in belief.But he prayed with
iniquity, hatred, murder in his heart; and God, who is too pure to
know evil, heard him not.Prayer is the affirmation of omnipotent
_good_.Is it good to murder one's fellow-men?The Psalmist wrote: 'If
I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.'That is why
the Church's prayers and curses have failed, and why she herself is a
failing institution to-day.I say this in pity, not in malice.""I, sir, believe in a religion that can hate," returned the doctor."Christianity is as much a religion of hate as of love--hatred of all
that is evil and opposed to the revealed Word of God.""And thereby your religion will fail, and has failed, for God is love.You, by your hatred of what you consider evil, make evil real.Indeed,
the Church has always emphasized evil as a great and living reality.How could it ever hope to overcome it then?Your Church, Doctor, has
little of the meekness of the Christ, and so, little of his strength.Its numbers and great material
wealth do not constitute power.Its assumptions remind me of the
ancient Jews, who declared that God spent much of His time reading
their Talmud.You will have to lay aside, Doctor, all of it, and turn
to the simple, demonstrable teachings of Jesus.When you have learned
to do the works he did, then will you have justified yourself and your
faith."While Father Waite was speaking, Carmen had quietly risen and taken
her place at the piano.When he concluded, she began to play and sing
softly.As the sweet melody flowed out through the room the little
group became silent and thoughtful.Again it was that same weird
lament which the girl had sung long before in the Elwin school to
voice the emotions which surged up in her during her loneliness in the
great city.In it her auditors heard again that night the echoing
sighs of the passive Indians, enslaved by the Christian Spaniards.Hitt's head sank upon his breast as he listened.Haynerd tried to
speak, but choked.The Beaubien buried her face in her hands and wept
softly.The lines about Doctor Siler's mouth relaxed, and his lips
trembled.He rose quietly and went around to where Father Waite sat."My friend--" He bent and took Father Waite's hand.Father Waite sprang to his feet and threw an arm about the doctor."We
are more than that, Doctor," he whispered.And in
reality we are both, here and now, beloved children of God."Then he nodded to the others, and took his
departure.As he passed the piano Carmen rose and seized his hand."You know, Doctor, that we love you, don't you?""Your love," he murmured, as he bent over her hand, "is from the
Christ.Nay, it _is_ the Christ himself among us!"He would have said more, but his voice broke.When Hitt, Reverend Moore, and Doctor Morton had left, Haynerd, who
had remained for a moment to speak to Father Waite, turned to the
Beaubien."Madam," he said, "Mr.But--" He stopped and looked at Carmen."Well,
if I mistake not, his quietness this evening indicated his belief that
this might be our last meeting for some time."Then, abruptly:

"Telephone me, Carmen, if anything of interest comes up to-morrow in
Avon."The Beaubien turned quickly to the girl."You are going to Avon
to-morrow?There was a look of fear in her
eyes.Carmen drew the woman to her, then stooped and kissed her cheek."Mother dearest, I go to Avon with my God."CHAPTER 11


The town of Avon, two hours from New York, lay along Avon creek, from
which its first manufacturing industries derived their motive power.Years before, when it was little more than a barren stretch of sand,
some enterprising soul had built a cotton mill there, with only a few
primitive looms.As the years passed, and kindly Congresses reared
about the industry a high protective wall, the business prospered
marvelously.But shortly after the death of the senior Ames the
company became involved, through mismanagement, with the result that,
to protect itself, the house of Ames and Company, the largest
creditor, was obliged to take over its mills.At first, J. Wilton Ames was disposed to sell the assets of the
defunct company, despite the loss to his bank.But then, after a visit
of inspection, and hours of meditation on certain ideas which had
occurred to him, he decided to keep the property.The banging of the
looms, the whirr of the pickers, the sharp little shrieks of the
spinning machines, fascinated him, as he stood before them.They
seemed to typify the ceaseless throbbing of his own great brain.They
seemed, too, to afford another outlet for that mighty flood of
materialistic thought and energy which flowed incessantly through it.And so he set about reorganizing the business.He
familiarized himself with every detail of the cotton market.He was
already well versed in the intricacies of the tariff.And soon the
idle machinery was roaring again.Soon the capacity of the mills was
doubled.And soon, very soon, the great Ames mills at Avon had become
a corporate part of our stupendous mechanical development of the
century just closed.When Carmen stepped from the train that morning she stood for a moment
looking uncertainly about her.Everywhere on one side as far as she
could see were low, ramshackle frame houses; a few brick store
buildings stood far up the main street; and over at her right the
enormous brick mills loomed high above the frozen stream.The dull
roar of the machinery drifted through the cold air to her ears.Up the
track, along which she had just come, some ragged, illy clad children
were picking up bits of coal.She went directly to them, and asked their names."Anton Spivak," answered one of the children dully, when she laid a
hand on his shoulder."Over dere," pointing off to the jungle of decrepit sheds."Me an'
him, we worked in de mills; but dere ain't no work fer us now."Take me to your home," she said firmly."Dere ain't nobody to home," he
replied."De ol' man an' woman works in de mills daytimes.""Come-a home wi' me," spoke up the boy's companion, a bright-faced
little urchin of some ten years who had given his name as Tony Tolesi.Carmen looked at him for a moment.Up the main street of the town they went for a short distance, then
turned and wended their course, through narrow streets and byways,
down toward the mills.In a few minutes they were in the district
where stood the great frame structures built by the Ames company to
house its hands.Block after block of these they passed, massive,
horrible, decrepit things, and at last stopped at a grease-stained,
broken door, which the little fellow pushed open.Carmen followed shivering, close after the boy, while
he trotted along, proud of the responsibility of conducting a visitor
to his home.At the far end of the hall the lad plunged into a narrow
staircase, so narrow that a stout man could not have mounted it.Up
four of these broken flights Carmen toiled after him, and then down a
long, desolate corridor, which sent a chill into the very marrow of
her bones."Dis is where we lives, Missy," announced the little fellow."Miss-a
Marcus, she live in dere," pointing to the door directly opposite.He pushed open the door before which they had halted.A rush of foul
air and odors of cooking swept out.They enveloped the girl and seemed
to hurl her back.A black-haired woman, holding a crying baby in her
arms, rose hastily from an unmade bed at one side of the room.Two
little girls, six or eight years of age, and a boy still younger,
ranged about their mother and stared in wide-eyed wonder."Dis-a lady, she come to visit," announced Carmen's guide abruptly,
pointing a dirty finger at her.The woman's face darkened, and she spoke harshly in a foreign tongue
to the little fellow."She say," the boy interpreted, as a crestfallen look spread over his
face, "she say she don't spik _Inglese_.""But I speak your language," said the girl, going quickly to her and
extending a hand.Then, in that soft tongue which is music celestial
to these Neapolitan strangers upon our inhospitable shores, she added,
"I want to know you; I want to talk to you."A littered, greasy cook stove
stood in one corner.Close to it at either end were wooden couches,
upon which were strewn a few tattered spreads and blankets, stained
and grimy.A broken table, a decrepit chest of drawers, and a few
rickety chairs completed the complement of furniture.The walls were
unadorned, except for a stained chromo of the Virgin, and the plaster
had fallen away in many places.Several of its panes were broken and stuffed with rags and papers.At the sound of her own language the woman's expression changed.A
light came into her dull eyes, and she awkwardly took the proffered
hand.Then, sweeping
the girl's warm attire with a quick glance, "You are rich!I am rich, yes, but not in money."The woman turned to her children and sent the little brood scattering.At another sharp command little Tony set out a soiled, broken chair
for Carmen.But before the girl could take it the woman's voice again
rose sharply."You are--what do
you say?You come with your gay party to look us over and go
away laughing!But reaching out, she gently lifted the heavy
baby from the woman's arms and sat down with it.For a moment she
patted its cheeks and bent tenderly over it.Then she looked up at the
bewildered mother."I have come here," she said softly, "because I love you."She turned dully and sat down
on one of the begrimed beds.Her little ones gathered about her, their
soiled fingers in their mouths, or clutching their tattered gowns, as
they gazed at the beautiful creature who had suddenly come into their
midst."I am not from the mission," replied the girl gently."I have come to
talk, not of heaven, but of earth, and of you, and of Tony," smiling
down into the eager face of the little boy as he stood before her."You can't take
any of my children!The judge took Pietro Corrello's boy last
week--but you can't have mine!"I don't want your children," said Carmen, smiling up at the
frightened, suspicious mother.I want you to help me to
help all of these people here who need us.The mills are running only
half time, aren't they?But we,
you and I, are going to make things better for them, for everybody
here, aren't we?"But first," she went on hastily, to further allay the poor woman's
fears and to check additional protest, "suppose we plan our dinner.Let's see, Tony, what would you like?"He glanced
inquiringly at his mother; but no sign came from her.Then he could no
longer contain himself:

"Spaghetti!"Carmen drew out her purse and turned to the woman."While we are gone, Tony and the children will wash the dishes
and set the table.For a moment the woman looked uncomprehendingly at the girl, then at
her children, and then about the miserable room in which they were
huddled.Amazement and confusion sat upon her heavy features.Then
these gave way to another dark look of suspicion.She opened her
mouth--

But before she could voice her resentment, Carmen rose and threw an
arm about her.Then the girl quickly drew the startled woman to her
and kissed her on the cheek."Come," she whispered, "get your shawl.God's universal language is the language of love.All nations, all
tribes understand it.The flood-gates, long barred, swiftly opened,
and the tired, miserable woman sank sobbing upon the bed.She could
not comprehend what it was that had come so unannounced into her
dreary existence that cold winter morning.People were not wont to
treat her so.Her life had been an endless, meaningless struggle
against misery, want, grinding oppression.People did not put their
arms around her and kiss her thus.They scoffed at her, they abused
her, they fought with her!She hated them, and the world in which she
lived!"I know, I know," whispered Carmen, as she drew the sobbing woman's
head upon her shoulder.She drew back, and a frightened, superstitious look came into her
face."Yes," said Carmen softly, taking the cue, "I am an angel, right from
heaven.Now you are no longer afraid of me, are you?The woman rose mechanically and took up her thin shawl.Carmen gave a
few directions to the gaping children.And as she went out into the
bleak hall with the woman she heard one of them whisper in tones of
awe:

"Tony, she said she--she was--an angel!Get down on your knees
and cross yourself!"*       *       *       *       *

Upward to the blue vault of heaven, like the streaming mists that
rise through the tropic moonlight from the hot _llanos_, goes the
ceaseless cry of humanity.Oh, if the god of the preachers were real,
his heart must have long since broken!Upward it streams, this
soul-piercing cry; up from the sodden, dull-brained toiler at the
crashing loom; up from the wretched outcast woman, selling herself
to low passions to escape the slavery of human exploitation; up from
the muttering, ill-fed wreck, whose life has been cashed into
dividends, whose dry, worthless hulk now totters to the scrap heap;
up from the white-haired, flat-chested mother, whose stunted babes
lie under little mounds with rude, wooden crosses in the dreary
textile burial grounds; up from the weak, the wicked, the ignorant,
the hopeless martyrs of the satanic social system that makes
possible the activities of such human vultures as the colossus
whose great mills now hurled their defiant roar at this girl, this
girl whose life-motif was love.Close about her, at the wretched little table, sat the wondering group
of children, greedily gorging themselves on the only full meal that
they could remember.And with them sat the still bewildered mother,
straining her dark eyes at the girl, and striving to see in her a
human being, a woman like herself.At her right sat the widow Marcus,
who lived just across the hall.Her husband had been crushed to death
in one of the pickers two years before.The company had paid her a
hundred dollars, but had kept back five for alleged legal fees.She
herself had lost an arm in one of these same pickers, long ago,
because the great owner of the mills would not equip his plant with
safety devices.said the mother at length, as a sense of the reality of
life suddenly returned to her.Tony hurriedly swept the contents of his plate into his mouth, and
went for the battered dinner pail."My man goes to work at six-thirty in the morning," she explained to
Carmen, when the little fellow had started to the mills with the pail
unwontedly full."And he does not leave until five-thirty.He was a
weaver, and he earned sometimes ten dollars a week.And so he had to take a job as carder.He earns
about eight dollars a week now."But you can't live on that, with your children!""Yes, we could," replied the woman, "if the work was steady.You see, if I could work steady, and the children too, we could
live.And I am not nearly so worn out as he is.I
have several years left in me yet."The widow Marcus, who spoke the language from an association with
Italian immigrants since childhood, added her comments from time to
time.She was a gray-haired, kindly soul, bearing no enmity toward the
man to whom she had yielded her husband's life and her own."A man's no good in the mills after he's fifty," she said."You see,
Miss, it's all piece-work, and a man has to be most terribly spry and
active.The strain is something awful, day after day, in the noise and
bad air, and having to keep your eyes fixed on your work for ten hours
at a stretch; and he wears out fast.Then he has to take a job where
he can't make so much.And when he's about fifty he's no good for the
mills any more.""Well, if he hasn't any children, he goes to the poor-house.But, if
he has, then they take care of him.""Yes, they've got to, Miss.The little ones must work in the mills,
too.These mills here take them on when they are only twelve, or even
younger.Tony has worked there, and he is only ten.It's against the
law; but Mr.The company paid me some money two years ago, and I
haven't spent all of it yet.I'm pretty
spry with one arm.""But--you do not pay rent for your home?"Ames--the man whose machines killed your
husband and took off your arm--you still pay rent to him, for one
little room?"Why, his company gave me almost a
hundred dollars, you know!I was lucky, for when Lizzie Sidel's man
lost his hand in the cog wheels he went to law to sue the company, and
three years afterward the case was thrown out of court and he had to
pay the costs himself.But he was a picker-boss, and got nine dollars
a week."A little hand stole up along Carmen's arm.She looked down into the
wondering face of the child."I--I just wanted to see, _Signorina_, if
you were real.""I have been wondering that myself, dear," replied the girl, as her
thought dwelt upon what she had been hearing."I must go now, Miss," said the widow Marcus, rising."I promised to
drop in and look after Katie Hoolan's children this afternoon."Then I will go with you," Carmen announced."But I will come back
here," she added, as some little hands seized hers."If not to-day,
then soon--perhaps to-morrow."Marcus, and entered the doorway
which led to the little inner room where dwelt the widow.There were a
dozen such rooms in the building, the latter informed her.This one in
particular had been shunned for many years, for it had a bad
reputation as a breeder of tuberculosis.But the rent was low, and so
the widow had taken it after her man was killed.It contained a broken
stove, a dirty bed, and a couple of unsteady chairs.The walls were damp, and the paper which had once covered them
was molding and rotting off."It won't stay on," the widow explained, as she saw the girl looking
at it.The
creek overflows and runs into the basement.They call this the
'death-room.'"Carmen shuddered when she looked about this fearful human
habitation.Yet, "The only death to be feared," said Paracelsus, "is
unconsciousness of God."Was this impoverished woman, then, any less
truly alive than the rich owner of the mills which had robbed her of
the means of existence?And can a civilization be alive to the Christ
when it breeds these antipodal types?"Ames's
methods are the epitome of hell!But he is ours, and the worthy
offspring of our ghastly, inhuman social system.We alone are to
blame that he debauches courts, that he blinds executives, and that he
buys legislatures!We let him make the laws, and fatten upon the
prey he takes within their limits.Aye, he is the crafty, vicious,
gold-imbruted manifestation of a whole nation's greed!"Nay, more, he
is the externalization of a people's ignorance of God.Carmen's throat filled as she watched the old woman bustling about the
wretched room and making a feeble attempt at order."You see," the widow went on, happy in the possession of an auditor,
"there is no use making apologies for the looks of my room; I couldn't
make it look much better if I tried.We have
to get water from the hydrant down back of the house.It is pumped
there from the creek, and it's a long climb up these stairs when
you've got only one arm to hold the bucket.And I have to bring my
coal up, too.The coal dealer charges extra for bringing it up so
far."Carmen sat down on an empty box and watched her.The woman's lot
seemed to have touched the depths of human wretchedness, and yet there
burned within her soul a something that the oppression of human
avarice could not extinguish."It's the children, Miss, that I think about," she continued."It's
not so bad as when I was a little one and worked in the cloth mills in
England.I was only six when I went into the mills there.I worked
from seven in the morning until after six at night.And the air was so
bad and we got so tired that we children used to fall asleep, and the
boss used to carry a stick to whip us to keep us awake.My parents
died when I was only eight.They worked in the Hollow-ware works, and
died of lead poisoning.People only last four or five years at that
work.""How many children are employed in these mills here?""I want to see them," said the girl, and there was a hitch in her
voice as she spoke."You can go down and watch them come out about six this evening.But now I must hurry to look after the Hoolan
babes."When she again reached the street Carmen turned and looked up at the
hideous structure from which she had emerged; then she drew a long
breath.The foul air of the "death-room" seemed to fill her lungs as
with leaden weights.The dim light that lay over the wretched hovel
hung like a veil before her eyes."Katie lives a block down the street," said the widow, pointing in the
direction.These tenements don't have
fire-escapes, and the one she lived in burned to the ground in an
hour.She lived on the second floor, and got out.It seemed to Carmen as she listened to the woman that the carnal
mind's chamber of horrors was externalized there in the little town of
Avon, existing with the dull consent of a people too ignorant, too
imbruted, too mesmerized by the false values of life to rise and
destroy it.All that cold winter afternoon the girl went from door to door.There
was no thought of fear when she met dull welcomes, scowls, and
menacing glances.In humble homes and wretched hovels; to Magyar,
Pole, Italian alike; to French Canadian, Irish and Portuguese; and to
the angry, the defiant, the sodden, the crushed, she unfolded her
simple banner of love, the boundless love that discriminates not, the
love that sees not things, but the thoughts and intents of the heart
that lie behind them.And dark looks faded, and tears came; withered
hearts opened, and lifeless souls stirred anew.She knew their
languages; and that knowledge unlocked their mental portals to her.She knew their thoughts, and the blight under which they molded; and
that knowledge fell like the sun's bright rays upon them.She knew
God, their God and hers; and that knowledge began, even on that dull,
gray afternoon, to cut into the chains of human rapacity which
enslaved them.At six that evening she stood at the tall iron gate of the mill yard.Little Tony was at her side, clutching her hand.A single electric
lamp across the street threw a flickering, yellow light upon the snow.The great, roaring mills were ablaze with thousands of glittering
eyes.Suddenly their monster sirens shrieked, a blood-curdling yell.Then their huge mouths opened, and a human flood belched forth.They were not the image and likeness
of God, these creatures, despite the doctrinal platitudes of the
Reverend Darius Borwell and the placid Doctor Jurges.They were not
alive, these stooping, shuffling things, despite the fact that the
religiously contented Patterson Moore would argue that God had
breathed the spirit of life into the thing of dust which He created.And these children, drifting past in a great, surging throng!Fathers
and mothers of a generation to come!Carmen knew that many of them,
despite their worn looks, were scarcely more than ten years old.These
were the flesh and blood upon which Ames, the jungle-beast, waxed
gross!Upon their thin life-currents floated the magnificent
_Cossack_!Yes, she was right, evil can _not_ be
really known.There is no principle by which to explain the hideous
things of the human mind.And then she wondered what the Reverend
Darius Borwell did to earn that comfortable salary of ten thousand a
year in his rich New York church."It's quite a sight, ain't it, Miss?"He was a man of medium height,
young, and of Irish descent."It's a great sight," he continued, with a touch of brogue in his
tones.he cried, catching a passing workman's arm."He ain't worked to-day, Father," replied the man, stopping and
touching his cap.The young priest uttered an exclamation of displeasure.Then, as the
workman started away:

"You'll be at the Hall to-night, Fagin?The man addressed nodded and gave an affirmative grunt, then passed on
into the darkness."It's trying to reach a few of 'em I am," remarked the priest.When a man's stomach's empty he hasn't much respect
for morality.And I can't feed the lot of 'em!"Carmen gazed into the kindly blue eyes of the priest and wondered."No--but I am interested in my fellow-beings."I've some rooms, some on Main street,
which I call the Hall, and some down in the--well, the bad district,
which I call the Mission.They're reading rooms, places for men to meet,
and get acquainted, and rest, and talk.The Hall's for the fellows
who work, like this Fagin.The Mission's for the down-and-outs.""But--are your rooms only for--for men of your faith?""Race or
religion don't figure.It's to give help to every man that needs it.""And you are giving your life to help these people?""I want to see your Hall and Mission.Take me to them," she abruptly
demanded.He looked down at little Tony,
and then up at Carmen again."We will leave the boy at his door, and then go to
your Mission and Hall.Now tell me, you are a Roman Catholic priest?""Yes," he said mechanically, following her as she started away."How did you happen to get into this sort of work?""Oh, I've been at it these ten years!"he returned, now recovered from
his surprise, and pleased to talk about his work."I'd had some
experience in New York in the Bowery district.I came to the
conclusion that there were mighty few down-and-outs who couldn't be
set upon their pins again, given half a chance by any one sufficiently
interested.You see, Miss, I believe in my
fellow-men.Oh, it's only
temporary, I know.It ain't going to change the whole social system.But it helps a bit--and I like it."But," he continued more seriously, "there's going to be trouble here.And it's going to be a bad one."I've written him several times of late.But it's not
much I see he's doing, except to go on sucking the blood from these
poor devils down here!"They soon reached the tenement where Tony lived, and Carmen asked the
priest to go up with her."No," he said, "the good woman doesn't like priests.And my labors
don't reach the women anyway, except through the men.It was only by making many promises that Carmen could at last get away
from the little group on the fourth floor.But she slipped a bill into
Tony's hands as she went out, and then hurriedly crossed the hall and
opened the unlocked door of the widow Marcus's room.Carmen pinned a five-dollar bill upon the pillow and hastened
out."Now," said the priest, when the girl had joined him in the street
below, "it ain't right to take you to the Mission--"

"We'll go there first," the girl calmly announced.By the way, there's a telephone in your place?I want to call up
the health officer.I want to report the condition of these
tenements.""It won't do any good, Miss.I've camped on his
heels for months.If he
gets too troublesome to those higher up, why, he gets fired.He isn't here to report on conditions, but to
overlook 'em."You mean to say that nothing can be done in regard to those awful
buildings which Mr.Ames owns and rents to his mill hands?""It's criminal to let such buildings stand.Meanwhile, the priest was
studying his fair companion, and wondering who she might be.At length
he inquired if she had ever been in Avon before."Haven't seen Pillette's house then?He's resident manager of the Ames
mills.We can go a little out of our way and have a look at it."A few minutes later they stood at the iron gate of the manager's
residence, a massive, brown stone dwelling, set in among ancient trees
in an estate of several acres, and surrounded by shrubs and bushes."Does he know all about those tenements
down there?""Ah, that he does; and cares less.And he knows all about the terrible
hot air in his mills, and the flying lint that clogs the lungs of the
babies working there.He sees them leave the place, dripping with
perspiration, and go out into the zero temperature half naked.And
when they go off with pneumonia, well he knows why; and cares less.He
knows that the poor, tired workers in that great prison lose their
senses in the awful noise and roar, and sometimes get bewildered and
fall afoul of belts and cogs, and lose their limbs or lives.And he wouldn't put safety devices
over his machines, because he doesn't care.I've written to him a
dozen times about it.But--

"And then Pillette," he continued; "I've asked him to furnish his
hands with decent drinking water.They work ten and twelve hours in
that inferno, and when they want to drink, why, all they have is a
barrel of warm water, so covered with lint that it has to be pushed
aside in order to get at the water.Why, Pillette don't even give 'em
change rooms!He won't give 'em decent toilet rooms!Seems to me that when a man can give a ball and send
out invitations on cards of solid gold, he can afford to give a
thought to the thousands who have toiled and suffered in order to
enable him to give such a ball, don't you?"The memory came back now
in hot, searing thoughts."Oh, he catches 'em coming and going!""You see,
he manipulates Congress so that a high tariff law is passed,
protecting him from imported goods.Then he runs up the prices of his
output.That hits his mill hands, for they have to pay the higher
prices that the tariff causes.Oh, no, it doesn't result in increased
wages to them.He is
the only one who profits by high tariff on cotton goods.She might not know that Ames periodically appeared
before Congress and begged its protection--nay, threatened, and then
demanded.She might not know that Senator Gossitch ate meekly from the
great man's hand, and speciously represented to his dignified
colleagues that the benefits of high protective duties were for "the
people" of the United States.She might not know how Hood, employed to
evade the laws enacted to hedge and restrain his master, bribed and
bought, schemed and contrived, lobbied, traded, and manipulated, that
his owner might batten on his blood-stained profits, while he kept his
face turned away from the scenes of carnage, and his ears stopped
against the piteous cries of his driven slaves.But she did know how
needless it all was, and how easy, oh!how pitiably easy, it would be
to remedy every such condition, would the master but yield but a
modicum of his colossal, mesmeric selfishness.She did not know, she
could not, that the master, Ames, made a yearly profit from his mills
of more than two hundred per cent.But she did know that, were he less
stupidly greedy, even to the extent of taking but a hundred per cent
profit, he would turn a flood of sunshine into hundreds of sick,
despairing, dying souls."This is the place," she heard the priest say, his voice seeming to
come from a long distance.They were in front of an old,
two-story building, decrepit and forbidding, but well lighted.While
she gazed, the priest opened the door and bade her enter."This down here is the reading room," he explained.Upstairs is my office, and sleeping rooms for men.Also a
stock of old clothes I keep on hand for 'em when I send 'em out to
look for work.I've clothed an average of four men a day during the
past year, and sent 'em out to look for jobs.I board 'em, and keep
'em going until they land something.Sometimes I have to lend 'em
money.No, I never bother about a
man's religion.Carmen climbed the rough steps to the floor above and entered the
small but well-kept office of the priest."Now here," he said, with a touch of pride, "is my card-index.I keep
tab on all who come here.When they get straightened up and go out to
hunt work, I give 'em identification cards.Just as soon as I can get
funds I'm going to put a billiard table back there and fit up a little
chapel, so's the Catholic men who drift in here can attend service.You know, a lot of 'em don't have the nerve to go to a church.Carmen looked at the man in admiration."We haven't either of us asked the other's name," she said."I've been dying to know yours," he
replied."I'm Father Magee, Daniel Magee.Oh, give any name; it doesn't matter,
just so's I'll know how to address you."And I am from South America," said the girl
simply.*       *       *       *       *

An hour later the girl rose from her chair."I shall have to wait and
visit the Hall another time," she said."I must catch the eight-thirty
back to the city.But--"

"I'll never see you go down this tough street to the depot alone!"averred the priest, reaching for his hat.But she gratefully accepted the proffered escort.Two
of Father Magee's assistants had come in meanwhile, and were caring
for the few applicants below."You're right, Miss Carmen," the priest said, as they started for the
train.It eats my heart out to
see the suffering of these poor people!"At eleven o'clock that night Carmen entered the office of the city
editor of the Express."Ned," she said, "I've been with Dante--no,
Danny--in Inferno.I want expense
money--a good lot--so that I can leave to-morrow night."Haynerd's eyes dilated as he stared at the girl.But what did you find down in Avon?""I'll write you a detailed report of my trip to-morrow.I'm going home
now," she replied.CHAPTER 12


It is sometimes said of the man who toils at forge or loom in this
great commonwealth that he is fast forgetting that Washington is
something more significant to him than what is embraced in the
definition of the gazetteers.Not so, however, of that class of the
genus _homo_ individualized in J. Wilton Ames.He leaned not upon such
frail dependence as the _Congressional Record_ for tempered reports of
what goes on behind closed legislative doors; he went behind those
doors himself.He needed not to yield his meekly couched desires to
the law-builders whom his ballot helped select; he himself launched
those legislators, and gave them their steering charts.But, since the
interpretation of laws was to him vastly more important than their
framing, he first applied himself to the selection of judges, and
especially those of the federal courts.With these safely seated and
instructed at home, he gave himself comfortably to the task of holding
his legislators in Washington to the course he chose.Carmen had not spent a day at the Capital before the significance of
this fact to the common citizen swept over her like a tidal wave.If
the people, those upon whom the stability of the nation rests, looked
as carefully after appointments and elections as did Ames, would their
present wrongs continue long to endure?And after she
had spent the day with the Washington correspondent of the Express, a
Mr.Sands, who, with his young wife, had just removed to the Capital,
she knew more with respect to the mesmerism of human inertia and its
baneful effects upon mankind than she had known before.And yet, after that first day of wandering through the hallowed
precincts of a nation's legislative halls, she sat down upon a bench
in the shadow of the Capitol's great dome and asked herself the
questions: "What am I here for, anyway?And
instinct with her, as we have said, was unrestrained dependence upon
her own thought, the thought which entered her mentality only after
she had first prepared the way by the removal of every obstruction,
including self.At the breakfast table the second morning after her arrival in the
city, Mr.Sands handed her a copy of the Express.Among the editorials
was her full report upon conditions as she had found them in Avon,
published without her signature.Following it was the editor's
comment, merciless in its exposition of fact, and ruthless in its
exposure of the cruel greed externalized in the great cotton industry
in that little town.Carmen rose from the table indignant and protesting.Hitt had said he
would be wise in whatever use he made of her findings.But, though
quite devoid of malignity, this account and its added comment were
nothing less than a personal attack upon the master spinner, Ames.And
she had sent another report from Washington last night, one comprising
all she had learned from Mr.She
must get in touch with him at once.So she set out to find a telegraph
office, that she might check the impulsive publisher who was openly
hurling his challenge at the giant Philistine.When the message had gone, the girl dismissed the subject from her
thought, and gave herself up completely to the charm of the glorious
morning and her beautiful environment.For some time she wandered
aimlessly about the city; then bent her steps again toward the
Capitol.At the window of a florist she stopped and looked long and lovingly at
the gorgeous display within.In the midst of the beautiful profusion a
single flower held her attention.It was a great, brilliant red rose,
a kind that she had never seen before."We call it the 'President' rose, Miss," said the salesman in response
to her query.And when she went out with the splendid flower burning on her bosom
like living fire, she was glad that Hitt had not been there to see her
pay two dollars for it.The great Capitol seemed to fascinate her, as she stood before it a
few moments later.The mighty
sentiments and motives which had actuated the framers of the
Constitution seemed to loom before her like monuments of eternal
stone.Had statesmanship degenerated from that day of pure patriotism
into mere corruption?"Why, my dear girl,
the people of your great State are represented in the national Senate
by--whom?By the flies on the panes; by the mice in
the corners; by the god, perhaps, to whom the chaplain offers his
ineffectual prayers; but not by men.No; one of your Senators
represents a great railroad; the other an express company!Those Senators know no such ridiculous creature as 'the people'!"She turned from the Capitol, and for an hour or more strolled in the
brilliant sunlight."An economic disease," she murmured at length.And, like all disease, it is mental.It is a
disease of the human conscience.It comes from the fear of separation
from good.It all reduces to the belief of separation from God--the
belief that upon men's own human efforts depend all the happiness and
satisfaction they can have.Why, I have never known anything but
happiness and abundance!And yet, _I have never made a single effort
to acquire them_!"For the girl saw not the past vicissitudes of her
life except as shadowy mists, which dimmed not the sun of her joy.There was a tramping of horses' feet.It struck her, and brushed her to one side.She strove to hold
herself, but fell.The man and his companion were off their horses instantly, and
assisted the girl to her feet.asked the one who had been riding ahead."I called to
you, but you didn't seem to hear."laughed the girl, recovering her breath, and stooping to
brush the dust from her dress."Well, I'm glad to hear that!Perhaps you had better come in with
us."The girl raised her head and looked into his face with a bright smile.The man's anxious expression slowly changed into one of wonder, and
then of something quite different.The girl's long, thick hair had
been loosened by the fall, and was hanging about her shoulders.Framed
in the deep brown profusion was the fairest face he had ever looked
upon; the most winning smile; the most loving, compassionate glance."You'll have to come in now, and let the maid help you," he said
firmly."And I'll send you home in an auto."New York," replied Carmen, a little confused as she struggled vainly
with her hair."Oh, I'm not going to fuss with it any more!""Yes, I'll go with you, and let the maid do it up.She glanced about her, and then up the avenue toward which the men had
been riding.A flush suddenly spread over her face, and she turned and
looked searchingly at the man."You--you--live--in--there?"she stammered, pointing toward the
distant house."And you are--"

"Yes," he replied, coming to her assistance, but evidently greatly
enjoying her embarrassment, "I am the President."Then her hand stole mechanically to the rose flaming upon her bosom."I--I guess I know why I bought this now," she said softly.Quickly
unpinning it, she extended it to the man."I was bringing it to you,
wasn't I?"The picture was one that would have rejoiced an artist: the simple
girl, with her tumbled hair and wonderful face, standing there in the
glorious sunlight, holding out a single rose to the chief executive of
a great nation.The President bowed low and took the proffered flower.But the one who gives it is far more so."Then he bade his companion take the two horses to the stable, and
motioned to Carmen to accompany him."I was just returning from my morning ride," he began again, "when you
happened--"

"Things _never_ happen," interrupted the girl gently.He looked at her with a little quizzical side glance."Then you didn't
happen to be in the way?""I was obeying the law of cause and
effect.""A desire to see you, I guess.Or, perhaps, the _necessity_ of seeing
you.And because I wanted to see you in the interests of good, why,
evil seemed to try to run over me.""But why should you wish to see me?""Because you are the head of a wonderful nation.Then:

"You came down from New York to talk with me?""I think I came all the way from South America to see you," she said.There is a revolution in progress down there now.Did you
come to see me about that?I can do nothing--"

The girl shook her head."No," she said, "it's to prevent a revolution
here in your own country that I think I have come to see you."They had by now reached the door of the Executive Mansion.Entering,
the President summoned a maid, and turned the big-eyed girl over to
her."Bring her to my office," he directed, "when she is ready."A little later the nameless girl from Simiti again stood before the
President of the United States."I have an important conference at ten," he said, glancing at a clock."But we have a few minutes before that time.Will you--may I ask you
to tell me something about yourself?"he added, looking
apprehensively at her while he set out a chair.The girl drew the chair close to his desk and sat down."I know
nothing about accidents," she said quietly.Then, turning quite from
that topic, she drew the President quickly into her thought and
carried him off with her as on a magic carpet.From time to time he turned and
stared at his strange visitor.At other times he made notes of points
which impressed him.Once he interrupted, when she made reference to
her past life."This priest, Jose de Rincon, might he not have been
imprisoned as a political offender?""I do not know," the girl replied tenderly."My foster-father,
Rosendo, did not mention him in the two letters which I have
received."The President nodded; and the girl went rapidly on.Soon she was deep
in the problem presented by Avon.But at the mention of that town, and of its dominating genius, the
President seemed to become nervous.At length he raised a hand, as if
to end the interview."I fear I can do nothing at present," he said with an air of
helplessness."But," she protested, "you have the public welfare at heart.And can
you not see that public welfare is the welfare of each individual?"Ames well," the President replied, somewhat irrelevantly."He, like all men of great wealth, presents a serious problem,
doubtless.But he himself, likewise, is confronted by problems of very
trying natures.We must give him time to work them out.""It's like getting at the essence of Christianity,"
she said."The world has had nearly two thousand years in which to do
that, but it hasn't made much of a start as yet."But," the President resumed reflectively, "after all, it is the
people who are wholly responsible for the conditions which exist among
them.They have the means of remedying every economic situation, the
ballot.It is really all in their hands, is it not?They elect their
public officers, their judges, and their lawmakers.""You too," she said, "take refuge in the cant
of the age.Yes, the people do try to elect public servants; but by
some strange anomaly the servant becomes master the moment he enters
the door of office.And then
they, and you, sit helplessly back and cry, No use!And if the people
rise, their servants meet them with a hail of lead.It's really
childishly ridiculous, isn't it?when you stop to consider it
seriously."She leaned her elbows upon the desk, and sat with chin in her hands,
looking squarely into the eyes of the President."So you, the head of this great nation, confess to utter helplessness,"
she slowly said.A servant entered at that moment with a card.The President glanced at
it, and bade him request the caller to wait a few moments.Then, after
some reflection:

"The people will always--"

The door through which the servant had passed was abruptly thrown
open, and a harsh voice preceded the entrance of a huge bulk."I am not accustomed to being told to wait, Mr.President," said the
ungracious voice."My appointment was for ten o'clock, and I am here
to keep it."Then the newcomer stopped abruptly, and stared in amazement at the
young girl, sitting with her elbows propped upon the desk, and her
face close to that of the President.His
attention was centered upon the girl who sat looking calmly up at him.A dark, menacing scowl drew his bushy eyebrows together, and made the
sinister look which mantled his face one of ominous import to the
person upon whom it fell.Carmen was the first to break the tense silence.With a bright smile
illuming her face she rose and held out a hand to the giant before
her."We meet pretty often, don't
we?"Ames ignored both the greeting and the extended hand.Turning upon the
President, he said sharply: "So, the Express seeks aid in the White
House, eh?"Ames," said Carmen quickly, answering for the President."It
seeks to aid the White House.""Might I ask," he said in a tone of mordant
sarcasm, "how you learned that I was to be here this morning?I would
like to employ your methods of espionage in my own business.""I would give anything if you _would_ employ my methods in your
business," returned the girl gently.The President looked in embarrassment from one to the other."I think,
Miss Carmen," he said, "that we must consider our interview ended.A peculiar expression had come into Ames's features.President," he said in a tone pregnant with
meaning."I am glad to have a representative of the New York press
with us to hear you express your attitude toward the cotton
schedule."His
indignation mounted, but he checked it."The schedule has been reported out of committee," he replied briefly."I am aware of that," said Ames."And your influence with Congress in
regard to it?""Shall the Avon mills be closed pending a decision?Or, on the
assumption that Congress will uphold the altered schedule, must the
Spinners' Association begin immediate retrenchment?As president of
that Association, I ask for instructions.""My influence with Congress, as you well know, Mr.Ames, is quite
limited," replied the hectored executive."It is not a question of the _amount_ of your influence with that
body, Mr.President," returned Ames coldly, "but of how you will
employ that which you have."Silence lay upon them all for some moments.Then Ames resumed:

"I would remind you," he remarked with cruel insinuation, "that--or,"
glancing at the girl, "perhaps I should not make this public."He
paused and awaited the effect of his significant words upon the
President.Then, as the latter remained silent, he went on evenly:

"Second-term prospects, you are aware, are often very greatly
influenced by public facts regarding the first election.Of course we
are saying nothing that the press might use, but--well, you must
realize that there is some suspicion current as to the exact manner in
which your election was--"

"I think you wish to insinuate that my election was due to the
Catholic vote, which you controlled in New York, and to your very
generous campaign contributions, do you not?I see no reason for
withholding from the press your views on the subject.""But, my friend, this is an age of investigation, and of suspicion
toward all public officials.And such rumors wouldn't look well on the
front pages of the press throughout the country.Of course, our young
friend here isn't going to mention them to her superiors; but,
nevertheless, they ought to be suppressed at once.Their effect upon
your second-term prospects would be simply annihilating.Now I am in a
position to greatly assist in the matter of--well, in fact, I have
already once offered my aid to the Express.And I stand ready now to
join with it in giving the lie to those who are seeking to embarrass
the present administration.Miss Carmen is with us--"

"Mr.Ames," the girl quietly interrupted, "I wish _you_ were with
_us_.""But, my dear girl, have I--"

"For then there would be no more suffering in Avon," she added.Then it was you who wrote that misleading stuff in the Express,
eh?May I ask," he added with a contemptuous
sneer, "by whose authority you have visited the houses occupied by my
tenants, without my permission or knowledge?I take it you were down
there, although the cloudy weather must have quite dimmed your
perception.""Yes," she answered in a low voice, "I have been there.Yes, I visited your charnel houses and your cemeteries.I held their trembling hands, and stroked their
hot brows.I fed them, and gave them the promise that I would plead
their cause with you."But you first come here to--"

"It was with no thought of seeing you that I came to Washington, Mr.If I cross your path often, it must be for a purpose not yet
revealed to either of us.Perhaps it is to warn you, to awaken you, if
not too late, to a sense of your desperate state."You are drunk, you know, drunk with greed.And such continuous
drunkenness has made you sick unto death.It is the same dread disease
of the soul that the wicked Cortez told the bewildered Mexicans he
had, and that could be cured only with gold.Ames, that you are mesmerized by the evil which is always using you."She stood close to the huge man, and looked straight up into his face.He remained for a moment motionless, yielding again to that
fascination which always held him when in her presence, and of which
he could give no account to himself.That slight, girlish figure--how
easily he could crush her!"But you couldn't, you know," she said cryptically, as she shook her
head.He recoiled a step, struck by the sudden revelation that the girl had
read his thought.Ames," she continued, "what a craven error is before
truth.It makes a coward of you, doesn't it?Your boasted power is
only a mesmerism, which you throw like a huge net over your victims.You and they can break it, if you will.""We really must consider our
interview ended."I guess the appointment was made for to-day," the girl said softly."And by a higher power than any of us.Ames is the type of man who
is slowly turning our Republican form of government into a despotism
of wealth.He boasts that his power is already greater than a czar's.You bow before it; and so the awful monster of privilege goes on
unhampered, coiling its slimy tentacles about our national resources,
our public utilities, and natural wealth.I--I can't see how you, the
head of this great nation, can stand trembling by and see him do it.He made as if to reply, but restrained himself.A stern look then came into the
President's face.Then he
turned again to his desk and sat down."Please be seated," he said, "both of you.I don't know what quarrel
there is between you two, and I am not interested in it.But you, Miss
Carmen, represent the press; Mr.The things which have
been voiced here this morning must remain with us alone.Now let us
see if we can not meet on common ground.Is the attitude of your
newspaper, Miss Carmen, one of hostility toward great wealth?""The Express raises its voice only against the folly and wickedness of
the human mind, not against personality," replied the girl.We attack only the human thought which manifests in him.We
oppose the carnal thought which expresses itself in the folly, the
madness of strife for excessive wealth.It is that strife that makes
our hospitals and asylums a disgraceful necessity.It makes the
immigrant hordes of Europe flock here because they are attracted by
the horrible social system which fosters the growth of great fortunes
and makes their acquisition possible.Our alms-houses and prisons
increase in number every year.It is because rich men misuse their
wealth, trample justice under foot, and prostitute a whole nation's
conscience."They do not all--"

"It is a law of human thought," said Carmen in reply, "that mankind in
time become like that which has absorbed their attention.Rich men
obey this law with utmost precision.They acquire the nature and
character of their god, gold.They rapidly grow to be like that which
they blindly worship.They grow
metallic, yellow, calloused, unchanging, and soulless, like the coins
they heap up.There is the great danger to our country, Mr.And it is against the human thought that produces such beings--thought
stamped with the dollar mark--that the Express opposes itself."She hesitated, and looked in the direction of Ames.Then she added:

"Their features in time reveal to the world their metallic thought.Their veins shrivel with the fiery lust of gold.And then, at last, they crumble and sink into the dust of
which their god is made.And still their memories continue to poison
the very sources of our national existence.You see," she concluded,
"there is no fool so mired in his folly as the man who gives his soul
for great wealth.""A very enjoyable little sermon, preached for my benefit, Miss
Carmen," interposed Ames, bowing to her."And now if you have finished
excoriating my poor character," he continued dryly, "will you kindly
state by whose authority you publish to the world my affairs?"The maudlin sentimentalism of such as you make us all suffer!""Hadn't we better sing a hymn
now?You'll be wiser in a few years, I hope."Ames, by what right you own
mines, and forests, and lands?"By the divine right of law, most assuredly," he retorted.I have learned," she
continued, turning to the President, "that a bare handful of men own
or control all the public utilities of this great country.But," abruptly, "you believe in God, don't you?"He nodded his head, although with some embarrassment.His religion
labored heavily under political bias.She looked down at the floor, and sat silent for a while."Divine
right," she began to murmur, "the fetish of the creatures made rich by
our man-made social system!'The heavens are thine, the earth also is
thine: as for the world and the fullness thereof, thou hast founded
them.'But, oh, what must be the concept of God held by the rich, a
God who bestows these gifts upon a few, and with them the privilege
and divine consent to oppress and crush their fellow-men!What a low
order of intelligence the rich possess!An intelligence wherein the
sentiments of love and justice have melted into money!"President," put in Ames at this juncture, "I think we have spent
quite enough time moralizing.Suppose you now indicate your attitude
on the cotton tariff.Her sparkling eyes looked right into the
President's."I admire the man," she said,
"who dares to stand for the right in the face of the great taboo!There are few men nowadays who stand for anything in particular."exclaimed Ames, aware now that he had made a mistake in
permitting the girl to remain, "I wish my interview to be with you
alone, Mr."I have embarrassed you both, haven't I?"But first--"

She went to Ames and laid a hand on his arm."I wish--I wish I might
awaken you," she said gently."There is no victim at Avon in so
desperate a state as you.More gold will not cure you, any more than
more liquor can cure a slave to strong drink.You do not know that you
are hourly practicing the most despicable form of robbery, the
wringing of profits which you do not need out of the dire necessities
of your fellow-beings."She stopped and smiled down into the face of the man.This girl always dissected his soul with a smile on
her face."I wish I might awaken you and your poor victims by showing you and
them that righteousness makes not for a home in the skies, but for
greater happiness and prosperity for everybody right here in this
world.Don't you really want the little babies to have enough to eat
down there at Avon?Do you really want the President to support you in
the matter of the cotton schedule, and so increase the misery and
sorrow at your mills?that one's greatest
happiness is found only in that of others."She stood looking at him
for a few moments, then turned away.The President rose and held out his hand to her.She almost laughed as
she took it, and her eyes shone with the light of her eager, unselfish
desire."I--I guess I'm like Paul," she said, "consumed with zeal.Anyway,
you'll wear my rose, won't you?""And--you are not a bit afraid about a second term, are you?As for
party principle, why, you know, there is only _one_ principle, God.He
is the Christ-principle, you know, and that is way above party
principle."Under the spell of the girl's strange words every emotion fled from
the men but that of amazement."Righteousness, you know, is right-thinking.And that touches just
that about which men are most chary, their pocketbooks."Then she arched her brows and said naively:
"You will find in yesterday's Express something about Avon.You will
not use your influence with Congress until you have read it, will
you?"A deep quiet fell upon the men, upon the great executive and the great
apostle of privilege.It seemed to the one that as the door closed
against that bright presence the spirit of night descended; the other
sat wrapped in the chaos of conflicting emotions in which she always
left him."She's the bastard daughter of a <DW64> priest," replied Ames in an
ugly tone.cried the thoroughly angered Ames, bringing a huge
fist down hard upon the desk.And, what's
more, she's head over heels in love with another renegade priest!"But that's neither here nor there," he continued savagely."I want to
know what you are going to do for us?""I--I do not see, Mr.Ames, that I can do anything," replied the
President meditatively."Well--will you leave the details to us, and do as we tell you then?"the financier pursued, taking another tack."Yes--about the girl, you--"

"Damn the girl!""I've got proofs that will ruin
her, and you too--and, by God, I'll use 'em, if you drive me to it!You seem to forget that you were elected to do our bidding, my
friend!"For a long time he sat
staring at the floor."It was wonderful," he said,
"wonderful the way she faced you, like David before Goliath!There
isn't a vestige of fear in her make-up.I--we'll talk this matter over
some other time, Mr.roared Ames, his self-control flying to the
winds."I can ruin you--make your administration a laughing-stock--and
plunge this country into financial panic!Do you do as I say, or
not?"The President looked the angry man squarely in the eyes."I do not,"
he answered quietly.CHAPTER 13


"It's corking!cried Haynerd, when he and Hitt had
finished reading Carmen's report on her first few days in Washington."Makes a fellow feel as if the best thing Congress could do would be
to adjourn for about fifty years, eh?But
she's a wonder, Hitt!And she's booming the Express to the skies!That's why she is so--as the
Mexicans say--_simpatico_.""Well, not with you, I hope!""No, unfortunately," replied Haynerd, assuming a dejected mien, "but
with that Rincon fellow--and he a priest!He's got a son down in
Cartagena somewhere, and he doesn't write to her either.She's told
Sid the whole story, and he's working it up into a book during his odd
moments.But, say," turning the conversation again into its original
channel, "how much of her report are we going to run?You know, she
tried to head us off.As if she
hadn't already attacked him and strewn him all over the field!""We'll have to be careful in our allusions to the President," replied
Hitt."I'll rewrite it myself, so as not to offend her or him.her reports are the truth, and they rightfully
belong to the people!The Express is the avowed servant of the
public!I see no reason for
concealing a thing.Did I tell you that I had two inquiries from
Italian and German papers, asking permission to translate her reports
into their own columns?"Did you wire her to see
Gossitch and Mall?""Yes, and Logue, as well as others.And I've put dozens of senators
and congressmen on our mailing list, including the President himself.I've prepared letters for each one of them, calling attention to the
girl and her unique reports.She certainly writes in a fascinating
vein, doesn't she?Meanwhile, she's circulating around down there and
advertising us in the best possible manner.he finished, slapping the city editor roundly upon the back."Confine your enthusiasm to words, my
friend.Say, what did you do about that liquid food advertisement?""Discovered that it was beer," replied Hitt, "and turned it firmly
down."Not that we care to advertise it, but--"

Hitt laughed."When that fellow Claus smoothly tried to convince me
that beer was a food, I sent a sample of his stuff to the Iles
chemical laboratory for analysis.They reported ninety-four per cent
water, four per cent alcohol--defined now as a poisonous drug--and
about two per cent of possible food substance.If the beer had been of
the first grade there wouldn't have been even the two per cent of
solids.You know, I couldn't help thinking of what Carmen said about
the beer that is advertised in brown bottles to preserve it from the
deleterious effects of light.Light, you know, starts decay in beer.Well, light, according to Fuller, is 'God's eldest daughter.'Emerson
says it is the first of painters, and that there is nothing so foul
that intense light will not make it beautiful.Thus the light of truth destroys the fermentation which
is supposed to constitute the human mind and body.So light tries to
purify beer by breaking it up.The brewers have to put it into brown
bottles to preserve its poisonous qualities.As Carmen says, beer
simply can't stand the light.It's astonishing that so many so-called reputable papers will
take their advertising stuff.It's just as bad as patent medicine
ads."And I note that the American public still spend their annual
hundred million dollars for patent medicine dope.Most of this is
spent by women, who are largely caught by the mail-order trade.I
learned of one exposure recently made where it was found that a widely
advertised eye wash was composed of borax and water.The cost was
somewhere about five cents a gallon, and it sold for a dollar an
ounce.Nice little profit of some two hundred and fifty thousand per
cent, and all done by the mesmerism of suggestive advertising.Speaking of parasites on
society, Ames is not the only one!""And yet those fellows howl and threaten us with the boycott because
we won't advertise their lies and delusions.It's as bad as
ecclesiastical intolerance!"Then she returned to New York and
went directly to Avon.What she did there can only be surmised by a
study of her reports to Hitt, who carefully edited them and ran them
in the Express.Again, after several days, she journeyed back to
Washington.Her enthusiasm was boundless; her energy exhaustless; her
industry ceaseless; and her persistency doggedly unshakable.In
Washington she made her way unhindered among those whom she deemed
essential to the work which she was doing.Doubtless her ability to do
this and to gain an audience with whomsoever she might choose was in
great part due to her beauty and charming simplicity, her grace of
manner, and her wonderful and fearless innocence, combined with a
mentality remarkable for its matured powers.Hitt and Haynerd groaned
over her expenses, but promptly met them."She's worth it," growled the latter one day."She's had four
different talks with the President!How on earth do you suppose she
does it?And how did she get Mall and Logue to take her to dinner and
to the theater again and again?And what did she do to induce that
doddering old blunderbuss, Gossitch, to tell her what Ames was up to?How do you suppose she found out that
Ames was hand in glove with the medical profession, and working tooth
and nail to help them secure a National Bureau of Health?Say, do you
know what that would do?It would foist allopathy upon every chick and
child of us!Have
we come to that in this supposedly free country?By the way, Hitt,
Doctor Morton has been let out of the University.He says Ames
did it because of his association with us."I think, my friend," replied Hitt, "that it is a very serious matter,
and one that impinges heavily upon the rights of every one of us, when
a roaring lion like Ames is permitted to run loose through our
streets."I've centered my hopes in Carmen," sighed Haynerd.If she can't stop him, then God himself can't!"A few moments later he came out
again and handed an opened letter to Haynerd."Some notes she's sent
from Washington.Mentions the National Bureau of Health project.It
hasn't escaped her, you see.Say, will you tell me where she picks up
her information?""The Lord gives it to her, I guess," said Haynerd, glancing over the
letter."'Reverend Borwell and Doctor Siler are down here lobbying for the
  National Bureau of Health bill.Also, Senator Gossitch dropped a
  remark to me yesterday which makes me believe that he and other
  Senators have been approached by Tetham with reference to sending
  an American ambassador to the Vatican.Haynerd handed the letter back to Hitt and plunged into the papers on
his desk."This
country's going stark, staring mad!We're crazy, every mother's son of
us!""It's the human mind that is crazy, Ned, because it is wholly without
any basis of principle," returned Hitt with a sigh.*       *       *       *       *

"Doctor Siler!exclaimed that worthy person, looking up from
the gutter, whither he had hastened after his silk hat which had been
knocked off by the encounter with the young girl who had rounded the
corner of Ninth street into Pennsylvania avenue and plunged full into
him.Mary journeyed to the kitchen."Oh, I'm so sorry, Doctor!I was coming from the Smithsonian
Institution, and I guess--"

"Don't mention it, Miss Carmen.It's a privilege to have my hat
knocked off by such a radiant creature as you."And I want to offer
my--"

"Look here, Miss Carmen, just offer yourself as my guest at luncheon,
will you?That will not only make amends, but place me hopelessly in
your debt.""I was on my way to a
restaurant."I've got a little place around the corner here
that would have made Epicurus sit up nights inditing odes to it."The girl laughed merrily, and slipped her arm through his.A few
minutes later they were seated at a little table in a secluded corner
of the doctor's favorite chophouse."By the way, I met a friend of yours a few minutes ago," announced the
doctor, after they had given their orders."He was coming out of the
White House, and--were you ever in a miniature cyclone?That's twice to-day I've been sent to the gutter!"He laughed heartily
over his experiences, then added significantly: "You and he are both
mental cyclones, but producing diametrically opposite effects."The doctor went on chatting
volubly."Ames and the President don't seem to be pulling together
as well as usual.The President has come out squarely against him
now in the matter of the cotton schedule.Ames declares that the
result will be a general financial panic this fall.Sands, the Express correspondent, seems to be getting mighty close
to administration affairs these days.Where did he get that data
regarding a prospective National Bureau of Health, do you suppose?""I gave it to him," was the simple reply.The doctor dropped his fork, and stared at the girl."Well--of course you naturally would be opposed to it.But--"

"Tell me," she interrupted, "tell me candidly just what you doctors
are striving for, anyway.Are your activities
all quite utilitarian, or--is it money and monopoly that you are
after?It makes a lot of difference, you know, in one's attitude
toward you.If you really seek the betterment of health, then you are
only honestly mistaken in your zeal.But if you are doing this to make
money--and I think you are--then you are a lot of rascals, deserving
defeat.""Miss Carmen, do you impugn my motives?"He began to color slightly under her keen
scrutiny."Well," she finally continued, "let's see.If you doctors
have made the curative arts effective, and if you really do heal
disease, then I must support you, of course.But, while there is
nothing quite so important to the average mortal as his health, yet I
know that there is hardly anything that has been dealt with in such a
bungling way.The art of healing as employed by our various schools of
medicine to-day is the result of ages and ages of experimentation and
bitter experience, isn't it?And its cost in human lives is simply
incalculable.No science is so speculative, none so hypothetical, as
the so-called science of medicine.""But we have had to learn," protested the doctor."Do you realize, Doctor," she resumed, "that the teaching and
preaching of disease for money is one of the greatest curses resting
upon the world to-day?I never saw a doctor until I was on the boat
coming to New York.And then I thought he was one of the greatest
curiosities I had ever seen.I followed him about and listened to him
talk to the passengers.And I learned that, like most of our young
men, he had entered the practice of medicine under the pressure of
dollars rather than altruism.Money is still the determining factor in
the choice of a profession by our young men.And success and fortune
in the medical profession, more than in any other, depend upon the
credulity of the ignorant and helpless human mind.""Do you deny that great progress has been made in the curative arts?""See what we have done with diphtheria, with typhoid,
with smallpox, and malaria!""Surely, Doctor, you can not believe that the mere temporary removing
of a disease is _real_ healing!You render one lot of microbes
innocuous, after thousands of years of experimentation, and leave
mankind subject to the rest.Do
you expect to go on that way, making set after set of microbes
harmless to the human body, and thus in time, after millions of years,
eradicate disease entirely?Do you think that people will then cease
to die?All the time you are working only in matter and through
material modes.Do you expect thereby to render the human sense of
life immortal?Your patients
get well, only to fall sick again.And death to you is still as
inevitable as ever, despite your boasted successes, is it not so?"He broke into a bantering laugh, but did not reply."Doctor, the human mind is self-inoculated.It will keep on
making them, until it is educated out of itself, and taught to do
better.Then it will give place to the real reflection of divine mind;
and human beings will be no more.Why don't you realize this, you
doctors, and get started on the right track?Your real work is in the
_mental_ realm."Well, I for one have little respect for faith cure--"

"Nor I," she interposed."Dependence upon material drugs, Doctor, is
reliance upon the _phenomena_ of the human mind.Faith cure is
dependence upon the human mind itself, upon the _noumenon_, instead of
the _phenomenon_.Hypnotism is mental
suggestion, the suggestions being human and material, not divine
truth.The drugging system is an outgrowth of the belief of life in
matter.Faith cure is the belief of life and power inherent in the
human mind.The origin of healing is
shrouded in mythology, and every step of its so-called progress has
been marked by superstition, dense ignorance, and fear.The first
doctor that history records was the Shaman, or medicine-man, whose
remedies reflected his mental status, and later found apt illustration
in the brew concocted by Macbeth's witches.And think you he has
disappeared?Unbelievable as it may seem, it was only a short time ago
that a case was reported from New York where the skin of a freshly
killed black cat was applied as a remedy for an ailment that had
refused to yield to the prescribed drugging!And only a few years ago
some one applied to the Liverpool museum for permission to touch a
sick child's head with one of the prehistoric stone axes there
exhibited.""That was mere superstition," retorted the doctor."But _materia medica_ is superstition incarnate.And because of the superstition that life and virtue and power are
resident in matter, mankind have swallowed nearly everything known to
material sense, in the hope that it would cure them of their own
auto-infection.You remember what awful recipes Luther gave for
disease, and his exclamation of gratitude: 'How great is the mercy of
God who has put such healing virtue in all manner of muck!'""Miss Carmen," resumed the doctor, "we physicians are workers, not
theorists.We handle conditions as we find them, not as they ought to
be.""You handle conditions as the
human, mortal mind believes them to be, that's all.You accept its
ugly pictures as real, and then you try desperately through
legislation to make us all accept them.Yet you would bitterly resent
it if some religious body should try to legislate its beliefs upon
you."Now listen, you doctors are rank materialists.Perhaps it is because,
as Hawthorne puts it, in your researches into the human frame your
higher and more subtle faculties are materialized, and you lose the
spiritual view of existence.Your only remedy for diseased matter is
more matter.Why, ignorance and
superstition have given rise to by far the larger number of remedies
in use by you to-day!And all of your attempts to rationalize medicine
and place it upon a systematic basis have signally failed, because the
only curative property a drug has is the credulity of the person who
swallows it.And that is a factor which varies with the individual.""The most advanced physicians give little medicine nowadays, Miss
Carmen.""They are beginning to get away from it, little by little," she
replied."In recent years it has begun to dawn upon doctors and
patients alike that the sick who recover do so, not because of the
drugs which they have taken, but _in spite of them_!One of the most
prominent of our contemporary physicians who are getting away from the
use of drugs has said that eighty-five per cent of all illnesses get
well of their own accord, no matter what may or may not be done for
them.In a very remarkable article from this same doctor's pen, in
which he speaks of the huge undertaking which physicians must assume
in order to clear away the _materia medica_ rubbish of the ages, he
states that the greatest struggle which the coming doctor has on his
hands is with drugs, and the deadly grip which they have on the
confidence and affections both of the profession and of the public.Among his illuminating remarks about the drug system, I found two
drastic statements, which should serve to lift the veil from the eyes
of the chronic drug taker.These are, first, 'Take away opium and
alcohol, and the backbone of the patent medicine business would be
broken inside of forty-eight hours,' and, second, 'No drug, save
quinine and mercury in special cases, will cure a disease.'In words
which he quotes from another prominent physician, 'He is the best
doctor who knows the worthlessness of most drugs.'"The hundreds of drugs listed in books on _materia medica_ I find are
gradually being reduced in number to a possible forty or fifty, and
one doctor makes the radical statement that they can be cut down to
the'six or seven real drugs.'Still further light has been thrown
upon the debasing nature of the drugging system by a member of the
Philadelphia Drug Exchange, in a recent hearing before the House
Committee on municipal affairs right here.He is reported as saying
that it makes little difference what a manufacturer puts into a patent
medicine, for, after all, the effect of the medicine depends upon the
faith of the user.The sick man who turns to patent medicines for
relief becomes the victim of 'bottled faith.'If his faith is
sufficiently great, a cure may be effected--and the treatment has been
_wholly mental_!The question of ethics does not concern either the
patent medicine manufacturer or the druggist, for they argue that if
the sick man's faith has been aroused to the point of producing a
cure, the formula of the medicine itself is of no consequence, and,
therefore, if a solution of sugar and water sold as a cure for colds
can stimulate the sufferer's faith to the point of meeting his need,
the business is quite legitimate.'A bunch of bottles and sentiment,'
adds this member of the Drug Exchange, 'are the real essentials for
working healing miracles.'"exclaimed the doctor, again sitting back and regarding her with
amazement."But, Doctor, I am intensely interested in my fellow-men.I want to
help them, and show them how to learn to live.""And I am doing all I can, the very best I
know how to do.""I guess you mean you are doing what you are prompted to do by every
vagrant impulse that happens to stray into your mentality, aren't
you?""You haven't really seriously thought out your
way, else you would not be here now urging Congress to spread a
blanket of ignorance over the human mind.If you will reflect
seriously, if you will lay aside monetary considerations, and a little
of the hoary prejudice of the ages, and will carefully investigate our
present medical systems, you will find a large number of schools of
medicine, bitterly antagonistic to one another, and each accusing the
other of inferiority as an exact science, and as grossly ignorant and
reprehensibly careless of life.But which of these warring schools can
show the greatest number of cures is a bit of data that has never been
ascertained.A recent writer says: 'As important as we all realize
health to be, the public is receiving treatment that is anything but
scientific, and the amount of unnecessary suffering that is going on
in the world is certainly enough to make a rock shed tears.'He
further says that, 'at least seventy-five per cent of the people we
meet who are apparently well, are suffering from some chronic ailment
that regular medical systems can not cure,' and that many of these
would try further experimentation were it not for the criticism that
is going on in the medical world regarding various curative systems.The only hope under the drugging system is that the patient's life and
purse may hold out under the strain of trying everything until he can
light upon the right thing before he reaches the end of the list.""And do you include surgery in your general criticism?""Surgery is no less an outgrowth of the belief of sentient matter than
is the drugging system," she replied."It is admittedly necessary in
the present stage of the world's thought; but it is likewise admitted
to be 'the very uncertain art of performing operations,' at least
ninety per cent of which are wholly unnecessary."You see," she went on, "the effect upon the _moral_ nature of the
sick man is never considered as rightfully having any influence upon
the choice of the system to be employed.If Beelzebub can cast out
demons, why not employ him?For, after all, the end to be attained is
the ejection of the demon.And if God had not intended minerals and
plants to be used as both food and medicine, why did He make them?Besides, man must earn his bread in some way under our present crude
and inhuman social system, and if the demand for drugs exists we may
be very sure it will be supplied by others, if not by ourselves.Again, the influence of commercialism as a determining factor in the
choice of a profession, is an influence that works to keep many in the
practice of a profession that they know to be both unscientific and
harmful.The result is an inevitable lowering of ideals to the lust of
material accumulation.""You certainly are hard on us poor doctors!And
we have done so much for you, too, despite your accusations.Think of
the babies that are now saved from diphtheria alone!""And think of the children who are the victims of the medical mania!""Think how they are brought up under the tyranny of
fear!Fear of this and of that; fear that if they scratch a finger
blood poisoning will deprive them of life; fear that eating a bit of
this will cause death; or sitting in a breeze will result in wasting
sickness!As for diphtheria antitoxin, it is in the
same class as the white of an egg.It is the
result of human belief, the belief that a horse that has recovered
from diphtheria can never again be poisoned by the microbe of that
disease.The microbe, Doctor, is the externalization in the human
mentality of the mortal beliefs of fear, of life and power in matter,
and of disease and death.The microbe will be subject, therefore, to
the human mind's changing thought regarding it, always.""Well then," said the doctor, "if people are spiritual, and if they
really are a consciousness, as you say, why do we seem to be carrying
about a body with us all the time--a body from which we are utterly
unable to get away?""It is because the mortal mind and body are one, Doctor.The body is
a lower stratum of the human mind.Hence, the so-called mind is
never distinct from its body to the extent of complete separation,
but always has its substratum with it.And, Doctor, the mind can not
hold a single thought without that thought tending to become
externalized--as Professor James tells us--and the externalization
generally has to do with the body, for the mind has come to center
all its hopes of happiness and pleasure in the body, and to base its
sense of life upon it.The body, being a mental concept formed of
false thought, passes away, from sheer lack of a definite principle
upon which to rest.Therefore the sense of life embodied in it passes
away with it.You know, the ancients had some idea of the cause of
disease when they attributed it to demons, for demons at least are
mental influences.But then, after that, men began to believe that
disease was sent by God, either to punish them for their evil deeds,
or to discipline and train them for paradise.Think
of regarding pain and suffering as divine agents!I don't wonder
people die, do you?Humboldt, you know, said: 'The time will come
when it will be considered a disgrace for a man to be sick, when the
world will look upon it as a misdemeanor, the result of some
vicious thinking.'Many people seem to think that thought affects
only the brain; but the fact is that _we think all over_!""But look here," put in the doctor."Here's a question I intended to
ask Hitt the other night.He said the five physical senses did not
testify truly.Well now, if, as you say, the eyes do not testify to
disease, then they can't testify to cures either, eh?"He sat back
with an air of triumph."The physical senses testify only to
belief.In the case of sickness, they testify to false belief.In the
case of a cure, they testify to a changed belief, to a belief of
recovered health, that is all.It is all on the basis of human belief,
you see."But--nerves feel--"

"Nerves, Doctor, like all matter, are externalizations of human
thought.Can the externalization of thought talk back to thought?You are still on the basis of mere human belief."At that moment the doctor leaned over and tapped upon the window to
attract the attention of some one in the street.Carmen looked out and
caught sight of a tall, angular man dressed in clerical garb.The man
bowed pleasantly to the doctor, and cast an inquiring glance at the
girl, then passed on."Yes, Tetham," said the doctor."Oh, is that the man who maintains the lobby here at the Capital for
his Church?He--well, it is his business to see
that members of his Church are promoted to political office, isn't it?He trades votes of whole districts to various congressmen in return
for offices for strong church members.He also got the parochial
schools of New York exempt from compulsory vaccination.The
Express--"

"Eh?Wales in his work on the cotton schedule.And so
we heard from Father Tetham.He is supporting the National Bureau of
Health bill.He is working for the Laetare medal.He--"

"Say, Miss Carmen, will you tell me where you pick up your news?Do you know something about everybody here in
Washington?""I have learned much here," she said, "about popular
government as exemplified by these United States.But it is especially saddening to see our
constitutional liberties threatened by this Bureau of Health bill, and
by the Government's constant truckling to the Church of Rome.Doctor,
can it be that you want to commit this nation to the business of
practicing medicine, and to its practice according to the allopathic,
or'regular' school?The American Medical Association, with its
reactionary policies and repressive tendencies, is making strenuous
endeavors to influence Congress to enact certain measures which would
result in the creation of such a Department of Health, the effect of
which would be to monopolize the art of healing and to create a
'healing trust.'If this calamity should be permitted to come upon the
American people, it would fall as a curtain of ignorance and
superstition over our fair land, and shut out the light of the dawning
Sun of Truth.It would mean a reversion to the blight and mold of the
Middle Ages, in many respects a return in a degree to the ignorance
and tyranny that stood for so many centuries like an impassable rock
in the pathway of human progress.The attempt to foist upon a
progressive people a system of medicine and healing which is wholly
unscientific and uncertain in its effects, but which is admittedly
known to be responsible for the death of millions and for untold
suffering and misery, and then to say, '_Thou shalt be cured thereby,
or not be cured at all_,' is an insult to the intelligence of the
Fathers of our liberties, and a crime upon a people striving for the
light.It smacks of the Holy Inquisition: You accept our creed, or you
shall go to hell--after we have broken you on the rack!Why, the
thought of subjecting this people to years of further dosing and
experimentation along the materialistic lines of the'regular' school,
of curtailing their liberties, and forcing their necks under the yoke
of medical tyranny, should come to them with the insistence of a
clarion call, and startle them into such action that the subtle evil
which lurks behind this proposed legislative action would be dragged
out into the light and exterminated!To permit commercialism and
greed, the lust of mammon, and the pride of the flesh that expresses
itself in the demand, 'Who shall be greatest?'to dictate the course
of conduct that shall shape the destinies of a great people, is to
admit the failure of free government, and to revert to a condition of
mind that we had thought long since outgrown.To yield our dear-bought
liberties to Italian ecclesiastics, on the other hand--well, Doctor,
_it is just unthinkable_!"Well, at least you are delightfully frank with me.Yet you have
the effect of making me feel as if--as if I were in some way behind a
veil.That--"

"Well, the human mind is very decidedly behind a veil--indeed, behind
many of them.Mankind just grope
about all their lives back of these veils, not knowing that God is
right before them all the time.God has got to be everything, or else
He will be nothing.With or without drugs, it is God 'who healeth all
thy diseases.'The difficulty with physicians is that they are densely
ignorant of what healing means, and so they always start with a
dreadful handicap.They believe that there is something real to be
overcome--and of course fail to permanently overcome it.Many of them
are not only pitiably ignorant, but are in the profession simply to
make money out of the fears and credulity of the people.Doctor, the
physician of to-day is in no way qualified to handle the question of
public health--especially those doctors who say: 'If you won't take
our medicines we'll get a law passed that will make you take them.'To
place the health of the people in their hands would be a terrible
mistake.The agitation for a federal Department of Health is based
upon motives of ignorance and intentional wrong.If the people
generally knew this, they would rise in a body against it.Make what
laws you wish for yourself, Doctor.The human mind is constantly
occupied in the making of ridiculous laws and limitations.But do not
attempt to foist your laws upon the people.Tell me, why all this
agitation about teaching sex-hygiene in the public schools?Why not,
for a change, teach Christianity?But even
the Bible has been put out of the schools.By your
Church, that its interpretation may continue to be falsely made by
those utterly and woefully ignorant of its true meaning!"For some moments they continued their meal in silence.Then the girl
took up the conversation again."Doctor," she said, "will you come out
from among them and be separate?""Ah, that is the rub, then!Yes, oppose ignorance and falsity, even
though incarnate in Mr."He ruins everybody who
stands in his way!The cotton schedule has gone against him, and the
whole country will have to suffer for it!""But how can he make the country suffer because he has been blocked in
his colossal selfishness?""That I can not answer," said the doctor."But I do know that he has
intimated that there will be no cotton crop in this country next
year."Ames stands as the claim of omnipotent
evil," was his laconic reply.And when the meal was ended, the girl went her way, pondering deeply.But that was something too
dark to be reported to the Express.*       *       *       *       *

Three weeks from the day he had his brush with Carmen in the presence
of the President, Ames, the great corruptionist, the master
manipulator, again returned from a visit to Washington, and in a
dangerous frame of mind.What might have been his mental state had he
known that the train which drew his private car also brought Carmen
back to New York, can only be conjectured.It was fortunate, no doubt,
that both were kept in ignorance of that fact, and that, while the
great externalization of the human mind's "claim" of business sulked
alone in his luxurious apartments, the little follower after
righteousness sat in one of the stuffy day coaches up ahead, holding
tired, fretful babies, amusing restless children, and soothing away
the long hours to weary, care-worn mothers.When the financier's car drew into the station his valets breathed
great sighs of relief, and his French chef and <DW64> porter mopped the
perspiration from their troubled brows, while silently offering peans
of gratitude for safe delivery.When the surly giant descended the car
steps his waiting footman drew back in alarm, as he caught his
master's black looks.When he threw himself into the limousine, his
chauffeur drew a low whistle and sent a timidly significant glance in
the direction of the lackey.And when at last he flung open the doors
of his private office and loudly summoned Hood, that capable and
generally fearless individual quaked with dire foreboding."The Express--I want a libel suit brought against it at once!"Yes, sir," responded the lawyer meekly.Then, in a voice trembling with
anger: "Have you read the last week's issues?"She has no financial interest in the paper, sir.And, as for the
reports which they have published--I hardly think we can establish a
case from them--"

"What?If you and he can't make out a case
against them, then I'll get a judge and a lawyer who can!I want that
bill filed to-morrow!""Very well, sir," assented Hood, stepping back."Another thing," continued Ames, "see Judge Hanson and have the
calling of the Ketchim case held in abeyance until I am ready for it.I've got a scheme to involve that <DW64> wench in the trial, and drag
her through the gutters!So, she's still in love with Rincon, eh?Well, we'll put a crimp in that little affair, I guess!Has Willett
heard from Wenceslas?""I'll lift the scalp from that blackguard Colombian prelate if he
tries to trick me!But the detectives report that he has been in Spain
recently."he exclaimed in a voice that began
high and ended in a whisper.He lapsed into a reflective mood, and for some moments his thoughts
seemed to wander far.Then he pulled himself together and roused out
of his meditations."You told Jayne that I would back the Budget to any extent, provided
it would publish the stuff I sent it?"You and Willett set about at once getting up daily
articles attacking the Express.I want you to dig up every move ever
made by Hitt, Haynerd, that girl, Waite, Morton, and the whole
miserable, sneaking outfit!Rake up every scandal, every fact, or
rumor, that is in any way associated with any of them.I want them
literally cannonaded by the Budget!Haynerd was a bum before he got the Social Era!Waite is an unfrocked
priest!That girl--that girl is
a--Did you know that she used to be in a brothel down in the red-light
district?Great record the publishers of the Express
have, eh?I want you and Jayne to bury that whole outfit
under a mountain of mud!I'm ready to spend ten millions to do it!"I think we can do it, Mr.Now, another matter: I'm out to get the President's
scalp!Begin with those New York papers which we
can influence.I'll get Fallom and Adams over here for a conference.Meanwhile, think over what we'd better say to them.Our attacks upon
the President must begin at once!I've already bought up a Washington
daily for that purpose.They have a few facts now that will discredit
his administration!"Ah--a--there is a matter that I must mention as
soon as you are ready to hear it, Mr.It seems
that the reports which that girl has made have been translated into
several languages, and are being used by labor agitators down there to
stir up trouble.The mill hands, you know, never really understood
what your profits were, and--well, they have always been quite
ignorant, you know, regarding any details of the business.But now
they think they have been enlightened--they think they see how the
tariff has benefited you at their expense--and they are extremely
bitter against you.That priest, Father Danny, has been doing a lot of
talking since the girl was down there."cried Ames, rising from his chair, then sinking back again.Ames," the lawyer continued, "the situation is fast
becoming acute.The mill hands don't believe now that you were ever
justified in shutting down, or putting them on half time.And, whether
you reduce wages or not, they are going to make very radical demands
upon you in the near future, unless I am misinformed.These demands
include better working conditions, better tenements, shorter hours,
and very much higher wages.Also the enforcement of the child labor
law, I am sorry to say."Ames, you know you have said that it would
strengthen your case with Congress if there should be a strike at
Avon."I am
distinctly out of favor with the President--owing to that little <DW64>
wench!And Congress is going against me if I lose Gossitch, Logue, and
Mall!That girl has put me in bad down there!By G--"

"But, Mr.Ames, she can be removed, can she not?"But--if we can drive the
Express upon the shoals, and then utterly discredit that girl, either
in the libel suit or the Ketchim trial, why, then, with a little show
of bettering things at Avon, we'll get what we want.Say, is--is Sidney with the Express?"Hood started, and shot a look of mingled surprise and curiosity at his
master.Was it possible that Ames--

"You heard my question, Mr.Yes, sir--Sidney is still with them.He--a--they say
he has quite conquered his--his--"

"You mean, he's no longer a sot?"Don't sit there like a smirking Chinese god!"Ames, I learn that Sidney has been cured of his habits, and
that the--that girl--did it," stammered the nervous lawyer.Ames's mouth jerked open--and then snapped shut.His
head slowly sank until his chin touched his breast.And as he sat thus
enwrapped, Hood rose and noiselessly left the room.Alone sat the man of gold--ah, more alone than even he knew.Alone
with his bruised ambitions, his hectored egoism, his watery aims.Alone and plotting the ruin of those who had dared bid him halt in his
mad, destroying career.Alone, this high priest of the caste of
absolutism, of the old individualism which is fast hurrying into the
realm of the forgotten.Alone, and facing a new century, with whose
ideals his own were utterly, stubbornly, hopelessly discrepant.Alone he sat, looking out, unmoved, upon the want and pain of
countless multitudes gone down beneath the yoke of conditions which he
had made too hard for them.Looking, unmoved, unhearing, upon the
bitter struggles of the weak, the ignorant, the unskilled, the gross
hewers of wood and drawers of water.Looking, and knowing not that in
their piteous cry for help and light was sounded his own dire peril.The door opened, and the office boy announced the chief stenographer
of the great bank below.Ames looked up and silently nodded permission
for the man to enter.Ames," the clerk began, "I--I have come to ask a favor--a
great favor.I am having difficulty--considerable difficulty in
securing stenographers, but--I may say--my greatest struggle is
with myself.Ames, I can not--I simply can not continue to
hire stenographers at the old wage, nine dollars a week!I know how
these girls are forced to live.Ames, with prices where they
are now, they can not live on that!Say,
ten or twelve dollars to start with?""Why do you come to me with your request?""Yes, sir, I know," replied the young man with hesitation."But--I--did
speak to him about it, and--he refused.""I can do nothing, sir," returned Ames in a voice that chilled the
man's life-current.I refuse to remain here and hire
stenographers at that criminal wage!""Very well, sir," replied Ames in the same low, freezing tone.Again the guardian of the sanctity of private property was left alone.Again, as he lapsed into dark revery, his thought turned back upon
itself, and began the reconstruction of scenes and events long since
shadowy dreams.And always as they built, the fair face of that young
girl appeared in the fabric.And always as he retraced his course, her
path crossed and crossed again his own.Always as he moved, her
reflection fell upon him--not in shadow, but in a flood of light,
exposing the secret recesses of his sordid soul.He dwelt again upon the smoothness of his way in those days, before
her advent, when that group of canny pirates sat about the Beaubien's
table and laid their devious snares.It was only the summer before she
came that this same jolly company had merged their sacred trust assets
to draw the clouds which that autumn burst upon the country as the
worst financial panic it had known in years.And so shrewdly had they
planned, that the storm came unheralded from a clear sky, and at a
time when the nation was never more prosperous.They had wagered that he could not put it
through.How neatly he had turned the trick, filled his pockets, and
transformed their doubts into wondering admiration!Oh, yes, there had been some suffering, he had been told.How surprised the people of these United
States would be some day to learn that this tropic struggle was in
essence an American war!The smug and unthinkingly contented in this
great country of ours regarded the frenzied combat in the far South as
but a sort of _opera bouffe_.And he,
when that war should end, would control navigation on the great
Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and acquire a long-term lease on the
emerald mines near Bogota.Untold suffering--countless
broken hearts--indescribable, maddening torture--he had not given that
a thought.His trip to Washington had been
exhausting.His eyes had been bloodshot,
and there had been several slight hemorrhages from the nose.His
physician had shaken his head gravely, and had admonished him to be
careful--

But why did that girl continue to fascinate him?Why now,
in all his scheming and plotting, did he always see her before him?Was it only because of her rare physical beauty?If he wrote or read,
her portrait lay upon the page; if he glanced up, she stood there
facing him.There was never accusation in her look, never malice, nor
trace of hate.No; but always she
smiled--always she looked right into his eyes--always she seemed to
say, "You would destroy me, but yet I love you."Aye, much more so than he did her.She would scorn the use of his
methods.He had to admit _that_, though he hated her, detested her,
would have torn her into shreds--even while he acknowledged that he
admired her, yes, beyond all others, for her wonderful bravery and her
loyal stand for what she considered the right.He must have dozed while he sat there in the warm office alone.Surely, that hideous object now floating before his straining gaze,
that thing resembling the poor, shattered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, was not
real!It was but a shadow, a flimsy thing of thought!And that
woestricken thing there, with its tenuous arms extended toward
him--was that Gannette?But, that other shade--so like his wife, a few months dead, yet alive
again!Whence came that look of horror in a face once so haughty!It
was unreal, ghastly unreal, as it drifted past!Ah, now he knew that
he was dreaming, for there, there in the light stood Carmen!Oh, what
a blessed relief to see that fair image there among those other
ghastly sights!He would speak to her--

But--_God above_!_What was that?_ A woman--no, not Carmen--fair
and--

Her white lips moved--they were transparent--he could see right
through them--and great tears dropped from her bloodless cheeks when
her accusing look fell upon him!Slowly she floated nearer--she stopped before him, and laid a hand
upon his shoulder--it was cold, cold as ice!He tried to call out--to
rise--to break away--

And then, groaning aloud, and with his brow dripping perspiration, he
awoke.Hood entered, but stopped short when he saw his master's white face.Ames passed a hand across his wet forehead."A--a little tired, that's
all, I guess.The lawyer laid a large envelope upon the desk."There's a delegation of Avon mill hands in the outer office.Again he
seemed to see that smiling girl before him.His jaw set, and his face
drew slowly down into an expression of malignity.Then, without
examining its contents, he tore the envelope into shreds, and cast the
pieces into the waste basket."Wire Pillette at
once to discharge these fellows, and every one else concerned in the
agitation!If those rats down there want to fight, they'll find me
ready!"CHAPTER 14


The immense frame of J. Wilton Ames bent slightly, and the great legs
might have been seen to drag a bit, as the man entered his private
elevator the morning after his rejection of the mill hands' demands,
and turned the lever that caused the lift to soar lightly to his
office above.And a mouse--had the immaculate condition of his
luxurious _sanctum_ permitted such an alien dweller--could have seen
him sink heavily into his great desk chair, and lapse into deep
thought.Hood, Willett, and Hodson entered in turn; but the magnate
gave them scant consideration, and at length waved them all away, and
bent anew to his meditations.Truth to tell--though he would not have owned it--the man was now
dimly conscious of a new force at work upon him; of a change, slowly,
subtly taking place somewhere deep within.He was feebly cognizant of
emotions quite unknown; of unfamiliar sentiments, whose outlines were
but just crystallizing out from the thick magma of his materialistic
soul.And he fought them; he hated them; they made him appear unto himself
weak, even effeminate!His abhorrence of sentimentalism had been among
the strongest of his life-characteristics; and yet, though he could
not define it, a mellowing something seemed to be acting upon him that
dull, bitterly cold winter morning, that shed a soft glow throughout
his mental chambers, that seemed to touch gently the hard, rugged
things of thought that lay within, and soften away their sharp
outlines.He might not know what lay so heavily upon his thought, as
he sat there alone, with his head sunk upon his breast.And yet the
girl who haunted his dreams would have told him that it was an
interrogation, even the eternal question, "What shall it profit a
man--?"Had ever such heavenly music touched his ears before!He would have held out his arms to her if he could.And yet, how dared she come to him?How dared she, after what she had
done?To
stand within the protection which her sex afforded and vivisect anew
his tired soul?But, whatever her motives, this girl did the most
daring things he had ever seen a woman do."Isn't it funny," she said, as she stood before him with a whimsical
little smile, "that wherever I go people so seldom ask me to sit
down!"Ames sank back into his seat without speaking.Carmen stood for a
moment looking about her rich environment; then drew up a chair close
to him."You haven't the slightest idea why I have come here, have you?"she
said sweetly, looking up into his face."I must confess myself quite ignorant of the cause of this unexpected
pleasure," he returned guardedly, bending his head in mock deference,
while the great wonder retained possession of him."Well," she went on lightly, "will you believe me when I tell you that
I have come here because I love you?"So this was an attack from
a different quarter!Hitt and Haynerd had invoked her feminine wiles,
eh?With one blow the unfamiliar sentiment which had been
shedding its influence upon him that morning laid the ugly suspicion
dead at his feet.A single glance into that sweet face turned so
lovingly up to his brought his own deep curse upon himself for his
hellish thought."You know," she bubbled, with a return of her wonted airy gaiety, "I
just had to run the gauntlet through guards and clerks and office boys
to get here.Aren't you glad I didn't send in my card?For then you
would have refused to see me, wouldn't you?""If I
had known you were out there," he said more gently, "I'd have sent out
and had you dragged in.I--I have wanted something this morning; and
now I am sure it was--"

"Yes," she interrupted, taking the words out of his mouth, "you wanted
_me_.You see, it's just absolutely impossible to
oppose anybody who loves you.You know, that's the very method Jesus
gave for overcoming our enemies--to love them, just love them to
pieces, until we find that we haven't any enemies at all any more.Well, that's the way I've been doing with
you--just loving you."The man's brows knotted, and his lips tightened.Or was there aught but the deepest sincerity expressed
in the face from which he could not take his eyes?And
yet, did ever human being talk so strangely, so weirdly, as she?"I thought you looked upon me as a human monster."After all,
there was a note of pathos in the question.Carmen laid her hand upon
his."It's the _real_ you that I love," she answered gently."The monster
is only human thought--the thought that has seemed to mesmerize you.But you are going to throw off the mesmerism, aren't you?I'll help
you," she added brightly."You're going to put off the 'old man'
completely--and you're going to begin by opening yourself and letting
in a little love for those poor people down at Avon, aren't you?At the mention of the people of Avon his face became stern and dark.She had not mentioned the Beaubien,
Miss Wall, the Express, nor herself."You see, you don't understand, Mr.You'll be, oh, so surprised
some day when you learn a little about the laws of thought--even the
way human thought operates!For you can't possibly do another person
an injury without that injury flying back and striking you.You may not feel the effects of its return right
away--but it does return, and the effects accumulate.And then, some
day, when you least expect it, comes the crash!But, when you love a
person, why, that comes back to you too; and it never comes alone.It
just brings loads of good with it.Ames," she cried, suddenly rising and seizing both his hands,
"you've just _got_ to love those people down there!You can't help it,
even if you think you can, for hate is not real--it's an awful
delusion!"It was not so much an appeal which the girl made as an affirmation of
things true and yet to come.The mighty _Thou shalt not!_ which Moses
laid upon his people, when transfused by the omnipotent love of the
Christ was transformed from a clanking chain into a silken cord.The
restriction became a prophecy; for when thou hast yielded self to the
benign influence of the Christ-principle, then, indeed, thou shalt not
desire to break the law of God.Carmen returned to her chair, and sat eagerly expectant.Ames groped
within his thought for a reply.And then his mental grasp closed upon
the words of Hood."They are very bitter against me--they hate me!""They reflect in kind your thought of
them.Your boomerangs of greed, of exploitation, of utter indifference
which you have hurled at them, have returned upon you in hatred.Do
you know that hatred is a fearful poison?And do you know that
another's hatred resting upon you is deadly, unless you know how to
meet and neutralize it with love?For love is the neutralizing
alkaloid.""Love is--weakness," he said in a low tone.Why, there is no such mighty power in the whole
universe as love!"We argue from different
standpoints," he said."I am a plain, matter-of-fact, cold-blooded
business man."And that," she replied in a voice tinged with sadness, "is why
business is such chaos; why there is so much failure, so much anxiety,
fear, loss, and unhappiness in the business world.Ames, you
haven't the slightest conception of real business, have you?"Then, brightly, "I am in business,
Mr.The business of
attempting to annihilate me!""I am in the business of reflecting good to you, and to all mankind,"
she gently corrected."Then suppose you manifest your love for me by refraining from
meddling further in my affairs.Suppose from now on you let me
alone.""Why--I am not meddling with you, Mr.He opened a drawer of the desk and took out several copies of
the Express."I am to consider that this is not strictly meddling,
eh?"he continued, as he laid the papers before her."No, not at all," she promptly replied."That's uncovering evil, so's
it can be destroyed.All that evil, calling itself you and your
business, has got to come to the surface--has got to come up to the
light, so that it can be--"

"Ah!Then I, the monster, must be exposed, eh?And the mines and mills which I
own--"

"You own nothing, Mr.Ames, except by consent of the people whom you
oppress.They will wake up some day; and then state and national
ownership of public utilities will come, forced by such as you.""And that desideratum will result in making everybody honest, I
suppose?"All our
present troubles, whether domestic, business, civic, or social, come
from a total misapprehension of the nature of God--a misunderstanding
of what is really _good_.We have _all_ got to prove Him.And we are
very foolish to lose any more time setting about it, don't you think
so?"You see," she went on, while he sat studying her, "those poor people
down at Avon don't know any more about what is the real good than you
do.And that's why their thoughts and yours center upon the false
pleasures of this ephemeral existence called life--this existence of
the so-called physical senses--and why you both become the tools of
vice, disease, and misfortune.They build up such men as you, and then
you turn about and crush them.And in the end you are both what the
Bible says--poor, deluded fools.""Well, I'll be--"

"Oh, don't swear!"she pleaded, again seizing his hand and laughing up
into his face."It's time you started to prove God," she said earnestly."Won't you
begin now--to-day?Haven't you yet learned that evil is the very
stupidest, dullest, most uninteresting thing in the world?Won't you turn from your material endeavors now, and take time
to learn to really live?You've got plenty of time, you know, for you
aren't obliged to work for a living."She was leaning close to him, and her breath touched his cheek.Her
soft little hand lay upon his own.And her great, dark eyes looked
into his with a light which he knew, despite his perverted thought,
came from the unquenchable flame of her selfless love.Again that unfamiliar sentiment--nay, rather, that sentiment long
dormant--stirred within him.Again his worldly concepts, long
entrenched, instantly rose to meet and overthrow it.He had not yet
learned to analyze the thoughts which crept so silently into his
ever-open mentality.And to those
which savored of things earthy he still gave the power to build, with
himself as a willing tool."You will--help me--to live?"He thought her the most
gloriously beautiful object he had ever known, as she sat there before
him, so simply gowned, and yet clothed with that which all the gold of
Ophir could not have bought."Yes, gladly--oh, so gladly!"Her eyes sparkled with a rush of tears."Don't you think," he said gently, drawing his chair a little closer
to her, "that we have quite misunderstood each other?"But," with a happy smile
again lighting her features, "we can understand each other now, can't
we?"And hasn't the time come for us to work together,
instead of continuing to oppose each other?""I--I have been thinking so ever since I returned yesterday from
Washington.I am--I--"

"We need each other, don't we?"the artless girl exclaimed, as she
beamed upon him."I can help
you--more than you realize--and I want to.I--I've been sorry for you,
little girl, mighty sorry, ever since that story got abroad about--"

"Oh, never mind that!""We are living in the
present, you know."And I
want to see them straightened out.And you and I can do it, little
one.Madam Beaubien hasn't been treated right, either."We're going to
forget that in the good we're going to do, aren't we?"And you are going to get a square deal.Now, I've got
a plan to make everything right.I want to see you in the place that
belongs to you.I want to see you happy, and surrounded by all that is
rightfully yours.And if you will join me, we will bring that all
about.I told you this once before, you may remember."He stopped and awaited the effect of his words upon the girl.Ames," she replied, her eyes shining with a great hope,
"don't think about me!It's the people at Avon that I want to help.""We'll help them, you and I. We'll make things right all round.And
Madam Beaubien shall have no further trouble."Sidney shall come home--"

With a rush the impulsive girl, forgetting all but the apparent
success of her mission, threw herself upon him and clasped her arms
about his neck."Oh," she cried, "it is love that has done all this!The startled man strained the girl tightly in his arms.He could feel
the quick throbbing in her throat.Her warm breath played upon his
cheek like fitful tropic breezes.For a brief moment the supreme gift
of the universe seemed to be laid at his feet.For a fleeting interval
the man of dust faded, and a new being, pure and white, seemed to rise
within him."Yes," he murmured gently, "we'll take him to our home with us."Slowly, very slowly, the girl released herself from his embrace and
stepped back.she murmured, searching his face for the
meaning which she had dimly discerned in his words.He reached forward and with a quick movement seized her
hand.Not now--no, you
needn't come to me until you are ready.Why, I didn't know until to-day what it was that was making
me over!Don't--"

Carmen had struggled away from him, and, with a look of bewilderment
upon her face, was moving toward the door."Oh, I didn't know," she
murmured, "that you were--were--proposing _marriage_ to me!"We'll begin all over again, you and I!Why, I'll do anything--anything
in the world you say, Carmen, if you will come to me--if you will be
my little wife!"I know--I know," he hastily resumed, as she halted and stood
seemingly rooted to the floor, "there is a great difference in our
ages.But that is nothing--many happy marriages are made between ages
just as far apart as ours.I'll make Madam Beaubien rich!I'll support the
Express, and make it what you want it to be!I'll do whatever you say
for the people of Avon!Think, little girl, what depends now upon
you!"Carmen turned and came slowly back to him."And--you will not do these
things--unless I marry you?"she said in a voice scarcely above a
whisper."I will do them all, Carmen, if you will come to me!""But--oh, you were only deceiving me all the time!And now--if I
refuse--then what?""It depends upon you, entirely--and you will come?Not now--but within
the next few months--within the year--tell me that you will!""But--you will do these things whether I come to you or not?""I've put it all into your hands," he answered shortly.Then
she glanced about in helpless bewilderment."I--I--love--you," she murmured, as she looked off toward the window,
but with unseeing eyes."I would do anything for you that was right.I--love--everybody--everybody; but there are no conditions to _my_
love.she suddenly cried, burying her face in her hands and
bursting into tears."You have tried to _buy_ me!"Taking her by the hand he led her,
unresisting, back to her chair."Listen," he said, bending toward her."Go home now and think it
all over.It was sudden, I admit; I
took you by surprise.But--well, you are not going to prevent the
accomplishment of all that good, are you?She had been crushed; and
another lesson in the cruelty of the human mind--that human mind which
has changed not in a thousand years--had been read to her.But again
she smiled bravely, as she wiped her eyes."It's all right now," she murmured."It was all right all the
time--and I was protected.""Some day," she said gently, and in a voice
that trembled just a little, "you will help the people of Avon, but
not because I shall marry you."Then you refuse my offer, do you?""Remember, all the blame will be upon you.She saw now with a clairvoyance which separated
him from the mask which he had worn.Her glance penetrated until it
found his soul."You have shown me the depths of the carnal mind," she slowly replied."The responsibility is not with me, but with--God.I--I came to-day
to--to help you.But now I must leave you--with Him."He stooped and took up her muff which lay upon the floor.As he did so,
a letter fell out.He seized it and glanced at the superscription.Another little _billet-doux_ to your
priestly lover, eh?"She looked down at the letter which he held."It is money," she said,
though her thought seemed far away."Money that I am sending to a
little newsboy who bears his name."He rose and opened a drawer in his desk.Taking out a paper-bound
book, he held it out to the girl."Here's a
little piece of work which your brilliant lover did some time ago.Do you know the penalty your
clerical paramour paid for that, eh?Then I'll tell you," bending over
close to her ear, "his _life_!"She staggered
a few steps toward the door, then stopped."God--is--is--_everywhere_!"Then she reeled, and fell heavily to the floor.CHAPTER 15


If additional proof of the awful cost of hating one's fellow-men were
required, the strike which burst upon the industrial world that winter
must furnish it in sickening excess.But other facts, too, were
rendered glaringly patent by that same desperate clash which made Avon
a shambles and transformed its fair name into a by-word, to be spoken
only in hushed whispers when one's thought dwells for a moment upon
the madness of the carnal mind that has once tasted blood.The
man-cleft chasm between labor and capital, that still unbridged void
which separates master and servant, and which a money-drunk class
insolently calls God-made, grows wider with each roar of musketry
aimed by a frenzied militia at helpless men and women; grows deeper
with each splitting crack of the dynamite that is laid to tear asunder
the conscienceless wielder of the goad; and must one day fall gaping
in a cavernous embouchure that will engulf a nation.Hitt saw it, and shuddered; Haynerd, too.Ames may have dimly marked
the typhoon on the horizon, but, like everything that manifested
opposition to this superhuman will, it only set his teeth the firmer
and thickened the callous about his cold heart.And she knew--and the world must some day know--that but one tie has
ever been designed adequate to bridge this yawning canon of human
hatred.Aye, well she knew that the world laughed,
and called it chimera; called it idealism, and emotional weakness.And well she knew that the most pitiable weakness the world has ever
seen was the class privilege which nailed the bearer of the creed of
love upon the cross, and to-day manifests in the frantic grasping of a
nation's resources, and the ruthless murder of those who ask that
they, too, may have a share in that abundance which is the common
birthright of all.Do the political bully, the grafter, the tout, know
the meaning of love?Oh, not by the
hypocritical millionaire pietists who prate their glib platitudes to
their Sunday Bible classes, and return to their luxurious homes to
order the slaughter of starving women and babes!They, like their poor
victims, are deep under the spell of that mesmerism which tells them
that evil is good.Nor by the Church, with its lamentable weakness of
knowledge and works.Only by those who have learned something of the
Christ-principle, and are striving daily to demonstrate its
omnipotence in part, can the world be taught a saving knowledge of the
love that solves every problem and creates a new heaven and a newer,
better concept of the earth and its fullness.That morning when Carmen went to see Ames the Express received word of
the walk-out of the Avon mill employes.Almost coincident with the
arrival of the news, Carmen herself came unsteadily into Hitt's
office.The editor glanced up at her, then looked a second time.He
had never before seen her face colorless."What work have you--for me--to-day?"Then, so low that he scarcely caught the
words, "I--I have been with--a friend."Sidney Ames came puffing into the office at that moment."How does it happen you're out riding with
Willett?Saw him help you out of an auto just now.""He brought me here," she answered softly.Hitt and the lad stared at her with open mouths.She turned, and
started for her own room, moving as if in a haze.As she neared the
door she stumbled.Sidney sprang after her and caught her in his arms.When she turned her face, they saw that her eyes were swimming in
tears.Hitt closed the door after him, then took
the girl's hand and led her back to his own chair."Now, little one,"
he said gently, "tell me all about it."Then the tears began to flow; and then she
leaned her head against him and sobbed--sobbed as does the stricken
mother who hangs over the lifeless form of her babe--sobbed as does
the strong man bereft of the friend of his bosom--sobbed as did the
Man of Sorrow, when he held out his arms over the worldly city that
cruelly rejected him.He was the channel for the divine; yet the
wickedness of the human mind broke his great heart.Carmen was not far
from him at that moment.Hitt held her hand, and choked back the lump that filled his throat.Then the weeping slowly ceased, and the girl looked up into his
anxious face."It's all past now," she said brokenly."Jesus forgave them that
killed him.And--"

"You have been with--Ames?"said Hitt in a low, quiet tone."And he
tried to kill you?""He--he knew not what he was doing.Evil used him, because as
yet he has no spiritual understanding."Well, little girl, I am waiting for the whole story.It
didn't happen--it wasn't real.I--I seemed to manifest weakness--and I
fell--to the floor--but I didn't lose consciousness."But what had Ames said to you, Carmen?"persisted Hitt, his face dark
with anger.Ames only as--as God's child," she
murmured."Evil is not real, and it doesn't happen.Now I want to
work--work as I never did before!_I must!_"

"Will you not tell me more about it?"he asked, for he knew now that a
deadly thrust had been made at the girl's life."It didn't happen," was her
reply.A suspicion flashed into Hitt's mind, kindled by the girl's insistence
upon the nothingness of death."Carmen," he asked, "did he tell you
that--some one had died?"She came to him and laid her head against him.I shall overcome it, for God is with me.Promise that no
one but us shall know!The man's eyes grew moist, and his throat filled.He drew the girl to
him and kissed her forehead."It shall be as you wish, little one," he
said in a choking voice.This is another
opportunity to--to prove God!He turned to his desk with a heavy heart."There is work to be done
now," he said."I wonder--"

She took the telegram from his hands and scanned it.At once she
became calm, her own sorrow swallowed up in selfless love."Oh, they
have gone out at Avon!Hitt, I must go there at once!""I thought so," he replied, swallowing hard.But you are in higher hands than mine, Carmen.And we, Sidney and I, will
say nothing of--of your visit to his father."*       *       *       *       *

That night Hitt called up the Beaubien and asked if he and Haynerd
might come and talk with her after the paper had gone to press, and
requesting that she notify Carmen and Father Waite.A few hours later
the little group met quietly in the humble cottage.Miss Wall and
Sidney were with them.And to them all those first dark hours of
morning, when as yet the symbol of God's omnipresence hung far below
the horizon, seemed prescient with a knowledge of evil's further
claims to the lives and fortunes of men."I have asked you here," Hitt gravely announced when they were
assembled, "to consider a matter which touches us all--how deeply, God
alone knows.At ten o'clock to-night I received this message."He
opened the paper which he held in his hand and read:

  "'Property of Hitt oil company, including derricks, pump houses,
  storage tanks, destroyed by fire.Dynamite in pump houses
  exploded, causing wells to cave and choke.The news burst over them like the cracking of a bomb.Haynerd, who,
like the others, had been kept in ignorance of the message until now,
started from his chair with a loud exclamation, then sank back limp.Evil seemed to have chosen that day with
canny shrewdness to overwhelm her with its quick sallies from out the
darkness of the carnal mind."I see in this," he said slowly, "the
culmination of a long series of efforts to ruin the Express.That my
oil property was deliberately wrecked, I have not the slightest doubt.demanded Haynerd, having again found his voice."The Express has stood before the world as a
paper unique and apart.And because of its high ideals, the forces of
evil singled it out at the beginning for their murderous assaults.That the press of this country is very generally muzzled, stifled,
bought and paid for, I have good reason now to know.My constant
brushes with the liquor interests, with low politicians, judges,
senators, and dive-keepers, have not been revealed even to you.Could
you know the pressure which the Church, both Catholic and Protestant,
has tried to exert upon us, you would scarce credit me with veracity.But the Express has stood out firm against feudalism, mediaevalism,
and entrenched ecclesiasticism.It has fearlessly opposed the
legalizing of drugging.It has fought the debauching of a nation's
manhood by the legalized sale of a deadly poison, alcohol.And it has
fought without quarter the pernicious activity of morally stunted
brewers and distillers, whose hellish motto is, 'Make the boys drink!'It has fought the money octopus, and again and again has sounded to
the world the peril which money-drunken criminals like Ames and his
clique constitute.And for that we must now wear the crown of
martyrdom!"Silence, dismal and empty, lay over the little room for a long time."The Express has not been self-supporting.Its
growth has been steady, but it has depended for its deficit upon the
revenue from my oil property.Ames ruined Madam
Beaubien financially, as well as Miss Wall.And now, knowing that we all depended upon my oil wells, he has, I
doubt not, completely removed that source of income.""But," exclaimed Haynerd, "your property was insured, wasn't it?""Yes," replied Hitt, with a feeble attempt at a smile."But with the
proviso that dynamite should not be kept on the premises.You will
note that dynamite wrecked the wells.That doubtless renders my
policies void.But, even in case I should have a fighting chance with
the insurance companies, don't you think that they will be advised
that I purposely set fire to the wells, in order to collect the
insurance?And I shall find myself with a big
lawsuit on my hands, and with no funds to conduct the fight.Ames's
work, you know, is always thorough, and the Express is already facing
his suit for libel.""But you told us you were going to mortgage your property," said Miss
Wall."I stood ready to, should the Express require it.But, with its recent
little boom, our paper did not seem to need that as yet," he
returned."Yes, Ned, God _is_ good!""Can you say that, after all you have
endured, Carmen?"He looked at her for a moment, lost in wonder."An outcast babe," he
murmured, "left on the banks of a great river far, far away; reared
without knowledge of father or mother, and amid perils that hourly
threatened to crush her; torn from her beloved ones and thrust out
into an unknown and unsympathetic world; used as a stepping-stone to
advance the low social ambitions of worldly women; blackened by the
foulest slander, and ejected as an outcast by those who had fawned at
her feet; still going about with her beautiful message of love, even
though knowing that her childhood home is enveloped in the flames of
war, and her dear ones scattered, perhaps lost; spurned from the door
of the rich man whom she sought to save; carrying with her always the
knowledge that the one upon whom her affections had centered had a son
in distant Cartagena, and yet herself contributing to the support of
the little lad; and now, this morning--" He stopped, for he remembered
his promise."This morning," she finished, "shielded by the One who is both Father
and Mother to me.""That One surely ought to love you, Carmen--"

"He does," she answered softly.put in Haynerd, torn with anger and fear."What are we going
to do now?""Everything, Ned, that error seems to tell us not to do," replied the
girl.She reached over to the little table that stood near, and took from it
a Bible.Opening it, she read aloud, very slowly, the entire
fourteenth chapter of Exodus.Then she concluded by reading the last
two verses of the eighth chapter of Romans."Now," she said, looking up, "we know what we are going to do, don't
we?We are going right on, as'seeing Him who is invisible' to men
like Mr."There is no curse, whether of the Church, or of business, or of any
department of human thought, that can overthrow legitimate business;
and we are in the legitimate business of reflecting God to the world.If the physical sense of supply is now lost, we are fortunate, for now
we are obliged to acquire a higher sense.And we become aware of it in our own consciousness.It is there
that we interpret His supply.Ames interprets it one way; we, in a
very different way.God has always been able to prepare a table in the
wilderness of human thought.If we look for supply from without, we
shall not find it, for everything is within.And the very fact that
there is a legitimate demand shows that there is the supply to meet
it, for--though the world hasn't learned this yet--_it is the supply
itself that really creates the demand_!""Money, Ned, is the counterfeit of God.He is
our Principle--infinite, inexhaustible.We are facing a crisis, but, like every seeming disturbance of
the infinite harmony, it will vanish in a little while if we but cling
to the divine Mind that is God for guidance."Hitt folded the telegram and returned it to his pocket."Are you going
to Avon to-morrow?""And when we have in our midst this girl, who has borne,
without one word of complaint or reviling, the world's most poignant
sorrows!I--I really regret that I told you of--of this telegram.I
seemed for a moment to be overwhelmed.But I am on my feet again
now!"He reached into a pocket and took out some bills, which he handed to
Carmen."That will see you through for a day or so down there.Come," he added,
beckoning to Haynerd, "the Express will be issued to-morrow as usual,
and we must get to bed.I've really had quite a strenuous day!"He
turned, then paused and looked at Carmen.The girl caught the meaning in his glance, and went directly to the
piano."Don't," he said, "if you do not feel like it.This day has been a
hard one for you, I know.And--"

"But I do feel like it," she answered, smiling up at him.And," her voice dropped low, "I want to sing to--Him."Hitt gulped down something in his throat."The bravest little girl in
the whole wide world!"*       *       *       *       *

The carnage at Avon was not incidental; it was the logical effect of
definite mental causes.It was the orderly sequence of an endless
train of hatred of man for man, bred of greed and the fear of
starvation.And starvation is the externalized human belief that life
is at the caprice of intelligent matter.But that is an infraction of
the first Commandment, given when the human race was a babe.When the mill hands left their looms at evening of the day following
Ames's rejection of their demands, the master closed the doors behind
them and locked them out.The parrot-cry of the maudlin sentimental!But, four thousand men, women, and little children, with never a
dollar beyond their earnings of the day, thrust out into the blasts of
the bitterest winter the New England states had known in years!True; but why, then, did they strike?For, you see, that of itself
proved the soundness of Ames's single reply to all further appeal:
"There is nothing whatever to arbitrate."In the garden of the human mind waves many a flower, both black and
red, fanned by the foul winds of carnal thought.There grow the
brothel, the dive, the gin-shop, the jail.About these hardier stems
twine the hospital, the cemetery, the madhouse, the morgue.And Satan,
"the man-killer from the beginning," waters their roots and makes
fallow the soil with the blood of fools.But of those for whom the
gardener waits, there is none whose blood is so life-giving to these
noxious plants as that type of the materially rich who, like Ames,
have waxed gross upon the flesh of their own brothers.Ames was a gambler in human lives.They were his chips, by which he
gained or lost, and of themselves were void of intrinsic value.The
world was the table whereon he played; the game _rouge et noir_, with
the whirl of predatory commercialism as the wheel, and the ball
weighted to drop where he might direct.He carried millions on margin,
and with them carried the destinies, for weal or for woe, of millions
of his fellow-men, with not one thought that he did so at the cost of
their honor and morality, not less than their life-blood.It had been his custom to close his mills for several months each
year, in order to save expense when times were dull.And he did this
as casually as he closed the doors of his stables, and with much less
thought for the welfare of those concerned.It is doubtful if he had
ever really considered the fact that these four thousand human beings
were wholly dependent upon him for their very existence.For he was a
business man, and gold was far weightier in the scale of values than
human flesh, and much less easily obtained.Cain's comforting
philosophy was quite correct, else would the business world not have
been so firmly established upon it.Besides, he was terribly busy; and
his life was lived upon a plane high, high above that upon which these
swarming toilers groveled with their snouts in the dust.And now, with the doors of his mills barred against the hungry hordes,
he would frame the terms upon which they should be reopened.The
eight-hour law must not be enforced.Perhaps he could influence the
Supreme Court to declare it unconstitutional, as depriving the mill
hands of the right to labor as long as they pleased.And the right to organize and band together for their
common good would be contemptuously denied the ignorant rats who
should be permitted to toil for him once more.If they offered
violence, there was the state militia, armed and impatient to slay.Also, this was an excellent opportunity to stamp out trade-unionism
within the confines of his activities.He would win the plaudits of
the whole industrial world by so doing.He therefore immediately got
in touch with the Governor, a Tammany puppet, and received that loyal
henchman's warm assurances of hearty support for any measures which
the great magnate might wish to enforce.He then approached the
officers of the state guard, and secured them to a man.Times were
hard, and they welcomed his favor.He finally posted armed guards in
all his buildings at Avon, and bade them remember that property rights
were of divine institution.Then he sat down and dictated the general
policy to be followed by the Amalgamated Spinners' Association
throughout the country in support of his own selfish ends.His activity in these preparations, as in everything, was tremendous.His agents swarmed over the state like ants.The Catholic Archbishop
was instructed that he must remove Father Danny from Avon, as his
influence was pernicious.But the objection was made that the priest
was engaged only in humanitarian labors.It availed not; Ames desired
the man's removal.The widow Marcus likewise had
been doing much talking.Ames's lawyer, Collins, had her haled into
court and thoroughly reprimanded.And then, that matters might be
precipitated, and Congress duly impressed with the necessity of
altering the cotton schedule in favor of the Spinners' Association,
Ames ordered his agents to raise the rents of his miserable Avon
tenements.There were few, he knew, who dared even attempt to meet the
raise; and those who could not, he ordered set into the streets.It was a wild winter's day that the magnate chose for the enforcement
of this cruel order.A driving blizzard had raged throughout the
night, and the snow had banked up in drifts in places many feet deep.The temperature was freezing, and the strong east wind cut like a
knife.It was Ames's desire to teach these scum a needed lesson, and
he had chosen to enlist the elements to aid him in the righteous
task.For a week, ever since the strike was declared, Carmen had lived among
these hectored people.Daily her reports of the unbearable situation
had gone to Hitt.And through them the editor had daily striven to
awaken a nation's conscience.Ames read the articles, and through the
columns of the Budget sought to modify them to the extent of shifting
the responsibility to the shoulders of the mill hands themselves, and
to a dilatory Congress that was criminally negligent in so framing a
cotton tariff as to make such industrial suffering possible.Nor did
he omit to foully vilify the Express and calumniate its personnel.Amid curses, screams, and despairing wails, the satanic work of
ejecting the tenement dwellers went on that day.Ames's hirelings,
with loaded rifles, assisted the constables and city police in the
miserable work, themselves cursing often because of the keen blasts
that nipped their ears and numbed their well-cased limbs.More than
one tiny, wailing babe was frozen at the breast that dull, drab
afternoon, when the sun hung like a ghastly clot of human blood just
above the horizon, and its weird, yellow light flitted through the
snow-laden streets like gaunt spectres of death.More than one aged,
toil-spent laborer, broken at the loom in the service of his
insatiable master, fell prone in the drifts and lay there till his
thin life-current froze and his tired heart stopped.More than one
frenzied, despairing father, forgetful for the moment of the divine
right of property, rushed at a guard and madly strove with him, only
to be clubbed into complaisance, or, perchance, be left in a welter of
crimson on the drifting snow.She had been to see
Pillette that same morning, and had been laughed from his presence.She did not understand, she was told, what miserable creatures these
were that dared ask for bread and human rights.Wait; they themselves
would show their true colors.And it spurted like fountains
from their veins.And they saw it with dimming eyes, and were glad,
for it brought sweet oblivion.That night there were great fires
built along the frozen creek.Shacks and tents were hastily reared;
and the shivering, trembling women and babes given a desperate
shelter.Then the men, sullen and grim, drew off into little groups,
and into the saloons and gambling halls of the town.And when the
blizzard was spent, and the cold stars were dropping their frozen
light, these dull-witted things began to move, slowly at first,
circling about like a great forming nebula, but gaining momentum and
power with each revolution.More than a thousand strong, they circled
out into the frozen streets of the little town, and up along the main
thoroughfare.Their low
curses welled into a roar.And then, like the sudden bursting of
pent-up lava, they swept madly through the town, carrying everything
to destruction before them.Stores, shops, the bank itself, burst open before this wave of
maddened humanity.Guns and pistols were thrown from laden shelves to
the cursing, sweating mob below.Axes and knives were gathered by
armfuls, and borne out into the streets to the whirling mass.Great
barrels of liquor were rolled into the gutters and burst asunder.Bread and meat were dragged from the shops and savagely devoured.The
police gathered and planted themselves with spitting pistols before
the human surge.They went down like grass under stampeded cattle.Frightened clerks and operators rushed to the wires and sent wild,
incoherent appeals for help to New York.Pandemonium had the reins,
the carnal mind was unleashed.On rolled the mob, straight on to the massive stone house of Pillette,
the resident manager of the great Ames mills.On over the high iron
fence, like hungry dock rats.On up the
broad drive, shouting, shooting, moaning, raving.On over the veranda,
and in through broken windows and shattered doors, swarming like flies
over reeking carrion, until the flames which burst through the peaked
roof of the mansion drove them forth, and made them draw sullenly,
protestingly away, leaving the tattered bodies of Pillette and his
wife and daughters to be consumed in the roaring furnace.Oh, ye workers, ye toilers at loom and forge, it is indeed you who
bear the world's burdens!It is you who create the rich man's wealth,
and fight his battles.So ye fought in the great war between North and
South, and protected the rich man at home, hovering in fright over his
money bags.It is you who put into his hands the bayonet which he
turns against you to guard his wealth and maintain his iniquitous
privilege.It is indeed in your hands that the destinies of this great
nation lie; but what will ye do with your marvelous opportunity?What, with your stupendous, untried strength?Will ye once more set up
the golden calf, and prostrate yourselves before it?Will ye again
enthrone ecclesiastical despotism, and grovel before image of Virgin
and Saint?Will ye raise high the powers of mediaeval darkness, and
bend your necks anew to the yoke of ignorance and stagnation?But
think you now that flames and dynamite will break your present bonds?Aye, America may be made a land without a pauper, without a
millionaire, without industrial strife.But fire and sword will not
effect the transformation.Yes, perhaps, as has been said, our
"comfortable social system and its authority will some day be blown to
atoms."But shall we then be better off than we are to-day?For shall
we know then how to use our precious liberty?Blood-drunk and reeling, the mob turned from the flaming wreckage and
flowed down toward the mills.There were some among them, saner, and
prescient of the dire consequences of their awful work, who counseled
restraint.Down into the creek
bottom rolled the seething tide, with a momentum that carried it up
the far side and crashing into the heavily barred oak doors of the
great mills.A crushing hail of bullets fell upon them, and their
leaders went down; but the mass wavered not.Those within the
buildings knew that they would become carrion in the maws of the
ravening wolves outside, and fought with a courage fed with
desperation.In the solemn hush of death Socrates said, "The hour of departure has
arrived, and we go our ways, I to die and you to live.And mankind through the ages in their last
hours have echoed this sentiment of the gentle philosopher.For all
human philosophy leads to a single end--resignation.The frenzied hordes swarming about the Ames mills knew in their heart
of hearts that death was preferable to life in death under the goad of
human exploitation.In the distance, across the swale, the sky glowed red where the souls
of the agent of predatory wealth and his family had gone out in
withering heat.In the stricken town, men huddled their trembling
loved ones about them and stood with loaded muskets.Somewhere on the
steel bands that linked this scene of carnage with the great
metropolis beyond, a train plunged and roared, leaping over the
quivering rails at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, bringing eager
militiamen and their deadly instruments of civilization.For the Ames
mills were private property.*       *       *       *       *

In his luxurious office in the tower of the Ames building the master
sat that black night, surrounded by his laboring cohorts.Though they
strained under the excitement of the hour, Ames himself remained calm
and determined.He was in constant communication with the Governor at
Albany, and with the municipal officers of both New York and Avon.He
had received the tidings of the destruction of the Pillette family
with a grim smile.But the smile had crystallized into an expression
of black, malignant hatred when he demanded of the Governor that the
New York contingent of the state guard be sent at once to protect his
property, and specified that the bullets used should be of the
"dum-dum" variety.Such
bullets had been prohibited by the rules of modern warfare, it was
true.And Ames, foreseeing it all, had
purchased a hundred thousand rounds of these hellish things for the
militia to exchange for those which the Government furnished.And
then, as an additional measure of precaution, he had sent Hood and
Collins into the United States District Court and persuaded the
sitting judge to issue an injunction, enjoining any possible relief
committees from furnishing food and shelter to such as might enter the
industrial conflict being waged against him.And in the blood-red haze that hung
before his glittering eyes was framed the face of the girl who had
spurned him but a few days before.She was the embodiment of love that
had crossed his path and stirred up the very quintessence of evil
within him.From the first she had
aroused within his soul a conflict of emotions such as he had never
known before.And from the night when, in the Hawley-Crowles box at
the opera he had held her hand and looked down into her fathomless
eyes, he had been tortured with the conflicting desires to possess
that fair creature, or to utterly destroy her.Always she hovered just within his
grasp; and then drew back as his itching fingers closed.Always she
told him she loved him--and he knew she lied not.And such love had
its price--but not hers.And so hope strove with wrath, and chagrin
with despair.And
with it she had laid the giant low and bound him with chains.Though he knew now that she was lost to him forever; though
with foul curses he had seen hope flee; yet with it he had also bidden
every tender sentiment, every last vestige of good depart from his
thought forever more.And:

              "----with hope, farewell fear,
              Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;
              Evil, be thou my good!"And that night the master slept
not, but sat alone at his desk in the great Fifth Avenue mansion, and
plotted the annihilation of every human being who had dared oppose his
worldly ambitions.Plotted, too, the further degradation and final
ruin of the girl who had dared to say she loved him, and yet would not
become his toy.*       *       *       *       *

There is no need to curse the iniquitous industrial and social system
upon which the unstable fabric of our civilization rests, for that
system is its own fell curse in the rotting fruit it bears.A bit of
that poisonous fruit had now dropped from the slimy branch at Avon.Up
from the yards came the militiamen at double-quick, with rifles
unslung and loaded with the satanic Ames bullets.Behind them they
dragged two machine guns, capable of discharging three hundred times a
minute.The mob had concentrated upon the central building of the mill
group, and had just gained entrance through its shattered doors.Before them the guards were falling slowly back, fighting every inch
of the way.The air was thick with powder
smoke.The roar of battle was
deafening.Quickly swinging into action, the militia opened upon the mill hands.Hemmed in between two fires, the mob broke and fled down the frozen
stream.The officers of the guard then ordered their men to join in
the work of extinguishing the flames, which were beginning to make
headway, fanned by the strong draft which swept through the long
building.Then, the building
saved, they pitched their tents and sought a brief rest.At noon the soldiers were again assembled, for there remained the task
of arresting the leaders of the mob and bringing them to justice.The
town had been placed under martial law with the arrival of the
militia.Its streets were patrolled by armed guards, and a strong
cordon had been thrown around the shacks which the mill hands had
hastily erected the afternoon before.And now, under the protection of
a detachment of soldiers, the demand was made for the unconditional
surrender of the striking laborers.Dull terror lay like a pall over the miserable shacks huddled along
the dead stream.It was the dull, hopeless, numbing terror of the
victim who awaits the blow from the lion's paw in the arena.Weeping
wives and mothers, clasping their little ones to them, knelt upon the
frozen ground and crossed themselves.Young men drew their newly-wed
mates to their breasts and kissed them with trembling lips.Stern,
hard-faced men, with great, knotted hands, grouped together and looked
out in deadly hatred at the heartless force surrounding them.Then out from among them and across the ice went Carmen, up the
slippery hillside, and straight to the multi-mouthed machine gun, at
the side of which stood Major Camp.She had been all night with these
bewildered, maddened people.She had warmed shivering babes at her own
breast.She had comforted widows of a night, and newly-bereaved
mothers.She had bound up gaping wounds, and had whispered tender
words of counsel and advice.And they had clung to her weeping; they
had called upon Virgin and Saint to bless her; and they named her the
Angel of Avon--and the name would leave her no more."Take me," she said, "take me into court, and let me tell all."This beautiful, well-clad girl among
such miserable vermin!"You have demanded their leaders," she continued."I have been trying
to lead them.The major's eyes roved over her face and figure.He could make nothing
out of her words, but he motioned to an aid, and bade him place the
girl under arrest.A wild shout then rose from the shacks, as Carmen moved quietly away
under guard.A dozen men sprang out and rushed, muskets in
hand, up toward the soldiers to liberate her.Their narrow vision could
comprehend but one thing at a time; and they saw in the arrest of the
girl only an additional insult piled upon their already mountainous
injuries.It was answered by a shriek of rage from the hovels, and a murderous
return fire.Then the major gave another loud command, and the machine
guns began to vomit forth their clattering message of death.At the sound of shooting, Carmen's guard halted.Then one of them
fell, pierced by a bullet from the strikers.The others released the
girl, and hurried back to the battle line.Carmen stood alone for a
moment.One sang its death-song almost in her ear.Then she turned and made her way slowly up the hill to the
paralyzed town.Down in the vale beneath, Death swung his scythe with long, sweeping
strokes.The two machine guns poured a flaming sheet of lead into the
little camp below.The tents
caught fire, and were whirled blazing aloft by the brisk wind.Men
dropped like chaff from a mill.Hysterical, screaming women rushed
hither and yon to save their young, and were torn to shreds by the
merciless fusillade from above.Babes stood for a moment bewildered,
and then sank with great, gaping wounds in their little, quivering
bodies.And over all brooded the spirit of the great manipulator,
Ames, for the protection of whose sacred rights such ghastly work is
done among civilized men to-day.*       *       *       *       *

That night, while the stars above Avon drew a veil of gray between
them and the earth below, that they might not see the red embers and
stark bodies, Carmen came slowly, and with bent head, into the office
of the Express.As she approached Hitt's door she heard him in earnest
conversation with Haynerd."Yes," the editor was saying, "I had a mortgage placed on the Express
to-day, but I couldn't get much.And it's a short-term one, at that.Stolz refused point blank to help us, unless we would let him dictate
the policy of the paper.He's still
fighting Ames for control of C. and R. And I learn, too, that the
Ketchim case is called for next week.That probably means an attempt
by Ames to smoke Stolz out through Ketchim.It also means that
Carmen--"

"Yes; what about her?""That she will be forced to go upon the stand as a witness.""And that, as I read it, means a further effort on Ames's part to
utterly discredit her in the eyes of the world, and us through her
association with the Express.""But--where is she, Hitt?No word from her since we got the news of
the massacre at Avon this afternoon!Nothing happened to her, do you
think?"Hitt's face was serious, and he did not answer.Then Carmen herself
came through the open door.Both men rose with exclamations of
gladness to welcome her.The girl's eyes were wet, and her wonted
smile had gone.Hitt," she said, "I want a thousand dollars to-night."Hitt and Haynerd both sat down hard."I must go back to Avon to-morrow," she announced."And the money is
for the--the people down there."Her voice caught, and her words
stumbled.The two men looked at each other blankly.Then Hitt reached out and
took her hand."Tell us," he said, "about the trouble there to-day.""No," she said, "we will not talk about evil.A thousand--"

"I have that much on deposit in the bank now, Carmen," he replied
gravely.His thought was on the mortgage which he had signed that
morning."Then write me a check at once, and I will deposit it in the Avon bank
when I get there to-morrow.I must go home now--to see mother.""But--let me think about it, Carmen.Money is--well, won't less than
that amount do you?"Hitt sighed, but made no further protest.If the Express must founder,
then this money were well spent on the stricken people of Avon.He
took out his book, and immediately wrote the check and handed it to
the girl."Hitt," said Haynerd, after Carmen had left them and he had exhausted
his protests over the size of the check, "something's killing that
girl!And it isn't only the trouble at Avon, either!"She's no longer in this world, Ned.But Hitt would say nothing to further illuminate his cryptic remark,
and Haynerd soon switched to the grim topic of the industrial war in
progress at Avon.A
social and industrial system such as ours, which leaves the masses to
starve and consume with disease under intolerable burdens, that a
handful may rot in idleness and luxury, marks us in this latest
century as hopelessly insane!""Well, Ned, whence came the idea, think you, that it is divine justice
for a majority of the people on earth to be poor in order that a few
may be rich?And how are we going to get that perverted idea out of
the minds of men?"Legislation arouses no faith in me!We are
suffering here because, in our immensely selfish thought of ourselves
only, we have permitted the growth of such men as Ames, and allowed
them to monopolize the country's resources.Future
generations will laugh themselves sick over us!Why, what sane excuse
is there for permitting the commonest necessities of life to be
juggled with by gamblers and unmoral men of wealth?How can we ask to
be considered rational when we, with open eyes, allow 'corners' on
foodstuffs, and permit 'wheat kings' to amass millions by corralling
the supply of grain and then raising the price to the point where the
poor washerwoman starves?The
existence of poverty in a country like America is not only proof
positive that our social system is rotten to the core, but that our
religion is equally so!As a people we deserve to be incarcerated in
asylums!""A considerable peroration, Ned," smiled Hitt."And yet, one that I
can not refute.The only hope I see is in a radical change in the
mental attitude of the so-called enlightened class--and yet they are
the very worst offenders!"Doesn't the militia exist for men like Ames?To-day's work at
Avon proves it, I think!""Apparently so, Ned," returned Hitt sadly."And the only possibility
of a change in enlightened people is through a better understanding of
what is really good and worth while."Seems to me, Hitt, that it ought to stagger our preachers to realize
that nineteen centuries of their brand of Christianity have scarcely
even begun to cleanse society.What do you suppose Borwell thinks,
anyway?""Ned, they still cling to human law as necessarily a compelling
influence in the shaping of mankind's moral nature.""And go right on accepting the blood-stained money of criminal
business men who have had the misfortune to amass a million dollars!And, more, they actually hold such men up as patterns for the youth to
emulate!As if the chief end of endeavor were to achieve the glorious
manhood of an Ames!And he a man who is deader than the corpses he
made at Avon to-day!""The world's ideal, my friend, has long been the man who succeeds in
everything except that which is worth while," replied Hitt."But we
have been bidden to come out from the world, and be separate."Y--e--s, of course.But I can't take my thought from Avon--"

"And thereby you emphasize your belief in the reality of evil.""Then, if that is so, why not resign your position, Ned?Not while the Express has a leg to stand on!Your words are
an offense to me, sir!"Hitt rose and clapped his friend heartily on the back.Things do look very dark for us, if we look only with
the human sense of vision.But we are trying to look at the invisible
things within."Ned, Carmen is not in our hands.*       *       *       *       *

On the following afternoon at three a little group of Avon mill hands
crept past the guards and met in Father Danny's Mission, down in the
segregated vice district.They met there because they dared not go
through the town to the Hall.He had
slipped into town the preceding night, and remained in hiding through
the day.She had gone first to the
Hall, and then to the Mission, when she arrived again in the little
town.And after she had deposited Hitt's check in the bank she had
asked Father Danny to call together some of the older and more
intelligent of the mill hands, to discuss methods of disbursing the
money.Almost coincident with her arrival had come an order from Ames to
apprehend the girl as a disturber of the peace.The hush of death lay
over Avon, and even the soldiers now stood aghast at their own bloody
work of the day before.Carmen had avoided the main thoroughfares, and
had made her way unrecognized.At a distance she saw the town jail,
heavily guarded.Its capacity had been sorely taxed, and many of the
prisoners had been crowded into cold, cheerless store rooms, and
placed under guards who stood ready to mow them down at the slightest
threatening gesture.whispered Father Danny, after he had quietly
greeted the girl.It may be the beginning of the great
revolution we've all known wasn't far off!I just _had_ to get back
here!He sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.But soon he
sprang to his feet."No time for mollycoddling!""Come,
men, we'll give you checks, and do you get food for the babies.Only,
don't buy of the company stores!""We'll have to, Father," said one of them."But they've never taken cash from you there, ye know."Aye, Father, and they've discounted that ten per cent each time.But
if we bought at other stores we were discharged."But now then, Miss
Carmen, we'll begin."For an hour the girl wrote small checks, and the priest handed them
out to the eager laborers.They worked feverishly, for they knew that
at any moment they might be apprehended.cried Father Danny, at last unable to restrain himself."Did ye but know that this grand nation is wholly dependent on such as
you, its common people!Not on the rich, I say, the handful that own
its mills and mines, but on you who work them for your rich masters!"Ah, lass, it's but love that I'm dealin' out to 'em, God knows!And
yet, it's they that are masters of the situation, only they don't know
it!They've no leaders, except such as waste their
money and leave 'em in the ditch!The world's social schemes, Miss
Carmen, don't reach such as these.And they've got
the contempt of the wage-earners.""The Church, Father, could do much for these people, if--"

"Don't hesitate, Miss Carmen.You mean, if we didn't give all our
thought to the rich, eh?But still, it's wholly up to the people
themselves, after all.And, mark me, when they do rise, why, such men
as Ames won't know what's hit 'em!"The door was thrown violently open at that moment, and a squad of
soldiers under the command of a lieutenant entered.Carmen and Father Danny rose and faced them.The mill hands stood like
stone images, their faces black with suppressed rage.The lieutenant
halted his men, and then advanced to the girl."Is a woman named Carmen Ariza here?""I am she," replied the fearless girl."Come with us," he said in a rough voice.cried Father Danny, suddenly pulling the girl
back and thrusting himself before her.The mill hands
quickly formed about the girl.And then, with a yell of rage, they
threw themselves upon the soldiers.For a few minutes the little room was a bedlam.The crazed strikers
fought without weapons, except such as they could wrest from the
soldiers.One of them seized Carmen and
threw her beneath the table at which she had been working.The shouting and cursing might have been
heard for blocks around.Father Danny stood in front of the table,
beneath which lay the girl.He strove desperately to maintain his
position, that he might protect her, meantime frantically calling to
the mill hands to drag her out to the rear, and escape by the back
door.In the midst of the _melee_ a soldier mounted a chair near the door
and raised his rifle.The shot roared out, and Father Danny pitched
forward to the floor.Another shot, and still another followed in
quick succession.Then
they turned and fled precipitately through the rear exit.The lieutenant dragged Carmen from beneath the table and out through
the door.Then, assembling his men, he gave an order, and they marched
away with her up the icy street to the town jail.CHAPTER 16


With the wreckage which he had wrought strewn about him, J. Wilton
Ames sat at his rich desk far above the scampering human ants in the
streets below and contemplated the fell work of his own hands.And
often and anon as he looked, great beads of perspiration welled out
upon his forehead, and his breath came hot and dry.In the waste
basket at his feet lay crumpled the newspapers with their shrieking,
red-lettered versions of the slaughter at Avon.He was not a coward,
this man!But he had pushed that basket around the desk out of his
sight, for when he looked at it something rose before him that sent a
chill to his very soul.At times his vision blurred; and then he
passed his hands heavily across his eyes.He had chanced to read in
the grewsome accounts of the Avon massacre that little children had
been found among those fallen shacks, writhing in their last agonies.And the reports had said that great, red-dripping holes had been
ripped in their thin little bodies by those awful "dum-dum" bullets.And why had the demoniac soldiers down
there blown the brains from harmless women and helpless babes?He
really had not intended to go so far!The brats would have grown up to oppose
the vested privileges of the rich!They, too, would have become
anarchists and rioters, bent on leveling the huge industrial fabric
which such as he had so laboriously erected under the legal protection
afforded their sacred rights!And
the great captains of industry would thank him for the example he had
thus fearlessly set!To think of Avon was for him now to think in terms of blood.And yet
his carnal soul hourly wrestled sore with thoughts of a wholly
different stamp; with those strange emotions which he had felt when in
Carmen's presence; with those unfamiliar sentiments which, had he not
fought them back so bitterly, might have made him anew, and--

But the remembrance maddened him.His face grew black, and his mouth
poured forth a torrent of foul imprecations and threats upon her and
upon those who stood with her.He smote the
desk with his great fist.He fumed, he frothed, he hurled reason from
its throne, and bade the Furies again become his counselors.Upon the desk before him lay the mortgage papers which Hitt had
signed.He had bought the mortgage from the bank which had loaned the
Express the money.He would crush that sheet now, crush it until the
ink dripped black from its emasculated pages!And when it fell into
his hands, he would turn it into the yellowest of sensational
journals, and hoot the memory of its present staff from ocean to
ocean!Then, his head sunk upon his breast, he fell to wondering if he might
not secure a mortgage upon the Beaubien cottage, and turn its
occupants into the street.It was the
lever by which he moved the world, and clubbed its dull-witted
inhabitants into servile obeisance!Who could stand against him--

That girl!That obedient lackey hastened
into his master's presence."Called for this week, sir," replied Hood, glad that the announcement
could not possibly offend his superior."Brought up from Avon, and lodged in the Tombs, sir.""You tell Judge Spencer that if he allows her bail I'll see that his
federal appointment is killed, understand?"Ames regarded the man with a mixture of admiration and utter contempt.For Hood stood before him a resplendent example of the influence of
the most subtle of all poisons, the insidious lure of money.Soul and
body he had prostituted himself and his undoubted talents to it.And
now, were he to be turned adrift by Ames, the man must inevitably sink
into oblivion, squeezed dry of every element of genuine manhood, and
weighted with the unclean lucre for which his bony fingers had always
itched.He knows most about the formation of the defunct
Simiti company.""Well, see him and--you say he's young, and got a wife and baby?Offer
him twenty-five thousand to quit the case.""I'm afraid it wouldn't do, sir," returned Hood, shaking his head
dubiously."I've had men talking with him regarding the trial, and
he--"

"Then get him over here.I'll see if I can't persuade him," growled
Ames in an ugly tone.A few minutes later Reverend Darius Borwell
was ushered into the financier's private office.Ames," cried that gentleman of the cloth, "it's shocking,
terribly so, what those unbridled, unprincipled mill hands have drawn
upon themselves down in Avon!And four members of the Church
of the Social Revolution came to my study last evening and demanded
that I let them speak to my congregation on the coming Sabbath!"And I shall
have policemen stationed at the doors next Sunday to maintain order!To think that it has come to this in America!I would advise--"

"Nobody can get within a block of my house, sir, without ringing a
series of electric bells," replied Ames evenly."I have fifty guards
and private detectives in attendance in and about my premises all the
time.My limousine has been lined with sheet steel.I simply want to keep going
until I can carry out a few plans I have in hand."His thought had
reverted again to the fair girl in the Tombs."But now, Borwell," he continued, "I want to talk with you about
another matter.I am drawing up my will, and--"

"Why, my dear Mr.Ames thought of his physician's constantly iterated warning; but shook
his head."I may get caught in this Avon affair," he said evasively.The President has sent his message to
Congress, as you may be aware.There are unpleasant suggestions in it
regarding dispossession in cases like my own.I'm coming back by
magnanimously willing to Congress a hundred millions, to stand as a
fund for social uplift.""But the little matter I wish to discuss with you is the sum that I am
setting aside for the erection of a new church edifice," continued
Ames, eying the minister narrowly.cried that worthy gentleman, springing up and
clasping the financier's hand.One should not be too precipitate in
accepting tentative benefactions."Ah--we really should have--ah--a
trifle more, Mr.There's the settlement home, and the commons,
you know, and--"

"Humph!Well, we'll start with half a million," replied Ames dryly."By the way, you know Jurges, eh?Er--have
you any particular influence with him, if I may ask?"His sharp eyes
bored straight through the wondering divine."Why--yes--yes, I know the gentleman.And, as for influence--well, I
may--"

"Yes, just so," put in Ames."Now there is a trial coming up this
week, and Jurges will be called to the stand.I want you to give him
the true facts in regard to it.I'll call Hood, and we'll go over them
in detail now.Then you see Jurges this afternoon, and--say, he's
raising a building fund too, isn't he?"The magnate summoned Hood again; and for an hour the trio discussed
the forthcoming trial of the unfortunate Philip O. Ketchim.Then Ames
dismissed the clergyman, and bade his office boy admit the young
lawyer, Cass, who had come in response to Hood's request.For some moments after Cass entered the office Ames stood regarding
him, studying what manner of man he was, and how best to approach him.Then he opened the conversation by a casual reference to the
unsatisfactory business situation which obtained throughout the
country, and expressed wonder that young men just starting in their
professions managed to make ends meet."But," he concluded with deep significance, "better go hungry than
take on any class of business which, though promising good money
returns, nevertheless might eventually prove suicidal."He looked hard
at the young lawyer when he paused."But as I am
particularly busy this morning, may I ask why you have sent for me?Have you anything that I can--"

"I have," abruptly interrupted the financier."We need additions to
our legal staff.I thought perhaps you might like to talk over the
matter with me, with a view to entering our employ."Ames, I--I have never thought of--" The young man's eyes
glistened."Well, suppose you think of it now," said Ames, smiling graciously."I
have heard considerable about you of late, and I must say I rather
like the way you have been handling your work."The work which he had been
doing of late was most ordinary and routine, and called for no display
of legal skill whatever."I'd hate to see you tackle anything at this stage of your career, Mr.And I am afraid your
association with Ketchim is going to do just that.But possibly you do
not intend to handle further business for him?"Ketchim, though long confined in the Tombs, had at length secured
bail, through the not wholly disinterested efforts of his uncle,
Stolz, the sworn enemy of Ames.And, because of his loyal efforts in
behalf of Ketchim, Stolz had insisted that Cass be retained as counsel
for the latter when his trial should come up."I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr.Hood
will take you on at a salary of, say, five thousand to start with.We'll try you out for a few weeks.Then, if we don't mutually fit,
why, we'll quietly separate and say nothing.Half of that salary would have looked large to him
then.But--

"May I ask," he slowly said in reply, "what class of work Mr.Hood
would give me to start with?""Why, nothing of great importance, perhaps, while you are getting into
the harness.You've had experience
in that, eh?"That little house
which he had passed and stopped to look at so wistfully every night on
his way home was now within his grasp.He glanced up at the great man, sitting so calmly before him.Ames," he said, "if I enter your employ, it must be with the
stipulation that I shall have nothing to do with the Ketchim trial.""If you enter my employ, sir, it will
be with the stipulation that you do as I say," he returned coldly.And then the young lawyer saw through the mask.And his anger flamed
high at what he discerned behind it.Ames," said he, "you have made a mistake.I am poor, and I need
business.But I have not as yet fallen so completely under the spell
of fortune-hunting as to sell my honor to a man like you!To enter
your employ, I now see, would mean the total loss of character and
self respect.It would mean a lowering of my ideals, whatever they may
be, to your own vulgar standard.I may have done wrong in becoming
associated with Mr.But I
pledged myself to assist him.And yet, in doing so, I scarcely can
blacken my reputation to the extent that I should were I to become
your legal henchman.But there are some terms upon
which even I can not accept it.Ames gave a snort of anger when Cass went out.Summoning Hood, he
vented his great wrath upon that individual's bald pate."And now," he
concluded, "I want that fellow Cass so wound up that he will sneak off
to a lonely spot and commit suicide!And if you can't do it, then I'll
accept your resignation!"Ames, I have
just learned that Judge Harris, father of the young man who came up
with that girl, is in Colombia.Seems that he's taken some wealthy man
down there to look at La Libertad mine.""They believe you put one over on Ketchim, with the help of Monsignor
Lafelle, and so they've gone down to get titles to that mine.""By G--"

"And they say that--"

"Never mind what they say!""Cable Wenceslas at once to
see that those fellows remain permanently in Colombia.He has ways of
accomplishing that.I guess
Wenceslas can block his little game!"His great frame shook slightly as he stood consuming with rage, and a
slight hemorrhage started from his nostrils.And as he walked, Hood thought his left foot dragged
slightly.*       *       *       *       *

And then, with the way well cleared, came the Ketchim trial, which has
gone down in history as containing the most spectacular _denouement_
in the record of legal procedure in the New World.Had it been
concerned, as was anticipated, only with routine legal procedure
against the man Ketchim, a weak-souled compound of feeble sycophancy
and low morals, it would have attracted slight attention, and would
have been spread upon the court records by uninterested clerks with
never a second thought.But there were elements entering into it of
whose existence the outside world could not have even dreamed.Into it
converged threads which now may be traced back to scenes and events in
three continents; threads whose intricate windings led through
trackless forest and dim-lit church; through court of fashion and hut
of poverty; back through the dark mazes of mortal thought, where no
light shines upon the carnal aims and aspirations of the human mind;
back even to the doors of a palace itself, even to the proudest throne
of the Old World.But none of these elements found expression in the indictment against
the frightened defendant, the small-visioned man who had sought to
imitate the mighty Ames, and yet who lacked sufficient intelligence of
that sort which manifests in such a perversion of skill and power.Ames was a tremendous corruptionist, who stood beyond the laws simply
because of the elemental fact that he himself made those laws.Ketchim
was a plain deceiver.Mingling
his theology with fraud, he employed the unholy alliance for the
purpose of exploiting the credulous who attended his prayer meetings
and commented with bated breath upon his beautiful showing of
religious zeal.He was but one of a multitude afflicted with the
"dollar mania."His misfortune was that his methods were so antique
that they could not long fail of detection.And it was because of his
use of the mails for the purpose of deceit that the indictment had
been drawn against Philip O. Ketchim _et al._ by the long-suffering,
tolerant complainant, called the people.Nominally the people's interests were in the hands of the Public
Prosecutor, a certain smug young worldling named Ellis.But, as that
gentleman owed his appointment to Ames, it is not surprising that at
his right hand sat Hood and his well trained staff.Nominally, too,
Judge Spencer conducted the trial strictly upon its merits, not all of
which lay with the people.But the judge might have been still
prosecuting petty cases back in the unknown little district from
which he came, had it not been for the great influence of Ames, long
since, who had found him on a certain occasion useful.And so the jury
panel contained none but those who, we may be very sure, were amenable
to the tender pressure of a soft hand lined with yellow gold.And only
those points of evidence were sustained which conduced to the
incrimination of the miserable defendant.Ketchim was doomed before
the trial began.And yet, to subserve the dark schemes of Ames, and to lengthen the
period of torture to which his victims should be subjected, the trial
was dragged through many days.Besides, even he and his hirelings were
bound to observe the formalities.It was at the suggestion of Cass that no effort had been made to
procure bail for Carmen after her arrest.The dramatic may always be
relied upon to carry a point which even plain evidence negatives.And
she, acquiescing in the suggestion, remained a full two weeks in the
Tombs before Ames's eager counsel found their opportunity to confront
her on the witness stand and besmirch her with their black charges.The Beaubien was prostrated.But, knowing that for her another hour of
humiliation and sorrow had come, she strove mightily to summon her
strength for its advent.Father Waite toiled with Cass day and night.Hitt and Haynerd, without financial resources, pursued their way, grim
and silent.And
they stood at the helm, stanch to their principles, not yielding an
iota to offers of assistance in exchange for a reversal of the policy
upon which the paper had been launched."We're going down, Hitt," said Haynerd grimly."But we go with the
flag flying at the mast!"He was learning to know as did Carmen, and to
see with eyes which were invisible.It was just when the jury had been impaneled, after long days of petty
wrangling and childish recrimination among the opposing lawyers, that
Stolz came to Ames and laid down his sword.The control of C. and R.
should pass unequivocally to the latter if he would but save Ketchim
from prison.Then Ames lay back and roared with laughter over his great triumph.He would send Stolz' nephew to prison, and then roll a
bomb along Wall Street whose detonation would startle the financial
world clean out of its orbit!Stolz had failed to notice that Ames's
schemes had so signally worked out that C. and R. was practically in
his hands now!The defeated railroad magnate at length backed out of
the Ames office purple with rage.And then he pledged himself to
hypothecate his entire fortune to the rescue of his worthless nephew.Thus, in deep iniquity, was launched the famous trial, a process of
justice in name only, serving as an outlet for a single man's long
nurtured personal animosities.The adulterous union of religion and
business was only nominally before the bar.The victims, not the
defendant only, not the preachers, the washerwomen, the factory girls,
the widows, and the orphans, whose life savings Ketchim had drawn into
his net by the lure of pious benedictions, but rather those
unfortunates who had chanced to incur the malicious hatred of the
great, legalized malefactor, Ames, by opposition to his selfish
caprice, and whose utter defeat and discrediting before the public
would now place the crown of righteous expediency upon his own
chicanery and extortion and his wantonly murderous deeds.Doctor Jurges, utterly
confused by the keen lawyers, and vainly endeavoring to follow the
dictates of his conscience, while attempting to reconcile them with
his many talks with Darius Borwell, gave testimony which fell little
short of incriminating himself.For there were produced letters which
he had written to members of his congregation, and which for subtlety
and deception, though doubtless innocently done, would have made a
seasoned promoter look sharp to his own laurels.He had been summoned from Denver for the
trial.But his stuttering evidence gave no advantage to either side.And then--crowning blunder!--Cass permitted Ketchim himself to take
the stand.And the frightened, trembling broker gave his own cause
such a blow that the prosecution might well have asked the judge to
take the case from the jury then and there.It was a legal _faux pas_;
and Cass walked the floor and moaned the whole night through.Then, as per program, the prosecution called Madam Beaubien.Could not
that sorrowing woman have given testimony which would have aided the
tottering defense, and unmasked the evil genius which presided over
this mock trial?But not one point would the
judge sustain when it bordered upon forbidden territory.It was made
plain to her that she was there to testify against Ketchim, and to
permit the Ames lawyers to bandy her own name about the court room
upon the sharp points of their cruel cross-questions and low
insinuations.But, she protested, her knowledge of the Simiti company's affairs had
come through another person.Ames should give his own testimony--for was it not he who
had, not long since, legally punished the witness on a charge of
defamation of character?And the spectators
knew that it was because the righteous prosecution could no longer
stain its hands with one who bore such a tarnished name as she.And then, taunted and goaded to exasperation, the wronged woman burst
into tears and flayed the bigamist Ames there before the court room
crowded with eager society ladies and curious, non-toiling men.Flayed
him as men are seldom flayed and excoriated by the women they trample.The bailiffs seized her, and dragged her into an ante-room; the judge
broke his gavel rapping for order, and threatened to clear the court;
and then Cass, too young and inexperienced to avoid battle with
seasoned warriors, rose and demanded that Madam Beaubien be returned
to the stand.He turned to
the people, as if seeking their support.A great murmur arose through
the court room.That man, sitting calm
and unimpassioned, nodded his head slightly.And the woman was led
back to the chair."It may have an important bearing upon the case, Your Honor!"cried
the young lawyer for the defense.Ames is to take the stand as an
important witness in this case.If Madam Beaubien brings such a charge
against him, it gives us reason to believe his honor peccable, and his
testimony open to suspicion!"It was a daring statement, and the whole room gasped, and held its
breath."The
lawyer for the defense is in contempt of court!Madam Beaubien has
been shown to be a--"

"The objection is sustained!"_"His first wife's portrait--is in a glass window--in his yacht!"_
cried the hysterical Beaubien.Then she crumpled up in a limp mass,
and was led from the chair half fainting.At the woman's shrill words a white-haired man, dressed in black,
clerical garb, who had been sitting in the rear of the room close to
the door, rose hastily, then slowly sat down again.At his feet
reposed a satchel, bearing several foreign labels.Evidently he had
but just arrived from distant lands.Consternation reigned throughout the room for a few minutes.Then
Cass, believing that the psychological moment had arrived, loudly
called Carmen Ariza to the stand.The dramatic play must be continued,
now that it had begun.The battle which had raged back and forth for
long, weary days, could be won, if at all, only by playing upon the
emotions of the jury, for the evidence thus far given had resulted in
showing not only the defense, but likewise the Beaubien, and all who
had been associated with the Simiti company, including Cass himself,
to be participators in gross, intentional fraud.The remaining witness, the girl herself, had been purposely neglected
by the prosecution, for the great Ames had planned that she must be
called by the defense.Then would he bring up the prostitute, Jude,
and from her wring testimony which must blast forever the girl's
already soiled name.Following her, he would himself take the stand,
and tell of the girl's visits to his office; of her protestations of
love for him; of her embracing him; and of a thousand indiscretions
which he had carefully garnered and stored for this triumphant
occasion.But the judge, visibly perturbed by the dramatic turn which the case
seemed to be taking, studied his watch for a moment, then Ames's face,
and then abruptly adjourned court until the following day.Mary moved to the bedroom.Yet not
until Cass had been recognized, and the hounded girl summoned from her
cell in the Tombs, to take the stand in the morning for--her life!CHAPTER 17


In the days to come, when the divine leaven which is in the world
to-day shall have brought more of the carnal mind's iniquity to the
surface, that the Sun of Truth may destroy the foul germs, there shall
be old men and women, and they which, looking up from their work, peep
and mutter of strange things long gone, who shall fall wonderingly
silent when they have told again of the fair young girl who walked
alone into the crowded court room that cold winter's morning.And
their stories will vary with the telling, for no two might agree what
manner of being it was that came into their midst that day.Even the bailiffs, as if moved by some strange prescience, had fallen
back and allowed her to enter alone.The buzz of subdued chatter
ceased, and a great silence came over all as they looked.Some swore,
in awed whispers, when the dramatic day had ended, and judge and jury
and wrangling lawyer had silently, and with bowed heads, gone quiet
and thoughtful each to his home, that a nimbus encircled her beautiful
head when she came through the door and faced the gaping multitude.Some said that her eyes were raised; that she saw not earthly things;
and that a heavenly presence moved beside her.Nor may we lightly set
aside these tales; for, after the curtain had fallen upon the
wonderful scene about to be enacted, there was not one present who
would deny that, as the girl came into the great room and went
directly to the witness chair, God himself walked at her side and held
her hand."Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou
dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
goest."Through the mind of that same white-haired man in the clerical garb
ran these words as he watched the girl move silently across the room.She seemed to have taken on a new meaning to him since the previous
day.And as he looked, his eyes grew moist, and he drew out his
handkerchief.But his were not the only eyes that had filled then.Hitt and Haynerd
bent their heads, that the people might not see; Miss Wall and the
Beaubien wept silently, and with no attempt to stay their grief; Jude
buried her head in her hands, and rocked back and forth, moaning
softly.A welter of conflicting emotions
surged through their harassed souls.They seemed to have come now to
the great crisis.And which way the tide would turn rested with this
lone girl.For some moments after she was seated the silence remained unbroken.And as she sat there, waiting, she looked down at the man who sought
to destroy what he might not possess.Some said afterward that as she
looked at him she smiled.Who knows but that the Christ himself smiled
down from the cross at those who had riven his great heart?He was far
from well that morning, and an ugly, murderous mood possessed him.And
yet, judged by the world's standards, he had tipped the crest of
success.He was swollen
with wealth, with material power, with abnormal pride.His tender
sensibilities and sympathies were happily completely ossified, and he
was stone deaf and blind to the agonies of a suffering world.Not a
single aim but had been realized; not a lone ambition but had been
met.Even the armed camp at Avon, and the little wooden crosses over
the fresh mounds there, all testified to his omnipotence; and in them,
despite their horrors, he felt a satisfying sense of his own great
might.The clerk held up the Bible for the girl to give her oath.She looked
at him for a moment, and then smiled."I will tell the truth," she
said simply.The officer hesitated, and looked up at the judge.But the latter sat
with his eyes fixed upon the girl.The clerk did not press the point;
and Carmen was delivered into the hands of the lawyers.Then, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he asked the girl to mention briefly the place of her birth,
her parentage, and other statistical data, leading up to her
association with the defendant.It was but the one she had
told again and again.And when
she had concluded, Cass turned her back again to Simiti, and to
Rosendo's share in the mining project which had ultimated in this
suit.A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as she spoke of that great,
black man who had taken her from desolate Badillo into his own warm
heart.There were few dry eyes among the spectators when she told of
his selfless love.And when she drew the portrait of him, standing
alone in the cold mountain water, far up in the jungle of Guamoco,
bending over the laden _batea_, and toiling day by day in those
ghastly solitudes, that she might be protected and educated and raised
above her primitive environment in Simiti, there were sobs heard
throughout the room; and even the judge, hardened though he was by
conflict with the human mind, removed his glasses and loudly cleared
his throat as he wiped them.Ames first grew weary as he listened, and then exasperated.His lawyer
at length rose to object to the recital on the ground that it was
largely irrelevant to the case.And the judge, pulling himself
together, sustained the objection.Then the prosecution
eagerly took up the cross-examination."Boast not thyself of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may
bring forth," murmured the white-haired man in the clerical garb far
back in the crowded room.Had he learned the law of Truth to error,
"Thou shall surely die"?Did he discern the vultures gnawing at the
rich man's vitals?Did he, too, know that this giant of privilege, so
insolently flaunting his fleeting power, his blood-stained wealth and
his mortal pride, might as well seek to dim the sun in heaven as to
escape the working of those infinite divine laws which shall effect
the destruction of evil and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven
even here upon earth?The latter drew Ellis down and
transmitted his master's instructions.The atmosphere grew tense, and
the hush of expectancy lay over all."Miss Carmen," began Ellis easily, "your parentage has been a matter
of some dispute, if I mistake not, and--"

Cass was on his feet to object.What had this question to do with the
issue?Cass should have divined it by this time.Ellis cleared his throat and adjusted his glasses."And your
father, it is said, was a <DW64> priest.I believe that has been
accepted for some time."I never knew my earthly father," replied Carmen in a low voice."But you have admitted that it might have been this Diego, have you
not?""It might have been," returned the girl, looking off absently toward
the high windows."Did he not claim you as his daughter?""Now," continued Ellis, "that being reasonably settled, is it not also
true that you used the claim of possessing this mine, La Libertad, as
a pretext for admission to society here in New York?"The girl did not answer, but only smiled pityingly at him.He, too,
had bartered his soul; and in her heart there rose a great sympathy
for him in his awful mesmerism."And that you claimed to be an Inca princess?"admonished the judge, looking severely down upon the silent
girl.Carmen sighed, and drew her gaze away from the windows.She was weary,
oh, so weary of this unspeakable mockery.And yet she was there to
prove her God."I would like to ask this further question," Ellis resumed, without
waiting for her reply."Were you not at one time in a resort conducted
by Madam Cazeau, down on--"

He stopped short.The girl's eyes were looking straight into his, and
they seemed to have pierced his soul."I am sorry for you," she said
gently, "oh, so sorry!The man knew not whether to smile in triumph or hide his head in
shame.Ames alone
met his embarrassed glance, and sent back a command to continue the
attack.What possible relation to the
issue involved could such testimony have?But the judge bade him sit
down, as the counsel for the prosecution doubtless was bringing out
facts of greatest importance.Ellis again cleared his throat and bent to his loathsome task."Now,
Miss Ariza, in reference to your labors to incite the mill hands at
Avon to deeds of violence, the public considers that as part of a
consistent line of attack upon Mr.Ames, in which you were aiding
others from whom you took your orders.May I ask you to cite the
motives upon which you acted?"Ames," she slowly replied, "but only the
things he stands for."A militant brand of social uplift, I
suppose?"And that is the sort of remedy that anarchists apply to
industrial troubles, is it not?""There is no remedy for industrial troubles but Christianity," she
said gently."Not the burlesque Christianity of our countless sects
and churches; not Roman Catholicism; not Protestantism; nor any of the
fads and fancies of the human mind; but just the Christianity of Jesus
of Nazareth, who knew that the human man was not God's image, but only
stood for it in the mortal consciousness.And he always saw behind
this counterfeit the real man, the true likeness of God.And--"

"You are diverging from the subject proper and consuming time, Miss
Ariza!"Carmen did not heed him, but continued quietly:

"And it was just such a man that Jesus portrayed in his daily walk and
words.""No," the girl went calmly on, "Jesus did not stand for the
intolerance, the ignorance, the bigotry, the hatred, and the human
hypothesis, the fraud, and chicanery, and the 'Who shall be greatest?'Nor did he make evil a reality, as mortals do.He knew it seemed awfully real to the deceived human consciousness;
but he told that consciousness to be not afraid.And then he went to
work and drove out the belief of evil on the basis of its nothingness
and its total lack of principle.The orthodox churches and sects of
to-day do not do that.Their
kingdom is wholly temporal, and is upheld by heartless millionaires,
and by warlike kings and emperors.Their tenets shame the intelligence
of thinking men!Yet they have slain tens of millions to establish
them!"To remove the girl meant depriving Ames of
his prey.But if she remained upon the stand, she would put them all
to confusion, for they had no means of silencing her.The judge looked
blankly at Ames; his hands were tied.Ellis hurried to change the current of her talk by interposing another
question."Will you tell us, Miss Carmen, why you have been working--"

"I have been working for God," she interrupted.Her voice was low and
steady, and her eyes shone with a light that men are not wont to see
in those of their neighbors.And for Him I am here to-day."Consternation was plainly discernible in the camp of the prosecution.Cass knew now that he need make no more objections.The defense had
passed from his hands.At this juncture James Ketchim, brother of the defendant, thinking to
relieve the strain and embarrassment, gave audible voice to one of his
wonted witticisms.But the effect was not
what he had anticipated.roared the exasperated judge, bending
far over his desk.And the elder
Ketchim retired in chagrin and confusion."Miss Carmen," pursued Ellis, eager to recover his advantage, for he
saw significant movements among the jury, "do you not think the
unfortunate results at Avon quite prove that you have allied yourself
with those who oppose the nation's industrial progress?"Order had now been restored in the court room, and
Ellis was feeling sure of himself again."You have opposed the constructive development of our country's
resources by your assaults upon men of wealth, like Mr.Ames, for
example, have you not?"Then the girl opened her mouth, and from it came words that fell upon
the room like masses of lead."I stand opposed to any man, Mr.Ellis,
who, to enrich himself, and for the purpose of revenge, spreads the
boll weevil in the cotton fields of the South."And yet it was a silence that
fell crashing upon Ames's straining ears.He sat for a moment stunned;
then sprang to his feet.He held out a
hand, and made as if to speak; then sank again into his chair.Ellis collected himself, and turned to the judge."Your Honor, we regret to state that, from the replies which Miss
Ariza has given, we do not consider her mentally competent as a
witness."I should
like to examine the witness further!"returned the judge, glowering over his spectacles
at the young lawyer."I stand on--"

"Sit down!"called Cass through the rising tumult, "the lawyer for
the prosecution has heaped insults upon you in his low references to
your parentage.Will you--"

The judge pounded upon his desk with the remnant of his broken gavel.he called in a loud, threatening
voice.The judge sat down and mopped his steaming face.Ames was a study of
wild, infuriated passion.Carmen
sat quietly facing the crowded room.She had reached up and was
fondling the little locket which hung at her throat.It was the first
time she had ever worn it.It was not a pretty piece of jewelry; and
it had never occurred to her to wear it until that day.Nor would she
have thought of it then, had not the Beaubien brought it to the Tombs
the night before in a little box with some papers which the girl had
called for.Why she had put it on, she could not say.Slowly, while the silence continued unbroken, the girl drew the
slender chain around in front of her and unclasped it."I--I never--knew my parents," she murmured musingly, looking down
lovingly at the little locket.Then she opened it and sat gazing, rapt
and absorbed, at the two little portraits within."But there are their
pictures," she suddenly announced, holding the locket out to Cass.It was said afterward that never in the history of legal procedure in
New York had that court room held such dead silence as when Cass stood
bending over the faces of the girl's earthly parents, portrayed in the
strange little locket which Rosendo had taken from Badillo years
before.Never had it known such a tense moment; never had the very air
itself seemed so filled with a mighty, unseen presence, as on that day
and in that crisal hour.Without speaking, Hood rose and looked over Cass's shoulder at the
locket.A muffled cry escaped him, and he turned and stared at Ames."Yes, sir," replied Hood in a voice that was scarcely heard.Hood seemed to have frozen to the spot.His hands shook, and his words
gibbered from his trembling lips."The--the woman's portrait, sir--is--is--the one in--in Mr."_

The piercing cry rang through the still room like a lost soul's
despairing wail.Ames had rushed from his seat, overturning his chair,
thrusting the lawyers aside, and seized the locket.For a moment he
peered wildly into it.It seemed as if his eyes would devour it,
absorb it, push themselves clean through it, in their eagerness to
grasp its meaning.His eyes were red; his face ashen; his lips white.His unsteady glance met the girl's.His mouth opened, and flapped like
a broken shutter in the wind.His arms swung wildly upward; then
dropped heavily.Suddenly he bent to one side; caught himself;
straightened up; and then, with a horrifying, gurgling moan, crashed
to the floor.The noise of the tremendous fall reverberated through
the great room like an echo of Satan's plunge into the pit of hell.They rushed forward in a mass, over railings, over chairs
and tables, heedless of all but the great mystery that was slowly
clearing away in the dim light that winter's morning.Through them the
white-haired man, clad in clerical vestments, elbowed his way to the
bar.He tore it from Hood's hand and scanned it eagerly.he murmured, trembling with
excitement.Then, shouting to the judge above the hubbub:

"Your Honor!called the judge in a loud, quavering voice.The woman's
portrait in this little locket is that of Dona Dolores, Infanta,
daughter of Queen Isabella the Second, of Spain!And this girl,"
pointing to the bewildered Carmen, who sat clinging to the arms of her
chair, "is her child, and is a princess of the royal blood!Her father
is the man who lies there--J. Wilton Ames!"CHAPTER 18


Borne on pulsing electric waves, the news of the great _denouement_
flashed over the city, and across a startled continent.Beneath the
seas it sped, and into court and hovel.Madrid gasped; Seville panted;
and old Padre Rafael de Rincon raised his hoary head and cackled
shrilly.To the seething court room came flying reporters and news gatherers,
who threw themselves despairingly against the closed portals.Within,
the bailiffs fought with the excited crowd, and held the doors against
the panic without.Over the prostrate form of Ames the physicians worked with feverish
energy, but shook their heads.In the adjoining ante-room, whither she had been half carried, half
dragged by Hitt when Ames fell, sat Carmen, clasped in the Beaubien's
arms, stunned, bewildered, and speechless.Hitt stood guard at the
door; and Miss Wall and Jude tiptoed about with bated breath, unable
to take their eyes from the girl.In the court room without, Haynerd held the little locket, and plied
Monsignor Lafelle with his incoherent questions.The excited editor's
brain was afire; but of one thing he was well assured, the Express
would bring out an extra that night that would scoop its rivals clean
to the bone!In a few minutes the bailiffs fought the mob back from the doors and
admitted a man, a photographer, who had been sent out to procure
chemicals in the hope that the portrait of the man in the locket might
be cleaned.Ten minutes later the features of J. Wilton Ames stood
forth clearly beside those of the wife of his youth.The picture
showed him younger in appearance, to be sure, but the likeness was
unmistakable.Monsignor, but you are slow!wailed Haynerd, shaking the
churchman's arm in his excitement."I saw the portrait in the Royal
Gallery, years ago, in Madrid.I could not forget the
sad, sweet face.I saw it again in the stained-glass window in the
Ames yacht.There was much whispering, much shaking of heads, but little
information.But this I know: the queen, the great Isabella, had a
lover, a wonderful tenor, Marfori, Marquis de Loja.And one day a babe
was taken quietly to a little cottage in the Granada hills.Rumor said
that it was an Infanta, and that the tenor was its father.One man, perhaps: old Rafael de Rincon.But Rome suddenly recalled
him from Isabella's court, and after that he was very quiet."Ames," he said, "traveled much in
Europe.He bought a vineyard in Granada--the
one from which he still procures his wine.And there--who knows?--he
met the Infanta.But probably neither he nor she guessed her royal
birth.""Well, they eloped--who knows?Whether married or not, I can not say.But it is evident she went with him to Colombia, where, perhaps, he
was seeking a concession from Congress in Bogota.Then came the news of his father's sudden death.Possibly he bade her wait for his return.But a
prospective mother is often excitable.She waited a day, a week--who
knows how long?she was wild
to do such a thing.She died at the little
riverine town of Badillo, after her babe, Carmen, was born."A heritage from her grandfather, the tenor, Marfori," Lafelle
suggested."But--the portraits--what is the name under that of Ames?"Yes, for Guillermo in Spanish is William.Doubtless Ames told her his
name was Will, contracted from Wilton, the name he went by in his
youth.And the nearest the Spanish could come to it was Guillermo.Diego's name was Guillermo Diego Polo.And after he had seen that name
in the locket he used it as a further means of strengthening his claim
upon the girl.""Then--she is--a--princess!""Yes, doubtless, if my reasoning is correct.Not an Inca princess, but
a princess of the reigning house of Spain."Haynerd could hold himself no longer, but rushed madly from the room
and tore across town to the office of the Express.Then came the white-enameled ambulance, dashing and careening to the
doors of the building where Ames lay so quiet.Gently, silently, the
great body was lifted and borne below.And then the chattering,
gesticulating mob poured from the court room, from the halls and
corridors, and out into the chill sunlight of the streets, where they
formed anew into little groups, and went over again the dramatic
events but a few minutes past.Then, too, emerged Carmen, heavily veiled from the curious, vulgar
gaze of the rabble, and entered the waiting limousine, with the
Beaubien and Hitt.Miss Wall and the gasping Jude followed in another.The judge had bidden the girl go on her own recognizance.The arrest
at Avon; the matter of bail; all had merged into the excitement of the
hour and been forgotten.Ketchim went out on Cass's arm.The judge had
ordered the clerk to enter an adjournment.*       *       *       *       *

All that afternoon and far into the night a gaping, wondering
concourse braved the cold and stood about the walk that led up to the
little Beaubien cottage.Within, the curtains were drawn, and Sidney,
Jude, and Miss Wall answered the calls that came incessantly over the
telephone and to the doors.Sidney had not been in the court room, for
Haynerd had left him at the editor's desk in his own absence.But with
the return of Haynerd the lad had hurried into a taxicab and commanded
the chauffeur to drive madly to the Beaubien home.And once through
the door, he clasped the beautiful girl in his arms and strained her
to his breast."My own, my very own little sister!We only
pretended before, didn't we?But now--now, oh, God above!The scarce comprehending girl drew his head down and kissed him."Sidney," she murmured, "the ways of God are past finding out!"Aye, for again, as of old, He had chosen the foolish things of the
world to confound the wise; He had chosen the weak to confound the
mighty; and the base things, and the things despised, had He used to
bring to naught the things that are.That no flesh might
glory in His terrible presence!The girl smiled up at him; then turned away.she kept repeating, groping her way about
the room as if in a haze.The still dazed Beaubien drew the girl into her arms.Yet I
called you that from the very first.And he--that
man--your father!"It--"

Then the Beaubien's heart almost stopped.What,
then, would this sudden turn in the girl's life mean to the lone woman
who clung to her so?"No, mother dearest," whispered Carmen, looking up through her tears."For even if it should be true, I will not leave you.He--he--"

She stopped; and would speak of him no more.But neither of them knew as yet that in that marvelous Fifth Avenue
palace, behind those drawn curtains and guarded bronze doors, at which
an eager crowd stood staring, Ames, the superman, lay dying, his left
side, from the shoulder down, paralyzed.*       *       *       *       *

In the holy quiet of the first hours of morning, the mist rose, and
the fallen man roused slowly out of his deep stupor.And then through
the dim-lit halls of the great mansion rang a piercing cry.For when
he awoke, the curtain stood raised upon his life; and the sight of its
ghastly content struck wild terror to his naked soul.He had dreamed as he lay there, dreamed while the mist was rising.He
thought he had been toiling with feverish energy through those black
hours, building a wall about the things that were his.And into the
design of the huge structure he had fitted the trophies of his
conquest.Gannette toiled with him, straining, sweating, groaning.Together they reared that monstrous wall; and as they labored, the man
plotted the death of his companion when the work should be done, lest
he ask for pay.And into the corners of the wall they fitted little
skulls.These were the children of Avon who had never played.And over
the great stones which they heaved into place they sketched red
dollar-marks; and their paint was human blood.A soft wind swept over
the rising structure, and it bore a gentle voice: "I am Love."But the
toilers looked up and cursed.And over the rim of the wall looked fair faces."We are
Truth, we are Life!"But the men frothed with fury, and hurled skulls
at the faces, and bade them begone!A youth and a tender girl looked
down at the sweating toilers."We ask help; we are young, and times
are so hard!"And then the darkness settled down,
for the wall was now so high that it shut out the sun.And the great
man howled with laughter; the wall was done.So he turned and smote
his companion unto death, and dipped his hands in the warm blood of
the quivering corpse.And then he sought to
mount the wall.But his hands slipped on the human blood of the red,
slimy dollar-marks, and he fell crashing back among his tinkling
treasures.The naked, splitting skulls
leered at him.The toothless jaws clattered, and the eyeless sockets
glowed eerily.He begged that a rope be
lowered.He would go out once more into the sunlit world.But the
chill wind brought him only despairing moans.Then he rushed madly to the wall, and smote it with his bare hands.It
mocked him with the strength which he had given it.He turned and tore
his hair and flesh.He gnashed his teeth until they broke into bits.He cursed; he raved; he pleaded; he offered all his great treasure for
freedom.But the skulls grinned their horrid mockery at him; and the
blood on the stones dripped upon his burning head.And above it all he
heard the low plotting of those without who were awaiting his death,
that they might throw down the wall and take away his treasure.And then his fear became frenzy; his love of gold turned to horror;
his reason fled; and he dashed himself wildly against the prison which
he had reared, until he fell, bleeding and broken.And as he fell, he
heard the shrill cackle of demons that danced their hellish steps on
the top of the wall.Then the Furies flew down and bound him tight."Ah, my God, What might I not have made of Thy fair world Had I
  but loved Thy highest creature here?It was my duty to have loved
  the highest; It surely was my profit had I known."Then he
sought to raise his arms, to move.And then the scream
tore from his dry throat.The physicians bent over him and
sought to soothe his mental agony.The man's torture was fearful to
behold; his weakness, pitiable.But the
sleep was one of unbroken horror; and those in the room stopped in the
course of their duties; and their faces blanched; and they held their
hands to their ears, when his awful moans echoed through the curtained
room.Through his dreams raced the endless panorama of his crowded life.Now
he was wading through muddy slums where stood the wretched houses
which he rented for immoral purposes.And then he hurried to Avon; and there he dug into those fresh
graves--dug, dug, dug, throwing the dirt up in great heaps behind him.And into the face of each corpse as he dragged it out of its damp bed
he peered eagerly.But with awful moans he threw them from him in
turn, for she was not there.Then he fled down, down, far into the burning South; and there he
roamed the trackless wastes, calling her name.And the wild beasts and
the hissing serpents looked out at him from the thick bush, looked
with great, red eyes, and then fled from him with loathing.And,
suddenly, he came upon another mound near the banks of a great river.And over it stood a rude cross; and on the cross he read the dim,
penciled word, _Dolores_.how he cried out for the oblivion
that was not his.But the ghastly mound froze his blood, and he rushed
from it in terror, and fell, whirling over and over, down, down into
eternal blackness filled with dying men's groans!The exhausted attendants stood about
the bed with bated breath.The physicians had called Doctor Morton in
consultation, for the latter was a brain specialist.And while they
sat gazing at the crazed, stricken giant, hopelessly struggling to
lift the inert mass of his dead body, Reverend Darius Borwell entered.He bowed silently to them all; then went to the bedside and took the
patient's hand.A moment later he turned to the physicians and
nurses."Let us ask God's help for Mr.They bowed, and he knelt beside the bed and prayed long and earnestly;
prayed that the loving Father who had made man in His image would take
pity on the suffering one who lay there, and, if it be His will, spare
him for Jesus' sake.He arose from his knees, and they all sat quiet for some moments.Then
Doctor Morton's heavy voice broke the silence of death.Borwell,"
he said in awful earnestness, extending his hand toward the bed, "cure
that man, if your religion is anything more than a name!"A hot flush of indignation spread over the minister's face; but he did
not reply."Gentlemen," he said solemnly, "Mr.Ames, I think, is past our aid.There is nothing on earth that can save him.If he lives, he will be
hopelessly insane.""Upstairs, sir, in her apartments," answered the maid, wiping her red
eyes."See that she remains there," said the doctor gruffly."Gentlemen,"
turning again to the physicians, "I have but one suggestion.Send
for--for--that little girl, Carmen.""It is ill-advised, Doctor," interrupted one of the men."It would
only further excite him."I do not agree with you," returned Doctor Morton."As it is, he is
doomed.With her here--there may be a chance."The others shook their heads; but Doctor Morton persisted stubbornly."If she is sent for, I shall
retire from the case.""Very well," announced Doctor Morton evenly, "then I will take it
myself."He rose and went out into the vestibule where there was a
telephone.Calling for the Beaubien cottage, he gave a peremptory
order that Carmen come at once in the automobile which he was sending
for her.The Beaubien turned from the telephone to the girl."Why--is it--is he--"

"They say he is--dying," the woman whispered.Carmen stood for a minute as if stunned."Why--I--didn't know--that
there was--anything wrong.The Beaubien threw her arms around the girl.Father Waite rose from
the table where he had been writing, and came to them.A few minutes later the great bronze doors of the Ames mansion swung
wide to admit the daughter of the house.Doctor Morton met the wondering girl, and led her directly into the
sick-room."Miss Carmen," he said gravely, "Mr.The girl turned upon him like a flash from a clear sky."You mean, he
_shall_ not live!"Then a sense of her
magnificent environment, of her strange position, and of the vivid
events of the past few hours swept over her, and she became
embarrassed.The nurses and attendants, too, who stood about and
stared so hard at her, added to her confusion."Listen," he said, "I am leaving now,
but you will remain.If I am needed, one of the maids will summon
me."Carmen stood for a moment without speaking.Then she walked slowly to
the bed and looked down at the man.Doctor Morton motioned to the
attendants to withdraw.Then he himself stepped softly out and closed
the door.When the girl turned around, she was alone--with death.CHAPTER 19


A curious, gossiping world, dwelling only in the froth of the human
mind, will not comprehend for many a year to come what took place in
that dim, tapestried chamber of the rich man in those next hours.When
twilight began to steal through the marble halls of the great,
shrouded mansion, the nurse in charge, becoming apprehensive, softly
opened the door of the sick-room and peeped in.Through the darkness
she saw the girl, sitting beside the bed, with the man's right hand
clasped in both of hers, and her head resting upon his shoulder.And
the nurse quickly closed the door again in awe, and stole away.The girl sat there all that day and all that night, nor would leave
but for brief moments to eat, or to reassure the Beaubien over the
telephone that all was well.Doctor Morton came, and went, and came
again.Carmen smiled, and held his hand for a moment each time, but
said little.And, more, his cheeks were stained where
the scalding tears had coursed down them.But the doctor would ask no
questions.And three days and nights passed thus, while Carmen dwelt with the man
who, as the incarnation of error, seeking the destruction of others,
had destroyed himself.Then Doctor Morton announced to a waiting world that his patient would
live--but he would say no more.And the world heard, too, that
Kathleen Ames had left her father's roof--left in humiliation and
chagrin when she learned that Carmen had come there to live--and had
gone to England for a prolonged visit with the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her now thoroughly dismayed son.But Sidney came; and with
him the black-veiled Beaubien.And they both knelt beside the bed of
suffering; and the hand of the now quiet man slowly went out and lay
for a moment upon their bowed heads, while Carmen stood near.Then
Willett was sent for; and he came often after that, and took his
master's scarce audible instructions, and went away again to touch the
wires and keys that ended the war of hatred at Avon; that brought
Father Danny in the master's private car to the great metropolitan
hospital; that sent to the startled Hitt the canceled mortgage papers
on the Express; and that inaugurated that great work of restitution
which held the dwellers in the Ames mansion toiling over musty books
and forgotten records for months to come.What had passed between the man and the sweet-faced girl who hovered
over him like a ray of light, no one may know.That he had trod the
glowing embers of hell, his cavernous, deep-lined face and whitening
hair well testified.It was said afterward that on that third day he
had opened his eyes and looked straight into those of the girl.It was
said that she then whispered but one word, "Father."And that, when
the sound of her low voice fell upon his straining ears, he had
reached out the arm that still held life, and had drawn her head down
upon his breast, and wept like a motherless babe.But what he had
said, if aught, about the abandoned mother who, on the banks of the
distant river, years gone, had yielded her life to him and his child,
no one knew.Of but one thing was there any certainty: the name of
Padre Jose de Rincon had not crossed their lips during those dark
days.Then strong men lifted the giant from his bed
and placed him in a wheel chair; and Carmen drew the chair out into
the conservatory, among the ferns and flowers, and sat beside him, his
hand still clasped in both of hers.That he had found life, no one who
marked his tense, eager look, which in every waking moment lay upon
the girl, could deny.His body was dead; his soul was fluttering
feebly into a new sense of being.But with the awakening of conscience, in the birth-throes of a new
life, came the horrors, the tortures, the wild frenzy of self-loathing;
and, but for the girl who clung so desperately to him, he would have
quickly ended his useless existence.The stage upon which the curtain had risen,
whereon he saw the hourly portrayal of his own fiendish deeds, stood
always before him like a haunting spectre; and as he gazed with
horrified eyes, his hair grew hourly white.And the torture was rendered more poignant by the demands of his
erstwhile associates and henchmen.They had taken fright at the first
orders which had issued from the sick-bed, but now they swooped down
upon the harassed man to learn what might be expected from him in the
future.What were to be his policies now in regard to those manifold
interests which he was pursuing with such vigor a few weeks ago?Was
he still bent upon depriving Senator Gossitch of the seat which the
Ames money had purchased?The
Amalgamated Spinners' Association must know at once his further plans.His great railroad projects, his
mining ventures, his cotton deals, his speculations and gambling
schemes--whither should they tend now?Ward bosses, dive keepers,
bank presidents, lawyers, magnates, and preachers clamored for
admission at his doors when they learned that he would live, but that
a marvelous, incomprehensible change had swept over him.The tired, hectored man turned to Carmen.And she called Hitt and
Waite and the keen-minded Beaubien.The latter's wide business
experience and worldly knowledge now stood them all in good stead, and
she threw herself like a bulwark between the stricken man and the
hounds that roared at his gates.There were those among them who, like
Ames, had bitterly fought all efforts at industrial and social reform,
and yet who saw the dawning of a new era in the realms of finance, of
politics, of religion.There were those who sensed the slow awakening
of the world-conscience, and who resisted it desperately, and who now
sat frightened and angered at the thought of losing their great
leader.Their attitude toward life, like his, had been wrong from the
beginning; they, like him, were striking examples of the dire effects
of a false viewpoint in the impoverishing of human life.But, with
him, they had built up a tremendous material fabric.And now they
shook with fear as they saw its chief support removed.For they must
know that his was a type that was fast passing, and after it must come
the complete breakdown of the old financial order.His world-embracing
gambling--which touched all men in some way, for it had to do with the
very necessities of life, with crops, with railroads, with industries,
and out of which he had coined untold millions--had ceased forever.And to him also came Reverend Darius Borwell, in whose congregation
sat sanctimonious malefactors of vast wealth, whose pockets bulged
with disease-laden profits from the sales of women's bodies and souls.Reverend Borwell came to offer the sufferer the dubious consolations
of religion--and inquire if his beautiful change of heart would affect
the benefaction which he had designed for the new church.Ah, this was the hour when the fallen giant faced the Apostle's awful
question: What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now
ashamed?_For the end of those things is death!_

And then came Monsignor Lafelle, asking not to see the sick man, but
the girl.And, alone with her in the great library that day, he bent
low over her hand and begged that she would forgive and forget.Ames that flagrantly false tale of the girl's
parentage.He had received it from Wenceslas, in Cartagena.It was he
who, surmising the dark secret of Ames, had concluded that the
supposed Infanta had been his wife.And he had returned to New York
to confront him with the charge, and to make great capital out of it.But he had never suspected for a moment Carmen's connection with the
mystery.And now--

But the girl saw only the image of God in the humiliated man.And when
he kissed her hand and departed, she bade him know, always, that she
loved him as a brother.And he knew it, knew that her love was of the
spirit--it left all for the Christ.A few days later there was delivered at the Ames mansion a cable
message from Cartagena, in reply to one which the master had sent to
the lawyer, Estrella.Ames shook with suppressed excitement when he
read it.Then he bade Carmen send at once for Hitt, Willett, and
Captain McCall, and leave them with him for a private conference.Ames repeated, as the three
men sat leaning eagerly forward an hour later, drinking in every word
he spoke."If the mission is successful, well and good.If it fails,
then our silence now will be justified, for as yet I have said nothing
to her regarding him.Wenceslas has
won--but with--but of that later.When can you get under way,
McCall?"The sudden flash of his old-time energy nearly startled them
from their chairs."And," he added, "you, Mr.Now, Willett, have the door of my limousine widened to accommodate
this wheel chair.I want a dozen men to insure our privacy, and to
keep the way clear.No one not in our confidence must see us depart.""But--Carmen--"

"Goes with us," returned Ames."I can not spare her for a moment.Madam Beaubien will have charge of the house during our absence.We
will be back here, weather favorable, in three weeks--or not at all!""Yet, she will know--"

"Nothing.I take the trip, ostensibly, for the change; to get away
from those who are hounding me here; for recuperation--anything!The man's eyes glistened like live coals, and
his sunken cheeks took on a feverish glow.That night the _Cossack_, enveloped in gloom, steamed noiselessly out
of New York harbor, and turned her prow to the South.And when she
had entered the high sea, Captain McCall from his bridge aloft sent a
message down to the waiting engineer:

"Full speed ahead!"CHAPTER 20


Cartagena's slumber of centuries had been broken by nearly four years
of civil warfare.But on the day that the lookout in the abandoned
convent of Santa Candelaria, on the summit of La Popa, flashed the
message down into the old city that a steam yacht had appeared on the
northern horizon, she was preparing to sink back again into quiet
dreams.For peace was being concluded among the warring political
factions.The country lay devastated and blood-soaked; but the cause
of Christ had triumphed, and the Church still sat supreme in the
councils of Bogota.Cartagena was _en fete_; the last of the political
agitators would be executed on the morrow.And so the lookout's
message was received with indifference, even though he embellished it
with the comment that the boat must be privately owned, as no ships of
the regular lines were due to arrive that day.Quietly the graceful craft swept down past Tierra Bomba and into the
Boca Chica, between the ancient forts of San Fernando and San Jose,
and came to anchor out in the beautiful harbor, a half mile from the
ancient gate of the clock.A few curious idlers along the shore
watched it and commented on its perfect lines.And the numerous
officials of the port lazily craned their necks at it, and yawningly
awaited the arrival of the skiff that was immediately lowered and
headed for the pier.The tall American who stepped from the little boat and came at once to
them to show his papers, easily satisfied their curiosity, for many
tourists of the millionaire class dropped anchor in Cartagena's
wonderful harbor, and came ashore to wander among the decaying
mementos of her glorious past.And this boat was not a stranger to
these waters.On the yacht itself, as they glanced again toward it,
there was no sign of life.Even the diminishing volume of smoke that
rose from its funnels evidenced the owner's intention of spending some
time in that romantic spot.From the dock, Hitt passed through the old gateway in the massive
wall, quickly crossed the _Plaza de Coches_, and lost himself in the
gay throngs that were entering upon the day's festivities.Occasionally he dropped into wine shops and little stores, and
lingered about to catch stray bits of gossip.Then he slowly made his
way up past the Cathedral and into the _Plaza de Simon Bolivar_.For a while, sitting on a bench in front of the equestrian statue of
the famous _Libertador_, he watched the passing crowds.From time to
time his glance strayed over toward the Cathedral.Once he rose, and
started in that direction; then came back and resumed his seat.It was
evident that he was driven hard, and yet knew not just what course to
pursue.Finally he jumped to his feet and went over to a little cigar store
which had caught his eye.He bent over the soiled glass case and
selected several cigars from the shabby stock.Putting one of them
into his mouth, he lighted it, and then casually nodded to a
powerfully built man standing near.The latter turned to the proprietor and made some comment in Spanish.Hitt immediately replied to it in the same tongue.The man flushed
with embarrassment; then doffed his hat and offered an apology."I
forget, senor," he said, "that so many Americans speak our language."Hitt held out his hand and laughed heartily at the incident.Then his
eye was attracted by a chain which the man wore."_Cierto_, _senor_," returned the man cordially."It came from an
Indian grave up in Guamoco.I am a _guaquero_--grave digger--by
profession; Jorge Costal, by name."Somehow he seemed to be familiar with that
name.Somewhere he seemed to have heard it."Suppose," he said, in his excellent Spanish, "that we cross
the _Plaza_ to yonder wine shop.You may be able to tell me some of
the history of this interesting old town.And--it would be a great
favor, senor."The man bowed courteously and accepted the invitation.A few moments
later they sat at a little table, with a bottle between them,
commenting on the animated scene in the street without."Peace will be concluded to-day, they say," reflected Hitt, by way of
introduction."Yes," returned the man grimly, "there is but little more blood to
let."The other is--"

He stopped and eyed Hitt furtively.But the American manifested only a
casual interest."They were posted this morning," said the man."Amado Jesus Fanor and
Jose de Rincon.""A liberal general and an ex-priest."It is the custom to--to shoot ex-priests down
here, eh?"But this man--senor, why do you ask?""Well--it struck me as curious--that's all," returned Hitt, at a loss
for a suitable answer."You didn't happen to know these men, I
presume?""_Na_, _senor_, you seek to involve me.Who are you, that you ask such
questions of a stranger?"The man reflected the suspicious caution of
these troublous times."Why, _amigo_, it is of no concern to me," replied Hitt easily,
flicking the ashes from his cigar."I once knew a fellow by that name.Learned that he afterward went to Simiti.But
I--"

"Senor!""Are you the _Americano_, the man
who explored?""I am," said Hitt, bending closer to him."And we are well met, for
you are Don Jorge, who knew Padre Jose de Rincon in Simiti, no?"The man cast a timid glance around the room."Senor," he whispered,
"we must not say these things here!I leave you now--"

"Not yet!"He was first three years in the prison in Cartagena.But the Bish--"

"Eh?Don Wenceslas had him removed to San Fernando?""And--"

"He will be shot to-morrow, senor.""Why do you
say he is an ex-priest?""He has just been excommunicated," replied the man."Cursed, they say,
by bell, book, and candle."Of course Don Wenceslas would not dare to execute a priest in
good standing.And so he
