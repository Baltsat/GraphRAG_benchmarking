After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness.""He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
among the marble pillars of the Crowles mausoleum, where lay in
pitying sleep the misguided woman whose gods of gold and tinsel had
betrayed her.On the outskirts of the Bronx, in a newly opened suburb, a slender
girl, with books and papers under her arm, walked slowly against the
sharp wind, holding her hat with her free hand, and talking rapidly to
a young man who accompanied her.Toward them came an old <DW64>,
leaning upon a cane.As he stepped humbly aside to make room, the girl
looked up.Then, without stopping, she slipped a few coins into his
coat pocket as she passed.The <DW64> stood in dumb amazement.He was poor--his clothes were thin
and worn--but he was not a beggar--he had asked nothing.The girl
turned and threw back a smile to him.Then of a sudden there came into
the old man's wrinkled, care-lined face such a look, such a
comprehension of that love which knows neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek
nor Barbarian, as would have caused even the Rabbis, at the cost of
defilement, to pause and seek its heavenly meaning.A few blocks farther on the strong wind sternly disputed the girl's
right to proceed, and she turned with a merry laugh to her companion.But as she stood, the wind fell, leaving a heap of dead leaves about
her feet.She stooped and
took up a two-dollar bill.Her companion threw her a wondering look; but the girl made no
comment.In silence they went on, until a few minutes more of brisk
walking brought them to a newly built, stucco-coated bungalow.Running
rapidly up the steps, the girl threw wide the door and called, "Mother
dear!"The Beaubien rose from her sewing to receive the hearty embrace.she said, devouring the sparkling creature with eager
eyes.Lewis begins his law course at once, and I may take
what I wish.Hitt's coming to call to-night and bring a
friend, a Mr.The Beaubien drew the girl to her and kissed her again and again.Then
she glanced over her shoulder at the man with a bantering twinkle in
her eyes and said, "Don't you wish you could do that?"Yes he can, too, mother," asserted the girl."I'm afraid it wouldn't look well," he said."And, besides, I don't dare lose my heart to her."With a final squeeze the girl tore herself from the Beaubien's
reluctant arms and hurried to the little kitchen."What is it
to-night, Jude?"she demanded, catching the domestic in a vigorous
embrace."Well, then, liver and bacon, with floating island," she whispered,
very mysteriously.Returning to the little parlor, Carmen encountered the fixed gaze of
both the Beaubien and Father Waite.she demanded, stopping and
looking from one to the other.said the Beaubien, in a tone of mock
severity."Oh," laughed the girl, running to the woman and seating herself in
the waiting lap, "he told, didn't he?Can't I ever trust you with a
secret?"in a tone of rebuke, turning to the man."Surely," he replied, laughing; "and I should not have divulged
this had I not seen in the incident something more than mere
chance--something meant for us all.""I--I think I have seen the working of a
stupendous mental law--am I not right?""You saw
a need, and met it, unsolicited.You found your own in another's
good."The girl smiled at the Beaubien without replying."What about it,
dearie?""She need not answer," said Father Waite, "for we know.She but cast
her bread upon the unfathomable ocean of love, and it returned to her,
wondrously enriched.""If you are going to talk about me, I shall not stay," declared
Carmen, rising.And she departed for the
kitchen, but not without leaving a smile for each of them as she went.The Beaubien and Father Waite remained some moments in silence."She is the light that is
guiding me.This little incident which you have just related is but a
manifestation of the law of love by which she lives.She gave,
unasked, and with no desire to be seen and advertised.There was no chance, no
miracle, no luck about it.It was--it
was--only the working of her beloved Christ-principle.if
we only knew--"

"We _shall_ know, Madam!""Her secret is
but the secret of Jesus himself, which was open to a world too dull to
comprehend.And," his eyes brightening, "to
that end I have been formulating a great plan.That's why I've asked
Hitt to come here to-night.Remember, my
dear friend, we are true searchers; and 'all things work together for
good to them that love God.'Our love of truth and real good is so
great that, like the consuming desire of the Jewish nation, it is
_bound_ to bring the Christ!"*       *       *       *       *

For three months the Beaubien and Carmen had dwelt together in this
lowly environment; and here they had found peace, the first that the
tired woman had known since childhood.The sudden culmination of those
mental forces which had ejected Carmen from society, crushed Ketchim
and a score of others, and brought the deluded Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to
a bitter end, had left the Beaubien with dulled sensibilities.Even
Ames himself had been shocked into momentary abandonment of his
relentless pursuit of humanity by the unanticipated _denouement_.But
when he had sufficiently digested the newspaper accounts wherein were
set forth in unsparing detail the base rumors of the girl's parentage
and of her removal from a brothel before her sudden elevation to
social heights, he rose in terrible wrath and prepared to hunt down to
the death the perpetrators of the foul calumny.Whence had come this
tale, which even the girl could not refute?He had
sailed for Europe--though but a day before.The man was
cringing like a craven murderer in his cell, for none dared give him
bail.Was it revenge for his own sharp move in regard to
La Libertad?He would have given all he possessed to lay his heavy
hands upon the guilty ones!The editors of the great newspapers,
perhaps?Ames raged like a wounded lion in the office of every editor
in the city.But they were perfectly safe, for the girl, although she
told a straightforward story, could not say positively that the
published statements concerning her were false.Yet, though few knew
it, there were two city editors and several reporters who, in the days
immediately following, found it convenient to resign their positions
and leave the city before the awful wrath of the powerful man.And, after weeks of terror, that
browbeaten woman, her hair whitening under the terrible persecution of
her relentless master, fled secretly, with her terrified daughter, to
England, whither the stupified Duke of Altern and his scandalized
mother had betaken themselves immediately following the expose.Thereupon Ames's lawyer drew up a bill of divorce, alleging desertion,
and laid it before the judge who fed from his master's hand.Meantime, the devouring wrath of Ames swept like a prairie fire over the
dry, withering stalks of the smart set.He vowed he would take Carmen
and flaunt her in the faces of the miserable character-assassins who
had sought her ruin!He swore he would support her with his untold
millions and force society to acknowledge her its queen!He had it
in his power to wreck the husband of every arrogant, supercilious
dame in the entire clique!He commenced at once with the unfortunate
Gannette.The latter, already tottering, soon fell before the subtle
machinations of Hodson and his able cohorts.Then, as a telling example
to the rest, Ames pursued him to the doors of the Lunacy Commission,
and rested not until that body had condemned his victim to a living
death in a state asylum.Kane, Fitch, and Weston fled to cover, and
concentrated their guns upon their common enemy.The Beaubien alone
stood out against him for three months.Her existence was death in
life; but from the hour that she first read the newspaper intelligence
regarding Carmen and the unfortunate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, she hid the
girl so completely that Ames was effectually balked in his attempts at
drastic vindication in her behalf.But this served only to intensify his anger, and he thereupon turned
its full force upon the lone woman.Driven to desperation, she stood
at length at bay and hurled at him her remaining weapon.Again the
social set was rent, and this time by the report that the black cloud
of bigamy hung over Ames.It was a fat season for the newspapers, and
they made the most of it.As a result, several of them found
themselves with libel suits on their hands.The Beaubien herself was
confronted with a suit for defamation of character, and was obliged to
testify before the judge whom Ames owned outright that she had but the
latter's word for the charge, and that, years since, in a moment of
maudlin sentimentalism, he had confessed to her that, as far as he
knew, the wife of his youth was still living.Ames then took his heavy toll, and retired within himself to sulk
and plan future assaults and reprisals.The Beaubien, crushed, broken, sick at heart, gathered up the scant
remains of her once large fortune, disposed of her effects, and
withdrew to the outskirts of the city.She would have left the
country, but for the fact that the tangled state of her finances
necessitated her constant presence in New York while her lawyers
strove to bring order out of chaos and placate her raging persecutor.To flee meant complete abandonment of her every financial resource to
Ames.And so, with the assistance of Father Waite and Elizabeth Wall,
who placed themselves at once under her command, she took a little
house, far from the scenes of her troubles, and quietly removed
thither with Carmen.One day shortly thereafter a woman knocked timidly at her door.Carmen
saw the caller and fled into her arms.The woman had come to return the string of pearls which the girl had
thrust into her hands on the night of the Charity Ball.She had not been able to bring herself to sell them.She
had wanted--oh, she knew not what, excepting that she wanted to see
again the girl whose image had haunted her since that eventful night
when the strange child had wandered into her abandoned life.Yes, she
would have given her testimony as to Carmen; but who would have
believed her, a prostitute?And--but the radiant girl gathered her in
her arms and would not let her go without a promise to return.And each time there was a change in
her.The Beaubien always forced upon her a little money and a promise
to come back.It developed that Jude was cooking in a cheap down-town
restaurant."Why not for us, mother, if she will?"And, though the sin-stained woman demurred and protested her
unworthiness, yet the love that knew no evil drew her irresistibly,
and she yielded at length, with her heart bursting.Then, in her great joy, Carmen's glad cry echoed through the little
house: "Oh, mother dear, we're free, we're free!"But the Beaubien was not free.Night after night her sleepless pillow
was wet with bitter tears of remorse, when the accusing angel stood
before her and relentlessly revealed each act of shameful meanness, of
cruel selfishness, of sordid immorality in her wasted life.And,
lastly, the weight of her awful guilt in bringing about the
destruction of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles lay upon her soul like a mountain.Oh, if she had only foreseen even a little of it!Oh, that Carmen had
come to her before--or not at all!And yet she could not wish that she
had never known the girl.The day of judgment was bound
to come.And, but for the comforting presence of
that sweet child, she had long since become a raving maniac.It was
Carmen who, in those first long nights of gnawing, corroding remorse,
wound her soft arms about the Beaubien's neck, as she lay tossing in
mental agony on her bed, and whispered the assurances of that infinite
Love which said, "Behold, I make all things new!"It was Carmen who
whispered to her of the everlasting arms beneath, and of the mercy
reflected by him who, though on the cross, forgave mankind because of
their pitiable ignorance.It is ignorance, always ignorance of what
constitutes real good, that makes men seek it through wrong channels.The Beaubien had sought good--all the world does--but she had never
known that God alone is good, and that men cannot find it until they
reflect Him.And so she had "missed the mark."Oh, sinful, mesmerized
world, ye shall find Me--the true good--only when ye seek Me with all
your heart!And yet, "I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."Only a God who is love could voice such a promise!And Carmen knew;
and she hourly poured her great understanding of love into the empty
heart of the stricken Beaubien.Then at last came days of quiet, and planning for the future.The
Beaubien would live--yes, but not for herself.Nay, that life had gone
out forever, nor would mention of it pass her lips again.The
Colombian revolution--her mendacious connivances with Ames--her
sinful, impenitent life of gilded vice--aye, the door was now closed
against that, absolutely and forever more.She had passed through the
throes of a new birth; she had risen again from the bed of anguish;
but she rose stripped of her worldly strength.Carmen was now the
staff upon which she leaned.And Carmen--what had been her thought when foul calumny laid its sooty
touch upon her?What had been the working of her mind when that world
which she had sought to illumine with the light of her own purity had
cast her out?When the blow fell the portals of her mind closed at once against
every accusing thought, against every insidious suggestion of defeat,
of loss, of dishonor.The arrows of malice, as well as those of
self-pity and condemnation, snapped and fell, one by one, as they
hurtled vainly against the whole armor of God wherewith the girl stood
clad.Self sank into service; and she gathered the bewildered,
suffering Beaubien into her arms as if she had been a child.She would
have gone to Ames, too, had she been permitted--not to plead for
mercy, but to offer the tender consolation and support which, despite
the havoc he was committing, she knew he needed even more than the
Beaubien herself."Paul had been a murderer," she often said, as she sat in the darkness
alone with the suffering woman and held her trembling hand."But he
became the chief of apostles.When the light came, he
shut the door against the past.If he hadn't, dearest, he never could
have done what he did.Ames, will have to do the
same."And this the Beaubien could do, and did, after months of
soul-racking struggle.But Ames sat in spiritual darkness, whipped by
the foul brood of lust and revenge, knowing not that the mountainous
wrath which he hourly heaped higher would some day fall, and bury him
fathoms deep.Throughout the crisis Father Waite had stood by them stanchly."I've just longed for some reasonable
excuse to become a social outcast," the latter had said, as she was
helping Carmen one day to pack her effects prior to removing from the
Hawley-Crowles mansion."I long for a hearthstone to which I can
attach myself--"

"Then attach yourself to ours!""For I know that now you are really
going to live--and I want to live as you will.Moreover--" She paused
and smiled queerly at the girl--"I am quite in love with your hero,
Father Waite, you know."Harris, too, made a brief call before departing again for Denver."I've got to hustle for a living now," he explained, "and it's me for
the mountains once more!New York is no place for such a tender lamb
as I. Oh, I've been well trimmed--but I know enough now to keep away
from this burg!"While he was yet speaking there came a loud ring at the front door of
the little bungalow, followed immediately by the entrance of the
manager of a down-town vaudeville house.He plunged at once into his
errand.He would offer Carmen one hundred dollars a week, and a
contract for six months, to appear twice daily in his theater.but she did put it over
the society ginks."And the Beaubien, shivering at the awful
proposal, was glad Harris was there to lead the zealous theatrical man
firmly to the door.Lastly, came one Amos A. Hitt, gratuitously, to introduce himself as
one who knew Cartagena and was likely to return there in the not
distant future, where he would be glad to do what he might to remove
the stain which had been laid upon the name of the fair girl.The
genuineness of the man stood out so prominently that the Beaubien took
him at once into her house, where he was made acquainted with Carmen."Oh," cried the girl, "Cartagena!Why, I wonder--do you know Padre
Jose de Rincon?""A priest who once taught there in the University, many years ago?And
who was sent up the river, to Simiti?Then Carmen fell upon his neck; and there in that moment was begun a
friendship that grew daily stronger, and in time bore richest fruit.It soon became known that Hitt was giving a course of lectures that
fall in the University, covering the results of his archaeological
explorations; so Carmen and Father Waite went often to hear him.And
the long breaths of University atmosphere which the girl inhaled
stimulated a desire for more.Besides, Father Waite had some time
before announced his determination to study there that winter, as long
as his meager funds would permit."I shall take up law," he had one day said."It will open to me the
door of the political arena, where there is such great need of real
men, men who stand for human progress, patriotism, and morality.I
shall seek office--not for itself, but for the good I can do, and the
help I can be in a practical way to my fellow-men.Carmen shared the inspiration; and so she, too, with the Beaubien's
permission, applied for admittance to the great halls of learning, and
was accepted.*       *       *       *       *

"And now," began Father Waite that evening, when Hitt and his friend
had come, and, to the glad surprise of Carmen, Elizabeth Wall had
driven up in her car to take the girl for a ride, but had yielded to
the urgent invitation to join the little conference, "my plan, in
which I invite you to join, is, briefly, _to study this girl_!"Carmen's eyes opened wide, and her face portrayed blank amazement, as
Father Waite stood pointing gravely to her.Nor were the others less
astonished--all but the Beaubien."Let me explain," Father Waite continued."We are assembled here
to-night as representatives, now or formerly, of very diversified
lines of human thought.I have stood as the
embodiment of Christly claims, as the active agent of one of the
mightiest of human institutions, the ancient Christian Church.For
years I have studied its accepted authorities and its all-inclusive
assumptions, which embrace heaven, earth, and hell.For years I sought
with sincere consecration to apply its precepts to the dire needs of
humanity.I have traced its origin in the dim twilight of the
Christian era and its progress down through the centuries, through
heavy vicissitudes to absolute supremacy, on down through schisms and
subsequent decline, to the present hour, when the great system seems
to be gathering its forces for a life and death stand in this, the New
World.I have known and associated with its dignitaries and its humble
priests.I know the policies and motives underlying its quiet
movements.And so I
withdrew from it my allegiance."Carmen's thought, as she listened, was busy with another whose
experience had not been dissimilar, but about whom the human coils had
been too tightly wound to be so easily broken.Hitt," Father Waite went on, "represented
the great protest against the abuses and corruption which permeated
the system for which I stood.He, like myself, embodied the eternal
warfare of the true believer against the heretic.Yet, without my
churchly system, I was taught to believe, he and those who share his
thought are damned.we both claimed the same
divine Father, and accepted the Christly definition of Him as Love.We
were two brothers of the same great family, yet calling each other
_anathema_!""And to-day," he continued, "we
brothers are humbly meeting on the common ground of failure--failure
to understand the Christ, and to meet the needs of our fellow-men with
our elaborate systems of theology.""I heard another priest, years ago, make a similar confession," said
Hitt reflectively."I would he were here to-night!""He is here, in spirit," replied Father Waite; "for the same spirit of
eager inquiry and humble desire for truth that animates us no doubt
moved him.I have reason to think so," he added, looking at Carmen."For this girl's spiritual development I believe to be very largely
his work."He knew but little as yet of her
past association with the priest Jose.Hitt, represented the greatest systems of so-called
Christian belief," pursued Father Waite."Madam Beaubien, on the other
hand, has represented the world that waits, as yet vainly, for
redemption.We have not been able to afford it her.Yet--pardon my
frankness in thus referring to you, Madam.It is only to benefit us
all--that the means of redemption _have_ been brought to her, we must
now admit."She started to speak, but Father
Waite raised a detaining hand."Miss Wall
represents the weariness of spirit and unrest abroad in the world
to-day, the spirit that finds life not worth the while; and Mr.Haynerd voices the cynical disbelief, the agnosticism, of that great
class who can not accept the childish tenets of our dogmatic systems
of theology, yet who have nothing but the philosophy of stoicism or
epicureanism to offer in substitute.""You have me correctly classified," he said."I'm a Yankee, and from Missouri.""And now, having placed us," said the Beaubien, "how will you classify
Carmen?"Father Waite looked at the girl reverently."Hers is the leaven," he
replied gently, "which has leavened the whole lump."My good friends," he went on earnestly, "like all priests and
preachers, I have been but a helpless spectator of humanity's
troubles.I have longed and prayed to know how to do the works which
Jesus is said to have done; yet, at the sick-bed or the couch of
death, what could I do--I, to whom the apostolic virtue is supposed to
have descended in the long line of succession?I could give promises of
remitted sins--though I knew I spoke not truth.I could comfort by
voicing the insipid views of our orthodox heaven.And yet I know that
what I gave was but mental nostrums, narcotics, to stupify until death
might end the suffering."And if you were a good orthodox priest," interposed Haynerd, "you
would refuse burial to dissenters, and bar from your communion table
all who were not of your faith, eh?""I would have to, were I consistent; for Catholicism is
the only true faith, founded upon the revealed word of God, you know."He smiled pathetically as he looked around at the little group."Now," he continued, "you, Mr.Haynerd, are a man of the world.You
are not in sympathy with the Church.You are an infidel, an
unbeliever.And therefore are you '_anathema_,' you know.""But you can not deny that at times you think very
seriously.And, I may go farther: you long, intensely, for something
that the world does not offer.Now, what is it but truth that you are
seeking?""I want to know," answered Haynerd quickly.I
am fond of exhibitions of sleight-of-hand and jugglery.But the
priestly thaumaturgy that claims to transform a biscuit into the
flesh of a man dead some two thousand years, and a bit of grape juice
into his blood, irritates me inexpressibly!And so does the
jugglery by which your Protestant fellows, Hitt, attempt to reconcile
their opposite beliefs.Why, what difference can it possibly make
to the Almighty whether we miserable little beings down here are
baptised with water, milk, or kerosene, or whether we are immersed,
sprinkled, or well soused?for nearly twenty centuries
you have been wandering among the non-essentials.Isn't it time to get
down to business, and instead of burning at the stake every one who
differs with you, try conscientiously to put into practice a few of
the simple moral precepts, such as the Golden Rule, and loving
one's neighbor as one's self?""There," commented Father Waite, "you have a bit of the world's
opinion of the Church!Can we say that the censure is not just?Would
not Christ himself to-day speak even more scathingly to those who
advocate a system of belief that puts blinders on men's minds, and
then leads them into the pit of ignorance and superstition?""Ye have taken away the key of knowledge," murmured Carmen; "ye
entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye
hindered."exclaimed Haynerd, looking at the girl who stood as a
living protest against all that hampers the expansion of the human
mind; that quenches its note of joy, and dulls its enlarging and ever
nobler concept of God."Now I want to know, first, if there is a God;
and, if so, what He is, and what His relation is to me.I want to know
what I am, and why I am here, and what future I may look forward to,
if any.I don't care two raps about a God who can't help me here on
earth, who can't set me right and make me happy--cure my ills, meet my
needs, and supply a few of the luxuries as well.And if there is a
God, and we can meet Him only by dying, then why in the name of common
sense all this hullabaloo about death?Why, in that case, death is the
grandest thing in life!But
you preacher fellows fight death tooth and nail.You're scared stiff
when you contemplate it.You make Christianity just a grand
preparation for death.Yet it isn't the gateway to life to you, and
you know it!Then why, if you are honest, do you tell such rubbish to
your trusting followers?""I would remind you," returned Hitt with a little laugh, "that I
don't, now.""Well, friends," interposed Father Waite, "it is to take up for
earnest consideration just such questions as Mr.Haynerd propounds,
that I have my suggestion to make, namely, that we meet together once
or twice a week, or as often as we may agree upon, to search for--"
his voice dropped to a whisper--"to search for God, and with this
young girl as our guide.For I believe she is very close to Him.The
world knows God only by hearsay.Carmen has _proved_ Him."Men ask why it is," he went on, "that God remains hidden from them;
why they can not understand Him.They forget that Jesus revealed God
as Love.And, if that is so, in order to know Him all mankind must
love their fellow-men.But they go right on hating one another,
cheating, abusing, robbing, slaying, persecuting, and still wondering
why they don't know God, regardless of the only possible way of ever
working out from the evils by which they are beset, if we believe that
Jesus told the truth, or was correctly reported."He paused and
reflected for a moment.Then:

"The ancient prophet said: 'Ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye
shall search for me with all your hearts.'It is my proposal that we
bind ourselves together in such a search.To it we can bring diverse
talents.To our vast combined worldly experience, I bring knowledge of
the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers, together with Church history.Hitt brings his command of the Hebrew language and history, and an
intimate acquaintance with the ancient manuscripts, and Biblical
interpretation, together with a wide knowledge of the physical
sciences.Madam Beaubien, Miss Wall, and Mr.Haynerd contribute their
earnest, searching, inquisitive spirit, and a knowledge of the world's
needs.Moreover, we all come together without bias or prejudice.And
Carmen--she contributes that in which we have all been so woefully
lacking, and without which we can _never_ know God, the rarest,
deepest spirituality.Shall we
undertake the search, my friends?It means a study of her thought, and
the basis upon which it rests."The Beaubien raised her hand to her moist eyes.She was thinking of
that worldly coterie which formerly was wont to meet nightly in her
magnificent mansion to prey upon their fellows.Oh, how different the
spirit of this little gathering!"You will meet here, with me," she said in a broken voice.There were none there unacquainted with the sorrows of this penitent,
broken woman.Each rose in turn and clasped her hand.Carmen threw
her arms about her neck and kissed her repeatedly."You see," said the Beaubien, smiling up through her tears, "what this
child's religion is?Would the swinging of incense burners and the
mumbling of priestly formulae enhance it?""Jesus said, 'Having seen me ye have seen God,'" said Father Waite."And I say," replied the Beaubien, "that having seen this child, you
have indeed seen Him."CHAPTER 2


"I'm afraid," Haynerd was saying, as he and Father Waite were wending
their way to the Beaubien home a few evenings later, "that this Carmen
is the kind of girl you read about in sentimental novels; the kind who
are always just ready to step into heaven, but who count for little in
the warfare and struggle of actual mundane existence.She
isn't quite true to life, you know, as a book critic would say of an
impossible heroine.""You mistake, my friend," replied Father Waite warmly."She is the
very kind we would see oftener, were it not for the belief that years
bring wisdom, and so, as a consequence, the little child is crushed
beneath a load of false beliefs and human laws that make it reflect
its mortal parents, rather than its heavenly one.""But I'd like to see her under stress--"

"Under stress!You haven't the slightest conception
of the stress she's been under most of her life!But your criticism
unconsciously pays her the highest tribute, for her kind never show by
word, deed, or look what they are enduring.That frail-appearing girl
has stood up under loads that would have flattened you and me out like
gold leaf!"She's so far and away ahead
of mortals like you and me that she doesn't admit the reality and
power of evil--and, believe me, she's got her reasons for not
admitting it, too!Only try humbly to
attain a little of her understanding and faith; and try to avoid
making yourself ridiculous by criticising what you do not comprehend.That, indeed, has been mankind's age-long blunder--and they have
thereby made asses of themselves!"Edward Haynerd, or "Ned," as he was invariably known, prided himself
on being something of a philosopher.And in the name of philosophy he
chose to be quixotic.That one who hated the dissimulations and shams
of our class aristocracy so cordially should have earned his
livelihood--and a good one, too--as publisher of the Social Era, a
sprightly weekly chronicle of happenings in fashionable society, would
have appeared anomalous in any but a man gifted in the Greek
sophistries and their modern innumerable and arid offshoots.Haynerd
was a laughing Democritus, an easy-going, even-tempered fellow, doomed
to be loved, and by the same graces thoroughly cheated by the world in
general.He had in his rapid career of some thirty-five years dipped
deeply into things mundane, and had come to the surface, sputtering
and blowing, with his face well smeared with mud from the shallow
depths.Whereupon he remarked that such an existence was a poor way of
serving the Lord, and turned cynic.It
was likewise his capital and stock-in-trade.By it he won a place for
himself in the newspaper world, and later, as a credit asset, had
employed it successfully in negotiating for the Social Era.It taking
over the publication of this sheet he had remarked that life was
altogether too short to permit of attempting anything worth while; and
so he forthwith made no further assaults upon fame--assuming that he
had ever done so--but settled comfortably down to the enjoyment of his
sinecure.And as justification for his
self-imposed celibacy he pompously quoted Kant: "I am a bachelor, and
I could not cease to be a bachelor without a disturbance that would be
intolerable to me."He simply shirked
responsibility and ease-threatening risk."You see," he remarked, explaining himself later to Carmen, "I'm a
pseudo-litterateur--I conduct a 'Who's It?'for the quidnunces of this
blase old burg.And I really meet a need by furnishing an easy method
of suicide, for my little vanity sheet is a sort of social mirror,
that all who look therein may die of laughter.By the way, I had to
run those base squibs about you; but, by George!I'm going to make a
retraction in next Saturday's issue.I'll put a crimp in friend Ames
that'll make him squeal.I'll say he has ten wives, and eight of 'em
Zulus, at that!""We have enough to meet, without
going out of our way to stir up more.Let it all work out now, as it
will, in the right way."Say, don't you
think that in formulating a new religion you're carrying coals to
Newcastle?Seems to me we've got enough now, if we'd practice 'em."Haynerd, is only the practice of the teachings of a
Nazarene Jew, named Jesus," she replied gently."Well, my religion is Socialism, I guess," he said lightly.So we
meet on common ground, don't we?"She held out her hand, and he took
it, a puzzled expression coming into his face."Well," he said, glancing about, "we'll have to dispute that later.I
see Father Waite is about to open this little religious seminar.But
we'll get back to the discussion of myself," he added, his eyes
twinkling."For, like Thoreau, I prefer to discuss that subject,
because there's no other about which I know so much.""Nor so little," she added, laughing and squeezing his hand as she
turned from him.The little coterie took their places around the dining room table,
which was well strewn with books of reference and writing materials.A deep, reverent silence fell
upon the group."Friends," began Father Waite slowly, "we are inaugurating to-night a
mission of the most profound significance.No question so vitally
touches the human race as the one which we shall reverently discuss in
this and subsequent meetings.I thought as I came in here to-night of
the wisdom of Epictitus, who said, 'What do I want?To acquaint myself
with the true order of things and comply with it.'I am sure no
statement so fully expresses our common desire as that.""If Adam was a Baptist, I want to know
and comply with the fact."Then Father Waite held up a hand and again
became serious."Can we treat lightly even the Adam story, when we consider how much
misery and rancor its literal acceptance has caused among mankind?Out of deepest sympathy for a world in search of truth, let us pity
their stumblings, and take heed that we fall not ourselves."Carmen's hand stole toward the
Beaubien's and clasped it tightly."In these days, as of old, it is still said, 'There is no God!'And
yet, though the ignorant and wilful admit it not, mankind's very
existence is a function of their concept of a Creator, a sole
cause of all that is.No question, economic, social, political, or
other, is so vitally related to humanity as this: 'Is there a God?'And the corollary: 'What is His relation to me?'For there can be
nothing so important as a knowledge of truth.Can the existence
of a God be demonstrated?Can He be shown to be beneficent, in
view of the world's testimony?If the
Bible, then can its authenticity be established?The greatest of
our so-called civilizations are known as Christian.But who can say
by them what Christianity really is?""I am quite prepared to say what it is not!""Doubtless," resumed Father Waite.But at present
we are seeking constructive criticism, not solely destructive.There
has been quite enough of that sort in the world.But, to go a step
further, can we say positively that the truth is to be found even in
Christianity?""Please explain your question," said Miss Wall, with a puzzled look."The first essential is always facts," he continued."The deduction of
right conclusions will follow--provided, as Matthew Arnold so tersely
said, we have sufficient delicacy of perception, subtlety, wisdom, and
tact.And, I may add, sufficient freedom from prejudice and mental
bias--ah, there is the stumbling block!""Matthew Arnold," ventured Haynerd, "was dubbed a first-class infidel,
as I recall it."As have been many of the world's most earnest searchers.Yet he enunciated much truth, which we to-day are acknowledging.But,
to resume, since Christianity as we know it is based upon the
personality of a man, Jesus, we ask: Can the historicity of Jesus be
established?"queried Miss Wall in greater
surprise than before.And if so, is he correctly reported in what we call the Gospels?Then, did he reveal the truth to his followers?And, lastly, has that
truth been correctly transmitted to us?""And," added Hitt, "there is still the question: Assuming that he gave
us the truth, can we apply it successfully to the meeting of our daily
needs?""The point is well taken," replied Father Waite."For, though I may
know that there are very abstruse mathematical principles, yet I may
be utterly unable to demonstrate or use them.But now," he went on,
"we are brought to other vital questions concerning us.They are, I
think, points to which the theologian has given but scant thought.If
we conclude that there is a God, we are confronted with the material
universe and man.And what are their natures and
import?""Seems to me you've cut out a large
assignment for this little party.Those are questions that the world
has played football with for thousands of years.Do you think we can
settle them in a few evenings' study?We can't spare you," laughed Father Waite.Then he glanced at
Carmen, who had sat quiet, apparently unhearing, during the remarks."I think you will hear things soon that will set you thinking," he
said."But now we are going to let our traveled friend, Mr.Hitt,
give us just a word in summation of his thought regarding the
modern world and its attitude toward the questions which we have been
propounding."The explorer leaned back in his chair and assumed his customary
attitude when in deep thought.All eyes turned upon him in eager
expectation."The world," he began reflectively, "presents to me to-day the most
interesting aspect it has assumed since history began.True, the age
is one of great mental confusion.Quite as true, startling discoveries
and astounding inventions have so upset our staid old mediaeval views
that the world is hurriedly crowding them out, together with its God.Doctrines for which our fathers bled and burned are to-day lightly
tossed upon the ash heap.The searchlight is turned never so
mercilessly upon the founder of the Christian religion, and upon the
manuscripts which relate his words and deeds.Yet most of us have
grown so busy--I often wonder with what--that we have no time for that
which can not be grasped as we run.We work desperately by day,
building up the grandest material fabric the world has ever seen; and
at night we repair the machine for the next day's run.Even our
college professors bewail the lack of time for solid reading and
research.And if our young pursue studies, it is with the almost
exclusive thought of education as a means of earning a material
livelihood later, and, if possible, rearing a mansion and stocking its
larder and garage.It is, I repeat, a grandly materialistic age,
wherein, to the casual observer, spirituality is at a very low ebb."He thrust his long legs under the table and cast his eyes upward to
the ceiling as he resumed:

"The modern world is still in its spiritual infancy, and does not
often speak the name of God.Not that we are so much irreverent as
that we feel no special need of Him in our daily pursuits.Since we
ceased to tremble at the thunders of Sinai, and their lingering echoes
in bulls and heresy condemnations, we find that we get along just as
well--indeed, much better.And it really is quite bad form now to
speak continually of God, or to refer to Him as anything real and
vital.To be on such terms of intimacy with Him as this girl Carmen
is--in thought, at least--would be regarded to-day as evidence of
sentimentalism and weakness."He paused again, to marshal his thought and give his auditors an
opportunity for comment.Then, as the silence remained unbroken, he
continued:

"Viewing the world from one standpoint, it has achieved remarkable
success in applying the knout to superstition and limitation.But,
like a too energetic housekeeper, it has swept out much that is
essential with the _debris_.When spirituality ceases to be real or
vital to a people, then a grave danger threatens them.Materiality has
never proved a blessing, as history shows.Life that is made up of
strain and ceaseless worry is not life.The incessant accumulation of
material wealth, when we do not know how really to enjoy it, is folly.To pamper the flesh, to the complete ignoring of the spirit, is
suicide.The increased hankering after physical excitements and animal
pleasures, to the utter abandonment of the search for that which is
real and satisfying, is an exhibition of gross, mesmeric stupidity, to
say the least.It shows that our sense of life is awry.""But the world is surely attempting its own betterment," protested
Haynerd."I grant you that," replied Hitt."But legislation and coercion are
the wrong means to employ."Oh, well, you are not going to change the race until the individual
himself changes.""Quite the contrary, that is the
pith of my observations.And no sane
man will maintain that general reform can ever come until the
individual's needs are met--his daily, hourly, worldly needs.""I think I get your point," said Father Waite."It is wholly a
question of man's concept of the cause of things, himself included,
and their purpose and end, is it not?""The restless spirit of the modern world is
hourly voicing its discontent with a faltering faith which has no
other basis than blind belief.It wants demonstrable fact upon which
to build.In plain words, _mankind would be better if they but knew
how_!""Well, we show them how," asserted Haynerd."But they don't do as we
tell 'em.""Are you quite sure that you show them how?""What do you
ever do toward showing them how permanently to eradicate a single
human difficulty?""Oh, well, putting it that way, nothing, of course."And so
the world continues to wait for surcease from woe in a life beyond the
grave.But now, returning to our survey, let me say that amid all the
folly of vain pursuits, of wars and strife, of doleful living and
pitiable dying, there are more encouraging and hopeful signs hung out
to the inquiring thought to-day than ever before in history.Daniel went to the kitchen.If I
misread not, we are already entered upon changes so tremendous that
their end must be the revolutionizing of thought and conduct, and
hence of life.Our present age is one of great extremes: though we
touch the depths, we are aiming likewise at the heights.I doubt if
there ever was a time when so many sensed the nothingness of the
pleasures of the flesh.I doubt if ever there was such a quickening of
the business conscience, and such a determined desire to introduce
honesty and purity into our dealings with one another.Never was the
need of religion more keenly felt by the world than it is to-day; and
that is why mankind are willing to accept any religious belief,
however eccentric, that comes in the guise of truth and bearing the
promise of surcease from sin, sickness, and sorrow here this side of
the grave.The world was never so hungry for religious truth; and this
fact is a perpetual challenge to the Church.There is a tremendous
world-yearning to know and to do better.I
answer, a growing appreciation of the idea that 'the kingdom of
harmony is within you.'""Jesus said that," murmured Carmen, looking up."He but amplified and gave form to the great fact that there was
an influence for better things always existent in the ancient Jews,
that'something not ourselves,' if you will, 'that makes for
righteousness.'And he showed that that influence could be outwardly
externalized in freedom from the ills which beset humanity.""Very good," put in Haynerd."That'something not ourselves' is the germ of the true idea of God,"
answered Hitt."The terms are synonymous," said Hitt."And now let me conclude with a
final observation.Mankind's beliefs are in a whirl.Orthodoxy and conservatism are hanging desperately to the
world's flying skirts, but they will eventually drop off.No change in
thought has been greater than that concerning God.The absentee Lord
who started the universe and then withdrew has gone to the scrap heap,
with the ridiculous views of predestination and infant damnation.The
idea of a God who at divers times interfered with His creation and
temporarily set aside His own laws to convince puny man of His
greatness, is likewise obsolescent.The world is slowly growing into a
conception of a creator, of some kind, but at least mental, and
universally present.Nay, more, available for all our problems and
needs.And the end will be the adoption of that conception, enlarged
and purified still further, and taken into the minutest affairs of our
daily life--as this girl has done.The day of patient suffering in
this world, under the spell of a promise of compensating reward in the
heavenly future, has all but passed.We are gradually becoming
conscious of the stupendous fact that the kingdom of all harmony,
immortality, and good, is _right here within us_--and therefore can be
naught but a consciousness of absolute good, perfectly attainable by
humanity as the 'old man' of Paul is laid off, but not gained,
necessarily, through what we call death."The silence which followed was broken at length by Miss Wall."And
what constitutes the 'old man'?""Largely, I think," said Hitt, "the belief that matter is real."exclaimed Haynerd, almost rising from his chair."I stand on my statement," he replied.Father Waite rose slowly, as if lost in thought."History shows," he
said, meditatively, "that man's progress has been proportionate to his
freedom from the limitation of ignorance and undemonstrable belief.And that freedom has come as man's concept of God has grown less and
less material, and more and more spiritual.From the animal nature of
the savage, to whom all is matter, down--or up--to the man of to-day,
to whom mind is assuming ever greater ascendency, man's progress has
been marked by a throwing off of limiting beliefs, theological or
other, in material power and substance.The development of the least
material forces, steam, electricity, the X-ray, has come only as the
human mind has thrown off a portion of its hampering material beliefs.I am astounded when I think of it, and of its marvelous message to
future generations!For, from the premise that the creator of all
things is spirit, or mind, as you will, comes the corollary that the
creation itself must of necessity be _mental_.And from this come such
deductions as fairly make me tremble.Carmen has told me of the
deductions which her tutor, the priest Jose, drew from the single
premise that the universe is infinite in extent--a premise which I
think we all will accept.""There can be no question about it," said Hitt, nodding his head."Well," continued Father Waite, "that granted, we must likewise grant
its creator to be infinite, must we not?""And that puts the creator out of the matter-class entirely.The
creator must be--"

"Mind," said Carmen, supplying the thought ever-present with her."I see no other conclusion," said Father Waite."But, that granted, a
flood of deductions pours in that sends human beliefs and reasoning
helter-skelter.For an infinite mind would eventually disintegrate if
it were not perfect in every part.""Perhaps it is already disintegrating, and that's what causes the evil
in the world," hazarded Haynerd."Utterly untenable, my friend," put in Hitt."For, granted an infinite
mind, we must grant the concomitant fact that such a mind is of very
necessity omnipotent, as well as perfect.What, then, could ever cause
disintegration in it?""You are right," resumed Father Waite."And such a mind, of very
necessity perfect, omnipotent, and, of course, ever-present, must
likewise be eternal.For there would be nothing to contest its
existence.Age, decay, and death would be unknown to it."And that," said Carmen, rising, "is my God."Father Waite nodded significantly to the others, and sat down, leaving
the girl facing them, her luminous eyes looking off into unfathomed
distances, and her face aglow with spiritual light."My God is infinite Good, to whom evil is unknown," she said."And
good includes all that is real.It includes wisdom, intelligence,
truth, life, and love--none of them material.Oh, not
by human reasoning, whereby you seek to establish the fact of His
existence, but by proof, daily proof, and in the hours when the floods
of suppositional evil have swept over me.You would rest your faith on
your deductions.But, as Saint Gregory said, no merit lies in faith
where human reason supplies the proof; and that you will all some day
know.And He ceaselessly expresses Himself in and
through His ideas, which He is constantly revealing.And these ideas express that goodness and
infinitude, from the tiniest up to the idea of God himself.And that
grandest idea is--man.Oh, no, not the men and women you think you see
about you in your daily walk.But the man that Jesus always saw back of every human concept.That
man is God's own idea of Himself.That is the man we shall all put on when we have
obeyed Paul and put off the old man, its counterfeit.""Then, Carmen," said Father Waite, "you believe all things to be
mental?""Yes, everything--man himself--and matter.""But, if God is mind, and infinite, He must include all things.Hence
He must include this imperfect representation, called the physical
man."Did not Jesus speak often of
the one lie about his Father, God?The material man and the material
universe are but parts of that lie.And a lie is always a supposition;
not real.All evil is contained in that supposition--a supposition
that there is power and life and substance apart from God.""A supposition is not made," replied Carmen quietly."I don't quite get that," interposed Miss Wall, her brows knitting.Carmen smiled down at the inquiring woman."The
creator of all things is mind.But you would have that
mind the creator of evil, also.Yet, your own reasoning has shown
that, on the premise of mind as infinite, such mind must be forever
whole, harmonious, perfect.The thoughts and ideas by which that mind
expresses itself must be likewise pure and perfect.Then that creative
mind can not create evil.For, a mind that creates evil must itself be
evil.And, being infinite, such a mind must include the evil it
creates.We would have, then, either a mind wholly evil, or one of
mixed evil and good.In either case, that mind must then destroy
itself."Your reasoning is, certainly," admitted Miss Wall."But, how to
account for evil, when God is infinite good--"

"To account for it at all," replied Carmen, "would be to make it
something real.Jesus would account for it only by classing it as a
lie about God.Now God, as the creative mind, must likewise be truth,
since He is perfection and harmony.Very well, a lie is always the
opposite of truth."Yes," said Father Waite, nodding his head as certain bright memories
returned to him."That is what you told me that day when I first
talked with you."Is it strange that God should have a suppositional opposite?""Has not everything with which you are concerned a
suppositional opposite?His suppositional opposite is
the great lie of evil.And matter is just as
mental as the thoughts which you are now holding.And so, evil and the lie are unreal.""The distinction seems to me theoretical," protested Miss Wall."That word'real,'" he said, "is perhaps
what is causing your confusion.The real is that which, according to
Spencer, does not pass away.We used to believe matter indestructible,
forever permanent.We learn that our views regarding it were very
incorrect."And yet," said Father Waite, "in this universe of constant change,
_something_ endures.What is it but the mind that is God, expressing
itself in such immaterial and permanent things as law, love, life,
power?""But now we have been brought back again to
the question of matter.If we can prove that matter is mental, and not
real substance, we will have established Carmen's premise that
everything is mental.Then there remains but the distinction between
the mind that is God, and its suppositional opposite, as expressed in
human existence.Let us conclude, therefore, that to-night we have
established, at least as a working hypothesis, that, since a thing
existing implies a creator; and since the existent universe, being
infinite, demands an infinite creator; and since a creator can not be
infinite without being at once mind, perfect, eternal, omnipotent,
omniactive, and good, we are fully justified in assuming that the
creator of all things still exists, and is infinite, ever-present
mind.Further than that we are not prepared to go, until we have
discussed the questions of matter and the physical universe and man.Let us leave those topics for a subsequent meeting.And now I suggest
that we unite in asking Carmen to sing for us, to crown the unity that
has marked this discussion with the harmony of her own beautiful
voice."A few moments later, about the small upright piano which the Beaubien
had rented for Carmen, the little group sat in reverent silence, while
the young girl sent out through the little room the harmonious
expression of her own inner life, the life that had never left heaven
for earth.CHAPTER 3


With her exit from the _beau monde_ and her entrance upon the broad
stage of University life, Carmen seemed to have awakened from the
lethargy which her abrupt transition from mediaeval Simiti into the
modern world had occasioned.The static struggle to hold her own
against the rushing currents of materialism had turned at length in
her favor.The lethal influences which
rose about her like stupifying fumes in the courts of fashion had been
lifted and swept away by the fresher and more invigorating breezes
into which her bark had now been drawn.She plunged into her new work joyously; yet not without a deeper
comprehension of its meaning than that of her fellow-students.She
knew that the University was but another stepping-stone, even as her
social life had been; another series of calls and opportunities to
"prove" her God to be immanent good.For she was keenly alive to the materialistic leadings of
the "higher education," and she would stand as a living protest
against them.It had not taken her long to discover the impotence lying at the heart
of so-called modern education.She had not been slow to mark the
disappointment written upon the faces of many of her fellow-students,
who had sought in vain a great awakening light in those sacred
precincts of learning, but, their confidence betrayed, were now
floundering in the devouring morass of materialism.To her keen
insight the University stood revealed as the great panderer to this
latest century's obsessing idea that the true function of education is
expressed in the imparting of changing, human information and a
training for the business of earning one's daily bread according to
the infamous code of the world's carnal social system.The University
did not meet the most urgent need of the race by equipping men to
stand against the great crises of human experience.It did not teach
men to lay aside the counterfeit man of material sense; but rather
emphasized the world's belief in the reality of this man by minutely
detailed courses in his mundane history and the manifestations of his
pitiable ignorance in his wanton crimes and watery ambitions.To
Carmen, God was the most insistent fact of creation.And mankind's
existence could find its only justification in ceaseless, consecrated
manifestation of His harmonious activity.True, the University vaguely
recognized God as infinitely competent.But in the same breath it
confessed its utter ignorance of a demonstrable knowledge of Him, to
know whom alone is life.But their hollow prayers bore no hope, for they knew not how to gain
answers to them.And yet the girl remained in her new environment, awaiting the call to
"come up higher."And meantime she strove to gain daily a wider
knowledge of the Christ-principle, and its application to the needs
and problems of her fellow-men.Her business was the reflection of her
Father's business.The weak, transient,
flighty, so-called intellectual life which she saw about her sent no
call across the calm currents of her thought.Her education was
religious in the strictest, deepest sense, for she was learning to
know God.Though the girl pursued her way quietly, unwilling that the notoriety
which had been fastened upon her should mark her as an object of
curiosity, yet her story soon spread among University circles, and the
first semester was a scant two weeks old before her name had been
debated in the numerous Sororities and Women's Clubs, and quietly
dropped.<DW64> blood coursed in her veins; and the stigma of parental
disgrace lay dark upon her.She lived with a woman of blackened
reputation--a reputation which waxed no brighter under the casual,
malicious comments of J. Wilton Ames, whose great financial strength
had made him a Trustee of this institution of learning.If Carmen
divined the comment that was passed concerning herself, she gave no
indication.But Hitt and Father Waite knew that the girl had not found
favor in the social and fraternal organizations of her mates; and they
knew why.mused Hitt, when he could no longer
restrain himself.Then he called a student to his desk one day, at the
conclusion of his lecture."Miss West," he said, "you are leader in the most prominent Sorority
in the University.I want you to give Miss Carmen Ariza a bid."the girl asked, as she arched her brows.But--well, what if she were a negress?Hers is the
most brilliant mind in the entire student-body!"Race segregation is a divine tenet, scripturally justified.What though the girl's skin vied with the lilies and rosebuds?What
though her hair was the brown of ripe fields?Had not God Almighty
decreed that the <DW64> should remain a drawer of water?Had the Lord designed him the equal of the noble white, He would
have bleached his face, and bridged his flat nose.And the reference to her dark-skinned sisters caused a
little _moue_ of disgust, as she flatly declined to consider Carmen an
eligible candidate for membership in her Society.ejaculated Hitt, who had been brooding over the incident
as he walked home with Father Waite."That toadying, sycophantic,
wealth-worshiping Miss West can see no farther than the epidermis!If
we could have maintained Carmen's reputation as an Inca princess, this
same girl would have fawned at her feet, and begged to kiss the edge
of her robe!And she would have used every art of cajolery to
ingratiate herself into Carmen's favor, to catch the social crumbs
that our girl might chance to drop!""There, there, Hitt," soothed Father Waite."Have you any idea that
Carmen is at all injured by Miss West's supercilious conduct?"You're forgetting the girl's influence, aren't
you?"Hitt gulped his wrath down his long throat."Waite," he blurted, "that
girl's an angel!"She's so real that we don't
understand her--so real that she has been totally misunderstood by the
petty minds that have sought to crush her here in New York, that's
all.""But certainly she is unique--"

"Ah, yes; unique in that she goes about putting her arms around people
and telling them that she loves them.And she is unique in that her purity and goodness hang about her like
an exquisite aura, and make people instinctively turn and look after
her as she passes.Unique in that in her sweet presence one seems to
hear a strain of heavenly music vibrating on the air.So unique that
the dawn, the nesting birds, the wild flowers, the daily sunset,
fairly intoxicate her with ecstasy and make her life a lyric."Hitt essayed to reply; but the words hung in his throat."Yes," continued Father Waite, "she is so unique that when the
empty-headed, vain young Duke of Altern, learning that she had been
thrown out of society because of the base rumor regarding her
parentage, sent her a written statement to the effect that there was
no engagement between them, and demanded that she sign it, she did
so, with a happy smile, with an invocation, with a prayer for blessing
upon those who had tried to ruin her."Hawley-Crowles and Ames and Lafelle
filched La Libertad from her, she would have given them the clothes on
her back with it, if they had demanded them.Yes, she's unique--so
unique that again and again I hear her murmur, as she looks off
absently into space: 'If it is right that he should have a son, then I
want it to be so.'""Referring to--that priest--Jose de Rincon?"And time and again I have heard her say: 'God is
light.Old
Rosendo's grandson, you know.""Waite," he said earnestly, "she is simply illustrating
what would happen to any of us if we threw ourselves wholly upon
God's protecting care, and took our thoughts only from Him.That's
why she can lose her home, her family, her reputation, that
mine--everything--and still stand._She does what we don't dare to
do!_"

"She is a living illustration," replied Father Waite, "of the mighty
fact that there is nothing so practical as _real_ Christianity.I want
you to tell Professor Cane that.He calls her 'the girl with the
Utopian views,' because of her ingenuous replies in his sociological
class.But I want you to show him that she is very far from being
impractical.""I'll do it," said Hitt emphatically."I'll prove to Cane that her
religion is not a visionary scheme for regulating a world inhabited
only by perfect beings, but is a working principle for the every-day
sinner to use in the solution of his daily problems.Moreover, Waite,
she is a vivid illustration of the fact that when the individual
improves, the nation does likewise."I not only get you, but I stand as a proof of your statement,"
returned Father Waite gently.Carmen, her thoughts above, though her feet trod the earth, came and
went, glad and happy.The change in her mode of living from the
supreme luxury of the Hawley-Crowles mansion to the common comforts of
the home where now she dwelt so simply with the Beaubien, seemed not
to have caused even a ripple in the full current of her joy.Her life
was a symphony of thanksgiving; an antiphony, in which all Nature
voiced its responses to her in a diapason, full, rich, and harmonious.Often that autumn she might have been seen standing among the tinted
leaves on the college campus, and drinking in their silent message.And then she might have been heard to exclaim, as she turned her rapt
gaze beyond the venerable, vine-clad buildings: "Oh, I feel as if I
just couldn't stand it, all this wealth of beauty, of love, of
boundless good!"For her dark
story had reared a hedge about her; the taboo rested upon her; and
even in the crowded classrooms the schoolmates of her own sex looked
askance and drew their skirts about them.But if the students avoided her, the faculty did not.And those like
Professor Cane, who had the opportunity and the ability to peer into
the depths of the girl's soul, took an immediate and increasing
interest in her.Often her own naive manners broke down the bars of
convention, and brought her enduring friendships among the men of
learning.This was especially the case with Doctor Morton, Dean of the
School of Surgery.Yielding to a harmless impulse of curiosity, the
girl one afternoon had set out on a trip of exploration, and had
chosen the Anatomy building to begin with.Many odd sights greeted her
eager gaze as she peered into classrooms and exhibit cases; but she
met with no one until she chanced to open the door of Doctor Morton's
private laboratory, and found that eminent man bending over a human
brain, which he was dissecting.The doctor looked up, surprise
written large upon his features as he noted his fair caller.queried the girl, twisting around and
looking at the name on the door to make certain."Yes," replied the genial doctor, with growing interest.He was a
gray-haired, elderly man, slightly inclined to embonpoint, and with
keen, twinkling eyes."Yes, indeed," returned the girl; "I'd love to."Most everybody seems to have heard of me," sighed the girl."Well, it
doesn't make any difference about my coming in here, does it?"She
looked up at him so wistfully that he felt a great tug at his
heartstrings."You're as welcome as the April
sun.""Now tell me," she said eagerly,
looking about."That," said he, taking up the pulpy gray object, "is the brain of my
erstwhile friend and collaborator, Doctor Bolton.murmured Carmen, a facetious twinkle coming into
her eyes as she looked at it."In the interests of science," returned the man, studying her."That
we may increase our knowledge of this marvelous mechanism of thought,
and the laws by which it operates in mental processes.""Then you still blindly seek the living among the dead, don't you?""You think that this poor thing held life, and you
search now among its ashes for the living principle.But, God is life;
and 'Canst thou by searching find out God?'"The man regarded her intently without replying.She bent for a while
over the half-dissected brain in deep thought."Doctor," she said, "life is not structural.God is life; and to know
Him is to reflect life.Doctor, don't
you think it is about time to do away with this business of dying?"The man of science started visibly, and his eyes opened wider.The
abrupt question quite swept him off his feet."You didn't really expect to find anything in this brain, did you?""Why, mostly water, with a few commonplace salts," he answered,
wondering what the next question would be."And can a compound of water and a few commonplace salts _think_?"she
asked, looking intently at him."N--no," he answered tentatively."The brain is not the cause of thought, then, but an effect, is it
not?""Why, really, my dear Miss Carmen, we don't know.We call it the organ
of thought, because in some way thought seems to be associated with
it, rather than with--well, with the liver, or muscles, for example.And we learn that certain classes of mental disturbances are
intimately associated with lesions or clots in the brain.Then:

"Doctor, you wouldn't cut up a machine to discover the motive power,
would you?But that is just what you are doing there with that brain.You are hoping by dissecting it to find the power that made it go,
aren't you?And the power that made it go was mind--life.""But the life is not in the brain now," hazarded the doctor."You see," she went on, "if
the brain was ever alive, it could never cease to be so.If it ever
lived, it could never die.It
manifested only a false sense of life.Who
or what says that the man who owned that brain is dead?Why, the human
mind--human belief.It is the human mind, expressing its belief in
death, and in a real opposite to life, or God.She returned his look
with a confident smile."You believe in evolution, don't you?""Oh, surely," he replied unhesitatingly."Well, then, in the process of evolution, which was evolved first, the
brain, or the mind which operates it and through it?""Why," he replied meditatively, "it is quite likely that they evolved
simultaneously, the brain being the mind's organ of expression.""But don't you see, Doctor, that you are now making the mind really
come first?For that which expresses a thing is always secondary to
the thing expressed.""At any rate, it is quite immaterial to a
practical knowledge of how to meet the brain's ills.I am a practical
man, you know.""I'm sorry to hear that," she said simply."Practical men are so
stupid and ignorant."he exclaimed, putting his hands on his hips and
staring down at the smiling face."And you are so nice and friendly, I wouldn't want to think you stupid
and ignorant," she went on blandly.Well, that kind o' takes the edge off your former classification
of me," he said, greatly amused, yet wondering just what appraisal to
place upon this frank girl."And evolution," she continued, "is an unfolding, isn't it?You see,
the great fact of creation is the creator, infinite mind.Well, that
mind expresses itself in its ideas.And these it is unfolding all the
time.Now a fact always gives rise to a suppositional opposite.The
opposite of a fact is an error.And that is why error has been called
'negative truth.'Of course, there isn't any such thing as negative
truth!And so all error is simply falsity, supposition, without real
existence."Now, the human, or
carnal, mind is the negative truth of the real mind, God.It is
infinite mind's suppositional opposite.And it imitates the
infinite mind, but in a very stupid, blundering way.And so the whole
physical universe manifests evolution, too--an unfolding, or
revealing, of material types, or mental concepts.And all these
manifest the human mind's sense of life, and its equally strong
sense of death.The universe, animals, men, are all human types,
evolved, or unfolded, or revealed, in the human mind.And all are
the human mind's interpretations of infinite mind's real and eternal
and perfect ideas."You know," she laughed, "speaking of 'negative truth', the first
chapter of Genesis sets forth positive truth, and the second chapter
sets forth its opposite, negative truth.But
there it is for everybody to read.And the human mind, of course, true
to its beliefs, clings to the second chapter as the reality.Meantime, Carmen's attention had been attracted to a large microscope
that stood on the table near her.Going to it, she peeped curiously
down into the tube.Well," she suddenly asked, "have
you got the fear germ here?"But when the girl looked up, her face was quite
serious."You do not know it, Doctor, for you are a practical man, but you
haven't anything but fear germs under this glass," she said in a low
voice."Why, those are germs of typhoid and tuberculosis!""And manifestations, externalizations, of the fear germ itself, which
is mental," she added."These things don't cause disease," she went
on, pointing to the slide.Do you scientists know why people die, Doctor?""We really do not know why people die.""Then I'll tell you," she said."_It's because they don't know enough
to live._ This poor Doctor Bolton died because he didn't know that God
was life.He committed sickness, and then paid the penalty, death.He
sinned by believing that there were other powers than God, by
believing that life and thought were in matter.And so he paid the
wages of sin, death.He simply missed the mark, that's all.""You haven't asked me
to sit down," she commented brightly."But, if you don't mind, I
will."the doctor exclaimed, coloring, and hastily
setting out a chair."I really was so interested in what you were
saying that I forgot my manners.""No," she said, shaking her head as she declined the proffered chair,
"I'll sit here, so's I can look straight into your eyes.You go ahead
and cut up poor Yorick, and I'll talk.""You are much more interesting," he
returned, "than poor Bolton, dead or alive.In fact, he really was
quite a bore.But you are like a sparkling mountain rill, even if you
do give me a severe classification.""Well," she replied, "then you are honestly more interested in life
than in death, are you?"Death is _such_ a mistake; and I haven't a bit of use
for it," she continued."It's like making mistakes in music, or
mathematics.Now when we make mistakes in those, we never stop to
discuss them.The world has nearly
talked its poor old head off about the mistakes of sickness and death.It never seems to occur to the world that Jesus always associated
sickness with sin.You know, the Rabbis of his day seem to have hit
upon a great truth, although they didn't make it really practical.They maintained that a sick man could not be healed of his diseases
until all his sins had been forgiven.And so they attempted to forgive
sins and make men clean by their elaborate ceremonies.And nobody got to the root of the difficulty until
Jesus came.And that cured
the disease that was the manifestation of sin.Now I ask, why do you,
nearly two thousand years after his time, still do as the old Rabbis
did, and continue to treat the body--the effect--instead of the mental
cause?But," looking down in meditation, "I suppose if you did that
the people would cry, 'He hath a devil!'They thought I was a witch in
Simiti.""Then you do not believe that disease is
caused by microbes, I take it?"It is a
manifestation of the human mind again.And, as with typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and other diseases, the human mind applies its own
cherished, ignorant beliefs in certain methods, and then renders
innocuous its own manifestations, microbes.The human mind makes its
own diseases, and then in some cases removes the disease, but still by
human, material methods.At last it
yields itself to its false beliefs, and then goes out in what it calls
death.It is all a mental process--all human thought and its various
manifestations.Now why not get beyond microbes and reach the cause,
even of them, the human mind itself?Why do not you men of science do likewise?"Doctor Morton himself took the chair which he had set out for the
girl."What you say," he replied slowly, "is not new to me.But I can
only answer that the world is not ready yet for the great change which
you suggest."What mesmerism you are laboring
under!"Well, then, would he be accepted to-day, if he had not come before?""And I quite agree with you," she said firmly."Now the world has
doctored for more than four thousand years, despite the fact that
health is not sold in bottle or pill form.Doctor, what does the
history of all these centuries of drugging show you?"Carmen waited a moment; then continued:

"Don't they demonstrate the absolute inability of medicines to cure
disease?""Any more than putting men in prison cures
crime?""They at least prove that medication has not _permanently_ removed
disease," he ventured, not wishing to go too far."Doctor," she said earnestly, "that man Jesus, who, according to you,
came too soon, said: 'Without me ye can do nothing.'Well, didn't he
come very, very close to the truth when he made that statement?He did
not say that without drugs or material remedies we could do nothing,
but that without the Christ-principle mankind would continue, as
before, to miss the mark.He showed that disease and discord result
from sin.Sin is lack of righteousness, lack of right-thinking about
things.Its effect,
disease, is mental--a state of discordant consciousness.Can you with
drugs change a state of mind?""Whiskey and opium cause changes in
one's state of mind.""But the human belief of power inherent in whiskey
and opium, or of the human body's reaction to them, causes a change in
the human thought-activity that is called consciousness.The state of
human consciousness changes with the belief, but not the real state of
mind.And Doctor Bolton--"

"Bolton was not sick.He died of natural causes, old age, and general
breakdown," was the doctor's refuge.Carmen laughed and sprang down from the table."What an obstinately
obdurate lot you scientific men are!""Don't you know
that you doctors are only a development of the old'medicine-man'?Bolton isn't dead; and, in the second, there
are no _natural_ causes of death.Why, that's gone out of
fashion, long since.""Then," with a note of banter in his voice, "I take it that you do not
expect to die.""I expect good, nothing but
good, ever!Don't you know that physiologists themselves admit that
the human body is composed of eighty-five per cent water and fifteen
per cent ordinary salts?Can such a combination have intelligence and
sensation?Do you still believe that life is dependent upon lungs,
stomach, or liver?Why, the so-called 'unit cell' breathes, digests,
and manifests life-functions, and yet it has no lungs, no mouth, no
stomach, no organs.It is the human mind, assuming knowledge and power
which it does _not_ possess, that says the sense of life shall depend
upon such organs in the one case and not in the other.And the human
mind could be utterly refuted if men would only learn to use the
Christ-principle.Jesus and Paul used it, and proved material laws to
be only false beliefs.""Well," he replied meditatively, "if you are correct, then the
preachers are way off the track.And I have long since come to the
conclusion that--Well," changing abruptly back to the previous topic,
"so you refute the microbe theory, eh?""I said I did and did not," she laughed."Listen: fear, worry, hatred,
malice, murder, all of which are mental things in themselves, manifest
to the human mind as microbes.These are the hurtful microbes, and
they produce toxins, which poison the system.It is
the Christ-principle.Now you can learn that principle, and how to
apply it.But if you don't care to, why, then you must go on with your
material microbes and poisons, and with your diseases and death, until
you are ready to leave them and turn to that which is real.For all
human-mind activity and manifestation, whether in microbes, death, or
life, is mental, and is but the counterfeit of the real activity of
divine mind, God."Do you know," she pursued earnestly, "I heard a lecture the other day
in which it was said that life is a sort of fermentation in the body.Well, as regards human life, I guess that is so.For the human body is
only a manifestation of the human mind; and the human mind surely is
in a continuous state of ferment!""The lecturer," she continued, "said that the
range of life was from ultra-microbe to man, and that Shakespeare
began as a single cell.The mundane concept of
Shakespeare's body may have unfolded from a cell-concept; but
Shakespeare was a manifestation of mind!And that mind was an
interpretation, though very imperfect, of the mind that is God.Why
can't you materialists raise your eyes above the dust?Why, you would
choke the very avenues of the spirit with mud!"Well, your education seems to be--"

"Yes," she interrupted, "my education is beyond the vagaries that are
so generally taught in the name of knowledge.It does nothing for mankind, except to give them a false
culture.Were the so-called great men of the past really educated?Here is an extract which I copied this afternoon from Hawthorne."She
opened her note book and read:

  "'Ah, but there is a half-acknowledged melancholy like to this
  when we stand in the perfected vigor of our life and feel that
  Time has now given us all his flowers, and that the next work of
  his never-idle fingers must be to steal them one by one away.'"Now," she asked, "was that man really educated?But that theology _could not solve his least earthly problem, nor
meet his slightest need_!Oh, what inexpressibly sad lives so many of
your greatest men have lived!John journeyed to the bathroom.Your Hawthorne, your Longfellow, they
yearned for the rest which they were taught was to follow death.If they
believed in the Christ--and they thought they did--why, then, did they
not rise up and do as he bade them do, put death out?He taught no
such resignation to human beliefs as they practiced!He showed men how
to overcome the world.He looked at her intently for some moments.She seemed, as she stood
there before him, like a thing of gossamer and sunshine that had
drifted into his laboratory, despite the closed door."Say," he suddenly exclaimed, as a new thought struck him, "I'd like
to have you talk with my friend, Reverend Patterson Moore!Pat and I
have barked at each other for many years now, and I'm getting tired.I'd like to shift him to a younger and more vigorous opponent.I
believe you've been providentially sent to relieve me.""You can tell Professor Hitt, and--"

"Hitt, eh?He is very much interested
in these things that you and I have been talking about to-day.We have
regular meetings, with Father Waite, and Mr.Haynerd, and--"

"Well, no wonder you can argue!But--suppose I have Hitt bring me to one of your meetings, eh?"The genial doctor laughed long and incontinently."I imagine Reverend
Pat wouldn't thank you for referring to him that way," he said."He is
a very high Anglican, and his dignity is marvelous--to say nothing of
his self-esteem.Well, we'll see, we'll see."I didn't really mean to come in here, you
know.But I guess I was led, don't you?"And when the door had closed upon her, the doctor sat silently beside
the pulseless brain of his deceased comrade and pondered long.*       *       *       *       *

When Carmen entered the house, late that afternoon, she found the
Beaubien in conversation with Professor Williams, of the University
School of Music.That gentleman had learned through Hitt of the girl's
unusual voice, and had dropped in on his way home to ask that he might
hear and test it.With only a smile for reply, Carmen tossed her books
and hat upon the sofa and went directly to the piano, where she
launched into the weird Indian lament which had produced such an
astounding effect upon her chance visitors at the Elwin school that
day long gone, and which had been running in her thought and seeking
expression ever since her conversation with Doctor Morton a short
while before.For a full half hour she sang, lost in the harmony that poured from
her soul.Father Waite entered, and quietly took a seat.Song after song, most of them the characteristic soft
melodies of her people, and many her own simple improvisations, issued
from the absorbed girl's lips.The Beaubien rose and stole softly from
the room.Father Waite sat with his head resting on his hand, striving
to interpret the message which welled from the depths of his own
being, where hidden, unused chords were vibrating in unison with those
of this young girl.Then, abruptly, the singing stopped, and Carmen turned and faced her
auditors."There," she said, with a happy sigh, "that just _had_ to
come out!""Who, may I ask, was your
teacher?"he said, in a voice husky with emotion.A look of astonishment came into the man's face.He turned to Father
Waite inquiringly.The latter nodded his confirmation of the girl's
words."I wonder if you realize what you
have got, Miss Carmen?""It's a beautiful gift, isn't it?""But--I had thought of asking you to let me train you--but--I--I dare
not undertake to handle such a voice as yours.May I--may I send
Maitre Rossanni to you, the great Italian?"Oh, yes," returned the girl; "I'll sing for anybody.The gift isn't
mine, you know.When the professor had taken his reluctant departure, the Beaubien
returned and handed Carmen a letter.With a cry of joy the girl seized
it and tore it open.It was from Colombia, the second one that her
beloved Rosendo had succeeded in getting down the river to the distant
coast.It had been written three months prior, and it bore many stains
and evidences of the vicissitudes through which it had emerged.Yes,
Rosendo and his family were well, though still at Maria Rosa, far up
the Boque, with Don Nicolas.The war raged below them, but they were
safe."And not a word from Padre Jose, or about him," murmured the girl,
sinking into a chair and clasping the soiled letter to her breast.Father Waite thought of the little newsboy of Cartagena, and his
possible share in the cause of Jose's silence.CHAPTER 4


Carmen's first serious test of her knowledge of English composition
was made early in the semester, in an essay on town life in Colombia;
and so meritorious did her instructor consider it that he advised her
to send it to a prominent literary magazine.The result was that the
essay was accepted, and a request made for further contributions.The girl bubbled with new-found happiness.Then she wrote another, and
still another article on the life and customs of her people.Both
were given publication; and with the money which she received for them
she bought a silk dress for Jude, much to that adoring woman's
surprise and vehement protest.Carmen might have saved the money
toward a piano--but, no; that would have been thinking of herself, and
was inadmissible.Nor did the Beaubien offer any objection."Indeed,"
commented that fond shepherd of this lone lamb, "she would have poured
the money out into somebody's open hand anyway, and it might as well
be Jude's."Then she choked back the tears as she added: "The girl comes home
every night with an empty purse, no matter how full it may have been
in the morning.Carmen's slight success in the field of letters still further aroused
Haynerd's interest.The peacefully somnolent Social Era, he thought,
might awaken to new things under the stimulus of such fresh writing as
hers.Perhaps life did hold something of real value after all.Would
she furnish him with a column or two on the peculiar social aspect of
the metropolis?And the result was that the staid conservative
sheet was given a smart shaking; and several prominent society people
sat up and blinked.It but threw a clear light from a somewhat unusual
angle upon certain phases of New York's social life, and uncovered a
few of the more subtly hidden springs of its peculiar activity.Among those who read her essay in the Social Era was J. Wilton Ames.He first lay back in his chair and laughed uproariously.And then,
when his agents discovered for him the identity of the author, he
glowered.The Beaubien was still standing between him and this budding
genius.And though he might, and would, ultimately ruin the Beaubien
financially, yet this girl, despite her social ostracism, bade fair to
earn with her facile pen enough to maintain them both in luxury.So he
bent anew to his vengeful schemes, for he would make them come to him.As Trustee, he would learn what courses the girl was pursuing in the
University--for he had long known that she was in attendance there.Then he would learn who her associates were; what suggestions and
advice her instructors gave her; and her plans for the future.And he
would trace her sources of income and apply pressure at the most vital
point.He had never in his life been successfully balked.Then Haynerd came to congratulate Carmen again, and to request that
she attend with him the formal opening of the new Ames mansion, the
great Fifth Avenue palace, for he wanted her vivid, first-hand
impressions for his account of the brilliant affair in the Social Era.As reporters, he explained, they would of necessity remain in
seclusion, and the girl might disguise to such an extent as to prevent
recognition, if she chose.It was business for him, and an opportunity
for rich experience for her.And the fearless girl went, because it
would help Haynerd, though the Beaubien inwardly trembled.Invitations to the number of three hundred had been issued to the
_elite_ of New York, announcing the formal opening of the newly
finished, magnificent Ames dwelling.These invitations were wrought in
enamel on cards of pure gold.A month prior to the opening, the
newspapers had printed carefully-worded announcements of the return of
Mrs.J. Wilton Ames and her daughter, after a protracted stay at
various foreign baths and rest-cures in the hope of restoring the
former's impaired health.Ames now felt that she could no
longer deprive society of her needed activities, and so had returned
to conduct it through what promised to be a season of unusual
brilliancy.The papers did not, however, state that J. Wilton had
himself recalled her, after quietly destroying his bill of divorce,
because he recognized the necessity of maintaining the social side of
his complicated existence on a par with his vast business affairs.As Carmen and Haynerd approached the huge, white marble structure,
cupolaed, gabled, buttressed, and pinnacled, an overwhelming sense of
what it stood for suddenly came upon the girl, and she saw revealed in
a flash that side of its owner's life which for so many months she had
been pondering.The great shadows that seemed to issue from the
massive exterior of the building swept out and engulfed her; and she
turned and clasped Haynerd's arm with the feeling that she would
suffocate were she to remain longer in them."Perk up, little one," said Haynerd, taking her hand."We'll go round
to the rear entrance, and I will present my business card there.Ames's secretary telephoned me instructions, and I said I was going to
bring a lady reporter with me."Carmen caught her breath as she passed through the tall, exquisitely
wrought iron gateway and along the marble walk which led to the rear.Up the winding steps to the front entrance, where swung the marvelous
bronze doors which had stirred the imaginations of two continents,
streamed the favored of the fashionable world.Among them Carmen saw
many whom she recognized.The buffoon, Larry Beers, was there,
swinging jauntily along with the bejeweled wife of Samson, the
multimillionaire packer.Kane and his wife, and Weston followed.Outside the gates there was incessant chugging of automobiles, mingled
with the shouted orders of the three policemen detailed to direct the
traffic.A pinched, ragged urchin and his tattered little sister crept
up and peered wildly through the iron pickets of the fence; but a
sharp rap from a policeman's club sent them scattering.Carmen stood
for a moment in the shadows and watched the swarm mount the marble
steps and enter through those wonderful doors.There were congressmen
and senators, magnates and jurists, distillers and preachers.Each one
owed his tithe of allegiance to Ames.Some were chained to him hard
and fast, nor would break their bonds this side of the grave.There were those who grew white under his most casual
glance.There were others who knew that his calloused hand was closing
about them, and that when it opened again they would fall to the
ground, dry as dust.Others, like moths, not yet singed, were hovering
ever closer to the bright, cruel flame.Reverend Darius Borwell,
bowing and smiling, alighted from his parochial car and tripped
blithely up the glistening marble steps.Each and all, wrapping the
skeleton of grief, greed, shame, or fear beneath swart broadcloth and
shimmering silk, floated up those ghostly steps as if drawn by a
tremendous magnet incarnate in the person of J. Wilton Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away.Hawley-Crowles sigh in the wake of that gilded assembly?Did the moans
of poor, grief-stricken Mrs.Gannette, sitting in her poverty and
sorrow, die into silence against those bronze doors?Was he, the being
who dwelt in that marble palace, the hydra-headed embodiment of the
carnal, Scriptural, age-old power that opposes God?How many others there were
scattered through the house itself, Haynerd could only guess.But he
passed inspection and was admitted with the girl.A butler took
immediate charge of them, and led them quickly through a short passage
and to an elevator, by which they mounted to another floor, where,
opening a paneled oak door, the dignified functionary preceded them
into a small reception hall, with lavatories at either end.Here he
bade them remove their wraps and await his return."Well," commented Haynerd, with a light, nervous laugh, "we've crossed
the Rubicon!A moment later the butler returned with a sharp-eyed young woman, Mrs."You will be very careful in your report," the latter began at once in
a business-like manner."And you will submit the same to me for
approval before it is published in your magazine.Ames deems that
imperative, since your recent publication of an essay on modern
society in this city.I have a list here of the guests, their business
and social standing, and other data.You
will say that this is the most brilliant assemblage ever gathered
under one roof in New York.The wealth represented here to-night will
total not less than three billion dollars.The jewels alone displayed
will foot up not less than twenty millions.Now, let me see," again
consulting her notes.Haynerd stole a covert glance at Carmen and winked."The chef," the secretary resumed, "was brought over from Paris by
Mrs.His name, Pierre Lotard, descendant of
the famous chef of the Emperor Napoleon First.He considers that his
menu to-night surpasses anything he ever before achieved.""May I ask," interrupted Haynerd, "the probable cost of the supper?""Yes, perhaps you had better mention that item.It will be in the
neighborhood of three hundred dollars a plate.House and table
decorations, about eight thousand dollars.The menu cards were hand-illuminated by Parisian
artists, and each bears a sketch illustrative or suggestive of the
guest to whom it is given.""Three thousand, if I correctly recall it," was the nonchalant reply."As to the viands, you will mention that they have been gathered from
every part of the world.Now come with me, and I will give you a hasty
sketch of the house, while the guests are assembling in the grand
salon.Then you will remain in the balcony, where you will make what
notes you wish on the dress displayed.Refreshments will be served to
you later in this waiting room.I need not remind you that you are not
expected to mingle with the guests, nor to address any one.Keep to
the balcony, and quite out of view."Opening a door opposite the one through which she had entered, the
young woman led her charges directly out upon the great marble balcony
overlooking the grand salon below.A rush of brilliant light engulfed
them, and a potpourri of chatter and laughter, mingled with soft music
from a distant organ, and the less distinct notes of the orchestra in
the still more distant ballroom, rose about them in confused babel, as
they tiptoed to the exquisitely carved marble railing and peered down
upon the gorgeous pageant.The ceiling rose far above them, delicately
tinted like a soft Italian sky.The lofty walls dropped, like
gold-gray veils, to the richly carved paneled wainscoting beneath,
which had once lined the halls of a mediaeval castle on the Rhine.The
great windows were hidden behind rare Venetian lace curtains, over
which fell hangings of brocade, repeating the soft tints of the wall
and the brocade-covered chairs and divans ranged close about the sides
of the splendid room.On the floor lay a massive, priceless Persian
carpet, dating from the fifteenth century.Haynerd drew a long breath, and whistled softly.From the end of the
salon he could mark the short flight of steps which led to the
mezzanine, with its walls heavily tapestried, and broken by rich oak
doors opening into lavatories and lounging rooms, itself widening at
the far end into the grand billiard and smoking parlors, done off in
Circassian walnut, with tables and furniture to harmonize.From the
mezzanine he saw the grand stairway falling away in great, sweeping
curves, all in blended marble from the world's greatest quarries, and
delicately chased and carved into classic designs.Two tapestries,
centuries old, hung from the walls on either side.Far above, the oak
ceiling, for which the _Schwarzwald_ had been ranged, was overlaid
with pure gold leaf.The whole was suffused with the glow of myriad
hidden and inverted lights, reflected in a thousand angles from
burnished gold and marble and rarest gems.He groped in the chambers of
his imagery for some superlative adjective to express his emotion
before this colossal display of wealth.But his ample vocabulary had
faded quite.He could only shake his head and give vent to the inept
remark, "Swell--by George!"The secretary, without replying, motioned them to follow.Passing
noiselessly around the balcony to the opposite side, she indicated a
door below, leading off to the right from the grand salon."That room beyond," she said, "is the petit salon.It is
in panels from French chateaux, covered with Gobelin tapestry.Now
from here you can see a bit of the music room.The grand organ cost,
installed, about two hundred thousand dollars.It is electrically
controlled, with its pipes running all around the room, so as to give
the effect of music coming from every corner.""There are three art galleries beyond, two for paintings, and one for
sculpture.Ames has without doubt the finest art collection in
America.It includes several Titians, Veroneses, da Vincis, Turners,
three Rubens, and two Raphaels.By the way, it may interest you to
know that his negotiations for the Murillo Madonna were completed
to-day, and the picture will be sent to him immediately.""Might I ask what he paid for it?""You may say that he paid something over three hundred thousand
dollars for it," she replied, in a quite matter of fact tone."Now,"
she continued, "you will go back to your first position, near the door
of the waiting room, and remain there until I return.I may have an
opportunity later to show you the library.Great
carved stone fireplace, taken from a Scotch castle.Hundreds of rare
volumes and first editions.Now, if any one approaches, you can step
behind the screen and remain out of view.You have chairs and a table
there for your writing.With this final injunction she turned and disappeared into the little
waiting room from which they had emerged.For some moments Carmen and Haynerd stood looking alternately at
each other and about them at their magnificent environment.Both had
seen much of the gilded life, and the girl had dwelt some months in
its alien atmosphere.But neither had ever witnessed such a
stupendous display of material wealth as was here unfolded before
their astonished gaze.At the head of the grand stairway stood the
Ames trio, to receive their resplendent guests.The women were
magnificently gowned.But Ames's massive form in its simple black
and chaste linen was the cynosure of all eyes.Even Haynerd could
not suppress a note of admiration as he gazed at the splendid figure."And yet," he murmured, "a victim, like the rest, of the great
delusion."Carmen laid down the opera glasses through which she had been studying
the man."He is an expression," she said, "of the American ideal--the
ideal of practical material life.It is toward his plane of life that
this country's youth are struggling, at, oh, what a cost!Think,
think, what his immense, misused revenue could do, if unselfishly
used!Why, the cost of this single night's show would put two hundred
men like Father Waite through a four-year course in the University,
and train them to do life's work!"Oh, further opportunities to increase his pile, I suppose," returned
Haynerd, shrugging his shoulders.And does he need further
opportunities to accumulate money?Does he not rather need some one to
show him the meaning of life, how to really live?"And it may be your mission, Carmen, to do just that.But if you don't, then I sincerely hope the man may die before he
discovers that all that he has achieved, his wealth, his prestige, his
power, have not been worth striving for!""He hasn't the slightest idea of the meaning of life," she murmured,
looking down upon the glittering throng."They put me in mind of Carlyle's famous remark, as
he stood looking out across the London Strand: 'There are in this city
some four million people, mostly fools.'How mean, narrow and hard
their lives are!These are the high priests of vested privilege, of
mediaevalism, of old institutions whose perpetual maintenance, even in
a generation that has progressed far beyond them, is a fungus blight
upon us.Ah, there's little Willie Van Wot, all dolled out!He's
glorifying his Creator now by devoting his foolish little existence to
coaching trips along the New England shore.He reminds me of the Fleet
street poet who wrote a century ago of the similar occupation of a
young dandy of that day--

                  What can little T. O. do?Why, drive a Phaeton and Two!!!Can little T. O. do no more?Yes, drive a Phaeton and Four!!!!"He's an interesting outgrowth of our unique social system, eh?""We must follow Emerson and treat them all as we do pictures, look at
them in the best light," murmured Carmen."Aye, hang them in the best light!""But make sure
they're well hung!There goes the pseudo-princess, member of the royal
house of England.I tell you, under
the splash and glitter you can see the feet of clay, eh?""Yes," smiled Carmen, "resting upon the high heel."muttered Haynerd, with a gesture of disgust."The women of
fashion seem to feel that the Creator didn't do a good job when He
designed the feminine sex--that He should have put a hump where the
heel is, so's to slant the foot and make comfortable walking
impossible, as well as to insure a plentiful crop of foot-troubles and
deformities.The Chinese women used to manifest a similarly insane
thought.The human mind is a cave
of black ignorance!"Carmen did not reply, but bent her attention again to the throng
below."Look there," said Haynerd, indicating a stout, full-toiletted woman,
resplendent with diamonds."That's our eminent French guest, Madam
Carot.She severed herself from her tiresome consort last year by
means of a bichloride tablet deftly immersed in his coffee, and then,
leaving a sigh of regret hovering over his unhandsome remains,
hastened to our friendly shores, to grace the _beau monde_ with her
gowns and jewels."Carmen turned to him with a remonstrance of incredulity."The Social Era got the whole spicy
story.See, she's drifted up to young Watson!Coquetting for a
husband still, the old buzzard!""Well, it's fact, anyway," persisted the society monitor."And there
beyond her is fat little Mrs.Stuffenheimer, with her two unlovely,
red-faced daughters.Ah, the despairing mamma is still vainly angling
for mates for her two chubby Venuses!If they're not married off
properly and into good social positions soon, it's mamma for the scrap
heap!it's positively tragic to see these anxious mothers
at Newport and Atlantic City and other fashionable places, rushing
madly hither and yon with their marriageable daughters, dragging them
from one function to another in the wild hope that they may ultimately
land a man.Worry and pain dig deep furrows into poor mamma's face if
she sees her daughters fading into the has-been class.It requires
heroism, I say, to travel in society!Well,"
taking up his notebook, "we must get busy now.By the way, how's your
shorthand progressing?""Oh, splendidly," replied the girl, her eyes still upon the massive
figure of Ames.Then, recovering from her abstraction, "I can write as
fast in it now as in longhand."For more than an hour the two sat in the seclusion of the splendid
balcony, looking down upon the scene of magnificence below.Through
the mind of the young girl ran a ceaseless paean of thanksgiving for
her timely deliverance from the trammels which she so well knew
enshackled these glittering birds of paradise.With it mingled a
great, consuming desire, a soul-longing to pour into the vacuity of
high society the leaven of her own pure thought.In particular did her
boundless love now go out to that gigantic figure whose ideals of life
this sumptuous display of material wealth and power expressed.Was it only a vainglorious
exhibition of his own human prowess?Was it an announcement,
magnificent beyond compare, that he, J. Wilton Ames, had attained the
supreme heights of gratified world ambition?That the world at last
lay at his feet?And that over it brooded the giant's lament that
there remained nothing more to conquer?But, if so, the girl at least
knew that the man's herculean efforts to subdue the material world
were as nothing.The real conquest lay still before him, the conquest
of self.And when that were faced and achieved, well she knew that no
such garish display as this would announce the victory to a breathless
world.The bustling little social secretary again appeared, and briefly
announced the production of an opera in the auditorium, to which she
had come to conduct them.Passing through the little waiting room and
to the elevator, they quickly mounted to the unoccupied gallery of the
theater above.The parquet, which would seat nearly a thousand
spectators, was rapidly filling with an eager, curious throng.The
Ames trio and some of the more distinguished guests were already
occupying the gorgeously decorated boxes at the sides.An orchestra of
fifty pieces was visible in the hollow below the stage.Caroni, the
famous grand opera leader, stood ready to conduct.The opera itself
was the much discussed music drama, Salome."Now," commented Haynerd to his fair, wondering companion, who was
lost in contemplation of the magnificent mural decorations of the
little theater, "we will see something rare, for this opera has been
called the most artistic piece of indecency known to the stage.Ames has got Marie Deschamps for the title role.She'll cost
him not less than five thousand dollars for this one night.And--see
here," drawing Carmen's attention to the bill, "Marcou and Corvalle
besides!These stars get three thousand
dollars a night during the regular season."Every phase of sophistication was manifested in that glittering
audience when the curtain rose and the sensational theme was
introduced.But to none came thoughts like those which clamored for
admittance at the portals of Carmen's mentality.In the bold challenge
of the insanely sensual portrayal of a carnal mind the girl saw the
age-old defiance of the spirit by the flesh.In the rolls of the
wondrous music, in its shrieks, its pleadings, and its dying echoes,
she heard voiced again the soul-lament of a weary world searching
vainly in the mazes of human thought for truth.As the wonderful
Deschamps danced weirdly before her in the ghastly light and fell
gloating over her gory trophy, Carmen saw but the frantic struggles of
a diseased soul, portrayed as the skilled surgeon lays bare the
malignant growth that is eating the quivering tissues of a human
frame.The immodesty of dress, the sensual suggestiveness of the
dance, the brutal flouting of every element of refinement and
delicacy, blazoned in frenzied tone and movement the bloody orgy and
dance of death which goes on incessantly upon the stage of human life,
and ends in the mad whirl and confusion and insane gibbering over the
lifeless trophies for which mankind sell their very souls.commented Haynerd, when the final
curtain dropped."Yes, even to a vitiated taste.The passionate thirst
for the sensational has led to this sickening display of salacity--"

"Splendid, wasn't it?"came in tones of admiration from the social
secretary, who had returned to conduct her charges back to the balcony
before the guests emerged from the theater."You will run the program
in full, and comment at some length on the expense attached," she went
on."You have just witnessed the private production of a full opera,
unabridged, and with the regular operatic cast.Supper will follow in
a half hour.Meantime, you will remain in the balcony where you were
before."Returning to their former position, Carmen sank into a chair at the
little table behind the screen, and strove to orient her thought.Haynerd sat down beside her to arrange his voluminous notes.Presently
footsteps were heard, and the sound of voices.Haynerd glanced through
the hinge of the screen.he whispered, "here comes Ames
and--who's with him?Showing him about, I
suppose."Carmen gazed at the approaching men with fascinated eyes, although she
saw but one, the towering magician who had reared this fairy palace.She saw Ames lead his companion to the door of the little waiting room
at their right, and heard the congressman protest against entering."But we can talk undisturbed in here," urged Ames, his hand on the
door."Better remain out here on the balcony," replied the congressman
nervously, as he moved toward the railing.He understood the
man's repugnance fully."You know, Wales," he said easily, going to the railing and peering
over at the brilliant assemblage below, "if I could get the heathen
Chinee to add an extra half-inch to his shirt length, I'd make a
hundred millions.And then, perhaps, I wouldn't need to struggle with
your Ways and Means Committee as I do.By the way, the cotton schedule
will be reported out unchanged, I presume."He turned and looked
quizzically at his companion as he said this.Wales trembled slightly when he replied to the question he had been
awaiting."Parsons will vote for it," he said
suggestively.Ames, is committed to
the high tariff principle.We can not let in a flood of foreign
cotton--"

"Then you want the fight between the farmers and spinners to continue,
eh?""You don't seem to realize that in the
end both will get more money than they are getting now, and that it
will come from the consumer, who will pay vastly higher for his
finished products, in addition to the tariff.Ames," returned the congressman
tenaciously."Look here, Wales," said Ames, turning savagely upon his companion.Their
cooeperative associations must be smashed.The tariff schedule which
you have before your Committee will do it.Ames," replied the congressman, "I--I am opposed to the constant
manipulation of cotton by you rich men.I--"

"There," interrupted Ames, "never mind explaining your conscientious
scruples.What I want to know is, do you intend to cast your vote for
the unaltered schedule?"Ames, I can't--"

"H'm," murmured Ames.Then, with easy nonchalance, turning to an
apparently irrelevant topic as he gazed over the railing, "I heard
just before coming from my office this evening that the doors of the
Mercantile Trust would not open to-morrow.A lot of my
personal friends are heavily involved.Ames and Company will take over their tangible assets; I believe
you were interested, were you not?"He glanced at the trembling man
out of the corners of his eyes.His hands shook as he grasped the railing before
him and tried to steady himself."It--it--yes--very hard," murmured the dazed man.But step into the waiting room and 'phone the newspapers.Representative Wales was serving his first term in Congress.His
election had been a matter of surprise to everybody, himself included,
excepting Ames.Wales knew not that his detailed personal history had
been for many months carefully filed in the vaults of the Ames tower.Nor did he ever suspect that his candidacy and election had been
matters of most careful thought on the part of the great financier
and his political associates.But when he, a stranger to congressional
halls, was made a member of the Ways and Means Committee, his
astonishment overleaped all bounds.Then Ames had smiled his own
gratification, and arranged that the new member should attend the
formal opening of the great Ames palace later in the year.Meantime,
the financier and the new congressman had met on several occasions,
and the latter had felt no little pride in the attention which the
great man had shown him.And so the path to fame had unrolled steadily before the guileless
Wales until this night, when the first suspicions of his thraldom had
penetrated and darkened his thought.Then, like a crash from a clear
sky, had come the announcement of the Mercantile Trust failure.And as
he stood there now, clutching the marble railing, his thought busy
with the woman and the two fair children who would be rendered
penniless by this blow, the fell presence of the monster Ames seemed
to bend over him as the epitome of ruthless, brutal, inhuman cunning."How much are you likely to lose by this failure?""Not less than fifty thousand
dollars," he replied in a husky voice.stooping and apparently taking up an object that had
been lying on the floor back of the congressman.Wales took the book in a dazed, mechanical way."Why--I have no--this
is not mine," he murmured, gazing alternately at the pass book and at
Ames."Your name's on it, at least," commented Ames laconically."And the
book's been issued by our bank, Ames and Company.Guess you've
forgotten opening an account there, let me see, yes, a week ago."He
took the book and opened it."Ah, yes, I recall the incident now.The book, made out in his name on Ames
and Company, showed a deposit to his credit of fifty thousand
dollars!Ames slipped his arm through the confused congressman's, and started
with him down the balcony."You see," he said, as they moved away,
"the Mercantile failure will not hit you as hard as you thought.Now,
about that cotton schedule, when you cast your vote for it, be sure
that--" The voice died away as the men disappeared in the distance,
leaving Carmen and Haynerd staring blankly at each other."We must save them both," said Carmen quietly."I could make my everlasting fortune out of this!"exclaimed Haynerd
excitedly."And lose your soul," replied the girl.Ames, and
tell him that we overheard his conversation.Haynerd then smiled, but it was a hard smile, coming from one who knew
the world."Listen, my dear girl," he said, "we will keep quiet, you
and I. To mention this would be only to court disaster at the hands of
one who would strangle us at the slightest intimation of our
knowledge."I can see but the right," returned Carmen determinedly."But, my dear girl," cried Haynerd, now thoroughly alarmed both for
himself and her, "he would ruin us!We had
no intention of hearing; and so let it be as if we had not heard."Haynerd, I could not, if I
would.Ames is being used by evil; and it is making him a channel
to ruin Mr.Shall I stand idly by and permit it?She rose, with a look of fixed resolution on
