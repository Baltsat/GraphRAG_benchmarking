Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity.Sandra went back to the garden."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Sandra went to the hallway.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Daniel went back to the garden.Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall."So am I, sah," confessed the queer colonel."He has been ver' valuable
to me.It will be a long time before I find another like him."Frank did not understand that remark then, but he did afterward, when he
was told that Colonel Vallier was a professional card sharp, and had
bled Rolf Raymond for many thousands of dollars.This explained the
singular friendship between the sharp old rascal and the young man.More than that, Frank afterward learned that Colonel Vallier was not a
commissioned officer, had never been such, but had assumed the title.In many ways the man tried to imitate the Southern gentleman of the old
school, but, as he was not a gentleman at heart, he was a sad failure.All at once Frank remembered Barney, and that he had promised to stand
by the Irish lad."Barney Mulloy is in there with that gang of
raging wolves!""Nivver a bit av it, Frankie," chirped a cheerful voice.Down from the tree swung the fighting Irish lad, dropping beside his
comrade."Th' craythers didn't feel loike comin' up th' shtairs inny more,"
Barney explained."They seemed to hiv enough sport fer wan avenin'.Somebody shouted somethin' to thim, an' away they wint out doors, so I
took to lookin' fer yez, me b'y.""Oi looked out av th' windy, an' hearrud yer voice.Thot's whoy Oi came
down.Phat has happened out here, Oi dunno?""Well, it's the avil wan's oun luck!""But av we shtay
here, Frankie, it's pinched we'll be by the police as will be afther
getting around boy and boy."Inza----"

"She ain't here inny more, me lad, an' so ye moight as well go."Swiftly and silently they slipped away, leaving Colonel Vallier with the
dead youth.Frank was feeling disgusted and desperate, and he expressed himself
freely as they made their way along the streets."It is voile luck," admitted Barney; "but we did our bist, an' it's a
jolly good foight we had.Frankie, we make a whole tame, wid a litthle
yaller dog under th' waggin.""Oh, I can't think of anything but Inza, Inza, Inza!Out of a dark shadow timidly came a female figure.With a cry of joy, Frank sprang forward, and clasped her in his arms,
lifting her off her feet and covering her face, eyes and mouth with
kisses, while he cried:

"Inza, girl!We fought like fiends to save you, and we
thought we had failed.But now----"

"You did your best, Frank, but that dreadful wretch dragged me to the
window and dropped me into the arms of a monster who was waiting below.I made up my mind that I would keep my
senses and try to escape.The man jumped after me, and then a signal was
given that brought the others from the building.They were going to wrap
something about my head when I got my mouth free and cried out.There was fighting, and I caught a
glimpse of the face of Rolf Raymond.I
felt myself free, and I ran, ran, ran, till I fell here from exhaustion,
and here I lay till I heard your voice.cried Barney, "it's a bit ago we were ravin' at our
luck: It's givin' thanks we should be this minute."Inza is safe, Rolf Raymond
is dead, and----"

A cry broke from the lips of the girl."But you were affianced to him?"My father and Roderick Raymond, who is a <DW36> and
has not many more years to live, were schoolmates and friends in their
younger days.Roderick Raymond has made a vast fortune, and in his old
age he set his heart upon having his son marry the daughter of his
former friend and partner.It seems that, when they first got married,
father and Raymond declared, in case the child of one was a boy, and
that of the other was a girl, that their children should marry.Raymond's only son, as I am an only daughter.Believing himself
ready to die, Roderick Raymond sent to my father and reminded him of
their agreement.As you know, father is not very wealthy, and he is now
an invalid.His mind is not strong, and he became convinced that it was
his duty to see that I married Rolf Raymond.He set his mind on it, and
all my pleadings were in vain.He brought me here to the South, and I
saw Rolf.I disliked him violently the moment my eyes rested on him,
but he seemed to fall madly in love with me.He was fiercely jealous of
me, and watched me as a dog watches its mistress.I could not escape
him, and I was becoming entangled deeper and deeper when you appeared.I
knew you, and I was determined to see you again--to ask you to save me.I took part in the parade to-night, and went to the ballroom.Rolf
followed me about so that I became disgusted and slipped from the room,
intending to return home alone.Barely had I left the room when a fellow
whispered in my ear that he had been sent there by you--that I was to go
with him, and he would take me to you.I entered a closed carriage, and
I was brought to the place where you found me a captive in the hands of
those ruffians."Frank had listened with eager interest to this explanation, and it made
everything clear."It was ordained by fate that we should find you there," he declared."It was known the Queen of Flowers had disappeared, and we were
searching for you.Rolf Raymond
came there, also, and he came to his death.But, Inza, explain one
thing--why didn't you answer my letters?""I did not; but I received no answers.""Then," cried the girl, "your letters must have been intercepted.I did not know your address, so I could
not ask for an explanation.""Well, it has come out right at last.We'll find a carriage and take you
home.They reached Canal Street, and found a carriage.Inza's invalid father was astounded when he saw Frank and Barney Mulloy
appear with his daughter, and he was more than ever astounded and
agitated when he knew what had happened.But Inza was safe, and Rolf Raymond was dead.It was a lively tale the boys related to Professor Scotch that night.The little man fairly gasped for breath as he listened.In the morning the police had taken hold of the affair, and they were
hot after the fellows who had killed Rolf Raymond.Frank and Barney were
called on to tell their story, and were placed under surveillance.But the cottage cafe was deserted, and the Spanish rascals were not
captured.They disappeared from New Orleans, and, to this day, the law
has never avenged the death of Roderick Raymond's only son.The murder of his boy was too much for Raymond to endure, and he died of
a broken heart on the day of the son's funeral.Knowing he was dying, he
had a new will swiftly made, and all his wealth was left to his old
friend Burrage.Frank and Barney thoroughly enjoyed the rest of their stay in New
Orleans.In the open carriage with them, at Frank's side, rode the
"Queen of Flowers" as they went sight-seeing.In the throng of spectators, with two detectives near at hand, they saw
Colonel La Salle Vallier.He lifted his hat and bowed with the utmost
courtesy."The auld chap is something of a daisy, after all, Frankie," laughed
Barney."Oi kinder admire th' spalpane."coughed Professor Scotch, at Barney's side."He is a great
duelist--a great duelist, but he quailed before my terrible eye--he was
forced to apologize."If anything happens when we are again separated that you should fail to
receive my letters, you will not doubt me, will you?"he asked, in a
whisper.And she softly replied:

"No, Frank, but----"

"But what?""You--you must not forget Elsie Bellwood.""I haven't heard from her in a long time," said Frank.But Frank was to hear from his other girl friend soon and in a most
unexpected manner.From New Orleans Frank, Barney and the professor journeyed to Florida.Frank was anxious to see the Everglades and do some hunting.Our hero was particularly anxious to shoot a golden heron, of which he
had heard not a little.One day a start was made in a canoe from a small settlement on the edge
of the great Dismal Swamp, and on went our three friends deeper and
deeper into the wilds.At last the professor grew tired of the sameness of the journey."How much further into this wild swamp do you intend to go, Frank?""I am going till I get a shot at a golden heron."White hunters have searched the
remote fastnesses of the Florida swamps for a golden heron, but no such
bird have they ever found.The Indians are the only ones to see golden
herons.""If the Indians can see them, white men may find them.I shall not be
satisfied till I have shot one.""Oh, I don't know about that, professor.I am something of an Indian
myself.You know the Seminoles are honest and peaceable, and----"

"All Indians are liars.I would not take the word of a Seminole under
any condition.Come, Frank, don't be foolish; let's turn round and go
back.We may get bewildered on these winding waterways which twist here
and there through swamps of cypress and rushes.We were foolish to come
without a guide, but----"

"We could not obtain one until to-morrow, and I wished to come to-day.""You may be sorry you did not wait.""Now, you are getting scared, professor," laughed Frank, lifting his
paddle from the water and laying it across the bow of the canoe."I'll
tell you what we'll do.""We'll leave it to Barney, who has not had a word to say on the matter.If he says go back, we'll go back."Professor Scotch hesitated, scratched his fingers into his fiery beard,
and then said:

"Well, I'll have to do as you boys say, anyway, so we'll leave it to
Barney.""All right," laughed Frank, once more."What do you say, Barney, my
boy?"Barney Mulloy was in the stern of the canoe that had been creeping along
one of the sluggish water courses that led through the cypress swamp and
into the heart of the Everglades."Well, gintlemin," he said, "Oi've been so busy thrying to kape thrack
av th' twists an' turruns we have been makin' thot Oi didn't moind mutch
pwhat ye wur soaying.So the matter was laid before him, and, when he had heard what Frank and
the professor had to say, he declared:

"Fer mesilf it's nivver a bit do Oi care where we go ur pwhat we do,
but, as long as we hiv come so fur, an' Frankie wants to go furder, Oi'd
soay go on till he is sick av it an' reddy to turn back.""As I knew it would be settled," growled Professor Scotch, sulkily."You
boys combine against me every time.Well, I suppose I'll have to
submit."So the trio pushed on still farther into the great Dismal Swamp, a weird
section of strange vegetable and animal life, where great black trees
stood silent and grim, with Spanish moss dangling from their branches,
bright-plumaged birds flashed across the opens, ugly snakes glided
sinuously over the boggy land, and sleepy alligators slid from muddy
banks and disappeared beneath the surface of the dead water."If we should come upon one of these wonderful golden herons, Frank
could not come within a hundred yards of it with that old bow and
arrow," he said."Perhaps not, but I could make a bluff at
it.""I don't see why you won't use a gun."In the first place, in order to be sure of
killing a heron with a shotgun I'd have to use fairly large shot, and
that might injure the bird badly; in the second place, there might be
two, and I'd not be able to bag more than one of them with a gun, as the
report would scare the other.Then there is the possibility that I would
miss with the first shot, and the heron would escape entirely.If I miss
with an arrow, it is not likely the bird will be alarmed and take to
flight, so I'll have another chance at it.Oh, there are some advantages
in using the primitive bow and arrow.""You have a way of always making out a good
case for yourself.he is a hard b'y to bate, profissor," grinned Barney."Av he
wurn't, it's dead he'd been long ago.""That's right, that's right," agreed Scotch, who admired Frank more than
he wished to acknowledge."It's not all luck, profissor," assured the Irish boy."In minny cases
it's pure nerve thot pulls him through.""Well, there's a great deal of luck in it--of course there is.""Oh, humor the professor, Barney," laughed Frank."Perhaps he'll become
better natured if you do."They now came to a region of wild cypress woods, where the treetops were
literally packed with old nests, made in the peculiar heron style.They
were constructed of huge bristling piles of cross-laid sticks, not
unlike brush heaps of a Western clearing.Here for years, almost ages, different species of herons had built their
nests in perfect safety.As the canoe slowly and silently glided toward the "rookeries," white
and blue herons were seen to rise from the reed-grass and fly across the
opens in a stately manner, with their long necks folded against their
breasts, and their legs projecting stiffly behind them."Pwoy don't yez be satisfoied wid a few av th' whoite wans, Frankie?""They're handsome," admitted Frank; "but a golden heron is worth a large
sum as a curiosity, and I mean to have one.""All roight, me b'y; have yer own way, lad.""He'll do that, anyhow," mumbled Professor Scotch, gruffly.They could now see long, soldier-like lines of herons stretched out
along the reedy swales, standing still and solemn, like pickets on duty.They were not particularly wary or wild, for they had not been hunted
very much in the wild region which they inhabited.Little green herons were plentiful, and they kept flying up before the
canoe constantly, scaring the others, till Frank grew very impatient,
declaring:

"Those little rascals will scare away a golden heron, if we are
fortunate enough to come upon one."Let me shoot a few of th' varmints," urged Barney, reaching for one of
the guns in the bottom of the canoe."Think what the report of a gun
would do here.muttered the Irish lad, reluctantly relinquishing his hold
on the gun."Av ye soay kape still, kape still it is."Frank instructed the professor to take in his paddle, and Barney was
directed to hold the canoe close to the edge of the rushes.In this
manner, with Frank kneeling in the prow, an arrow ready notched on the
string, he could shoot with very little delay.Beyond the heron rookery the waterway wound into the depths of a dark,
forbidding region, where the Spanish moss hung thick, and the great
trees leaned over the water.They had glided past one side of the rookery and were near this dark
opening when an exclamation of surprise came from Frank Merriwell's
lips."Phat is it, me b'y?""There must be other hunters near at hand," said the professor."The canoe is not drawn up to the bank," said Frank, in a puzzled way."It seems to be floating at some distance from the shore.""Why should it be moored in such a place?There are no tides here, and
alligators are not liable to steal canoes.""Do ye see inny soign av a camp, Frankie?""Not a sign of a camp or a human being.A strange feeling of wonder that swiftly changed to awe was creeping
over them.The canoe was snowy white, and lay perfectly motionless on
the still surface of the water.It was in the dark shadow beneath the
trees."Perhaps the owner of the canoe is lying in the bottom," suggested the
professor."We'll see about that," said Frank, putting down the bow and arrow and
taking up a paddle.With the very first stroke in that direction a most astonishing thing
happened.The white canoe seemed to swing slightly about, and then, with no
visible occupant and no apparent motive power, it glided smoothly and
gently toward the dark depths of the black forest!"There must be a
strong current there!""Nivver a bit is she floating!"Oi fale me hair shtandin' on me head!"Look at the
ripple that spreads from her prow!""But--but," spluttered Professor Scotch, "what is making her move--what
is propelling her?"came from Frank, "but it's a mystery I mean to
solve!Keep straight after that canoe,
Barney.We'll run her down and look her over."Then a strange race began, canoe against canoe, the one in the lead
apparently empty, the one pursuing containing three persons who were
using all their strength and skill to overtake the empty craft.[Illustration: "The white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the
inky surface of the shadowed water."(See page 147)]




CHAPTER XXVI.snorted Barney, in disgust, great drops of perspiration rolling
down his face."As if we wurn't pullin'!""The white canoe keeps just so far ahead."it's not our fault at all, at all."Indeed, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how fast they made the
canoe fly through the water, they could not gain on the mysterious white
canoe.The distance between the two canoes seemed to remain just the
same, and the one in advance slipped through the water without a sound,
following the winding water course beneath the dark trees and going
deeper and deeper into the heart of the swamp.Other water courses were passed, running away into unknown and
unexplorable wilds.It grew darker and darker, and the feeling of awe
and fear fell more heavily upon them.At last, exhausted and discouraged, the professor stopped paddling,
crying to his companions, in a husky voice:

"Stop, boys, stop!There is something supernatural about that fiendish
boat!It is luring us to some frightful fate!""You are not superstitious--you
have said so at least a score of times.""That's all right," returned Scotch, shaking his head."I do not take
any stock in rappings, table tippings, and that kind of stuff, but I
will confess this is too much for me."Oi don't wonder at thot," gurgled Barney Mulloy, wiping the
great drops of perspiration from his forehead."It's the divvil's own
canoe, thot is sure!""Thin ixplain it fer me, me b'y--ixplain it.""Oh, I won't say that I can explain it, for I do not pretend to
understand it; but I'll wager that the mystery would be readily solved
if we could overtake and examine that canoe.""Mebbe so; but I think it nades a stameboat to overtake it."Professor Scotch shook his head in a most solemn manner."Boys," he said, "in all my career I have never seen anything like this,
and I shall never dare tell this adventure, for people in general would
not believe it--they'd think I was lying.""And, still I will wager that the
explanation of the whole matter would seem very simple if we could
overtake that canoe and examine it.""I am surprised at you, professor--I am more than surprised.""I can't help it if you are, my boy.""I am afraid your mind is beginning to weaken.""Soay, Frankie," broke in Barney."Oi loike fun as well as th' nixt wan,
but, be jabbers!it's nivver a bit av it can Oi see in this!"cried the professor, pointing at the mystic
craft."It has stopped out there in the shadows.""And seems to be waiting for us to pursue again.""I am not," decisively declared Professor Scotch."It's enough av this
koind av business Oi've been in!""We'll turn about," said Scotch, grimly."That canoe will lure us into
this dismal swamp so far that we'll never find our way out."I suppose I'll have to give up, but I do dislike
to leave without solving the mystery of that canoe.""It may be thot we're so far in thot we can't foind our way out at all,
at all," said the Irish lad."I'm afraid we'll not be able to get out before nightfall," confessed
the professor."I have no fancy for spending a night in this swamp."Barney promptly expressed his dislike for such an adventure, but Frank
was silent.The canoe turned about, and they set about the task of retracing the
water courses by which they had come far into the swamp.It was not long before they came to a place where the courses divided.Frank was for following one, while both Barney and the professor
insisted that the other was the right way.Finally, Frank gave in to them, although it was against his better
judgment, and he felt that he should not submit.They had not proceeded far before, as they were passing round a bend, a
cry of astonishment fell from Barney's lips.Th' thing is afther follying av us!"They looked back, and, sure enough, there was the mysterious canoe,
gliding after them, like a most uncanny thing!said Frank, in a tone that plainly indicated he did
not like it.throbbed the professor, splashing his paddle into the
water and very nearly upsetting them all."Don't let the thing overtake
us!"Oi think it's a foine plan to be gettin' out av this," muttered Barney,
in an agitated tone of voice."Steady, there, professor," called Frank, sharply."What do you want to
do--drown us all?As long as we could not overtake it, let it overtake us."Th' skame won't worruck, me b'y.Th' ould thing's shtopped."It was true; the white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the
inky surface of the shadowed water."Well, I can't say that I like this," said Frank."And I scarcely think I like it more than you do," came from the
professor."An' th' both av yez loike it as well as mesilf," put in the Irish
youth.Go on they did, but the white canoe still followed, keeping at a
distance."I can't stand this," declared Frank, as he picked up a rifle from the
bottom of the canoe."I wonder how lead will work on her?""Pwhat are yez goin' to do, me b'y?""Shoot a few holes in that craft," was the deliberate answer."Swing to
the left, so that I may have a good chance.""No telling what'll come of it if you shoot.""I'll simply put a few holes through that canoe.""It may sind us all to glory by th' farrust express."Swing her to the left, I say.I am going to
shoot, and that settles it."It was useless for them to urge him not to fire; he was determined, and
nothing they could say would change his mind.The canoe drifted round to
the left, and the rifle rose to Frank's shoulder.The clear report rang out and echoed through the cypress forest.The bullet tore through the white canoe, and the weird craft seemed to
give a leap, like a wounded creature.echoed the professor, quivering with terror.groaned Barney Mulloy, his face white and his eyes staring."She is turning about--she is going to leave us!Up the rifle came, but, just as he pressed the trigger, Professor Scotch
pushed the weapon to one side, so the bullet did not pass within twenty
feet of the white canoe."I couldn't see you shoot into that canoe again," faltered the agitated
professor.He could not explain, and he was
ashamed of his agitation and fears."Well, you fellows lay over anything I ever went up against!""I didn't suppose you could be so thoroughly
childish.""All right, Frank," came humbly from the professor's lips."I can't help
it, and I haven't a word to say.""But I will take one more shot at that canoe!""Not this day," chuckled Barney Mulloy.The mysterious canoe had vanished from view while they were
speaking.The exclamations came from Frank and Professor Scotch.Barney's chuckle changed to a shiver, and his teeth chattered."Th' Ould B'y's in it!""The Old Boy must have been in that canoe," agreed the professor.He still refused to believe there
was anything supernatural about the mysterious, white canoe, but he was
forced to acknowledge to himself that the craft had done most amazing
things."It simply slipped into some branch waterway while we were not looking,"
he said, speaking calmly, as if it were the most commonplace thing
imaginable."Well, it's gone," said Scotch, as if greatly relieved."Now, let's get
out of this in a great hurry.""I am for going back to see what has become of the white canoe," said
Frank, with deliberate intent to make his companions squirm.Barney and the professor raised a perfect howl of protest.shouted Scotch, nearly upsetting the boat in his excitement,
and wildly flourishing his arms in the air."Oi'll joomp overboard an' swim out av
this before Oi'll go back!""I suppose I'll have to give in to
you, as you are two to one.""Come on," fluttered the professor; "let's be moving."So Frank put down the rifle, and picked up his paddle, and they resumed
their effort to get out of the swamp before nightfall.But the afternoon was well advanced, and night was much nearer than they
had thought, as they were soon to discover.At last, Barney cried:

"Oi see loight enough ahead!We must be near out av th' woods."For a long time he had been certain they were on the
wrong course, but he hoped it would bring them out somewhere.He had
noted the light that indicated they were soon to reach the termination
of the cypress swamp, but he held his enthusiasm in check till he could
be sure they had come out somewhere near where they had entered the
dismal region."What do you think now,
young man?Do you mean to say that we don't know our business?What if
we had accepted your way of getting out of the swamp!We'd been in there
now, sir.""Don't crow till you're out of the woods," advised Frank.Oi belave he'd be plazed av we didn't get out at all, at all!"In a short time they came to the termination of the cypress woods, but,
to the surprise of Barney and the professor, the swamp, overgrown with
tall rushes and reed-grass, continued, with the water course winding
away through it."Pwhat th' ould boy does this mane?""It means," said Frank, coolly, "that we have reached the Everglades."Well, pwhat do we want iv thim, Oi dunno?""They are one of the sights of Florida, Barney.""It's soights enough I've seen alreddy.Oi'd loike ter git out av this.""I knew you wouldn't get out this way, for we have not passed the
rookeries of the herons, as you must remember.""That's true," sighed the professor, dejectedly."Turn about, and retrace our steps," said Frank.But Barney and the professor raised a vigorous protest."Nivver a bit will yez get me inther thot swamp again th' doay!"shouted
the Irish lad, in a most decisive manner."If we go back, we'll not be able to get out before darkness comes on,
and we'll have to spend the night in the swamp," said Scotch, excitedly."Well, what do you propose to do?""I don't seem
to have anything to say in this matter.You are running it to suit
yourselves."They were undecided, but one thing was certain; they would not go back
into the swamp.The white canoe was there, and the professor and the
Irish lad did not care to see that again."We're out av th' woods, an',
by follyin' this strame, we ought to get out av th' Iverglades."asked Frank, who was rather enjoying the
adventure, although he did not fancy the idea of spending a night on the
marsh."Go on--by all means, go on!"We'll proceed to explore the Everglades in company
with Professor Scotch, the noted scientist and daring adventurer.So they pushed onward into the Everglades, while the sun sank lower and
lower, finally dropping beneath the horizon.Night was coming on, and they were in the heart of the Florida
Everglades!Barney and the professor fell to growling at each other, and they kept
it up while Frank smiled and remained silent.At length, Scotch took in his paddle in disgust, groaning:

"We're lost!""I am inclined to think so myself," admitted Frank, cheerfully."Well, who's to blame, Oi'd loike to know?"roared the professor, like a wounded lion."It's yersilf thot is to blame!Frankie wanted to go the other woay, but ye said no."You
insisted that this was the proper course to pursue!"Profissor, ye're a little oulder thin Oi be, but av ye wur nigh me age,
Oi'd inform ye thot ye didn't know how to spake th' truth.""Do you mean to call me a liar, you impudent young rascal?""Not now, profissor; but I would av ye wur younger.""Well, pwhat are yez goin' to do about it?""I'll make you swallow the words, you scoundrel!""Well, thot would be more av a male thin the rist av ye are loikely to
get th' noight, so it is!""Come, come," laughed Frank; "this is no time nor place to quarrel.""You're right, Frank; but this ungrateful young villain makes me very
tired!""Excuse me, but you know human beings are influenced by their
surroundings and associates.If I have----"

"Professor!""You would not accuse me of
having taught you to use slang?"No, no--that is, you see--er--well, er, that Dutch boy
was always saying something slangy."Quite a joke--quite a little joke, you
know!As under the circumstances there was nothing else to do, they finally
paddled slowly forward, looking for a piece of dry land, where they
could stop and camp for the night.They approached a small cluster of trees, which rose above the rushes,
and it was seen that they seemed to be growing on land that was fairly
high and dry."It's not likely we'll find another
place like that anywhere in the Everglades."As they came nearer, they saw the trees seemed to be growing on an
island, for the water course divided and ran on either side of them."This is really a
very interesting and amusing adventure.""It may be for you," groaned the professor; "but you forget that it is
said to be possible for persons to lose themselves in the Everglades and
never find their way out.""On the contrary, I remember it quite well.In fact, it is said that,
without a guide, the chances of finding a way out of the Everglades is
small, indeed.""Well, what do you feel so exuberant about?""Why, the possibility that we'll all perish in the Everglades adds zest
to this adventure--makes it really interesting.""Frank, you're a puzzle to me.You are cautious about running into
danger of any sort, but, once in it, you seem to take a strange and
unaccountable delight in the peril.The greater the danger, the happier
you seem to feel.""Thot's roight," nodded Barney."When I am not in danger, my good judgment tells me to take no chances;
but when I get into it fairly, I know the only thing to be done is to
make the best of it.I delight in adventure--I was born for it!"A dismal sound came from the professor's throat."When your uncle died," said Scotch, "I thought him my friend.Although
we had quarreled, I fancied the hatchet was buried.He made me your
guardian, and I still believed he had died with nothing but friendly
feelings toward me.But he knew you, and now I believe it was an act of
malice toward me when he made me your guardian.And, to add to my
sufferings, he decreed that I should travel with you.Asher Dow
Merriwell deliberately plotted against my life!He knew the sort of a
career you would lead me, and he died chuckling in contemplation of the
misery and suffering you would inflict upon me!That man was a
monster--an inhuman wretch!"cried Barney, pointing toward the small, timbered island."May Ould Nick floy away wid me av it ain't a house!"In a little clearing on some rising ground amid the trees they could see
the hut."It looks as if some one stops here at times, at least," said Frank."Av this ain't a clear case av luck, Oi dunno mesilf!""We'll get the man who lives there to guide us out of the Everglades!"shouted the professor, in a relieved tone.Then Frank cast a gloom over their spirits by saying:

"This may be a hunter's cabin, inhabited only at certain seasons of the
year.Ten to one, there's no one living in it now.""You'd be pleased if there wasn't!""We'll soon find out if there's any one at home," he said, as the canoe
ran up to the bank, and he took care to get out first.As soon as Frank was out, the professor made a scramble to follow him.He rose to his feet, despite Barney's warning cry, and, a moment later,
the cranky craft flipped bottom upward, with the swiftness of a flash of
lightning.The professor and the Irish lad disappeared beneath the surface of the
water.Barney's head popped up in a moment, and he stood upon his feet, with
the water to his waist, uttering some very vigorous words.Up came the professor, open flew his mouth, out spurted a stream of
water, and then he wildly roared:

"Help!Before either of the boys could say a word, he went under again."This is th' firrust toime Oi iver saw a man thot wanted to drown in
thray fate av wather," said Barney.Frank sat down on the dry ground, and shouted with laughter.he bellowed, after he had spurted another big stream of water
from his mouth."Will you see me perish before your very eyes?But Frank was laughing so heartily that he could not say a word, and the
little man went down once more.For the third time the professor's head appeared above the surface, and
the professor's voice weakly called:

"Will no one save me?This is a plot to get me out of the way!May you be happy
when I am gone!"shouted Frank, seeing that the little man had actually
resigned himself to drown.The professor stood up, and an expression of pain, surprise, and disgust
settled on his face, as he thickly muttered:

"May I be kicked!And I've been under the water two-thirds of the time
for the last hour!I've swallowed more than two barrels of this
swamp-water, including, in all probability, a few dozen pollywogs,
lizards, young alligators, and other delightful things!If the water
wasn't so blamed dirty here, and I wasn't afraid of swallowing enough
creatures to start an aquarium, I'd just lie down and refuse to make
another effort to get up."Then he waded out, the look on his face causing Frank to double up with
merriment, while even the wretched Barney smiled.Barney would have waded out, but Frank said:

"Don't attempt to land without those guns, old man.They're somewhere on
the bottom, and we want them."So Barney was forced to plunge under the surface and feel around till he
had fished up the rifles and the shotgun.Frank had taken care of his bow and arrows, the latter being in a quiver
at his back, and the paddles had not floated away.After a time, everything was recovered, the canoe was drawn out and
tipped bottom upward, and the trio moved toward the cabin, Frank
leading, and the professor staggering along behind.Reaching the cabin, Frank rapped loudly on the door.Once more he knocked, and then, as there was no reply, he pushed the
door open, and entered.The cabin was not occupied by any living being, but a glance showed the
trio that some one had been there not many hours before, for the embers
of a fire still glowed dimly on the open hearth of flat stones.There were two rooms, the door between them being open, so the little
party could look into the second.The first room seemed to be the principal room of the hut, while the
other was a bedroom.They could see the bed through the open doorway.There were chairs, a table, a couch, and other things, for the most part
rude, home-made stuff, and still every piece showed that the person who
constructed it had skill and taste.Around the walls were hung various tin pans and dishes, all polished
bright and clean.What surprised them the most was the wire screens in the windows, a
screen door that swung inward, and a mosquito-bar canopy over the bed
and the couch.cried Frank; "the person who lives here is prepared to
protect himself against mosquitoes and black flies.""It would be impossible to live here in the summer," gravely declared
Professor Scotch, forgetting his own misery for the moment."The pests
would drive a man crazy.""Oh, I don't know about that," returned Frank."If a man knew how to
defend himself against them he might get along all right.They can't be
worse than the mosquitoes of Alaska in the warm months.Up there the
Indians get along all right, even though mosquitoes have been known to
kill a bear."Oh, Frankie, me b'y, Oi
nivver thought that av you!""Sometimes bears, lured by
hunger, will come down into the lowlands, where mosquitoes will attack
them.They will stand up on their hind legs and strike at the little
pests with their forward paws.Sometimes a bear will do this till he is
exhausted and falls."Thot's a harrud yarn to belave, profissor; but it goes av you soay so,"
said Barney, thinking it best to smooth over the late unpleasantness."Up there," said Frank, "the Indians smear their faces and hands with
some kind of sticky stuff that keeps the mosquitoes from reaching their
flesh.But they had something to talk about besides the Indians of Alaska, for
the surprises around them furnished topics for conversation.Exploring the place, they found it well stocked with provisions, which
caused them all to feel delighted."It will be all right if we are able to get out of the scrape," said
Scotch.Barney built a fire, while Frank prepared to make bread and cook supper,
having found everything necessary for the accomplishment of the task.The professor stripped off his outer garments, wrung the water out of
them, and hung them up before the fire to dry.They made themselves as comfortable as possible, and night came on,
finding them in a much better frame of mind than they had expected to
be.Frank succeeded in baking some bread in the stone oven.He found
coffee, and a pot bubbled on the coals, sending out an odor that made
the trio feel ravenous.There were candles in abundance, and two of them were lighted.Then,
when everything was ready, they sat down to the table and enjoyed a
supper that put them in the best of moods.The door of the hut was left open, and the light shone out upon the
overturned canoe and the dark water beyond.After supper they cleaned and dried the rifles and shotgun.laughed Frank; "this is a regular picnic!I'm glad we took
the wrong course, and came here!""You may change your tune before we get out," said the professor, whose
trousers were dry, and who was now feeling of his coat to see how that
was coming on."Don't croak, profissor," advised Barney."You're th' firrust mon Oi
iver saw thot wuz bound ter drown himsilf in thray fate av wather."Oh, laugh, laugh," snapped the little man, fiercely."I'll get even
with you for that some time!After supper they lay around and took things easy.Barney and Frank told
stories till it was time to go to bed, and they finally turned in, first
having barred the door and made sure the windows were securely fastened.They soon slept, but they were not to rest quietly through the night.Other mysterious things were soon to follow those of the day.The boys leaped to their feet, and the professor came tearing out of the
bedroom, ran into the table, which he overturned with a great clatter of
dishes, reeled backward, and sat down heavily on the floor, where he
rubbed his eyes, and muttered:

"I thought that fire engine was going to run me down before I could get
out of the way.""Who ever heard of a fire engine
in the heart of the Florida Everglades?""Oi herrud th' gong," declared Barney."I heard something that sounded like a fire gong," admitted Frank."Pwhat was it, Oi dunno?""It seemed to come from beneath the head of the bed in there," said
Scotch."An' Oi thought I herrud it under me couch out here," gurgled Barney."We will light a candle, and look around," said Frank.A candle was lighted, and they looked for the cause of the midnight
alarm, but they found nothing that explained the mystery."It's afther gettin' away from here we'd
better be, mark me worrud.""It's spooks there be around this place, ur Oi'm mistaken!""Oh, I've heard enough about spooks!The professor was silent, but he shook his head in a very mysterious
manner, as if he thought a great many things he did not care to speak
about.They had been thoroughly awakened, but, after a time, failing to
discover what had aroused them, they decided to return to bed.Five minutes after they lay down, Frank and the professor were brought
to their feet by a wild howl and a thud.They rushed out of the bedroom,
and nearly fell over Barney, who was lying in the middle of the floor,
at least eight feet from the couch.palpitated the Irish lad, thickly."Oi wur jist beginning to get slapy whin something grabbed me an' threw
me clan out here in th' middle av th' room.""Oi'll swear to it, Frankie--Oi'll swear on a stack av Boibles.""You dreamed it, Barney; that's what's the matter.""Nivver a drame, me b'y, fer Oi wasn't aslape at all, at all.""But you may have been asleep, for you say you were beginning to get
sleepy."Oi dunno about thot, Frankie.Oi'm incloined to belave th' Ould B'y's
around, so Oi am.""Nivver a bit will Oi troy to slape on thot couch again th' noight, me
b'y.Oi'll shtay roight here on th' flure.""Sleep where you like, but keep still.Frank was somewhat nettled by these frequent interruptions of his rest,
and he was more than tempted to give Barney cause to believe the hut was
really haunted, for he was an expert ventriloquist, and he could have
indulged in a great deal of sport with the Irish boy.But other things were soon to take up their attention.While they were
talking a strange humming arose on every side and seemed to fill the
entire hut.At first, it was like a swarm of bees, but it grew louder
and louder till it threatened to swell into a roar.Professor Scotch was nearly frightened out of his wits.he shrieked, making a wild dash for the
door, which he flung wide open.But the professor did not rush out of the cabin.Instead, he flung up
his hands, staggered backward, and nearly fell to the floor.he faintly gasped, clutching at empty air for
support.Frank sprang forward, catching and steadying the professor.Sure enough, on the dark surface of the water, directly in front of the
hut, lay the mysterious canoe.And now this singular craft was illuminated from stem to stern by a
soft, white light that showed its outlines plainly."Sint Patherick presarve us!""I am getting tired of being chased around by a canoe!"said Frank, in
disgust, as he hastily sought one of the rifles."Av yer do, our goose is cooked!"Frank threw a fresh cartridge into the rifle, and turned toward the open
door, his mind fully made up.And then, to the profound amazement of all three, seated in the canoe
there seemed to be an old man, with white hair and long, white beard.The soft, white light seemed to come from every part of his person, as
it came from the canoe.Frank Merriwell paused, with the rifle partly lifted."It's th' spook himsilf!"gasped Barney, covering his face with his
hands, and clinging to the professor."For mercy's sake, don't shoot,
Frank!Frank was startled and astonished, but he was determined not to lose his
nerve, no matter what happened.The man in the canoe seemed to be looking directly toward the cabin.He
slowly lifted one hand, and pointed away across the Everglades, at the
same time motioning with the other hand, as if for them to go in that
direction."I'll just send a bullet over his head, to see what he thinks of it,"
said Frank, softly, lifting the rifle.Canoe and man disappeared in the twinkling of an eye!The trio in the hut gasped and rubbed their eyes."An' now Oi suppose ye'll say it wur no ghost?"It was extremely dark beneath the shadow of the cypress trees, and not a
sign of the mysterious canoe could they see."It is evident he did not care to have me send a bullet whizzing past
his ears," laughed Frank, who did not seem in the least disturbed.demanded Professor Scotch, in a shaking
tone of voice.Frank's hand fell on the professor's arm, and the three listened
intently, hearing something that gave them no little surprise.From far away through the night came the sound of hoarse voices singing
a wild, doleful song."Pwhat the Ould Nick does thot mane?""Let's see if we can understand the words
they are singing."We sailed away from Gloucester Bay,
      And the wind was in the west, yo ho!And her cargo was some New England rum;
      Our grog it was made of the best, yo ho!""A sailor's song," decided Frank, "and those are sailors who are
singing.We are not alone in the Everglades.""They're all drunk," declared the professor."You can tell that by the
sound of their voices."They're a blamed soight betther than none, fer it's loikely they know
th' way out av this blissed swamp," said Barney."They may bub-bub-be pup-pup-pup-pirates!""What sticks me," said Frank, "is how a party of sailors ever made their
way in here, for we are miles upon miles from the coast."Are ye fer takin' a look at th' loikes av thim, Frankie?""I am not going near those ruffianly and bloodthirsty pirates.""Then you may stay here with the spooks, while Barney and I go."This was altogether too much for the professor, and, when he found they
really intended to go, he gave in.Frank loaded the rifles and the shotgun, and took along his bow and
arrows, even though Barney made sport of him for bothering with the
last.They slipped the canoe into the water, and, directed by Frank, the
professor succeeded in getting in without upsetting the frail affair."Oi hope we won't run inther the ghost," uttered the Irish boy."The sound of that singing comes from the direction in which the old man
seemed to point," said Frank.The singing continued, sometimes sinking to a low, droning sound,
sometimes rising to a wild wail that sounded weirdly over the marshland."Ready," said Frank, and the canoe slipped silently over the dark
surface of the water course.The singing ceased after a time, but they were still guided by the sound
of wrangling voices."This is tut-tut-terrible!"Suddenly the sound of a pistol shot came over the rushes, followed by a
feminine shriek of pain or terror!As soon as he
could recover, Frank asked:

"Did you hear that?""It sounded very much like the voice of a woman or girl," said Professor
Scotch, who was so amazed that he forgot for the moment that he was
scared."That's what it was," declared Frank; "and it means that our aid is
needed in that quarter at once.""There's no telling
what kind of a gang we may run into."grated Barney Mulloy, quivering with eagerness."There's a female in nade av hilp."directed Frank, giving utterance to his old maxim.The professor was too agitated to handle a paddle, so the task of
propelling the canoe fell to the boys, who sent it skimming over the
water, Frank watching out for snags.In a moment the water course swept round to the left, and they soon saw
the light of a fire gleaming through the rushes.The sounds of a conflict continued, telling them that the quarrel was
still on, and aiding them in forming their course.In a moment they came in full view of the camp-fire, by the light of
which they saw several struggling, swaying figures.Frank's keen eyes seemed to take in everything at one sweeping glance.Six men and a girl were revealed by the light of the fire.Five of the
men were engaged in a fierce battle, while the sixth was bound, in a
standing position, to the trunk of a tree.The girl, with her hands bound behind her back, was standing near the
man who was tied to the tree, and the firelight fell fairly on the faces
of man and girl.A low exclamation of the utmost astonishment broke from Frank's lips."It can't be--it is an impossibility!""Pwhat is it, me b'y?"That is Captain Justin Bellwood,
whose vessel was lost in the storm off Fardale coast!"An' th' girrul is----"

"Elsie Bellwood, his daughter!""Th' wan you saved from th' foire, Frankie?""Captain Bellwood
has a new vessel, and he would not be here."But how----"

"There has been some kind of trouble, and they are captives--that is
plain enough.Those men are sailors--Captain Bellwood's sailors!It's
likely there has been a mutiny."We must land while those ruffians are fighting.If
we can get ashore, we'll set the captain free, and I fancy we'll be able
to hold our own with those ruffians, desperate wretches though they
are.""Perhaps they will kill each other,
and then our part will be easy."Frank was not for waiting, but, at that moment, something happened that
caused him to change his plan immediately.The fighting ruffians were using knives in a deadly way, and one man,
bleeding from many wounds, fell exhausted to the ground.Another, who
seemed to be this one's comrade, tore himself from the other three,
leaped to the girl, caught her in his arms, and held her in front of
him, so that her body shielded his.Then, pointing a revolver over her
shoulder, he snarled:

"Come on, and I'll bore the three of ye!You can't shoot me, Gage,
unless you kill ther gal!"The youngest one of the party, a mere boy, but a fellow with the air of
a desperado, stepped to the front, saying swiftly:

"If you don't drop that girl, Jaggers, you'll leave your carcass in this
swamp!Frank clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from uttering a great shout
of amazement.The next moment he panted:

"This is fate!by the eternal skies, that is Leslie Gage,
my worst enemy at Fardale Academy, and the fellow who ran away to keep
from being expelled.It was reported that he had gone to sea.""Ye're roight, Frankie," agreed the no less excited Irish lad."It's
thot skunk, an' no mistake!""It is Leslie Gage," agreed the professor."He was ever a bad boy, but I
did not think he would come to this.""An' Oi always thought he would come to some bad ind.It wur thot
spalpane thot troied to run Frank through with a sharpened foil wan
toime whin they wur fencing.He had black murder in his hearrut thin,
an' it's not loikely th' whilp has grown inny betther since."The man with the girl laughed defiantly, retorting:

"You talk big, Gage, but it won't work with me.I hold the best hand
just at present, and you'll have to come to terms."You don't dare shoot," returned the young desperado, as he took still
another step toward the sailor.In a moment the man placed the muzzle of the revolver against the temple
of the helpless girl, fiercely declaring:

"If you come another inch, I'll blow her brains out!"I will fix him, or
my name is not Merriwell!"He drew an arrow from the quiver, and fitted the notch to the
bow-string.His nerves were steady, and he was determined.He waited
till the man had removed the muzzle of the weapon from the girl's
temple, and then he lifted the bow.They longed to check
Frank, but dared not speak for fear of causing him to waver and send the
arrow at the girl.The bow was bent, the line was taut, the arrow was drawn to the head,
and then----

Twang!The arrow sped through the air, but it was too dark for them to
follow its flight with their eyes.With their hearts in their mouths,
they awaited the result.Of a sudden, the ruffian uttered a cry of pain, released his hold on the
girl, and fell heavily to the ground.The firelight showed the arrow sticking in his shoulder.grunted a voice close beside the canoe."Very good shot for a
white boy.The trio turned in amazement and alarm, and, within three feet of them,
they saw a shadowy canoe that contained a shadowy figure.There was but
one person in the strange canoe, and he immediately added:

"There is no need to fear Socato, the Seminole, for he will not harm
you.He is the friend of all good white men."It was an Indian, a Seminole, belonging to the remnant of the once great
nation that peopled the Florida peninsula.Frank realized this in a
moment, and, knowing the Seminoles were harmless when well treated, felt
no further alarm.The Indian had paddled with the utmost silence to their side, while they
were watching what was taking place on shore.The arrow had produced consternation in the camp.The fellow who was
wounded tried to draw it from his shoulder, groaning:

"This is not a fair deal!Give me a fair show, and I'll fight you all!"The two canoes were beyond the circle of firelight, so they could not be
seen from the shore.Gage's two companions were overcome with terror."We've been attacked
by a band of savages!"Gage spoke a few words in a low tone, and then sprang over the prostrate
form of the man who had been stricken down by the arrow, grasped the
girl, and retreated into the darkness.His companions also scudded
swiftly beyond the firelight, leaving Captain Bellwood still bound to
the tree, while one man lay dead on the ground, and another had an arrow
in his shoulder.Close to Frank's ear the voice of Socato the Seminole sounded:

"Light bother them.They git in the dark and see us from the shore.gasped Professor Scotch, "I don't care to stay here,
and have them shoot at me!""Of course we will pay," hastily answered Frank."Can you aid us in
saving her?If you can, you shall be----"

"Socato save her.White man and two boys go back to cabin of Great White
Phantom.Stay there, and Socato come with the girl."Oi don't loike thot," declared Barney."Oi'd loike to take a
hand in th' rescue mesilf.""Socato can do better alone," asserted the Seminole.But Frank was not inclined to desert Elsie Bellwood in her hour of
trouble, and he said:

"Socato, you must take me with you.Professor, you and Barney go back to
the hut, and stay there till we come."The Indian hesitated, and then said:

"If white boy can shoot so well with the bow and arrow, he may not be in
the way.I will take him, if he can step from one canoe to the other
without upsetting either.""That's easy," said Frank, as he deliberately and safely accomplished
the feat."Well done, white boy," complimented the strange Indian."Pass me one of those rifles," requested Frank."White boy better leave rifle; take bow and arrows," advised Socato."Rifle make noise; bow and arrow make no noise."Return to the hut, Barney, and stay there
till we show up.""But th' spook----"

"Hang the spook!We'll know where to find you, if you go there.""The Great White Phantom will not harm those who offer him no harm,"
declared the Indian."I am not so afraid of spooks as I am of---- Jumping Jupiter!"There was a flash of fire from the darkness on shore, the report of a
gun, and a bullet whirred through the air, cutting the professor's
speech short, and causing him to duck down into the canoe."Those fellows have located us," said Frank, swiftly.Socato's paddle dropped without a sound into the water, and the canoe
slid away into the night.The professor and Barney lost no time in moving, and it was well they
did so, for, a few seconds later, another shot came from the shore, and
the bullet skipped along the water just where the canoes had been.Frank trusted everything to Socato, even though he had never seen or
heard of the Seminole before.Something about the voice of the Indian
convinced the boy that he was honest, for all that his darkness was such
that Frank could not see his face and did not know how he looked.The Indian sent the canoe through the water with a speed and silence
that was a revelation to Frank Merriwell.The paddle made no sound, and
it seemed that the prow of the canoe scarcely raised a ripple, for all
that they were gliding along so swiftly.whispered Frank, observing that they were leaving
the camp-fire astern."If I didn't, I shouldn't be here.Socato take him round to place where we can come up
behind bad white men.The light of the camp-fire died out, and then, a few moments later,
another camp-fire seemed to glow across a strip of low land.What party is camped there--friends of yours, Socato?"We left that fire behind us, Socato.""And we have come round by the water till it is before us again."This was true, but the darkness had been so intense that Frank did not
see how their course was changing."I see how you mean to come up behind them," said the boy."You are
going to land and cross to their camp."Soon the rushes closed in on either side, and the Indian sent the canoe
twisting in and out amid their tall stalks like a creeping panther.He
seemed to know every inch of the way, and followed it as well as if it
were broad noonday.Frank's admiration for the fellow grew with each moment, and he felt
that he could, indeed, trust Socato."If we save that girl and the old man, you shall be well paid for the
job," declared the boy, feeling that it was well to dangle a reward
before the Indian's mental vision."It is good," was the whispered retort.In a few moments they crept through the rushes till the canoe lay close
to a bank, and the Indian directed Frank to get out.The camp-fire could not be seen from that position, but the boy well
knew it was not far away.Taking his bow, with the quiver of arrows slung to his back, the lad
left the canoe, being followed immediately by the Seminole, who lifted
the prow of the frail craft out upon the bank, and then led the way.Passing round a thick mass of reeds, they soon reached a position where
they could see the camp-fire and the moving forms of the sailors.Just
as they reached this position, Leslie Gage was seen to dash up to the
fire and kick the burning brands in various directions."He has done that so that the firelight might not reveal them to us,"
thought Frank."They still believe us near, although they know not where
we are."Crouching and creeping, Socato led the way, and Frank followed closely,
wondering what scheme the Indian could have in his head, yet trusting
everything to his sagacity.In a short time they were near enough to hear the conversation of the
bewildered and alarmed sailors.The men were certain a band of savages
were close at hand, for they did not dream that the arrow which had
dropped Jaggers was fired by the hand of a white person."The sooner we get away from here, the better it will be for us,"
declared Leslie Gage."We'll have to get away in the boats," said a grizzled
villainous-looking, one-eyed old sailor, who was known as Ben Bowsprit."Fo' de Lawd's sake!"gasped the third sailor, who was a <DW64>, called
Black Tom; "how's we gwine to run right out dar whar de critter am dat
fired de arrer inter Jack Jaggers?""The 'critter' doesn't seem to be there any longer," assured Gage."Those two shots must have frightened him away.""That's right," agreed Bowsprit."This has been an unlucky stop fer us,
mates.Tomlinson is dead, an' Jaggers----"

"I ain't dead, but I'm bleedin', bleedin', bleedin'!"moaned the fellow
who had been hit by Frank's arrow."There's a big tear in my shoulder,
an' I'm afeared I've made my last cruise.""It serves you right," came harshly from the boy leader of the ruffianly
crew."Tomlinson attempted to set himself up as head of this crew--as
captain over me.All the time, you knew I was the leader
in every move we have made.""And a pretty pass you have led us to!""Where's the money you said the captain had stored away?Where's the
reward we'd receive for the captain alive and well?We turned mutineers
at your instigation, and what have we made of it?We've set the law
agin' us, an' here we are.The _Bonny Elsie_ has gone up in smoke----"

"Through the carelessness of a lot of drunken fools!"But for that, we wouldn't be here now,
hiding from officers of the law.""Well, here we are," growled Ben Bowsprit, "an' shiver my timbers if we
seem able to get out of this howlin' swamp!The more we try, the more we
seem ter git lost.""Fo' goodness, be yo' gwine to stan' roun' an' chin, an' chin, an'
chin?""The fire's out, and we can't be seen," spoke Gage, swiftly, in a low
tone.You two are to take the old man in one; I'll
take the girl in the other.""It's the gal you've cared fer all the time," cried Jaggers, madly."It
was for her you led us into this scrape."You can't make me shut up, Gage.""Well, you'll have a chance to talk to yourself and Tomlinson before
long."I saw you strike the
blow, and I'll swear to that, my hearty!""It's not likely you'll be given a chance to swear to it, Jaggers.I may
have killed him, but it was in self-defense.He was doing his best to
get his knife into me.""Yes, we was tryin' to finish you," admitted Jaggers."With you out of
the way, Tomlinson would have been cap'n, and I first mate.You've kept
your eyes on the gal all the time.I don't believe you thought the cap'n
had money at all.It was to get the gal you led us into this business.She'd snubbed you--said she despised you, and you made up your mind to
carry her off against her will.""If that was my game, you must confess I succeeded very well.But I
can't waste more time talking to you.Put Cap'n Bellwood in the larger, and look out for
him."Boy though he was, Gage had resolved
to become a leader of men, and he had succeeded.The girl, quite overcome, was prostrate at the feet of her father, who
was bound to the cypress tree.There was a look of pain and despair on the face of the old captain.His
heart bled as he looked down at his wretched daughter, and he groaned:

"Merciful Heaven!It were better that she
should die than remain in the power of that young villain!""What are you muttering about, old man?"coarsely demanded Gage, as he
bent to lift the girl."You seem to be muttering to yourself the greater
part of the time.""Do you
think you can escape the retribution that pursues all such dastardly
creatures as you?"I have found out that the goody-good people do
not always come out on top in this world.Besides that, it's too late
for me to turn back now.I started wrong at school, and I have been
going wrong ever since.It's natural for me; I can't help it.""If you harm her, may the wrath of Heaven fall on your head!"I will be very tender and considerate with her.He attempted to lift her to her feet, but she drew from him, shuddering
and screaming wildly:

"Don't touch me!""Now, don't be a little fool!""You make me sick with
your tantrums!But she screamed the louder, seeming to stand in the utmost terror of
him.With a savage exclamation, Gage tore off his coat and wrapped it about
the girl's head so that her cries were smothered."Perhaps that will keep you still a bit!"he snapped, catching her up in
his arms, and bearing her to the smaller boat, in which he carefully
placed her.As her hands were bound behind her, she could not
remove the coat from about her head, and she sat as he placed her, with
it enveloping her nearly to the waist.Somebody
take Tomlinson's weapons.He may need them when we
are gone.""Don't leave me here to die alone!"piteously pleaded the wounded
sailor."I'm pretty well gone now, but I don't want to be left here
alone!"Gage left the small boat for a moment, and approached the spot where the
pleading wretch lay."Jaggers," he said, "it's the fate you deserve.You agreed to stand by
me, but you went back on your oath, and tried to kill me.""And now you're going to leave me here to bleed to death or starve?"The tables are turned on you, my fine fellow.""Well, I'm sure you won't leave me."Jaggers flung up his hand, from which a spout of flame seemed to leap,
and the report of a pistol sounded over the marsh.Leslie Gage fell in a heap to the ground.Well, he is dead already, for I shot
him through the brain!""That's where you are mistaken, Jaggers," said the cool voice of the
boyish leader of the mutineers."I saw your move, saw the revolver, and
dropped in time to avoid the bullet."A snarl of baffled fury came from the lips of the wounded sailor."See if you can dodge this
bullet!"He would have fired again, but Gage leaped forward in the darkness,
kicked swiftly and accurately, and sent the revolver spinning from the
man's hand."I did mean to have
you taken away, and I was talking to torment you.Now you will stay
here--and die like a dog!"He turned from Jaggers, and hurried back to the boat, in which that
muffled figure silently sat.Captain Bellwood had been released from the tree, and marched to the
other boat, in which he now sat, bound and helpless.They pushed off, settled into their seats, and began rowing.Gage was not long in following, but he wondered at the silence of the
girl who sat in the stern.It could not be that she had fainted, for she
remained in an upright position."Any way to get out of this," was the answer."We will find another
place to camp, but I want to get away from this spot."Not a sound came from beneath the muffled coat."It must be close," thought Gage."I wonder if she can breathe all
right.At last, finding he could keep up with his companions without trouble,
and knowing he would have very little difficulty in overtaking them,
Gage drew in his oars and slipped back toward the muffled figure in the
stern."You must not think too hard of me, Miss Bellwood," he said, pleadingly.I love you far too much for that,
Elsie."He could have sworn that the sound which came from the muffling folds of
the coat was like a smothered laugh, but he knew she was not laughing at
him."I have been wicked and desperate," he went on; "but I was driven to the
life I have led.When I shipped on
your father's vessel it was because I had seen you and knew you were to
be along on the cruise.I loved you at first sight, and I vowed that I
would reform and do better if you loved me in return, Elsie."He was speaking swiftly in a low tone, and his voice betrayed his
earnestness.He passed an arm around the muffled figure, feeling it
quiver within his grasp, and then he continued:

"You did not take kindly to me, but I persisted.Then you repulsed
me--told me you despised me, and that made me desperate.I swore I would
have you, Elsie.Then came the mutiny and the burning of the vessel.Now
we are here, and you are with me.Elsie, you know not how I love you!I
have become an outcast, an outlaw--all for your sake!It must be that he was beginning to break down that icy barrier.She
realized her position, and she would be reasonable."Do not scream, Elsie--do not draw away, darling.Say that you will love
me a little--just a little!"He pulled the coat away, and something came out of the folds and touched
cold and chilling against his forehead.commanded a voice that was full of chuckling laughter."If
you chirp, I'll have to blow the roof of your head off, Gage!"Leslie Gage caught his breath and nearly collapsed into the bottom of
the boat.Indeed, he would have fallen had not a strong hand fastened on
his collar and held him."I don't want to shoot you, Gage," whispered the cool voice."I don't
feel like that, even though you did attempt to take my life once or
twice in the past.You have made me very good natured within the past
few moments.How gently you murmured, 'Do not draw
away, darling; say that you love me a little--just a little!'Really, Gage, you gave me such amusement that I am more than
satisfied with this little adventure.""Still, I can't
place you.""Indeed, you are forgetful, Gage.But it is rather dark, and I don't
suppose you expected to see me here."And you are--Frank Merriwell!"Gage would have shouted the name in his amazement, but Frank's fingers
suddenly closed on the fellow's throat and held back the sound in a
great measure."Now you have guessed it," chuckled Frank.I can forgive you
for the past since you have provided me with so much amusement to-night.How you urged me to learn to love you!But that's too much, Gage; I can
never learn to do that."Leslie ground his teeth, but he was still overcome with unutterable
amazement and wonder.That Frank Merriwell, whom he hated, should appear
there at night in the wilds of the Florida Everglades was like a
miracle.Had some magic of that wild and
dreary region changed her into Frank Merriwell?Little wonder that Gage was dazed and helpless."How in the name of the Evil One did you come here?"he finally asked,
recovering slightly from his stupor.It was the same old merry, boyish laugh
that Gage had heard so often at Fardale, and it filled him with intense
anger, as it had in the days of old."I know you did not expect to see me," murmured Frank, still laughing."I assure you that the Evil One had nothing to do with my appearance
here."I left her in the boat a few moments."I will let you speculate over that question for a while, my fine
fellow.In the meantime, I fancy it will be a good idea to tie you up so
you will not make any trouble.Remember I have a revolver handy, and I
promise that I'll use it if you kick up a row."At this moment, one of the sailors in the other boat called:

"Hello, there, Mr.Gage was tempted to shout for help, but the muzzle of the cold weapon
that touched his forehead froze his tongue to silence.Ben Bowsprit was growing impatient and wondering why Leslie did not
answer.It had occurred to the old tar that it was possible the boy had
deserted them.The voice of Black Tom was heard to say:

"He oughter be right near by us, Ben.'Smighty strange dat feller don'
seem to answer nohow.""We'll pull back, my hearty, and
take a look for our gay cap'n."They were coming back, and Gage was still unbound, although a captive in
Frank Merriwell's clutch.There would not be enough time to bind Gage and
get away.Something must be done to prevent the two sailors from turning
about and rowing back."Gage," whispered Frank, swiftly, "you must answer them.Say, it's all
right, boys; I'm coming right along."Gage hesitated, the longing to shout for help again grasping him.hissed Frank, and the muzzle of the revolver seemed
to bore into Gage's forehead, as if the bullet longed to seek his brain.With a mental curse on the black luck, Gage uttered the words as his
captor had ordered, although they seemed to come chokingly from his
throat."Well, what are ye doing back there so long?""Tell them you're making love," chuckled Frank, who seemed to be hugely
enjoying the affair, to the unspeakable rage of his captive."Ask them
if they don't intend to give you a show at all."Gage did as directed, causing Bowsprit to laugh hoarsely.cackled the old sailor, in the darkness."But
this is a poor time to spend in love-makin', cap'n.Wait till we git
settled down ag'in.Tom an' me'll agree not ter watch ye.""Say, all right; go on," instructed Frank, and Gage did so.In a few seconds, the sound of oars were heard, indicating that the
sailors were obeying instructions.At that moment, while Frank was listening to this sound, Gage believed
his opportunity had arrived, and, being utterly desperate, the young
rascal knocked aside Frank's hand, gave a wild shout, leaped to his
feet, and plunged headlong into the water.It was done swiftly--too swiftly for Frank to shoot, if he had intended
such a thing.But Frank Merriwell had no desire to shoot his former
schoolmate, even though Leslie Gage had become a hardened and desperate
criminal, and so, having broken away, the youthful leader of the
mutineers stood in no danger of being harmed.Frank and Socato had been close at hand when Gage placed Elsie Bellwood
in the boat, and barely was the girl left alone before she was removed
by the Seminole, in whose arms she lay limp and unconscious, having
swooned at last.Then it was that a desire to capture Gage and a wild longing to give the
fellow a paralyzing surprise seized upon Frank."Socato," he whispered, "I am going to trust you to take that girl to
the hut where my friends are to be found.Remember that you shall be
well paid; I give you my word of honor as to that."Have a little racket on my own hook," was the reply."If I lose my
bearings and can't find the hut, I will fire five shots into the air
from my revolver.Have one of my friends answer in a similar manner."Frank took the coat; stepped into the boat, watched till Gage was
approaching, and then muffled his head, sitting in the place where Elsie
had been left.In the meantime, the Seminole was bearing the girl swiftly and silently
away.Thus it came about that Gage made love to Frank Merriwell, instead of
the fair captive he believed was muffled by the coat.When Gage plunged into the water, the small boat rocked and came near
upsetting, but did not go over.But the fellow's cry and the splash had brought the sailors to a halt,
and they soon called back:

"What's the matter?"I rather fancy it will be a good plan to make myself scarce in this
particular locality," muttered Frank.Gage swam under water for some distance, and then, coming to the
surface, he shouted to the men in the leading boat:

"Bowsprit, Black Tom, help!There is an enemy here,
but he is alone!"You will have a fine time
catching me.You have given me great amusement, Gage.I assure you that
I have been highly entertained by your company, and hereafter I shall
consider you an adept in the gentle art of making love."fiercely shouted Gage from the water."You are having your turn
now, but mine will soon come!""I have heard you talk like that before, Gage.It does not seem that you
have yet learned 'the way of the transgressor is hard.'""You'll learn better than to meddle with me!I have longed to meet you
again, Frank Merriwell, and I tell you now that one of us will not leave
this swamp alive!""This is not the first time you have made a promise that you were not
able to keep.Before I leave you, I have this to say: If Captain
Bellwood is harmed in the least, if he is not set at liberty with very
little delay, I'll never rest till you have received the punishment
which your crimes merit."Frank could hear the sailors rowing back, and he felt for the oars,
having no doubt that he would be able to escape them with ease, aided by
the darkness.When Gage stopped rowing to make love to the supposed Elsie he had left
the oars in the rowlocks, drawing them in and laying them across the
boat.In the violent rocking of the boat when the fellow leaped
overboard one of the oars had been lost.Frank was left with a single oar, and his enemies were bearing down upon
him with great swiftness."I wonder if there's a chance to scull this boat?"he coolly speculated,
as he hastened to the stern and made a swift examination.To his satisfaction and relief, he found there was, and the remaining
oar was quickly put to use.Even then Frank felt confident that he would be able to avoid his
enemies in the darkness that lay deep and dense upon the great swamp.He
could hear them rowing, and he managed to skull the light boat along
without making much noise.He did not mind that Gage had escaped; in fact, he was relieved to get
rid of the fellow, although it had been his intention to hold him as
hostage for Captain Bellwood.It was the desire for adventure that had led Frank into the affair, and,
now that it was over so far as surprising Gage was concerned, he was
satisfied to get away quietly.He could hear the sailors calling Gage, who answered from the water, and
he knew they would stop to pick the fellow up, which would give our hero
a still better show of getting away.All this took place, and Frank was so well hidden by the darkness that
there was not one chance in a thousand of being troubled by the
ruffianly crew when another astonishing thing happened.From a point amid the tall rushes a powerful white light gleamed out and
fell full and fair upon the small boat and its single occupant,
revealing Frank as plainly as if by the glare of midday sunlight."What is the meaning of this,
I would like to know?"He was so astonished that he nearly dropped the oar.The sailors were astonished, but the light showed them distinctly, and
Gage snarled."Give me your pistol, Bowsprit!He snatched the weapon from the old tar's hand, took hasty aim, and
fired.Frank Merriwell was seen to fling up his arms and fall heavily into the
bottom of the boat!grated the triumphant young rascal, flourishing the revolver.The mysterious light vanished in the twinkling of an eye, but it had
shone long enough for Gage to do his dastardly work.The sailors were alarmed by the light, and wished to row away; but Gage
raved at them, ordering them to pull down toward the spot where the
other boat lay.After a time, the men recovered enough to do as directed, and the
smaller boat was soon found, rocking lightly on the surface.Running alongside, Gage reached over into the small boat, and his hand
found the boy who was stretched in the bottom.cried the young rascal, gleefully."I'll bet anything I
put the bullet straight through his heart!"And then, as if his own words had brought a sense of it all to him, he
suddenly shuddered with horror, faintly muttering:

"That was murder!"The horror grew upon him rapidly, and he began to wonder that he had
felt delight when he saw Frank Merriwell fall.The shooting had been the
impulse of the moment, and, now that it was done and he realized what it
meant, he would have given much to recall that bullet."I swore that one of us should not leave this
swamp alive, and my oath will not be broken.I hated Frank Merriwell the
first time I saw him, and I have hated him ever since.Now he is out of
my way, and he will never cross my path again."There was a slight stir in the small boat, followed by something like a
gasping moan."He don't seem to be dead yet, cap'n," said Ben Bowsprit."I guess your
aim wasn't as good as you thought.""Oh, I don't think he'll recover very fast," said the youthful rascal,
harshly.He rose and stepped over into the smaller boat."I want to take a look at the chap."You'll find I'm not dead yet!"returned a weak voice, and Frank
Merriwell sat up and grappled with Gage.A snarl of fury came from the lips of the boy desperado."You'll have to fight before you finish me!"But Merriwell seemed weak, and Gage did not find it difficult to handle
the lad at whom he had shot.He forced Frank down into the bottom of the
boat, and then called to his companions:

"Give me some of that line.A piece of rope was handed to him, and Black Tom stepped into the boat
to aid him.Between them, they succeeded in making Frank fast, for the
boy's struggles were weak, at best."At Fardale Frank
Merriwell triumphed.He disgraced me, and I was forced to fly from the
school.""You disgraced yourself," declared the defiant captive."You cheated at
cards--you fleeced your schoolmates."Oh, yes, I was rather flip with the papers,
and I should not have been detected but for you, Merriwell.When I was
exposed, I knew I would be shunned by all the fellows in school, and so
I ran away.But I did not forget who brought the disgrace about, and I
knew we should meet some time, Merriwell.How you came here
I do not know, and why my bullet did not kill you is more than I can
understand.""It would have killed me but for a locket and picture in my pocket,"
returned Frank."It struck the locket, and that saved me; but the shock
robbed me of strength--it must have robbed me of consciousness for a
moment.""It would have been just as well for you if the locket had not stopped
the bullet," declared Gage, fiercely."By that I presume you mean that you intend to murder me anyway?""I have sworn that one of us shall never leave this swamp alive.""Go ahead, Gage," came coolly from the lips of the captive."Luck seems
to have turned your way.Make the most of it while you have an
opportunity.""We can't spend time in gabbing here," came nervously from Bowsprit."Yes," put in Black Tom; "fo' de Lawd's sake, le's get away before dat
light shine some mo'!""That's right," said the old tar."Some things happen in this swamp that
no human being can account for."Gage was ready enough to get away, and they were soon pulling onward
again, with Frank Merriwell, bound and helpless, in the bottom of the
smaller boat.For nearly an hour they rowed, and then they succeeded in finding some
dry, solid land where they could camp beneath the tall, black trees.They were so overcome with alarm that they did not venture to build a
fire, for all that Gage was shivering in his wet clothes.Leslie was still puzzling over Frank Merriwell's astonishing appearance,
and he tried to question Frank concerning it, but he could obtain but
little satisfaction from the boy he hated.Away to the west stretched the Everglades, while to the north and the
east lay the dismal cypress swamps.The party seemed quite alone in the heart of the desolate region.Leslie started out to explore the strip of elevated land upon which they
had passed the night, and he found it stretched back into the woods,
where lay great stagnant pools of water and where grew all kinds of
strange plants and vines.Gage had been from the camp about thirty minutes when he came running
back, his face pale, and a fierce look in his eyes.cried Bowsprit, with an attempt at cheerfulness.What is it you have heard about, my hearty?""The serpent vine," answered Gage, wildly.I did not believe there was such a thing, but it tangled
my feet, it tried to twine about my legs, and I saw the little red
flowers opening and shutting like the lips of devils.""Fo' de Lawd's sake!de boss hab gone stark, starin' mad!"cried Black
Tom, staring at Leslie with bulging eyes."But I have thought of a way to
dispose of Frank Merriwell.Frank had listened to all this, and he noted that Gage actually seemed
like a maniac.Captain Bellwood, securely bound, was near Frank, to whom he now spoke:

"God pity you, my lad!He was bad enough before, but he seems to have
gone mad."Well, if that's to be the end of me, I'll have to take my medicine,"
came grimly from the lips of the undaunted boy captive.She is with friends of mine, and they will
fight for her as long as they are able to draw a breath."Now I care not if these wretches murder me!""I scarcely think they will murder you, captain.They have nothing in
particular against you; but Gage hates me most bitterly."snarled Leslie, who had overheard Frank's last words."I do hate you, and my hatred seems to have increased tenfold since last
night.I have been thinking--thinking how you have baffled me at every
turn whenever we have come together.I have decided that you are my evil
genius, and that I shall never have any luck as long as you live.One of us will not leave this swamp alive, and you
will be that one!""Go ahead with the funeral," said Frank, stoutly."If you have made up
your mind to murder me, I can't help myself; but one thing is
sure--you'll not hear me beg.""Wait till you know what your fate is to be.Boys, set his feet free,
and then follow me, with him between you."The cords which held Frank's feet were released, and he was lifted to a
standing position.Then he was marched along after Gage, who led the
way.Into the woods he was marched, and finally Gage came to a halt,
motioning for the others to stop.he cried, pointing; "there is the serpent vine!"On the ground before them, lay a mass of greenish vines, blossoming over
with a dark red flower.Harmless enough they looked, but, as Gage drew a
little nearer, they suddenly seemed to come to life, and they began
reaching toward his feet, twisting, squirming, undulating like a mass of
serpents.shouted Leslie--"there is the vine that feeds on flesh and
blood!See--see how it reached for my feet!It longs to grasp me, to
draw me into its folds, to twine about my body, my neck, to strangle
me!"The sailors shuddered and drew back, while Frank Merriwell's face was
very pale."It did fasten upon me," Gage continued."If I had not been ready and
quick with my knife, it would have drawn me into its deadly embrace.I
managed to cut myself free and escape."Then he turned to Frank, and the dancing light in his eyes was not a
light of sanity."Merriwell," he said, "the serpent vine will end your life, and you'll
never bother me any more!"He leaped forward and clutched the helpless captive, screaming:

"Thus I keep my promise!"And he flung Frank headlong into the clutch of the writhing vine!With his hands bound behind his back, unable to help himself, Frank
reeled forward into the embrace of the deadly vine, each branch of which
was twisting, curling, squirming like the arms of an octopus.He nearly plunged forward upon his face, but managed to recover and keep
on his feet.He felt the vine whip about his legs and fasten there tenaciously, felt
it twist and twine and crawl like a mass of serpents, and he knew he was
in the grasp of the frightful plant which till that hour he had ever
believed a creation of some romancer's feverish fancy.A great horror seemed to come upon him and benumb
his body and his senses.He could feel the horrid vines climbing and coiling about him, and he
was helpless to struggle and tear them away.He knew they were mounting
to his neck, where they would curl about his throat and choke the breath
of life from his body.It was a fearful fate--a terrible death.And there seemed no possible
way of escaping.Higher and higher climbed the vine, swaying and squirming, the blood-red
flowers opening and closing like lips of a vampire that thirsted for his
blood.A look of horror was frozen on Frank's face.His eyes bulged from his
head, and his lips were drawn back from his teeth.He did not cry out,
he did not seem to breathe, but he appeared to be turned to stone in the
grasp of the deadly plant.It was a dreadful sight, and the two sailors, rough and wicked men
though they were, were overcome by the spectacle.Shuddering and
gasping, they turned away.For the first time, Gage seemed to fully realize what he had done.He
covered his eyes with his hand and staggered backward, uttering a low,
groaning sound.Merriwell's staring eyes seemed fastened straight upon him with that
fearful stare, and the thought flashed through the mind of the wretched
boy that he should never forget those eyes."They will haunt me as long as I live!"Already he was seized by the pangs of remorse.Once more he looked at Frank, and once more those staring eyes turned
his blood to ice water.Then, uttering shriek after shriek, Gage turned and fled through the
swamp, plunging through marshy places and jungles, falling, scrambling
up, leaping, staggering, gasping for breath, feeling those staring eyes
at his back, feeling that they would pursue him to his doom.Scarcely less agitated and overcome, Bowsprit and the <DW64> followed,
and Frank Merriwell was abandoned to his fate.Frank longed for the use of his hands to tear away those fiendish vines.It was a horrible thing to stand and let them creep up, up, up, till
they encircled his throat and strangled him to death.Through his mind flashed a picture of himself as he would stand there
with the vines drawing tighter and tighter about his throat and his face
growing blacker and blacker, his tongue hanging out, his eyes starting
from their sockets.He came near shrieking for help, but the thought that the cry must reach
the ears of Leslie Gage kept it back, enabled him to choke it down.He had declared that Gage should not hear him beg for mercy or aid.Not
even the serpent vine and all its horrors could make him forget that
vow.The little red flowers were getting nearer and nearer to his face, and
they were fluttering with eagerness.He felt a sucking, drawing,
stinging sensation on one of his wrists, and he believed one of those
fiendish vampire mouths had fastened there.He swayed his body, he tried to move his feet, but he seemed rooted to
the ground.He did not have the strength to drag himself from that fatal
spot and from the grasp of the vine.His senses were in a maze, and the whole
world was reeling and romping around him.The trees became a band of
giant demons, winking, blinking, grinning at him, flourishing their arms
in the air, and dancing gleefully on every side to the sound of wild
music that came from far away in the sky.Then a smaller demon darted out from amid the trees, rushed at him,
clutched him, slashed, slashed, slashed on every side of him, dragged at
his collar, and panted in his ear:

"White boy fight--try to git away!Was it a dream--was it an hallucination?He
tore at the clinging vines, he fought with all his remaining strength,
he struggled to get away from those clinging things.All the while that other figure was slashing and cutting with something
bright, while the vine writhed and hissed like serpents in agony.How it was accomplished Frank could never tell, but he felt himself
dragged free of the serpent vine, dragged beyond its deadly touch, and
he knew it was no dream that he was free!A black mist hung before his eyes, but he looked through it and faintly
murmured:

"Socato, you have saved me!""Yes, white boy," replied the voice of the Seminole, "I found you just
in time.A few moments more and you be a dead one.""That is true, Socato--that is true!I can never
pay you for what you have done!"In truth the Indian had appeared barely in time to rescue Frank from the
vine, and it had been a desperate and exhausting battle.In another
minute the vine would have accomplished its work."I hear white boy cry out, and I see him run from this way," explained
the Seminole.Sailor men follow, and then I
come to see what scare them so.You knew how to fight the vine--how to cut
it with your knife, and so you saved me.""We must git 'way from here soon as can," declared the Indian."Bad
white men may not come back, and they may come back.They may want to
see what has happen to white boy."Frank knew this was true, but for some time he was not able to get upon
his feet and walk.At length the Indian assisted him, and, leaning on
Socato's shoulder, he made his way along.Avoiding the place where the sailors were camped, the Seminole proceeded
directly to the spot where his canoe was hidden.Frank got in, and
Socato took the paddle, sending the light craft skimming over the water.Straight to the strange hut where Frank and his companions had stopped
the previous night they made their way.The sun was shining into the heart of the great Dismal Swamp, and Elsie
Bellwood was at the door to greet Frank Merriwell.Elsie held out both hands, and there was a welcome light in her eyes.It
seemed to Frank that she was far prettier than when he had last seen her
in Fardale."Frank, I am so glad to see you!"He caught her hands and held them, looking into her eyes.The color came
into her cheeks, and then she noted his rumpled appearance, saw that he
was very pale, and cried:

"What is it, Frank?Socato grunted in a knowing way, but said nothing."It is nothing, Miss Bellwood," assured the boy."I have been through a
little adventure, that's all.He felt her fingers trembling in his clasp, and an electric thrill ran
over him.He remembered that at their last parting she had said it were
far better they should never meet again; but fate had thrown them
together, and now--what?He longed to draw her to him, to kiss her, to tell her how happy he was
at finding her, but he restrained the impulse.Then the voice of Barney Mulloy called from within the hut:

"Phwat ye goin' to do me b'y--shtand out there th' rist av th' doay?Whoy don't yez come in, Oi dunno?""Come in, Frank--come in," cried Professor Scotch."We have been worried
to death over you.Thought you were lost in the Everglades, or had
fallen into the hands of the enemy.""Your second thought was correct," smiled Frank, as he entered the hut,
with Elsie at his side.shouted the Irish boy, in astonishment."Ye don't mane
to say thim spalpanes caught yez?""That's what they did, and they came near cooking me, too."Frank then related the adventures that had befallen him since he started
out on his own hook to give Leslie Gage a surprise.He told how Gage had
made love to him in the boat, and Barney shrieked with laughter.Then he
related what followed, and how his life had been saved by the locket he
carried, and the professor groaned with dismay.Following this, he
related his capture by Gage and how the young desperado flung him, with
his hands bound, into the clutch of the serpent vine.The narrative first amused and then thrilled his listeners.Finally they
were horrified and appalled by the peril through which he had passed."It's Satan's own scum thot Gage is!""Iver let
me get a crack at th' loike av him and see phwat will happen to th'
whilp!"Then Frank explained how he had been saved by Socato, and the Seminole
found himself the hero of the hour."Soc, ould b'y," cried Barney, "thot wur th' bist job ye iver did, an'
Oi'm proud av yez!Ye'll niver lose anything by thot thrick, ayther."roared the little professor, wiping his eyes.Then the Seminole had his hand shaken in a manner and with a heartiness
that astonished him greatly."That was nothing," he declared, "Socato hates the snake vine--fight it
any time.When all had been told and the party had recovered from the excitement
into which they had been thrown, Barney announced that breakfast was
waiting.Elsie, for all of her happiness at meeting Frank, was so troubled about
her father that she could eat very little.Socato ate hastily, and then announced that he would go out and see what
he could do about rescuing Captain Bellwood.Barney wished to go with the Seminole, but Socato declared that he could
do much better alone, and hurriedly departed.Then Frank did his best to cheer Elsie, telling her that everything was
sure to come out all right, as the Indian could be trusted to outwit the
desperadoes and rescue the captain.Seeing Frank and Elsie much together, Barney drew the professor aside,
and whispered:

"It's a bit av a walk we'd better take in th' open air, Oi think.""But I don't need a walk," protested the little man."Yis ye do, profissor," declared the Irish boy, soberly."A man av your
studious habits nivver takes ixercoise enough.""But I do not care to expose myself outdoors.""Phwat's th' matther wid out dures, Oi dunno?""There's danger that Gage and his gang will appear."We can get back here aheed av thim, fer we won't go
fur enough to be cut off.""Then the exercise will not be beneficial, and I will remain here.""Profissor, yer head is a bit thick.Can't ye take a hint, ur is it a
kick ye nade, Oi dunno?""Young man, be careful what kind of language you use to me!""Oi'm spakin' United States, profissor; no Irishmon wauld iver spake
English av he could hilp it.""But such talk of thick heads and kicks--to me, sir, to me!""Well, Oi don't want to give yez a kick, but ye nade it.Ye can't see
thot it's alone a bit Frank an' th' litthle girrul would loike to be."did ye iver think ye'd loike to be alone wid a pretty swate
girrul, profissor?Come on, now, before Oi pick ye up an' lug ye out."So Barney finally induced the professor to leave the hut, but the little
man remained close at hand, ready to bolt in through the wide open door
the instant there was the least sign of danger.Left to themselves, Frank and Elsie chatted, talking over many things of
mutual interest.They sat very near together, and more and more Frank
felt the magnetism of the girl's winning ways and tender eyes.He drew
nearer and nearer, and, finally, although neither knew how it happened,
their hands met, their fingers interlocked, and then he was saying
swiftly, earnestly:

"Elsie, you cannot know how often I have thought of you since you left
me at Fardale.There was something wrong about that parting, Elsie, for
you refused to let me know where you were going, refused to write to me,
expressed a wish that we might never meet again."Her head was bowed, and her cheeks were very
pale."All the while," she softly said, "away down in my heart was a hope I
could not kill--a hope that we might meet again some day, Frank.""When we have to part again,
Elsie, you will not leave me as you did before?She was looking straight into his eyes now, her face was near his, and
the temptation was too great for his impulsive nature to resist.In a
moment his arm was about her neck, and he had kissed her.She quickly released herself from his hold and sprang to her feet, the
warm blood flushing her cheeks."We cannot always be right," she admitted; "but we should be right when
we can.Frank, Inza Burrage befriended me.She thinks more of you than
any one else in the wide world.He lifted his hand to a round hole in his coat where a bullet from
Leslie Gage's revolver had cut through, and beneath it he felt the
ruined and shattered locket that held Inza's picture.The forenoon passed, and the afternoon was well advanced, but still
Socato the Seminole did not return.But late in the afternoon a boat and a number of canoes appeared.In the
boat was Leslie Gage and the two sailors, Black Tom and Bowsprit."Phwat th'
dickens does this mane, Oi dunno?""It means trouble," said Frank, quickly."Have the rifles ready, and be
prepared for hot work.""Those must be Seminoles," said Frank."It is scarcely likely that they
are very dangerous."The boat containing the three white persons ran boldly up to the shore,
and Leslie Gage landed.Advancing a short distance toward the hut, the
door of which was securely closed, he cried:

"Hello in there!""Talk with him, Barney," Frank swiftly directed."The fellow does not
know I am alive, and I do not wish him to know it just now."So Barney returned:

"Hello, yersilf, an' see how ye loike it.""You people are in a bad trap," declared Gage, with a threatening air."Look," and he motioned toward the water, where the canoes containing
the Indians were lying, "these are my backers.There are twenty of them,
and I have but to say the word to have them attack this hut and tear it
to the ground.""Well, Oi dunno about thot," coolly retorted the Irish lad."We moight
have something to say in thot case.It's arrumed we are, an' we know how
to use our goons, me foine birrud.""If you were to fire a shot at one of these Indians it would mean the
death of you all."Well, we are arrumed with Winchester repeaters, an' it
moight make the death av thim all av we began shootin'.""They do not look very dangerous," said Frank."I'll wager something
Gage has hired the fellows to come here and make a show in order to
scare us into submitting.The chances are the Indians will not fight at
all.""You're not fools," said Gage, "and you will not do anything that means
the same as signing your death warrant.If you will come to reason,
we'll have no trouble.We want that girl, Miss Bellwood, and we will
have her.If you do not----"

He stopped suddenly, for there was a great shouting from the Indians.they cried, in tones that betokened the
greatest terror.Then they took to flight, paddling as if their very lives depended on
it.At the same time, the mysterious white canoe, still apparently without
an occupant, was seen coming swiftly toward them, gliding lightly over
the water in a most unaccountable manner.Exclamations of astonishment broke from the two sailors, and Leslie Gage
stared at the singular craft in profound astonishment.When the attention of the crowd was on the remarkable sight, Frank
unfastened the door and before Gage was aware of it, our hero was right
upon him.Frank shouted, pointing a revolver at the
fellow.Gage saw the boy he believed he had destroyed, uttered a wild shriek,
threw up his hands, and fell in a senseless heap to the ground.Frank swiftly lifted the fellow, and then ran into the cabin with him,
placing him on the couch.In fact, they seemed almost as badly
scared as the Indians, and they got away in their boat, rowing as if for
their very lives, soon passing from sight.exclaimed Barney Mulloy; "this is phwat Oi call a
ragion av wonders.It's ivery doay and almost ivery hour something
happens to astonish ye."Gage was made secure, so he could not get away when he recovered from
the swoon into which he seemed to have fallen.A short time after, Socato was seen returning, but he was alone in his
canoe."He has not found my father--my poor father!""Let's hear what he has to say."The bad white men leave their captive alone," said Socato, "and I
should have set him free, but the great white phantom came, and then the
white captive disappeared."Whom do you mean by the great white phantom?""The one who owns the canoe that goes alone--the one who built this
house and lives here sometimes.My people say he is
a phantom, for he can appear and disappear as he likes, and he commands
the powers of light and darkness.Socato knew that the bad white man had
hired a hunting party of my people to come here and appear before the
house to frighten you, but he knew you would not be frightened, and the
bad men could not get my people to aid them in a fight.Socato also knew
that the great white phantom sent his canoe to scare my people away, but
he does not know what the great white phantom has done with the man who
was a prisoner.""Well, it is possible the great white phantom will explain a few things
we do not understand," said Frank, "for here he comes in his canoe.""And father--my father is with him in the canoe!"screamed Elsie
Bellwood, in delight.The white canoe was approaching, still gliding noiselessly
over the water, without any apparent power of propulsion, and in it were
seated two men.One had a long white beard and a profusion of white
hair.He was dressed entirely in white, and sat in the stern of the
canoe.The other was Captain Justin Bellwood, quite unharmed, and
looking very much at his ease.The little party flocked to the shore to greet the captain, who waved
his hand and called reassuringly to Elsie.As soon as the canoe touched
and came to a rest, he stepped out and clasped his daughter in his arms,
saying, fervently:

"Heaven be thanked!we have come through many dangers, and we are free
at last!Neither of us has been harmed, and we will soon be out of this
fearful swamp."The man with the white hair and beard stepped ashore and stood regarding
the girl intently, paying no heed to the others.Captain Bellwood turned
to him, saying:

"William, this is my daughter, of whom I told you.Elsie, this is your
Uncle William, who disappeared many years ago, and has never been heard
from since till he set me free to-day, after I was abandoned by those
wretches who dragged us here.""And so I believed, but he still lives.Professor Scotch, I think we had
the pleasure of meeting in Fardale.Permit me to introduce you to
William Bellwood, one of the most celebrated electricians living
to-day."As he said this, Captain Bellwood made a swift motion which his brother
did not see.He touched his forehead, and the signal signified that
William Bellwood was not right in his mind.This the professor saw was
true when he shook hands with the man, for there was the light of
madness in the eyes of the hermit."My brother," continued Captain Bellwood, "has explained that he came
here to these wilds to continue his study of electricity alone and
undisturbed.He took means to keep other people from bothering him.This
canoe, which contains a lower compartment and a hidden propeller, driven
by electricity, was his invention.He has arrangements whereby he can
use a powerful search-light at night, and----"

"That search-light came near being the death of me," said Frank."He
turned it on me last night just in time to show me to my enemy.""He has many other contrivances," Captain Bellwood went on."He has
explained that, by means of electricity, he can make his canoe or
himself glow with a white light in the darkest night.""And he also states that he has wires connecting various batteries in
yonder hut, so that he can frighten away superstitious hunters who
otherwise might take possession of the hut and give him trouble.""Thot ixplains th' foire-allarum an' th' power
thot throwed me inther th' middle av th' flure!Oi nivver hearrud th'
bate av it!"At this moment, a series of wild shrieks came from the hut, startling
them all.Gage was still on the couch,
and he shrieked still louder when he saw Frank; an expression of the
greatest terror coming to his face.Then he began to rave incoherently, sometimes frothing at the mouth.Two days later a party of eight persons emerged from the wilds of the
great Dismal Swamp and reached a small settlement.They were Frank
Merriwell, Barney Mulloy, Professor Scotch, Leslie Gage, Captain
Bellwood and his brother William, Socato the Seminole, and last, but far
from least, Elsie Bellwood."He shall be given shelter and medical treatment," declared Frank; "and
I will see that all the bills are paid.""Thot's the only thing Oi have against ye, me b'y.Ye wur always letting
up on yer inemies at Fardale, an' ye shtill kape on doin' av it.""If I continue to do so, I shall have nothing to trouble my conscience."Frank did take care of Gage and see that he was given the best medical
aid that money could procure, and, as a result, the fellow was saved
from a madhouse, for he finally recovered.He seemed to appreciate the
mercy shown him by his enemy, for he wrote a letter to Frank that was
filled with entreaties for forgiveness and promised to try to lead a
different life in the future."That," said Frank, "is my reward for being merciful to an enemy."If Jack Jaggers did not perish in the Everglades, he disappeared.Ben
Bowsprit and Black Tom also vanished, and it is possible that they left
their bones in the great Dismal Swamp.William Bellwood, so long a hermit in the wilds of Florida, seemed glad
to leave that region.Leaving their friends in Florida, Frank, Barney and the professor next
moved northward toward Tennessee, Frank wishing to see some of the
battlegrounds of the Civil War.The boys planned a brief tour afoot and were soon on their way among the
Great Smoky Mountains.Professor Scotch had no heart for a "tour afoot" through the mountains,
and so he had stopped at Knoxville, where the boys were to join him
again in two or three weeks, by the end of which period he was quite
sure they would have enough of tramping.Frank and Barney were making the journey from Gibson's Gap to Cranston's
Cove, which was said to be a distance of twelve miles, but they were
willing to admit that those mountain miles were most disgustingly long.They had paused to rest, midway in the afternoon, where the road curved
around a spur of the mountain.Below them opened a vista of valleys and
"coves," hemmed in by wild, turbulent-appearing masses of mountains,
some of which were barren and bleak, seamed with black chasms, above
which threateningly hung grimly beetling crags, and some of which were
robed in dense wildernesses of pine, veiling their faces, keeping them
thus forever a changeless mystery.From their eyrie position it seemed that they could toss a pebble into
Lost Creek, which wound through the valley below, meandered for miles
amid the ranges, tunneling an unknown channel beneath the rock-ribbed
mountains, and came out again--where?Both boys had been silent and awe-stricken, gazing wonderingly on the
impressive scene and thinking of their adventures in New Orleans and in
Florida, when a faint cry seemed to float upward from the depths of the
valley.They listened, and some moments passed in silence, save for the peeping
cry of a bird in a thicket near at hand.Oi belave it wur imagination, Frankie," said the Irish lad, at
last."I do not think so," declared Frank, with a shake of his head."It was a
human voice, and if we were to shout it might be---- There it is again!"There could be no doubt this time, for they both heard the cry
distinctly."It comes from below," said Frank, quickly."Roight, me lad," nodded Barney."Some wan is in difficulty down there,
and' it's mesilf thot don't moind givin' thim a lift."Getting a firm hold on a scrub bush, Frank leaned out over the verge and
looked down into the valley."Look, Barney--look down there amid those
rocks just below the little waterfall.""She has seen us, and is signaling for us to come down.""Instanter, as they say out West."The boys were soon hurrying down the mountain road, a bend of which
quickly carried them beyond view of the person near the waterfall.It was nearly an hour later when Frank and Barney approached the little
waterfall, having left the road and followed the course of the stream.anxiously asked Barney, who was behind."Can't tell yet," was the reply."Will be able to see in a minute, and
then---- She is there, sure as fate!"In another moment they came out in full view of a girl of eighteen or
nineteen, who was standing facing the waterfall, her back toward a great
rock, a home-made fishing pole at her feet.The girl was dressed in homespun, the skirt being short and reaching
but a little below the knees, and a calico sunbonnet was thrust half off
her head.Frank paused, with a low exclamation of admiration, for the girl made a
most strikingly beautiful picture, and Frank had an eye for beauty.Nearly all the mountain girls the boys had seen were stolid and
flat-appearing, some were tall and lank, but this girl possessed a
figure that seemed perfect in every detail.Her hair was bright auburn, brilliant and rich in tint, the shade that
is highly esteemed in civilization, but is considered a defect by the
mountain folk.Frank thought it the most beautiful hair he had ever
seen.Her eyes were brown and luminous, and the color of health showed through
the tan upon her cheeks.Her parted lips showed white, even teeth, and
the mouth was most delicately shaped.gasped Barney, at Frank's shoulder."Phwat have we struck, Oi
dunno?"Then the girl cried, her voice full of impatience:

"You-uns has shorely been long enough in gittin' har!"Frank staggered a bit, for he had scarcely expected to hear the uncouth
mountain dialect from such lips as those but he quickly recovered,
lifted his hat with the greatest gallantry, and said:

"I assure you, miss, that we came as swiftly as we could."Ef you-uns had been maounting boys, you'd been har in
less'n half ther time.""I presume that is true; but, you see, we did not know the shortest way,
and we were not sure you wanted us.""Wal, what did you 'low I whooped at ye fur ef I didn't want ye?I
nighly split my throat a-hollerin' at ye before ye h'ard me at all."Frank was growing more and more dismayed, for he had never before met a
strange girl who was quite like this, and he knew not what to say."Now that we have arrived," he bowed, "we shall be happy to be of any
possible service to you.""Dunno ez I want ye now," she returned, with a toss of her head.gurgled Barney, at Frank's ear."It's a doaisy she is,
me b'y!"Frank resolved to take another tack, and so he advanced, saying boldly
and resolutely:

"Now that you have called us down here, I don't see how you are going to
get rid of us.You want something of us, and we'll not leave you till we
find out what it is."The girl did not appear in the least alarmed.Instead of that, she
laughed, and that laugh was like the ripple of falling water."Wal, now you're talkin'!"she cried, with something like a flash of
admiration."Mebbe you-uns has got some backbone arter all."I have not looked at mine for so long that I am not sure what condition
it is in, but I know I have one.""Then move this rock har that hez caught my foot an' holds it.That's
what I wanted o' you-uns."She lifted her skirt a bit, and, for the first time, they saw that her
ankle had been caught between two large rocks, where she was held fast."Kinder slomped in thar when I war fishin'," she explained, "an' ther
big rock dropped over thar an' cotched me fast when I tried ter pull
out.That war nigh two hour ago, 'cordin' ter ther sun.""And you have been standing like that ever since?"cried Frank, in
dismay."Lively, Barney--get hold here!we must have her
out of that in a hurry!""Thot's phwat we will, ur we'll turrun th' ould mountain over!"shouted
the Irish lad, as he flew to the aid of his friend.The girl looked surprised and pleased, and then she said:

"You-uns ain't goin' ter move that rock so easy, fer it's hefty.""But your ankle--it must have crushed your ankle."Ye see it couldn't pinch harder ef it tried, fer them rocks
ain't built so they kin git nigher together; but it's jest made a
reg'ler trap so I can't pull my foot out."It was no easy thing for the boys to get hold of the rock in a way to
exert their strength, but they finally succeeded, and then Frank gave
the word, and they strained to move it.It started reluctantly, as if
loath to give up its fair captive, but they moved it more and more, and
she was able to draw her foot out.Then, when she was free, they let go,
and the rock fell back with a grating crash against the other."You-uns have done purty fair fer boys," said the girl, with a saucy
twinkle in her brown eyes."S'pose I'll have ter thank ye, fer I mought
a stood har consider'bul longer ef 'tadn't bin fer ye.an' whar be ye goin'?"Frank introduced himself, and then presented Barney, after which he
explained how they happened to be in the Great Smoky Mountains.She watched him closely as he spoke, noting every expression, as if a
sudden suspicion had come upon her, and she was trying to settle a doubt
in her mind.When Frank had finished, the girl said:

"Never heard o' two boys from ther big cities 'way off yander comin' har
ter tromp through ther maountings jest fer ther fun o' seein' ther
scenery an' ther folks.I s'pose we're kinder curi's 'pearin' critters
ter city folks, an' you-uns may be har ter cotch one o' us an' put us in
a cage fer exhibition."She uttered the words in a way that brought a flush to Frank's cheeks,
and he hastened to protest, halting in confusion when he tried to speak
her name, which he did not know as yet.A ripple of sunshine seemed to break over her face, and she laughed
outright, swiftly saying:

"Don't you-uns mind me.I'm p'izen rough, but I don't mean half I say.I
kin see you is honest an' squar, though somebody else mought think by
yer way that ye warn't.My name's Kate Kenyon, an' I live down toward
ther cove.I don't feel like fishin' arter this, an' ef you-uns is goin'
that way, I'll go 'long with ye."She picked up her pole, hooked up the line, and prepared to accompany
them.They were pleased to have her as a companion.Indeed, Frank was more
than pleased, for he saw in this girl a singular character.Illiterate
though she seemed, she was pretty, vivacious, and so bright that it was
plain education and refinement would make her most fascinating and
brilliant.The boys did not get to Cranston's Cove that night, for Kate Kenyon
invited them to stop and take supper at her home, and they did so.Kate's home was much like the rough cabins of other mountain folks,
except that flowering vines had been trained to run up the sides and
over the door, while two large bushes were loaded with roses in front of
the house.Kate's mother was in the doorway as they approached.She was a tall,
angular woman, with a stolid, expressionless face."Har, mammy, is some fellers I brung ter see ye," said this girl.Merriwell, an' that un is Mr.The boys lifted their hats, and bowed to the woman as if she were a
society queen."What be you-uns doin' 'round these parts?"Frank explained, seeing a look of suspicion and distrust deepening in
her face as he spoke."An' what do you-uns want o'
me?""Your daughter invited us to call and take supper," said Frank, coolly."I ain't uster cookin' flip-flaps fer city chaps, an' I don't b'lieve
you kin eat the kind o' fodder we-uns is uster."The boys hastened to assure her that they would be delighted to eat the
plainest of food, and their eagerness brought a merry laugh from the
lips of the girl."You-uns is consid'ble amusin'," she said.I
asked 'em to come, mammy.It's no more'n fair pay fer what they done fer
me."Then she explained how she had been caught and held by the rocks, and
how the boys had seen her from the mountain road and come to her
rescue.The mother's face did not soften a bit as she listened, but, when Kate
had finished, she said:

"They're yore comp'ny.So the boys were asked into the cabin, and Kate herself prepared supper.It was a plain meal, but Frank noticed that everything looked neat and
clean about the house, and both lads relished the coarse food.Indeed,
Barney afterward declared that the corn bread was better than the finest
cake he had ever tasted.Frank was particularly happy at the table, and the merry stories he told
kept Kate laughing, and, once or twice, brought a grim smile to the face
of the woman.After supper they went out in front of the cabin, where they could look
up at the wild mass of mountains, the peaks of which were illumined by
the rays of the setting sun.Kenyon filled and lighted a cob pipe.She sat and puffed away,
staring straight ahead in a blank manner.Just how it happened Frank himself could not have told, but Barney fell
to talking to the woman in his whimsical way, while Frank and Kate
wandered away a short distance, and sat on some stones which had been
arranged as a bench in a little nook near Lost Creek.From this position
they could hear Barney's rich brogue and jolly laugh as he recounted
some amusing yarn, and, when the wind was right, a smell of the black
pipe would be wafted to them."Do you know," said Frank, "this spot is so wild and picturesque that it
fascinates me.I should like to stop here two or three days and rest.""Better not," said the girl, shortly."Wal, it mought not be healthy.""I wonder ef you air so ignerent, or be you jest makin' it?""Honestly and truly, I do not understand you.""Wal, I kinder 'low you-uns is all right, but thar's others might not
think so.S'pose you know what moonshine is?""Yes; it is illicitly distilled whiskey."Wal, ther revenues say thar's moonshine made round these
parts.They come round ev'ry little while to spy an' cotch ther folks
that makes it.""By revenues you mean the officers of the government?""Wal, they may be officers, but they're a difrrunt kind than Jock
Hawkins.""He's ther sheriff down to ther cove.Jock Hawkins knows better'n to
come snoopin' 'round, an' he's down on revenues ther same as ther rest
o' us is.""Then you do not like the revenue officers?"cried the girl, starting up, her eyes seeming to blaze in
the dusky twilight."I hate 'em wuss'n pizen!An' I've got good cause
fer hatin' 'em."The boy saw he had touched a tender spot, and he would have turned the
conversation in another channel, but she was started, and she went on
swiftly:

"What right has ther gover'ment to take away anybody's honest means o'
earnin' a livin'?What right has ther gover'ment to send spies up har
ter peek an' pry an' report on a man as is makin' a little moonshine ter
sell that he may be able ter git bread an' drink fer his fam'ly?What
right has ther gover'ment ter make outlaws an' crim'nals o' men as
wouldn't steal a cent that didn't b'long ter them if they was starvin'?"Frank knew well enough the feeling of most mountain folks toward the
revenue officers, and he knew it was a useless task to attempt to show
them where they were in the wrong."Yes, I has good right to hate ther revenues, an' I do!Didn't they
pester my pore old daddy fer makin' moonshine!Didn't they hunt him
through ther maountings fer weeks, an' keep him hidin' like a dog!An'
didn't they git him cornered at last in Bent Coin's old cabin, an' when
he refused ter come out an' surrender, an' kep' 'em off with his gun,
didn't they shoot him so he died three days arter in my arms!Wal, I've got good reason ter hate 'em!"Kate was wildly excited, although she held her voice down, as if she did
not wish her mother to hear what she was saying.Frank was sitting so
near that he felt her arm quivering against his."I has more than that to hate 'em fer!Whar is my brother Rufe, ther best boy that ever drored a breath?Ther
revenues come fer him, an' they got him.Thar war a trial, an' they
proved ez he'd been consarned in makin' moonshine.He war convicted, an'
he's servin' his time.Wal, thar's nuthin' I hate wuss on this
earth!""You have had hard luck," said Frank, by way of saying something."It's
lucky for us that we're not revenues.""Yer right thar," she nodded."I didn't know but ye war at first, but I
changed my mind later.""Wal, ye're young, an' you-uns both has honest faces."I don't suppose they have been able to check the making of
moonshine--that is, not to any extent?""He makes more whiskey in a week than all ther others in this region
afore him made in a month.""He must be smarter than the others before him.""Wal, he's not afeared o' ther revenues, an' he's a mystery to ther men
ez works fer him right along.""None o' them has seen his face, an' they don't know Who he is.They
ain't been able to find out.""Wal, Con Bean war shot through ther shoulder fer follerin' Muriel, an'
Bink Mower got it in ther leg fer ther same trick.""I rather admire this Muriel," laughed Frank."He may be in unlawful
business, but he seems to be a dandy.""He keeps five stills runnin' all ther time, an' he has a way o' gittin'
ther stuff out o' ther maountings an' disposin' of it.But I'm talkin'
too much, as Wade would say.""He's Wade Miller, a partic'lar friend o' our'n sence Rufe war tooken by
ther revenues.Wade has been good to mammy an' me."If I lived near, I might try to bother Wade
somewhat."It was now duskish, but he was so near that
he could see her eyes through the twilight."I dunno what you-uns means," she said, slowly, her voice falling."Wade
would be powerful bad to bother.He's ugly sometimes, an' he's jellus o'
me.""Wal, he's tryin' ter, but I don't jes' snuggle ter him ther way I might
ef I liked him right.Thar's something about him, ez I don't edzac'ly
like.""That makes it rather one-sided, and makes me think all the more that I
should try to bother him if I lived near.Do you know, Miss Kenyon, that
you are an exceptionally pretty girl?""Hair that would make you the envy of a society belle.It is the
handsomest hair I ever saw.""Now you're makin' fun o' me, an' I don't like that."She drew away as if offended, and he leaned toward her, eager to
convince her of his sincerity."Indeed, I am doing nothing of the sort," he protested."The moment I
saw you to-day I was struck by the beauty of your hair.But that is not
the only beautiful feature about you, Miss Kenyon.Your mouth is a
perfect Cupid's bow, and your teeth are like pearls, while you have a
figure that is graceful and exquisite.""Never nobody talked to me like that afore," she murmured."Round har
they jes' say, 'Kate, you'd be a rippin' good looker ef it warn't fer
that red hair o' yourn.'An' they've said it so much that I've come to
hate my hair wuss'n pizen."Her hand found his, and they were sitting very near together."I took to you up by ther fall ter-day," she went on, in a low tone."Now, don't you git skeered, fer I'm not goin' to be foolish, an' I know
I'm not book-learned an' refined, same ez your city gals.We kin be
friends, can't we?"Frank had begun to regret his openly expressed admiration, but now he
said:

"To be sure we can be friends, Miss Kenyon.""I am sure I shall esteem your friendship very highly.""Wall, partic'ler friends don't call each other miss an' mister.I'll
agree ter call you Frank, ef you'll call me Kate.""I am going away to-morrow," he thought.A fierce exclamation close at hand, the cracking of a twig, a heavy
step, and then a panther-like figure leaped out of the dusk, and flung
itself upon Frank.[Illustration: "Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and with
astonishing strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad."(See page
218)]




CHAPTER XL.The attack was so sudden and fierce that the boy was hurled to the
ground before he could make a move to protect himself.A hand fastened on his throat, pinning him fast.The man's knee crushed
into his stomach, depriving him of breath.The man's other hand snatched
out something, and lifted it aloft.A knife was poised above Frank's heart, and in another moment the blade
would have been buried to the hilt in the lad's bosom.Without uttering a sound, Kate Kenyon grasped the wrist of the
murderous-minded man, gave it a wrench with all her strength, which was
not slight, and forced him to drop the knife."You don't murder anybody, Wade Miller!""I'll choke ther life outen him!"snarled the fellow, as he tried to
fasten both hands on Frank's throat.By this time the boy had recovered from the surprise and shock, and he
was ready to fight for his life.Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and, with astonishing
strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad.Sandra moved to the kitchen.In the twinkling of an eye, Frank came to his feet, and he was ready for
a new assault.Snarling and growling like a mad dog, the man scrambled up and lunged
toward the boy, trying to grasp him.Frank was a skillful boxer, and now his skill came into play, for he
dodged under the man's right arm, whirled like a cat, and struck the
fellow behind the ear.sounded the blow, sending the assailant staggering, and Frank
followed it up by leaping after him and striking him again, the second
blow having the force of the lad's strength and the weight of his body.It seemed that the man was literally knocked "spinning," and he did not
stop till he landed in the creek."Wal," exclaimed the girl, "I 'low you kin take keer o' yerself now!""I rather think so," came coolly from the boy."He caught me foul, and I
did not have a show at first."It was a case of jealousy, and he had aroused the worst
passions of the man who admired Kate Kenyon.Miller came scrambling and
snorting from the water, and Barney Mulloy rushed toward the spot,
crying:

"Pwhat's th' row, Frankie, me b'y?Do ye nade inny av me hilp?"So far, I am all right, thanks to Miss Kenyon."breathed the mountain maid, in sincere admiration."I didn't s'pose city chaps knowed how ter fight.""Some do," laughed Frank, keeping his eyes on Miller.panted the man, springing toward Frank, and then
halting suddenly, and throwing up his hand.Frank knew this well enough, and he was expecting just such a move, so
it happened that the words had scarcely left the girl's lips when the
revolver was sent flying from Wade Miller's hand.The boy had leaped forward, and, with one skillful kick, disarmed his
foe by knocking the weapon out of his hand.Miller seemed dazed for a moment, and then he started for Frank, once
more grinding his teeth."Oh, let me take a hand in this!"cried Barney Mulloy, who was eager for
a fight."Me blud is gittin' shtagnant.""Well, you have tried that trick twice, but I do not see that you have
succeeded to any great extent.""I'll hammer yer life out o' yer carcass with my bare hands!""Possibly that will not be such a very easy trick to do."The boy's coolness seemed to add to the fury of his assailant, and the
man made another rush, which was easily avoided by Frank, who struck
Miller a stinging blow."You'd better stop, Wade," advised the girl."He-uns is too much fer
you-uns, an' that's plain enough.""Oh, I'll show ye--I'll show ye!"There was no longer any reason in the man's head, and Frank saw that he
must subdue the fellow some way.Miller was determined to grapple with
the boy, and Frank felt that he would find the mountaineer had the
strength of an ox, for which reason he must keep clear of those grasping
hands.For some moments Frank had all he could do to avoid Miller, who seemed
to have grown stolid to the lad's blows.At last, Frank darted in,
caught the man behind, lifted him over one hip, and dashed him headlong
to the ground."Wal, that's the beatenest I ever saw!"cried Kate Kenyon, whose
admiration for Frank now knew no bounds."You-uns is jes' a terror!""Whoy, thot's fun fer Frankie," he declared.Miller groaned, and sat up, lifting his hands to his head, and looking
about him in a dazed way."Ye run ag'in' a fighter this time, Wade," said the girl."He done ye,
an' you-uns is ther bully o' these parts!""It was an accident," mumbled the man."I couldn't see ther critter
well, an' so he kinder got----"

"That won't go, Wade," half laughed the girl."He done you fa'r an'
squar', an' it's no us' ter squawk.""An' ye're laffin' 'bout it, be ye, Kate?"Better let him erlone, Wade.You-uns has made fool enough o' yerself.Ye tried ter kill me, an'----"

"What I saw made me do it!""He war makin' love ter ye,
Kate--an' you-uns liked it!""Wal, Wade Miller, what is that ter you-uns?""He has a right ter make love ter me ef he wants ter.""Oh, yes, he has a right, but his throat'll be slit before long, mark
what I say!""Ef anything o' that kind happens, Wade Miller, I'll know who done it,
an' I swa'r I'll never rest till I prove it agin' ye.""I don't keer, Kate," muttered the man, getting on his feet and standing
there sulkily before them."Ef I can't hev ye, I sw'ar no other critter
shall!"I've stood all I kin from you, an' from now on
I don't stan' no more.Arter this you-uns an' me-uns ain't even
friends."He fell back a step, as if he had been struck a blow, and then he
hoarsely returned:

"All right, Kate.I ain't ter be thrown
aside so easy.As fer them city chaps, ther maountings ain't big enough
ter hold them an' me.Wade Miller has some power, an' I wouldn't give a
snap for their lives.The Black Caps don't take ter strangers much, an'
they know them critters is hyar.I'm goin' now, but that don't need ter
mean that I'll stay away fer long."He turned, and, having picked up his revolver, strode away into the
darkness, quickly disappearing.Kate's trembling hand fell on Frank's arm, and she panted into his ear:

"You-uns must git out o' ther maountings quick as you kin, fer Wade
Miller means what he says, an' he'll kill ye ef you stay hyar!"Frank Merriwell's blood was aroused, and he did not feel like letting
Wade Miller drive him like a hunted dog from the mountains."By this time I should think you would have confidence in my ability to
take care of myself against this man Miller," he said, somewhat testily."Yo're ther best fighter I ever saw, but that won't'mount ter anything
agin' ther power Miller will set on yer.He's pop-ler, is Wade Miller,
an' he'll have ther hull maountings ter back him.""I shall not run for Miller and all his friends.Right is right, and I
have as good right here as he."cried Kate, admiringly; "hang me ef I don't like you-uns'
pluck.You may find that you'll need a friend afore yo're done with
Wade.Ef ye do--wal, mebbe Kate Kenyon won't be fur off.""It is a good thing to know I shall have one
friend in the mountains."Kenyon was seen stolidly standing in
the dusk."Mebbe you-uns will find my Kate ther best friend ye could
have.Come, gal, it's time ter g'win."So they entered the cabin, and Barney found an opportunity to whisper to
Frank:

"She's a corker, me b'y!an' Oi think she's shtuck on yez.Kenyon declared she was tired,
and intended to go to bed.She apologized for the bed she had to give
the boys, but they assured her that they were accustomed to sleeping
anywhere, and that the bed would be a positive luxury."Such slick-tongued chaps I never did see before," declared the old
woman."They don't seem stuck up an' lofty, like most city fellers.Really, they make me feel right to home in my own house!"She said this in a whimsical way that surprised Frank, who fancied Mrs.Kate bade them good-night, and they retired, which they were glad to do,
as they were tired from the tramp of the day.Frank was awakened by a sharp shake, and his first thought was of
danger, but his hand did not reach the revolver he had placed beneath
the pillow, for he felt something cold against his temple, and heard a
voice hiss:

"Be easy, you-uns!Ef ye make a jowl, yo're ter be shot!"Barney was awakened at the same time, and the boys found they were in
the clutches of strong men.The little room seemed filled with men, and
the lads instantly realized they were in a bad scrape.Through the small window sifted the white moonlight, showing that every
man wore a black, pointed cap and hood, which reached to his shoulders.In this hood arrangement great holes were cut for the eyes, and some had
slits cut for their mouths.was the thought that flashed through Frank's mind.The revolvers pressed against the heads of the boys kept them from
defending themselves or making an outcry.They were forced to get up and
dress, after which they were passed through the open window, like
bundles, their hands having been tied behind them.Other black-hooded men were outside, and horses were near at hand.But when he thought how tired they had been, he did not wonder that both
had slept soundly while the men slipped into the house by the window,
which had been readily and noiselessly removed.It did not take the men long to get out as they had entered.Then Frank
and Barney were placed on horses, being tied there securely, and the
party was soon ready to move.They rode away, and the horses' feet gave out no sound, which explained
why they had not aroused anybody within the cabin.The hoofs of the animals were muffled.Frank wondered what Kate Kenyon would think when morning came and she
found her guests gone."She will believe we rose in the night, and ran away.I hate to have her
believe me a coward."Then he fell to wondering what the men would do with himself and Barney.They will not dare to do anything more than
run us out of this part of the country."Although he told himself this, he was far from feeling sure that the men
would do nothing else.He had heard of the desperate deeds perpetrated
by the widely known "White Caps," and it was not likely that the Black
Caps were any less desperate and reckless.As they were leaving the vicinity of the cabin, one of the horses
neighed loudly, causing the leader of the party to utter an exclamation
of anger."Ef that 'rousts ther gal, she's li'bul ter be arter us in a hurry," one
of the men observed.The party hurried forward, soon passing from view of the cabin, and
entering the shadow that lay blackly in the depths of the valley.They rode about a mile, and then they came to a halt at a command from
the leader, and Frank noticed with alarm that they had stopped beneath a
large tree, with wide-spreading branches."This looks bad for us, old man," he whispered to Barney."Thot's pwhat it does, Frankie," admitted the Irish lad."Oi fale
throuble coming this way."The horsemen formed a circle about the captives, moving at a signal from
the leader, who did not seem inclined to waste words."Brothers o' ther Black Caps," said the leader, "what is ther fate
we-uns gives ter revenues?"Every man in the circle uttered the word, and they spoke all together."Now, why are we assembled ter-night?""Ter dispose o' spies," chorused the Black Caps.Each one of the black-hooded band extended a hand and pointed straight
at the captive boys."They shall be hanged," solemnly said the men.cried the leader, as if well satisfied.In a moment one of the men brought forth a rope.This was long enough to
serve for both boys, and it was quickly cut in two pieces, while
skillful hands proceeded to form nooses."Frankie," said Barney Mulloy, sadly, "we're done for.""It looks that way," Frank was forced to admit."Oi wouldn't moind so much," said the Irish lad, ruefully, "av we could
kick th' booket foighting fer our loives; but it is a bit harrud ter go
under widout a chance to lift a hand.""That's right," cried Frank, as he strained fiercely at the cords which
held his hands behind his back."It is the death of a criminal, and I
object to it."The leader of the Black Caps rode close to the boys, leaned forward in
his saddle, and hissed in Frank's ear:

"It's my turn now!""We-uns is goin' ter put two revenues
out o' ther way, that's all!""It's murder," cried Frank, in a ringing tone."You know we are not
revenue spies!We can prove that we are what we
claim to be--two boys who are tramping through the mountains for
pleasure.Will you kill us without giving us a chance to prove our
innocence?""It's ther same ol' whine," he said."Ther revenues alwus cry baby when
they're caught.You-uns can't fool us, an' we ain't got time ter waste
with ye.About the boys' necks the fatal ropes were quickly adjusted."If you murder us, you will find you have not
killed two friendless boys.We have friends--powerful friends--who will
follow this matter up--who will investigate it.You will be hunted down
and punished for the crime."Do you-uns think ye're stronger an' more
po'erful than ther United States Gover'ment?Ther United States
loses her spies, an' she can't tell who disposed o' 'em.We won't be
worried by all yore friends."He made another movement, and the rope ends were flung over a limb that
was strong enough to bear both lads.Hope was dying within Frank Merriwell's breast.At last he had reached
the end of his adventurous life, which had been short and turbulent.He
must die here amid these wild mountains, which flung themselves up
against the moonlit sky, and the only friend to be with him at the end
was the faithful friend who must die at his side.Frank's blood ran cold and sluggish in his veins.The spring night had
seemed warm and sweet, filled with the droning of insects; but now there
was a bitter chill in the air, and the white moonlight seemed to take on
a crimson tinge, as of blood.The boy's nature rebelled against the thought of meeting death in such a
manner.It was spring-time amid the mountains; with him it was the
spring-time of life.He had enjoyed the beautiful world, and felt strong
and brave to face anything that might come; but this he had not reckoned
on, and it was something to cause the stoutest heart to shake.Over the eastern mountains, craggy, wild, barren or pine-clad, the
gibbous moon swung higher and higher.The heavens were full of stars,
and every star seemed to be an eye that was watching to witness the
consummation of the tragedy down there in that little valley, through
which Lost Creek flowed on to its unknown destination.The silence was broken by a sound that made every black-hooded man start
and listen.Sweet and mellow and musical, from afar through the peaceful night, came
the clear notes of a bugle.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!A fierce exclamation broke from the lips of the leader of the Black
Caps, and he grated:

"Muriel, by ther livin' gods!Quick, boys--finish this
job, an' git!""If that is Muriel, wait
for him--let him pronounce our fate.He is the chief of you all, and he
shall say if we are revenue spies."You-uns know too much, fer ye've called my name!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!From much nearer, came the sound of the bugle, awakening hundreds of
mellow echoes, which were flung from crag to crag till it seemed that
the mountains were alive with buglers.The clatter of a horse's iron-shod feet could be heard, telling that the
rider was coming like the wind down the valley."Cut free ther feet o' ther pris'ners!"panted the leader of the Black
Caps.Muriel will be here in a few shakes, an' we-uns must
be done.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Through the misty moonlight a coal-black horse, bearing a rider who once
more awakens the clamoring echoes with his bugle, comes tearing at a mad
gallop.repeats Wade Miller, fiercely, as the black-hooded men
seem to hesitate.One of the men utters the command, and his companions hesitate."Muriel is death on revernues," says the one who had spoken, "an' thar
ain't any reason why we-uns shouldn't wait fer him."More than half the men agree with the one who has interrupted the
execution, filling Wade Miller with unutterable rage.snarled the chief ruffian of the party."I am leadin' you-uns
now, an' ye've gotter do ez I say.I order ye ter string them critters
up!"Nearer and nearer came the clattering hoof-beats."Av we can have wan minute more!""Half a minute will do," returned Frank."We refuse ter obey ye now," boldly spoke the man who had commanded his
companions to stop."Muriel has signaled ter us, an' he means fer us ter
wait till he-uns arrives."He snatched out a revolver, pointed it straight at Frank's breast, and
fired!Just as the desperate ruffian was pulling the trigger, the man nearest
him struck up his hand, and the bullet passed through Frank's hat,
knocking it to the ground.Miller was furious as a maniac, but, at this moment, the black horse
and the dashing rider burst in upon the scene, plunged straight through
the circle, halting at the side of the imperiled lads, the horse being
flung upon its haunches."Wal, what be you-uns doin'?""What work
is this, that I don't know erbout?"Wade Miller cowered before the chief of the
moonshiners, trying to hide the revolver.Muriel's eyes, gleaming through the twin holes of the mask he wore,
found Miller, and the clear voice cried:

"You-uns has been lettin' this critter lead ye inter somethin'!An' it's
fair warnin' I gave him ter keep clear o' meddlin' with my business."The boys gazed at the moonshiner chief in amazement, for Muriel looked
no more than a boy as he sat there on his black horse, and his voice
seemed the voice of a boy instead of that of a man.Yet it was plain
that he governed these desperate ruffians of the mountains with a hand
of iron, and they feared him."We-uns war 'bout ter hang two revernues," explained Miller."How long sence ther gover'ment has
been sendin' boys hyar ter spy on us?""They know what happens ter ther men they send," muttered Miller."Wal, 'tain't like they'd be sendin' boys arter men failed.""That's ther way they hope ter fool us.""An' how do you know them-uns is revernues?""We jest s'picions it.""An' you-uns war hangin' 'em on s'picion, 'thout lettin' me know?""We never knows whar ter find ye, Muriel.""That is nary excuse, fer ef you-uns had held them-uns a day I'd knowed
it.It looks like you-uns war in a monstr'us hurry.""It war he-uns," declared one of the black hoods, pointing to Miller."We don't gener'ly waste much time in dinkerin' 'roun' with anybody
we-uns thinks is revernues," said Miller."Wal, we ain't got ther record o' killin' innercent boys, an' we don't
begin now.Two men hastened to obey the order, while Miller sat and grated his
teeth.As this was being done, Muriel asked:

"What war you-uns doin' with that revolver when I come?I heard ye
shoot, an' I saw ther flash.Miller stammered and stuttered till Muriel repeated the question, his
voice cold and hard, despite its boyish caliber."Wal," said Wade, reluctantly, "I'll have ter tell yer.I shot at
he-uns," and he pointed at Frank."I thought so," was all Muriel said.When the ropes were removed from the necks of the boys, Muriel directed
that their feet be tied again, and their eyes blindfolded.These orders were attended to with great swiftness, and then the
moonshiner chief said:

"Follow!"Out they rode from beneath the tree, and away through the misty
moonlight.Frank and Barney could not see, but they felt well satisfied with their
lot, for they had been saved from death for the time being, and,
somehow, they felt that Muriel did not mean to harm them."Frank," whispered Barney, "are yez there?""Here," replied Frank, close at hand."It's dead lucky we are to be livin', me b'y."I feel like singing a song of praise and
thanksgiving.But we're not out of the woods yet.""Thot Muriel is a dandy, Frankie!Oi'm shtuck on his stoyle."I wonder how he happened to appear at such an
opportune moment?""Nivver a bit do Oi know, but it's moighty lucky fer us thot he did."Frank fell to speculating over the providential appearance of the
moonshiner chief.It was plain that Muriel must have known that
something was happening, and he had signaled with the bugle to the Black
Caps.In all probability, other executions had taken place beneath that
very tree, for the young chief came there direct, without hesitation.For nearly an hour they seemed to ride through the night, and then they
halted.The boys were removed from the horses and compelled to march
into some kind of a building.After some moments, their hands were freed, and, tearing away the
blindfolds, they found themselves in a low, square room, with no
windows, and a single door.With his back to the door, stood Muriel.The light of a swinging oil lamp illumined the room.Muriel leaned gracefully against the door, his arms folded, and his eyes
gleaming where the lamplight shone on them through the twin holes in the
sable mask.The other moonshiners had disappeared, and the boys were alone in that
room with the chief of the mountain desperadoes.There was something strikingly cool and self-reliant in Muriel's
manner--something that caused Frank to think that the fellow, young as
he was, feared nothing on the face of the earth.At the same time there was no air of bravado or insolence about that
graceful pose and the quiet manner in which he was regarding them.Instead of that, the moonshiner was a living interrogation point,
everything about him seeming to speak the question that fell from his
lips."You must know
that we will lie if we are, and so you will hear our denial anyway."Look hyar--she tol' me fair an' squar' that you-uns warn't revernues,
but I dunno how she could tell."Frank fancied that he knew, but he put the question, and Muriel
answered:

"Ther gal that saved yore lives by comin' ter me an' tellin' me ther
boys had taken you outer her mammy's house."She did save our lives, for if you had been one minute
later you would not have arrived in time.Muriel moved uneasily, and he did not seem pleased by Frank's words,
although his face could not be seen.It was some moments before he
spoke, but his voice was strangely cold and hard when he did so."It's well ernough fer you-uns ter remember her, but ye'd best take car'
how ye speak o' her.She's got friends in ther maountings--true
friends."Frank was startled, and he felt the hot blood rush to his face.Then, in
a moment, he cried:

"Friends!Well, she has no truer friends than the boys she saved
to-night!I hope you will not misconstrue our words, Mr.A sound like a smothered laugh came from behind that baffling mask, and
Muriel said:

"Yo're hot-blooded.I war simply warnin' you-uns in advance, that's all.We esteem Miss Kenyon too highly to say
anything that can give a friend of hers just cause to strike against
us.""Wal, city chaps are light o' tongue, an' they're apt ter think that
ev'ry maounting girl is a fool ef she don't have book learnin'.Some
city chaps make their boast how easy they kin'mash' such gals.Anything
like that would count agin' you-uns."Frank was holding himself in check with an effort."It is plain you do not know us, and you have greatly misjudged us.We
are not in the mountains to make'mashes,' and we are not the kind to
boast of our conquests.""Thot's right, me jool!"growled Barney, whose temper was started a bit."An' it's mesilf thot loikes to be suspected av such a thing.It shtirs
me foighting blud."The Irish lad clinched his fist, and felt of his muscle, moving his
forearm up and down, and scowling blackly at the cool chief of
moonshiners, as if longing to thump the fellow.This seemed to amuse Muriel, but still he persisted in further arousing
the lads by saying, insinuatingly:

"I war led ter b'lieve that Kate war ruther interested in you-uns by her
manner.Thar don't no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers
fer nothin'!"Frank bit his lip, and Barney looked blacker than ever.It seemed that
Muriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort, and they were
growing suspicious.Had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued
them that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the
way?Mary journeyed to the bedroom.The boys were silent, and Muriel forced a laugh."Wal, ye won't talk about that, an' so we'll go onter somethin' else.I
judge you-uns know yo're in a po'erful bad scrape?"exclaimed Barney, feeling of his neck, and
making a wry face, as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection."It is a scrape that you-uns may not be able ter git out of easy,"
Muriel said."I war able ter save yer from bein' hung 'thout any show at
all, but ye're not much better off now.""If you were powerful enough to save us in the first place, you should
be able to get us out of the scrape entirely.""You-uns don't know all about it.Moonshiners have laws an' regulations,
an' even ther leader must stan' by them."Frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that Muriel was
their enemy, after all that had happened.He felt that they must guard
their tongues, for there was no telling what expression the fellow might
distort and turn against them.Seeing neither of the lads was going to speak, Muriel went on:

"Yes, moonshiners have laws and regulations.Ther boys came nigh
breakin' one o' ther laws by hangin' you-uns ter-night 'thout givin' ye
a show.""Then we are to have a fair deal?""Ez fair ez anybody gits," assured Muriel, tossing back a lock of his
coal-black hair, which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his
coat."Ain't that all ye kin ask?"That depends on what kind of a deal it is.""Wall, ye'll be given yore choice."If it is proven that we are revenue spies,
we'll have to take our medicine.But if it is not proven, we demand
immediate release.""Take my advice; don't demand anything o' ther Black Caps.Ther more ye
demand, ther less ye git.""We have a right to demand a fair deal.""Right don't count in this case; it is might that holds ther fort.You-uns stirred up a tiger ag'in' ye when you made Wade Miller mad.It's
a slim show that ye escape ef we-uns lets yer go instanter.He'd foller
yer, an' he'd finish yer somewhar."We have taken care of ourselves so
far, and we think we can continue to do so.All we ask is that we be set
at liberty and given our weapons.""An' ye'd be found with yer throats cut within ten miles o' hyar.""Wal, 'cordin' to our rules, ye can't be released onless ther vote ur
ther card sez so.""Wal, it's like this: Ef it's put ter vote, one black bean condemns
you-uns ter death, an' ev'ry man votes black ur white, as he chooses.I
don't judge you-uns care ter take yer chances that way?""Oi sh'u'd soay not!Ixchuse us from thot, me hearty!""There would be one
vote against us--one black bean thrown, at least.""Pwhat av th' carruds?""Two men will be chosen, one ter hold a pack o' cards, and one to draw a
card from them.Ef ther card is red, it lets you-uns off, fer it means
life; ef it is black, it cooks yer, fer it means death."The boys were silent, dumfounded, appalled.Muriel stood watching them, and Frank fancied that his eyes were
gleaming with satisfaction.The boy began to believe he had mistaken the
character of this astonishing youth; Muriel might be even worse than his
older companions, for he might be one who delighted in torturing his
victims.Frank threw back his head, defiance and scorn written on his handsome
face."It is a clean case of murder, at best!"he cried, his voice ringing out
clearly."We deserve a fair trial--we demand it!""Wal," drawled the boy moonshiner, "I warned you-uns that ther more yer
demanded, ther less yer got."We're in fur it, Frankie, me b'y!""If we had our revolvers, we'd give them a stiff fight for it!""They would not murder us till a few of them had eaten
lead!""You-uns has stuff, an' when I tell yer that ye'll have ter sta' ter
vote ur take chances with ther cards, I don't judge you'll hesitate."Then, make it the cards," said Frank, hoarsely."That will give us an
even show, if the draw is a fair one.""I'll see ter that," assured Muriel.Without another word, he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room.They heard him bar the door, and then they stood looking into each
other's faces, speechless for a few moments."It's a toss-up, Barney," Frank finally observed."Thot's pwhat it is, an' th' woay our luck is runnin' Oi think it's a
case av heads they win an' tails we lose.""But there is no way out of it."Pwhat do yez think av thot Muriel?""Worse than thot, me b'y--he's a cat's cradle toied in a hundred an'
sivintane knots.""It is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the
worst foe we have in these mountains.""Oi wonder how Kate Kenyon knew where to foind him so quick?"She must have found him in a very short time
after we were taken from the cabin.""An' she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we
wur gone, me b'y.It may have aroused Kate and her
mother, and caused them to investigate.""Loikely thot wur th' case, fer it's not mesilf thot would think she'd
kape shtill an' let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it.""No; I believe her utterly fearless, and it is plain that Wade Miller is
not the only one in love with her.""Mebbe ye're roight, Frankie."The fellow tried to lead me into a trap--tried
to get me to boast of a mash on her.I could see his eyes gleam with
jealousy.In her eagerness to save us--to have him aid her in the
work--she must have led him to suspect that one of us had been making
love to her."Barney whistled a bit, and then he shyly said:

"Oi wunder av wan of us didn't do a bit av thot?""We talked in a friendly manner--in fact, she
promised to be a friend to me.I may have expressed admiration for her
hair, or something of the sort, but I vow I did not make love to her.""Well, me b'y, ye have a thrick av gettin' all th' girruls shtuck on yez
av ye look at thim, so ye didn't nade ter make love.""It's nivver a fault at all, at all, me lad.Oi wish Oi wur built th'
soame woay, but it's litthle oice I cut wid th' girruls.This south av
Oireland brogue thot Oi foind mesilf unable to shake counts against me a
bit, Oi belave.""I should think Miller and Muriel would clash.""It's plain enough that Miller is afraid av Muriel.""And Muriel intends to keep him thus.I fancy it was a good thing for us
that Kate Kenyon suspected Wade Miller of having a hand in our capture,
and told Muriel that we had been carried off by him, for I fancy that is
exactly what happened.Muriel was angry with Miller, and he seized the
opportunity to call the fellow down.But for that, he might not have
made such a hustle to save us.""Thin we should be thankful thot Muriel an' Miller do not love ache
ither."The boys continued to discuss the situation for some time, and then they
fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned.It did not
seem to have a window anywhere, and the single door appeared to be the
only means of entering or leaving the place."There's little show of escaping from this room," said Frank."This wur built to kape iverything safe
thot came in here."A few minutes later there was a sound at the door, and Muriel came in,
with two of the Black Caps at his heels."Ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o' ther cards," said the
boy moonshiner."An' yo're goin' ter have a fair an' squar' deal.""We will have to submit," said Frank, quietly."You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this
room," said Muriel.The men each held the end of a stout rope, and the boys were forced to
submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them.Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say
anything.When their hands were tied, Muriel said:

"Follow."He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily
along at his heels.They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was
lighted by three oil lamps.The room was well filled with the
black-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent
circle, with their backs against the walls.Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched.The door closed,
and Muriel addressed the Black Caps."It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther
cards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only
one objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind.Now we mean ter
have this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out
an' see that it is.Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards
an' one ter draw.Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he
believed one of them was Wade Miller.A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that
told of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men.Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,
should there be any fraud.An awed hush seemed to settle over the room.The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of
them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack.Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was
silent, standing stiff and straight.Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes
in his mask like twin stars.The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller
reached out his hand to draw.Then Frank suddenly cried:

"Wait!That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this
matter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?"Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man
who held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:

"Stop!Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards.He shuffled
them, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel.He
"shook them up" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who
was to hold them.Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless.Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the
draw, holding the fateful card up for all to see.From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man
beheld the black card which was exposed to view.Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no
sound came from his lips.Barney Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve.Indeed, the Irish lad
laughed recklessly as he cried:

"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie.Th' snakes had it
fixed fer us all th' toime."The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a
spring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand.Mary journeyed to the garden.Let's give ther critters a fair
show.""Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?"John went to the kitchen."Not knowin' it," answered Muriel."But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther
same."One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther
nine o' hearts."Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot
into Frank Merriwell's heart.Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be
done with ther spies."Mary travelled to the office."Them boys is goin' ter
have a squar' show."It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check.His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon
Muriel.The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand
of the man who had held them."Release one of the prisoners," was his command."The cards shall be
shuffled again."Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him
to shuffle.He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them
back to Muriel.Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second
drawing."Be careful an' not get two cards this time," warned Muriel as he faced
Miller."This draw settles ther business fer them-uns."The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped
forward to draw.Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the
card that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the
captives stood still.He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against
him.For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a
muttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to
view.Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the
floor.Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath.It was plain that
some were disappointed, and some were well satisfied."They-uns won't be put out o'
ther way ter-night.""An' I claim that it don't," returned the youthful moonshiner, without
lifting his voice in the least."You-uns all agreed ter ther second
draw, an' that lets them off.""But
them critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!""By that yer mean--jes' what?""They're not liable ter git out alive.""Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at
ther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!"Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but
it was plain that he meant every word."Wal," muttered Miller, "what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn
'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?"I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther
maountings.Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'.Ter-morrer night it can be done."He seemed to know it was useless to make further
talk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger.The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly
peril they had passed through, and Muriel nodded in a satisfied way when
he had looked them over."Come," he said, in a low tone, "you-uns will have ter go back ter ther
room whar ye war a bit ago."They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief
that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment.Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys
free."Suspecting you of double-dealing."It seemed that you had saved us from being
hanged, but that you intended to finish us here.""Ef that war my scheme, why did I take ther trouble ter save ye at all?""It looked as if you did so to please Miss Kenyon.You had saved us, and
then, if the men disposed of us in the regular manner, you would not be
to blame."Muriel shook back his long, black hair, and his manner showed that he
was angry.He did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been
doubted."Wal," he said, slowly, "ef it hadn't been fer me you-uns would be gone
<DW53>s now.""You-uns know I saved ye, but ye don't know how I done it."There was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the
youthful moonshiner.He continued:

"I done that fer you I never done before fer no man.I wouldn't a done
it fer myself!""Do you-uns want ter know what I done?""When I snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o' ther man what
drawed it.It war ther ace o' spades, an' it condemned yer ter die."Thar war one card drawed, an' that war all!""That war whar I cheated," he said, simply."I had ther red card in my
hand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed.In that way I
knowed I could give yer two shows ter escape death."The boys were astounded by this revelation, but they did not doubt that
Muriel spoke the truth.His manner showed that he was not telling a
falsehood.And this strange boy--this remarkable leader of moonshiners--had done
such a thing to save them!More than ever, they marveled at the fellow.Once more Muriel's arms were folded over his breast, and he was leaning
gracefully against the door, his eyes watching their faces.For several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and
surprise.Frank was not a little confused, thinking as he did how he had
misunderstood this mysterious youth.It seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two
lads who were utter strangers to him.A sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask, and Muriel
flung out one hand, with an impatient gesture."I know what you-uns is thinkin' of," declared the young moonshiner."Ye
wonder why I done so.Wal, I don't jes' know myself, but I promised Kate
ter do my best fer ye."cried Frank, "kept it nobly!Muriel, you
may be a moonshiner, you may be the leader of the Black Caps, but I am
proud to know you!I believe you are white all the way through!"exclaimed the youth, with a show of satisfaction, "that makes me
feel better.But it war Kate as done it, an' she's ther one ter thank;
but it ain't likely you-uns'll ever see her ag'in.""Then, tell her," said Frank, swiftly, "tell her for us that we are very
thankful--tell her we shall not forget her.He seemed about to speak, and then checked
himself."I'll tell her," nodded Muriel, his voice sounding a bit strange."Is
that all you-uns want me ter tell her?""Tell her I would give much to see her again," came swiftly from Frank's
lips."She's promised to be my friend, and right well has she kept that
promise.""Then I'll have ter leave you-uns now.Breakfast will be brought ter ye, and when another night comes, a guard
will go with yer out o' ther maountings.He held out a hand, and Muriel seemed to hesitate.After a few moments,
the masked lad shook his head, and, without another word, left the room.cried Barney, scratching his head, "thot felly is worse than
Oi thought!Oi don't know so much about him now as Oi did bafore Oi met
him at all, at all!"They made themselves as
comfortable as possible, and talked over the thrilling events of the
night."If Kate Kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a
convict, I should think this Muriel must be her brother," said Frank."Av he's not her brither, it's badly shtuck on her he must be, Oi
dunno," observed Barney."An' av he be shtuck on her, pwhoy don't he git
onter th' collar av thot Miller?"Finally, when they had tired
of talking, the boys lay down and tried to sleep.Frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight
rustling in that very room, and his eyes flew open in a twinkling.He
started up, a cry of wonder surging to his lips, and being smothered
there.Kate Kenyon stood within ten feet of him!As Frank started up, the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips,
warning him to be silent.Frank sprang to his feet, and Barney Mulloy sat up, rubbing his eyes and
beginning to speak."Pwhat's th' matter now, me b'y?Are yez---- Howly shmoke!"Barney clasped both hands over his mouth, having caught the warning
gestures from Frank and the girl.Still the exclamation had escaped his
lips, although it was not uttered loudly.Swiftly Kate Kenyon flitted across the room, listening with her ear to
the door to hear any sound beyond.After some moments, she seemed
satisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had
happened within that room, and she came back, standing close to Frank,
and whispering:

"Ef you-uns will trust me, I judge I kin git yer out o' this scrape."exclaimed Frank, softly, as he caught her hand."We have
you to thank for our lives!Kate--your pardon!--Miss Kenyon, how can we
ever repay you?""Don't stop ter talk 'bout that now," she said, with chilling
roughness."Ef you-uns want ter live, an' yer want ter git erway frum
Wade Miller, git reddy ter foller me.""But how are we to leave this room?She silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner, and they saw that
a small trapdoor was standing open."We kin git out that way," she said.The boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they
examined the place, but there was no time for investigation.Kate Kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening.Pausing beside it, she
pointed downward, saying:

"Go ahead; I'll foller and close ther door."The boys did not hesitate, for they placed perfect confidence in the
girl now.Barney dropped down in advance, and his feet found some rude
stone steps.In a moment he had disappeared, and then Frank followed.As lightly as a fairy, Kate Kenyon dropped through the opening, closing
the door behind her.The boys found themselves in absolute darkness, in some sort of a
narrow, underground place, and there they paused, awaiting their guide.Her hand touched Frank as she slipped past, and he
caught the perfume of wild flowers.To him she was like a beautiful wild
flower growing in a wilderness of weeds.The boys heard the word, and they moved slowly forward through the
darkness, now and then feeling dank walls on either hand.For a considerable distance they went on in this way, and then the
passage seemed to widen out, and they felt that they had entered a cave."Keep close ter me," directed the girl.Now you-uns can't git astray."At last a strange smell came to their nostrils, seemingly on the wings
of a light breath of air."Ther mill whar ther moonshine is made."Never for a moment did she
hesitate; she seemed to have the eyes of an owl.All at once they heard the sound of gently running water."Lost Creek runs through har," answered the girl.So the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern, and the cave was
near one of the illicit distilleries.Frank cared to know no more, for he did not believe it was healthy to
know too much about the makers of moonshine.It was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave.They saw
the opening before them, and then, of a sudden, a dark figure arose
there--the figure of a man with a gun in his hands!FRANK'S SUSPICION.Kate uttered the words, and the boys began to recover from their alarm,
as she did not hesitate in the least.I put him thar ter watch
out while I war in hyar."Of a sudden, Kate struck a match, holding it so the
light shone on her face, and the figure at the mouth of the cave was
seen to wave its hand and vanish."Ther coast is clear," assured the girl."But it's gittin' right nigh
mornin', an' we-uns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light.The boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible.They passed out of the dark cavern into the cool, sweet air of a spring
morning, for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness, and
the birds were twittering from the thickets.The phantom of a moon was in the sky, hanging low down and half-inverted
as if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep
in Lost Creek Valley.The sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air, and
from some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful
watchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring."Thar's somethin' stirrin' at 'Bize Wiley's, ur his dorg wouldn't be
kickin' up all that racket," observed Kate Kenyon."He lives by ther
road that comes over from Bildow's Crossroads.Folks comin' inter ther
maountings from down below travel that way."The boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of
the cave, but they saw nothing of him.He had slipped away into the
bushes which grew thick all around the opening."Come on," said the girl, after seeming strangely interested in the
barking of the dog."We'll git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin.Foller me, an' be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen."Now that they could see her, she led them forward at a swift pace, which
astonished them both.She did not run, but she seemed to skim over the
ground, and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered
some deep, lowland pines.Through this strip of woods she swiftly led them, and they came near to
Lost Creek, where it flowed down in the dismal valley.There they found the ruins of an old mill, the moss-covered water-wheel
forever silent, the roof sagging and falling in, the windows broken out
by mischievous boys, the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted
appearance.The road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown
with weeds.Later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks.Wild
sassafras grew along the roadside."That's whar you-uns must hide ter-day," said Kate, motioning toward the
mill."We are not criminals, nor are we
revenue spies.I do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog.""It's better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion.Ef you-uns'll take my
advice, you'll come inter ther mill thar, an' ye'll keep thar all day,
an' keep mighty quiet.I know ye're nervy, but thar ain't no good in
bein' foolish.It'll be known that you-uns have escaped, an' then Wade
Miller will scour ther country.Ef he come on yer----"

"Give us our arms, and we'll be ready to meet Mr."But yer wouldn't meet him alone; thar'd be others with him, an' you-uns
wouldn't have no sorter show."Kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth,
and they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill.She led them into the mill, which was dank and dismal.The imperfect
light failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet, but
she warned them, and they escaped injury.The miller had lived in the mill, and the girl took them to the part of
the old building that had served as a home."Har," she said, opening a closet door, "I've brung food fer you-uns, so
yer won't starve, an' I knowed ye'd be hongry.""You are more than thoughtful, Miss Kenyon.""Yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other, Frank."She spoke the words in a tone of reproach.Barney turned away, winking uselessly at nothing at all, and kept his
back toward them for some moments.But Frank Merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl
of the mountains.She had promised to be his friend; she had proved
herself his friend, and as no more than a friend did he propose to
accept her.That he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in Kate
Kenyon's breast seemed evident, and the girl was so artless that she
could not conceal her true feelings toward him.They stood there, talking in a low tone, while the morning light stole
in at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room.As he did so a new thought
came to him--a thought that was at first a mere suspicion, which he
scarcely noted at all.This suspicion grew, and he found himself asking:

"Kate, are you sure your brother is still wearing a convict's suit?""You do not know that he is dead--you have not heard of his death?"Her eyes flashed, and a look of pride swept across her face."Folks allus 'lowed Rufe Kenyon wa'n't afeard o' ary two-legged critter
livin', an' they war right."She clutched his arm, beginning to pant, as she asked:

"What makes you say that?I knowed he'd try it some day, but--but, have
you heard anything?The suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye.If Rufe
Kenyon was not at liberty, then he must be right in what he thought."I do not know that your brother has tried to escape.I did think that he might be Muriel, the
moonshiner.""You-uns war plumb mistooken thar," she said, positively."Rufe is not
Muriel.""Then," cried Frank, "you are Muriel yourself!""Have you-uns gone plumb dafty?"asked the girl, in a dazed way."But you are--I am sure of it," said Frank, swiftly.Of course I'm not Muriel; but he's ther best
friend I've got in these maountings."Frank was far from satisfied, but he was too courteous to insist after
this denial.Kate laughed the idea to scorn, saying over and over that
the boy must be "dafty," but still his mind was unchanged.To be sure, there were some things not easily explained, one being how
Muriel concealed her luxurious red hair, for Muriel's hair appeared to
be coal-black.Another thing was that Wade Miller must know Muriel and Kate were one
and the same, and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch
his victims from his maws.Barney Mulloy had been more than astounded by Frank's words; the Irish
youth was struck dumb.When he could collect himself, he softly
muttered:

"Well, av all th' oideas thot takes th' cake!"Having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought
there, Kate said:

"Har is two revolvers fer you-uns.Don't use 'em unless yer have ter,
but shoot ter kill ef you're forced."Oi'm ready fer th' spalpanes!"cried Barney, as he grasped one
of the weapons."Next time Wade Miller and his
gang will not catch us napping.""Roight, me b'y; we'll be sound awake, Frankie."Kate bade them good-by, assuring them that she would return with the
coming of another night, and making them promise to await her, and then
she flitted away, slipped out of the mill, soon vanishing amid the
pines."It's dead lucky we are ter be living, Frankie," observed Barney."I quite agree with you," laughed Merriwell."This night has been a
black and tempestuous one, but we have lived through it, and I do not
believe we'll find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the
Tennessee mountains."They were hungry, and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been
provided for them.When breakfast was over, Barney said:

"Frankie, it's off yer trolley ye git sometoimes.""What do you mean by that, Barney?Oi wur thinkin' av pwhat yez said about Kate Kenyon being
Mooriel, th' moonshoiner.""I was not off my trolley so very much then.""G'wan, me b'y!"You think so, but I have made a study of Muriel and of Kate Kenyon.I
am still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise.""An' Oi say ye're crazy.No girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does,
an' no band av min loike th' moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul
loike Kate Kenyon ter boss thim.""They do not know Muriel is a girl.That is, I am sure the most of them
do not know it--do not dream it.""Thot shows their common sinse, fer Oi don't belave it mesilf.""I may be wrong, but I shall not give it up yet.""Whoy, think pwhat a divvil thot Muriel is!An' th' color av his hair is
black, whoile the girrul's is red.""I have thought of those things, and I have wondered how she concealed
that mass of red hair; still I am satisfied she does it.""Well, it's no use to talk to you at all, at all."However, they did discuss it for some time.Finally they fell to exploring the old mill, and they wandered from one
part to another till they finally came to the place where they had
entered over a sagging plank.They were standing there, just within the
deeper shadow of the mill, when a man came panting and reeling from the
woods, his hat off, his shirt torn open at the throat, great drops of
perspiration standing on his face, a wild, hunted look in his eyes, and
dashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old
mill.Frank clutched Barney, and the boys fell back a step, watching the man,
who was looking back over his shoulder and listening, the perfect
picture of a hunted thing."They're close arter me--ther dogs!"came in a hoarse pant from the
man's lips."But I turned on 'em--I doubled--an' I hope I fooled 'em.It's my last chance, fer I'm dead played, and I'm so nigh starved that
it's all I kin do ter drag one foot arter t'other."He listened again, and then, as if overcome by a sudden fear of being
seen there, he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the
mill.In the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace,
struggling desperately.He tried to hurl Frank to the floor, and he would have succeeded had he
been in his normal condition, for he was a man of great natural
strength; but he was exhausted by flight and hunger, and, in his
weakened condition, the man found his supple antagonist too much for
him.A gasp came from the stranger's lips as he felt the boy give him a
wrestler's trip and fling him heavily to the floor.When he opened his eyes, Frank and
Barney were bending over him."Wal, I done my best," he said, huskily; "but you-uns trapped me at
last.I dunno how yer knew I war comin' har, but ye war on hand ter meet
me.""You have made a mistake," said Frank, in a reassuring tone."We are not
your enemies at all.""We are not your enemies; you are not trapped."The man seemed unable to believe what he heard."Fugitives, like yourself," assured Frank, with a smile.He looked them over, and shook his head.I'm wore ter ther bone--I'm a
wreck!Oh, it's a cursed life I've led sence they dragged me away from
har!Night an' day hev I watched for a chance ter break away, and' I war
quick ter grasp it when it came.They shot at me, an' one o' their
bullets cut my shoulder har.It war a close call, but I got away.Then
they follered, an' they put houn's arter me.Twenty times hev they been
right on me, an' twenty times hev I got erway.But it kep' wearin' me
weaker an' thinner.My last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an'
fight fer me, an' I came har--back home!I tried ter git inter 'Bije
Wileys' this mornin', but his dorg didn't know me, I war so changed, an'
ther hunters war close arter me, so I hed ter run fer it."exclaimed Barney; "we hearrud th' dog barruckin'.""So we did," agreed Frank, remembering how the creature had been
clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak."I kem har," continued the man, weakly."I turned on ther devils, but
when I run in har an' you-uns tackled me, I judged I had struck a trap.""It was no trap, Rufe Kenyon," said Frank, quietly.The hunted man started up and slunk away."An' still ye say you-uns are not my enemies.""No; but we have heard of you.""She saved us from certain death last night, and she brought us here to
hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country.""I judge you-uns is givin' it ter me straight," he said, slowly; "but I
don't jes' understan'."What had moonshiners agin' you-uns?"Well, we are not spies; but we were unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of Wade Miller, and he has sworn to end our lives."cried Rufe, showing his teeth in an ugly manner."An' I
s'pose he's hangin' 'roun' Kate, same as he uster?""He is giving her more or less trouble.""Wal, he won't give her much trouble arter I git at him.I'm goin' ter tell you-uns somethin'.Miller allus pretended
ter be my friend, but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me
an' got me arrested!He done it because I tol' him Kate war too good fer
him.I know it, an' one thing why I wanted ter git free war ter come har
an' fix ther critter so he won't ever bother Kate no more.I hev swore
ter fix him, an' I'll do it ef I live ter meet him face ter face!"He had grown wildly excited, and he sat up, with his back against a
post, his eyes gleaming redly, and a white foam flecking his lips.At
that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog.When Kenyon was calmer, Frank told the story of the adventures which had
befallen the boys since entering Lost Creek Valley.The fugitive
listened quietly, watching them closely with his sunken eyes, and,
having heard all, said:

"I judge you-uns tells ther truth.Ef I kin keep hid till Kate gits
har--till I see her--I'll fix things so you won't be bothered much.Wade
Miller's day in Lost Creek Valley is over."The boys took him up to the living room of the old mill, where they
furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast.He ate like a famished thing, washing the dry bread down with great
swallows of water.When he had finished and his hunger was satisfied, he
was quite like another man.he cried; "now I am reddy fer anything!"And you'll tell me ef thar's danger?"So the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep.He slept soundly
for some hours, and, when he opened his eyes, his sister had her arms
about his neck.He sat up and clasped her in his arms, a look of joy on his face.It is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting.The boys
had left brother and sister alone together, and the two remained thus
for nearly an hour, at the end of which time Rufe knew all that had
happened since he was taken from Lost Creek Valley, and Kate had also
been made aware of the perfidy of Wade Miller."I judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back,"
said Kate, when the four were together."Now looker how I helped
you-uns, an' then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer
Rufe.He found ye har, an' you-uns hev fed him an' watched while he
slept.""An' I hev tol' Kate all about Wade Miller
