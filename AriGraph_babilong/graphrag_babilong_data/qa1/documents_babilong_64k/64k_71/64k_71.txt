The name Pallas is derived from
the tradition of Pallas having accompanied Sesostris in his Asiatic
expeditions with the Lybian women, and she may have been a native of the
Jereed.The lake measures from north-east to south-west about seventy
English miles, with a third of the breadth, but it is not one collection
of water; there being several dry places, like so many islands,
interspersed over its surface, depending however, as to their number and
extent upon the season of the year, and upon the quantity of water in
the particular season."At first, on crossing it," says a tourist, "the grass and bushes become
gradually scarcer; then follows a tract of sand, which some way beyond,
becomes in parts covered with a thin layer of salt.This, as you
advance, is thicker and more united; then we find it a compact and
unbroken mass or sheet, which can, however, be penetrated by a sword, or
other sharp instrument, and here it was found to be eleven inches in
depth; and finally in the centre, it became so hard, deep, and
concentrated, as to baffle all attempts at breaking its surface except
with a pickaxe.The horse's shoe, in fact, makes no impression upon its
stone-like surface."The salt of the lake is considerably weaker than that of the sea, and
not adapted for preserving provisions, though its flavour is very
agreeable; it is not exported, nor made in any way an article of
commerce.The Jereed, from the existence in it of a few antiquities, such as
pieces of granite and marble, and occasionally a name or a classic
inscription, is proved to have been in the possession of the Romans, and
undoubtedly of the Carthaginians before them, who could have had no
difficulty in holding this flat and exposed country.The trade and resources of this country consist principally in dates.The quantity exported to other parts of the Regency, as well as to
foreign countries, where their fine quality is well known, is in round
numbers on an average from three to four thousand quintals per annum.But in Jereed itself, twenty thousand people live six months of the year
entirely on dates."A great number of poles," says Sir Grenville Temple, "are arranged
across the rooms at the height of eight or nine feet from the ground,
and from these are suspended rich and large bunches of dates, which
compose the winter store of the inhabitants; and in one corner of the
room is one or more large earthern jars about six or seven feet high,
also filled with dates pressed close together, and at the bottom of the
jar is a cock, from which is drawn the juice in the form of a thick
luscious syrup.It is scarcely possible to imagine anything more
palatable than this'sweet of sweets.'"As we are writing of the country of dates, _par excellence_, I must
needs give some description of the palm, but it will be understood that
the information is Tunisian, or collected in Tunis, and may differ in
some respects from details collected in other parts of North Africa.The
date-palm abounds in the maritime as well as in the inland districts of
North Africa.They are usually propagated from shoots of full grown
trees, which if transplanted and taken care of, will yield in six or
seven years, whilst those raised immediately from the stone require
sixteen years to produce fruit.The date-palm is male and female, or _dioecious_, and requires
communication, otherwise the fruit is dry and insipid.The age of the
palm, in its greatest vigour, is about thirty years, according to the
Tunisians, after planting, and will continue in vigour for seventy
years, bearing anually fifteen or twenty clusters of dates, each of them
fifteen or twenty pounds in weight; after this long period, they begin
gradually to wither away.But the Saharan Tripolitans will tell you that
the date-palm does not attain its age of full vigour till it reaches a
hundred years, and then will flourish two or or three centuries before
it withers!The only culture requisite, is to be well watered at the roots once in
four or five days, and to have the lower boughs cut off when they begin
to droop and wither.Much rain, however, injures the dates, and we know
that the countries in which they flourish, are mostly without rain.In
many localities in Africa, date-palms can never be watered in the dry
season; it is nevertheless observable that generally wherever a palm
grows and thrives water may usually be obtained by boring.The sap, or
honey of the palm is a delicious and wholesome beverage when drunk quite
fresh; but if allowed to remain for some hours, it acquires a sharp
taste, something like cider, and becomes very intoxicating.It is called
poetically _leghma_, "tears" of the dates.When a tree is found not to
produce much fruit, the head is cut off, and a bowl or cavity scooped
out of the summit, in which the rising sap is collected, and this is
drunk in its pure state without any other preparation.If the tree be
not exhausted by draining, in five or six months it grows afresh; and,
at the end of two or three years, may again be cut or tapped.The palm
is capable of undergoing this operation five or six times, and it may be
easily known how often a tree has been cut by the number of rings of a
narrow diameter which are seen towards its summit; but, if the sap is
allowed to flow too long, it will perish entirely at the end of a year.This sap, by distillation, produces an agreeable spirit called _Araky_
or _Arak_: from the fruit also the Jews distil a spirit called _bokka_,
or what we should call _toddy_.It is usual for persons of distinction
to entertain their friends upon a marriage, or the birth of a child,
with this pure sap, and a tree is usually tapped for the purpose.It
would appear that tapping the palm was known to the ancients, for a
cornelian _intaglio_ of Roman antiquity, has been found in the Jereed,
representing a tree in this state, and the jars in which the juice was
placed.Dates are likewise dried in the sun, and reduced into a kind of meal,
which will keep for any length of time, and which thus becomes a most
valuable resource for travellers crossing the deserts, who frequently
make it their only food, moistening a handful of it with a little water.Certain preparations are made of the male plant, to which medicinal
virtues are attributed; the younger leaves, eaten with salt, vinegar,
and oil, make an excellent salad.The heart of the tree, which lies at
top between the fruit branches, and weighs from ten to twenty pounds, is
eaten only on grand occasions, as those already mentioned, and possesses
a delicious flavour between that of a banana and a pine-apple.The palm, besides these valuable uses to which it is applied,
superseding or supplying the place of all other vegetables to the tribes
of the Jereed, is, nevertheless, still useful for a great variety of
other purposes.The most beautiful baskets, and a hundred other
nick-nackery of the wickery sort are made of its branches; ropes are
made and vestments wove from the long fibres, and its wood, also, when
hardened by age, is used for building.Indeed, we may say, it is the all
and everything of the Jereed, and, as it is said of the camel and the
desert, _the palm is made for the Jereed, and the Jereed is made for the
palm_.The Mussulmen make out a complete case of piety and superstition in the
palm, and pretend that _they are made for the palm, and the palm is made
for them_, alleging that, as soon as the Turks conquered Constantinople,
the palm raised its graceful flowing head over the domes of the former
infidel city, whilst when the Moors evacuated Spain, the palm pined
away, and died."God," adds the pious Mussulman, "has given us the palm;
amongst the Christians, it will not grow!"But the poetry of the palm is
an inseparable appendage in the North African landscape, and even town
scenery.The Moor and the Arab, whose minds are naturally imbued with
the great images of nature, so glowingly represented also in the sacred
leaves of the Koran, cannot imagine a mosque or the dome-roof of a
hermitage, without the dark leaf of the palm overshadowing it; but the
serenest, loveliest object on the face of the landscape is _the lonely
palm_, either thrown by chance on the brow of some savage hill or
planted by design to adorn some sacred spot of mother-earth.I must still give some other information which I have omitted respecting
this extraordinary tree.And, after this, I further refer the reader to
a Tour in the Jereed of which some details are given in succeeding
pages.A palm-grove is really a beautiful object, and requires scarcely
less attention than a vineyard.The trees are generally planted in a
_quincunx_, or at times without any regular order; but at distances from
each other of four or five yards.The situation selected is mostly on
the banks of some stream or rivulet, running from the neighbouring
hills, and the more abundant the supply of water, the healthier the
plants and the finer the fruit.For this tree, which loves a warm
climate, and a sandy soil, is yet wonderfully improved by frequent
irrigation, and, singularly, the _quality_ of the water appears of
little consequence, being salt or sweet, or impregnated with nitre, as
in the Jereed.Irrigation is performed in the spring, and through the whole summer.The
water is drawn by small channels from the stream to each individual
tree, around the stalk and root of which a little basin is made and
fenced round with clay, so that the water, when received, is detained
there until it soaks into the earth.(All irrigation is, indeed,
effected in this way.)As to the abundance of the plantations, the fruit
of one plantation alone producing fifteen hundred camels' loads of
dates, or four thousand five hundred quintals, three quintals to the
load, is not unfrequently sold for one thousand dollars.Besides the
Jereed, Tafilett, in Morocco, is a great date-country.Jackson says,
"We found the country covered with most magnificent plantations, and
extensive forests of the lofty date, exhibiting the most elegant and
picturesque appearance that nature on a plain surface can present to the
admiring eye.In these forests, there is no underwood, so that a
horseman may gallop through them without impediment."Our readers will see, when they come to the Tour, that this description
of the palm-groves agrees entirely with that of Mr.I have already mentioned that the palm is male and female, or,
as botanists say, _dioecious_; the Moors, however, pretend that the palm
in this respect is just like the human being.The _female_ palm alone
produces fruit and is cultivated, but the presence or vicinity of the
_male_ is required, and in many oriental countries there is a law that
those who own a palm-wood must have a certain number of _male_ plants in
proportion.In Barbary they seem to trust to chance, relying on the male
plants which grow wild in the Desert.They hang and shake them over the
female plants, usually in February or March.Koempfe says, that the male
flowers, if plucked when ripe, and cautiously dried, will even, in this
state, perform their office, though kept to the following year.The Jereed is a very important portion of the Tunisian territory,
Government deriving a large revenue from its inhabitants.It is visited
every year by the "Bey of the Camp," who administers affairs in this
country as a sovereign; and who, indeed, is heir-apparent to the
Tunisian throne.Immediately on the decease of the reigning Bey, the
"Bey of the Camp" occupies the hereditary beylick, and nominates his
successor to the camp and the throne, usually the eldest of the other
members of the royal family, the beylick not being transmitted from
father to son, only on the principle of age.At least, this has been the
general rule of succession for many years.The duties of the "Bey of the Camp" is to visit with a "flying-camp,"
for the purpose of collecting tribute, the two circuits or divisions of
the Regency.I now introduce to the reader the narrative of a Tour to the Jereed,
extracted from the notebooks of the tourists, together with various
observations of my own interspersed, and some additional account of
Toser, Nefta, and Ghafsa.Tour in the Jereed of Captain Balfour and Mr.Reade.--Sidi Mohammed.--
Plain of Manouba.--Tunis.--Tfeefleeah.--The Bastinado.--Turkish
Infantry.--Kairwan.--Sidi Amour Abeda.--Saints.--A French Spy--
Administration of Justice.--The Bey's presents.--The Hobara.--Ghafsa.Hot streams containing Fish.--Snakes.--Incantation.--Moorish Village.The tourists were Captain Balfour, of the 88th Regiment, and Mr.Richard
Reade, eldest son of Sir Thomas Reade.The morning before starting from Tunis they went to the Bardo to pay
their respects to Sidi Mohammed, "Bey of the Camp," and to thank him for
his condescending kindness in taking them with him to the Jereed.The
Bey told him to send their baggage to Giovanni, "Guarda-pipa," which
they did in the evening.At nine A. M. Sidi Mohammed left the Bardo under a salute from the guns,
one of the wads of which nearly hit Captain Balfour on the head.The Bey
proceeded across the plain of Manouba, mounted on a beautiful bay
charger, in front of the colours, towards Beereen, the greater part of
the troops of the expedition following, whilst the entire plain was
covered with baggage-camels, horses, mules, and detached parties of
attendants, in glorious confusion.The force of the camp consisted of--Mamelukes
  of the Seraglio, superbly mounted               20

  Mamelukes of the Skeefah, or those who
  guard the entrance of the Bey's
  palace, or tent, and are all Levantines         20

  Boabs, another sort of guard of the Bey,
  who are always about the Bey's
  tent, and must be of this country               20

  Turkish Infantry                               300
  Spahis, o. mounted Arab guards                 300
  Camp followers (Arabs)                       2,000
                                               -----
             Total                             2,660

This is certainly not a large force, but in several places of the march
they were joined for a short time by additional Arab troops, a sort of
honorary welcome for the Bey.As they proceeded, the force of the
camp-followers increased; but, in returning, it gradually decreased, the
parties going home to their respective tribes.We may notice the total
absence of any of the new corps, the Nithalm.This may have been to
avoid exciting the prejudices of the people; however, the smallness of
the force shows that the districts of the Jereed are well-affected.The
summer camp to Beja has a somewhat larger force, the Arabs of that and
other neighbouring districts not being so loyal to the Government.Besides the above-named troops, there were two pieces of artillery.The
band attendant on these troops consisted of two or three flageolets,
kettle-drums, and trumpets made of cow-horns, which, according to the
report of our tourists, when in full play produced the most diabolical
discord.After a ride of about three hours, we pitched our tents at Beereen.Through the whole of the route we marched on an average of about four
miles per hour, the horses, camels, &c., walking at a good pace.The
Turkish infantry always came up about two hours after the mounted
troops.Immediately on the tents being pitched, we went to pay our
respects to the Bey, accompanied by Giovanni, "Guardapipa," as
interpreter.His Highness received us very affably, and bade us ask for
anything we wanted.Afterwards, we took some luncheon with the Bey's
doctor, Signore Nunez Vaise, a Tuscan Jew, of whose kindness during our
whole tour it is impossible to speak too highly.The doctor had with him
an assistant, and tent to himself.Haj Kador, Sidi Shakeer, and several
other Moors, were of our luncheon-party, which was a very merry one.About half-way to Beereen, the Bey stopped at a marabet, a small square
white house, with a dome roof, to pay his devotions to a great Marabout,
or saint, and to ask his parting blessing on the expedition.They told
us to go on, and joined us soon after.Two hours after us, the Turkish
Agha arrived, accompanied with colours, music, and some thirty men.The
Bey received the venerable old gentleman under an immense tent in the
shape of an umbrella, surrounded with his mamelukes and officers of
state.After their meeting and saluting, three guns were fired.The Agha
was saluted every day in the same manner, as he came up with his
infantry after us.We retired for the night at about eight o'clock.The form of the whole camp, when pitched, consisting of about a dozen
very large tents, was as follows:--The Bey's tent in the centre, which
was surrounded at a distance of about forty feet with those of the
Bash-Hamba [31] of the Arabs, the Agha of the Arabs, the Sahab-el-Tabah,
Haznadar or treasurer, the Bash-Boab, and that of the English tourists;
then further off were the tents of the Katibs and Bash-Katib, the
Bash-Hamba of the Turks, the doctors, and the domestics of the Bey, with
the cookery establishment.Among the attendants of the Bey were the
"guarda-pipa," guard of the pipe, "guarda-fusile," guard of the gun,
"guarda-cafe," guard of the coffee, "guarda-scarpe," guard of the shoes,
[32] and "guarda-acqua," guard of water.A man followed the Bey about
holding in his hand a golden cup, and leading a mule, having two paniers
on its back full of water, which was brought from Tunis by camels.There
was also a story-teller, who entertained the Bey every night with the
most extraordinary stories, some of them frightfully absurd.The Bey did
not smoke--a thing extraordinary, as nearly all men smoke in Tunis.None of his ladies ever accompany him in
these expeditions.The tents had in them from twenty to fifty men each.Our tent consisted
of our two selves, a Boab to guard the baggage, two Arabs to tend the
horses and camels, and another Moor of all work, besides Captain
Balfour's Maltese, called Michael.The first night we found very cold; but having abundance of clothing, we
slept soundly, in spite of the perpetual wild shoutings of the Arab
sentries, stationed round the camp, the roaring and grumbling of the
camels, the neighing and coughing of the horses, all doing their utmost
to drive away slumber from our eyelids.We halted on the morrow, which gave us an opportunity of getting a few
things from Tunis which we had neglected to bring.But before returning,
we ate some sweetmeats sent us by the guarda-pipa, with a cup of coffee.The guarda-pipa is also a dragoman interpreter of his Highness, and a
Genoese by birth, but now a renegade.In this country they do not know
what a good breakfast is; they take a cup of coffee in the morning
early, and wait till twelve or one o'clock, when they take a hearty
meal, and then sup in the evening, late or early, according to the
season.Before returning to Tunis, we called upon his Highness, and told
him our object.We afterwards called to see the Bey every morning, to
pay our respects to him, as was befitting on these occasions.His
Highness entered into the most familiar conversation with us.On coming back again from Tunis, it rained hard, which continued all
night.In the evening the welcome news was proclaimed that the tents
would not be struck until daylight: previously, the camp was always
struck at 3 o'clock, about three hours before daylight, which gave rise
to great confusion, besides being without shelter during the coldest
part of the night (three hours before sun-rise) was a very serious trial
for the health of the men.The reason, however, was, to enable the
camels to get up to the new encampment; their progress, though regular
and continual, is very slow.Of a morning the music played off the _reveil_ an hour before sunrise.The camp presented an animated appearance, with the striking of tents,
packing camels, mounting horses, &c. We paid our respects to his
Highness, who was sitting in an Arab tent, his own being down.The music
was incessantly grating upon our ears, but was in harmony with the
irregular marching and movements of the Arabs, one of them occasionally
rushing out of the line of march, charging, wheeling about, firing,
reloading, shouting furiously, and making the air ring with his cries.The order of march was as follows:--The Bey mounts, and, going along
about one hundred yards from the spot, he salutes the Arab guards, who
follow behind him; then, about five or six miles further, overtaking the
Turkish soldiers, who, on his coming up, are drawn up on each side of
the road, his Highness salutes them; and then afterwards the
water-carriers are saluted, being most important personages in the dry
countries of this circuit, and last of all, the gunners; after all
which, the Bey sends forward a mameluke, who returns with the Commander,
or Agha of the Arabs, to his Highness.This done, the Bey gallops off to
the right or left from the line of march, on whichsoever side is most
game--the Bey going every day to shoot, whilst the Agha takes his place
and marches to the next halting-place.One morning the Bey shot two partridges while on horseback.Rade, "he is the best shot on horseback I ever saw--he seldom
missed his game."As Captain B. was riding along with the doctor, they
remarked a cannon-ball among some ruins; but, being told a saint was
buried there, they got out of the way as quick as if a deadly serpent
had been discovered.Stretching away to the left, we saw a portion of
the remains of the Carthaginian aqueduct.The march was only from six to
eight miles, and the encampment at Tfeefleeah.At day-break, at noon, at
3 o'clock, P.M.and at sunset, the Muezzen called from outside and near
the door of the Bey's tent the hour of prayer.An aide-de-camp also
proclaimed, at the same place, whether we should halt, or march, on the
morrow, The Arabs consider fat dogs a great delicacy, and kill and eat
them whenever they can lay hands upon them.Captain B. was fortunate in
not bringing his fat pointer, otherwise he would have lost him.The
Arabs eat also foxes and wolves, and many animals of the chase not
partaken of by us.The French in Algiers kill all the fat cats, and turn
them into hares by dexterous cooking.The mornings and evenings we found
cold, but mid-day very hot and sultry.We left Tfeefleeah early, and went in search of wild-boar; found only
their tracks, but saw plenty of partridges and hares; the ground being
covered with brushwood and heath, we soonae lost sight of them.The Arabs
were seen on a sudden running and galloping in all directions, shouting
and pointing to a hill, when a huge beast was put up, bristling and
bellowing, which turned out to be a hyaena.He was shot by a mameluke, Si
Smyle, and fell in a thicket, wallowing in his blood.He was a fine
fellow, and had an immense bead, like a bull-dog.They put him on a
mule, and carried him in triumph to the Bey.When R. arrived at the
camp, the Bey sent him the skin and the head as a present, begging that
he would not eat the brain.There is a superstitious belief among the
Moors that, if a person eats the brain of a hyaena he immediately becomes
mad.The hyaena is not the savage beast commonly represented; he rarely
attacks any person, and becomes untameably ferocious by being only
chained up.He is principally remarkable for his stupidity when at large
in the woods.The animal abounds in the forests of the Morocco Atlas.Our tourists saw no lions _en route_, or in the Jereed; the lion does
not like the sandy and open country of the plain.Very thick brushwood,
and ground broken with rocks, like the ravines of the Atlas, are his
haunts.Several Arabs were flogged for having stolen the barley of which they
had charge.The bastinado was inflicted by two inferior mamelukes,
standing one on each side of the culprit, who had his hands and his feet
tied behind him.In general, it may be said that bastinadoing in Tunis
is a matter of form, many of the strokes ordered to be inflicted being
never performed, and those given being so many taps or scratches.It is
very rare to see a man bleeding from the bastinado; I (the author) never
did.It is merely threatened as a terror; whilst it is not to be
overlooked, that the soles of the feet of Arabs, and the lower classes
in this country, are like iron, from the constant habit of going
barefoot upon the sharpest stones.Severe punishments of any kind are
rarely inflicted in Tunis.The country was nearly all flat desert, with scarcely an inhabitant to
dissipate its savage appearance.The women of a few Arab horsehair tents
(waterproof when in good repair) saluted us as we passed with their
shrill looloos.We passed the
ruins of several towns and other remains.The camels were always driven
into camp at sunset, and hobbled along, their two fore-legs being tied,
or one of them being tied up to the knee, by which the poor animals are
made to cut a more melancholy figure than with their usual awkward gait
and moody character.We continued our march about ten miles in nearly a southern direction,
and encamped at a place called Heelet-el-Gazlen.One morning shortly after starting, we came to a small stream with very
high and precipitous banks, over which one arch of a fine bridge
remained, but the other being wanting, we had to make a considerable
_detour_ before we could cross; the carriages had still greater
difficulty.Here we have an almost inexcusable instance of the
disinclination of the Moors to repairs, for had the stream been swollen,
the camp would have been obliged to make a round-about march by the way
of Hamman-el-Enf, of some thirty miles; and all for the want of an arch
which would scarcely cost a thousand piastres!This stream or river is
the same as that which passes near Hamman-el-Enf, and the extensive
plain through which it meanders is well cultivated, with douwars, or
circular villages of the Arabs dotted about.We saw hares, but, the
ground being difficult running for the dogs, we caught but few.Bevies
of partridges got up, but we were unprepared for them.In the evening,
the Bey sent a present of a very fine bay horse to R. Marched about ten
miles, and halted at Ben Sayden.The following day after starting, we left the line of march to shoot;
saw one boar, plenty of foxes and wolves, and we put up another hyaena,
but the bag consisted principally of partridges, the red-legged
partridge or _perdix ruffa_, killed, by the Bey, who is a dead-shot.Our
ride lay among hills; there was very little water, which accounted for
the few inhabitants.After dinner, went out shooting near Jebanah, and
bagged a few partridges, but, not returning before the sun went down,
the Bey sent a dozen fellows bawling out our names, fearing some harm
had befallen us.On leaving the hills, there lay stretched at our feet a boundless plain,
on which is situate Kairwan, extending also to Susa, and leagues around.North Africa, is a country of hills and plains--such was the case along
our entire route.We saw a large herd of gazelles feeding, as well as
several single ones, but they have the speed of the greyhound, so we did
not grace our supper with any.Saw several birds called Kader, about the
size of a partridge, but we shot none.A good many hares and partridges
either crossed our path or whirred over our heads.Passed over a running
stream called Zebharah, where we saw the remains of an ancient bridge,
but in the place where the baggage went over there was a fine one in
good repair.Here was a small dome-topped chapel, called Sidi Farhat, in
which are laid the ashes of a saint.We had seen many such in the hills;
indeed these gubbah abound all over Barbary, and are placed more
frequently on elevations.We noticed particularly the 300 Turkish
infantry; they were irregulars with a vengeance, though regulars
compared to the Arabs.On overtaking them, they drew up on each side,
and some dozen of them kept up a running sham fight with their swords
and small wooden and metal shields before the Bey.The officers kissed
the hand of the Bey, and his treasurer tipped their band, for so we must
call their tumtums and squeaking-pipes.This ceremony took place every
morning, and they were received in the camp with all the honours.They
kept guard during the night, and did all they could to keep us awake by
their eternal cry of "Alleya," which means, "Be off," or "Keep your
distance!"These troops had not been recruited for eight years, and will
soon die off; and yet we see that the Bey treats these remnants of the
once formidable Turkish Tunisian Janissaries with great respect; of
course, in an affair with the Arabs, their fidelity to the Bey would be
most unshaken.As we journeyed onward, we saw much less vegetation and very little
cultivation.An immense plain lay before and around us, in which,
however, there was some undulating ground.Passed a good stone bridge;
were supplied with water near a large Arab encampment, around which were
many droves of camels; turned up several hares, partridges, and
gazelles.One of the last gave us a good chase, but the greyhounds
caught him; in the first half mile, he certainly beat them by a good
half of the instance, but having taken a turn which enabled the dogs to
make a short cut, and being blown, they pulled the swift delicate
creature savagely down.There were several good courses after hares,
though her pursuers gave puss no fair play, firing at her before the
dogs and heading her in every possible way.Prince Pueckler
Muskau was the fourth when he visited it in 1835.The town is clean, but
many houses are in ruins.The greater part of a regiment of the Nitham
are quartered here.The famous mosque, of course, we were not allowed to
enter, but many of its marble pillars and other ornaments, we heard from
Giovanni, were the spoils of Christian churches and Pagan temples.The
house of the Kaed was a good specimen of dwellings in this country.Going along a street, we were greatly surprised at seeing our
attendants, among whom were Si Smyle (a very intelligent and learned
man, and who taught Mr.R. Arabic during the tour) and the Bash-Boab,
jumping off their horses, and, running up to an old-looking Moor, and
then seizing his hand, kissed it; and for some time they would not leave
the ragged ruffian-like saint.At last, having joined us, they said he was Sidi Amour Abeda, a man of
exceeding sanctity, and that if the Bey had met the saint, his Highness
must have done the same.The saint accompanied us to the Kaed's house;
and, on entering, we saw the old Kaed himself, who was ill and weeping
on account of the arrival of his son, the commander of a portion of the
guards of the camp.We went up stairs, and sat down to some sweetmeats
which had been prepared for us, together with Si Smyle and Hamda, but,
as we were commencing, the saint, who was present, laid hold of the
sweets with his hands, and blessed them, mumbling _bismillas_ [33] and
other jargon.We afterwards saw a little house, in course of erection by
order of the Bey, where the remains of Sidi Amour Abeda are to be
deposited at his death, so that the old gentleman can have the pleasure
of visiting his future burial-place.In this city, a lineal descendant
of the Prophet, and a lucky guesser in the way of divining, are the
essential ingredients in the composition of a Moorish saint.Saints of
one order or another are as thick here as ordinary priests in Malta,
whom the late facetious Major Wright was accustomed to call
_crows_--from their black dress--but better, cormorants, as agreeing
with their habits of fleecing the poor people.Sidi Amour Abeda's hands
ought to be lily-white, for every one who meets him kisses them with
devout and slavering obeisance.The renegade doctor of the Bey told us
that the old dervish now in question would like nothing better than to
see us English infidels burnt alive.Fanaticism seems to be the native
growth of the human heart!We afterwards visited the Jabeah, or well, which they show as a
curiosity, as also the camel which turns round the buckets and brings up
the water, being all sanctified, like the wells of Mecca, and the
drinking of the waters forming an indispensable part of the pilgrimage
to all holy Mohammedan cities.We returned to the Kaed's, and sat down to a capital dinner.The old
Governor was a great fanatic, and when R. ran up to shake hands with
him, the mamelukes stopped R. for fear he might be insulted.We visited
the fortress, which was in course of repair, our _cicerone_ being Sidi
Reschid, an artillery-officer.We then returned to the camp, and found
Santa Maria, the French officer, had arrived, who, during the tour,
employed himself in taking sketches and making scientific observations.He was evidently a French spy on the resources of the Bey.It was given
out, however, that he was employed to draw charts of Algiers, Tunis, and
Tripoli, by his Government.He endeavoured to make himself as unpopular
as some persons try to make themselves agreeable, being very jealous of
us, and every little thing that we had he used to cry for it and beg it
like a child, sometimes actually going to the Bey's tent in person, and
asking his Highness for the things which he saw had been given to us.We went to see his Highness administer justice, which he always did,
morning and evening, whilst at Kairwan.There were many plaintiffs, but
no defendants brought up; most of them were turned out in a very summary
manner.To some, orders were given, which we supposed enabled them to
obtain redress; others were referred to the kadys and chiefs.The Bey,
being in want of camels, parties were sent out in search of them, who
drove in all the finest that they could find, which were then marked
("taba,") _a la Bey_, and immediately became the Bey's property.It was
a curious sight to see the poor animals thrown over, and the red-hot
iron put to their legs, amidst the cries and curses of their late
different owners--all which were not in the least attended to, the wants
of the Bey, or Government, being superior on such occasions of
necessity, or what not, to all complaint, law, or justice.About two
hundred changed hands in this way.The Bey of Tunis has an immense number of camels which he farms out.He
has overseers in certain districts, to whom he gives so many camels;
these let them out to other persons for mills and agricultural labours,
at so much per head.The overseers annually render an account of them to
Government, and, when called upon, supply the number required.At this
time, owing to a disorder which had caused a great mortality, camels had
been very scarce, and this was the reason of the extensive seizure just
mentioned.If an Arab commits manslaughter, his tribe is mulcted
thirty-three camels; and, as the crime is rather common in the Bedouin
districts, the Bey's acquisition in this way is considerable.A few
years ago, a Sicilian nobleman exported from Tunis to Sicily some eighty
camels, the duty for which the Bey remitted.The camel, if ever so
healthy and thriving in the islands of the Mediterranean, could never
supersede the labour of mules.The camel is only useful where there are
vast plains to travel, as in North Africa, Arabia, Persia, Australasia,
and some parts of the East Indies.A hundred more Arabs joined, who passed in a single file before the Bey
for inspection: they came rushing into the camp by twos and threes,
firing off their long guns.We crossed large plains, over which ran troops of gazelles, and had many
gallops after them; but they go much faster than the greyhound, and,
unless headed and bullied, there is little chance of taking them, except
found asleep.On coming on a troop unawares, R. shot one, which the dogs
caught.R. went up afterwards to cut its throat _a la Moresque_, when he
was insulted by an Arab.R. noticed the fellow, and afterwards told the
Bey, who instantly ordered him to receive two hundred bastinadoes, and
to be put in chains; but, just as they had begun to whip him, R. went up
and generously begged him off.This is the end of most bastinados in the
country.We passed a stream which they said had swallowed up some
persons, and was very dangerous.A muddy stream, they add, is often very
fatal to travellers.The Bey surprised Captain B. by sending him a
handsome black horse as a present; he also sent a grey one to the
Frenchman, who, when complaining of it, saying that it was a bad one, to
the Bey's mamelukes, his Highness sent for it, and gave him another.Under such circumstances, Saint Mary ought to have looked very foolish.The Bey shot a kader, a handsome bird, rather larger than a partridge,
with black wings, and flies like a plover.We had a large
hawking-establishment with us, some twenty birds, very fine falconry,
which sometimes carried off hares, and even attacked young goat-kids.Marched to a place called Gilma, near which the road passes through an
ancient town.Shaw says, "Gilma, the ancient Cilma, or Oppidum
Chilmanenense, is six leagues to the east-south-east of Spaitla.We have
here the remains of a large city, with the area of a temple, and some
other fragments of large buildings.According to the tradition of the
Arabs, this place received its name in consequence of a miracle
pretended to have been wrought by one of their marabouts, in bringing
hither the river of Spaitla, after it was lost underground.For Ja Elma
signifies, in their language, 'The water comes!'an expression we are to
imagine of surprise at the arrival of the stream."During our tour, the mornings were generally cold.We proceeded about
twenty miles, and encamped near a place called Wady Tuckah.This river
comes from the hills about three or four miles off, and when the camp
arrives at Kairwan, the Bey sends an order to the Arabs of the district
to let the water run down to the place where the tents are pitched.When
we arrived, the water had just come.We saw warrens of hares, and caught
many with the dogs.Troops of gazelles were also surprised; one was
fired at, and went off scampering on three legs.The hawks caught a
beautiful bird called hobara, or habary, [34] about the size of the
small hen-turkey, lily white on the back, light brown brindle, tuft of
long white feathers on its head, and ruffle of long black feathers,
which they stretch out at pleasure, with a large grey eye.A curious
prickly plant grows about here, something like a dwarf broom, if its
leaves were sharp thorns, it is called Kardert.The Bey made R. a
present of the hobara.One day three gazelles were caught, and also a fox, by R.'s greyhound,
which behaved extremely well, and left the other dogs in the rear, every
now and then attacking him in the hind-quarters.Saw seven or eight
hobaras, but too windy for the hawks to be flown.Captain B. chased a
gazelle himself, and had the good fortune to catch him.As soon as an
Arab secures an animal, he immediately cuts its throat, repeating
"Bismillah, Allah Akbar," "In the name (of God), God is great."We marched seventeen miles to a place called Aly Ben Own, the name of
the saint buried close by.The plain we crossed must have been once
thickly inhabited, as there were many remains.We were joined by more
Arabs, and our force continued to augment.The Bey, being in want of
horses, the same system of seizing them was adopted as with the camels.One splendid morning that broke over our encampment we had an
opportunity of witnessing Africa's most gorgeous scenery.[35] Plenty of
hobaras; they fly like a goose.The hawks took two or three of them,
also some hares.The poor hare does not know what to make of the hawks;
after a little running, it gives itself up for death, only first dodging
out of the bird's pounce, or hiding itself in a tuft of grass or a bush,
but which it is not long allowed to do, for the Arabs soon drive it out
from its vain retreat.The hawk, when he seizes the hare with one claw,
catches hold of any tuft of grass or irregularity of the ground with the
other; a strong leather strap is also fastened from one leg to the
other, to prevent them from being pulled open or strained.We came upon
a herd of small deer, called ebba, which are a little larger than the
gazelle, but they soon bounded beyond our pursuit, leaving us scarcely
time to admire their delicate make and unapproachable speed.We crossed a range of hills into another plain, at the extremity of
which lies Ghafsa.The surface was naked, with the exception of tufts of
strong, rushy grass, almost a sure indication of hares, and of which we
started a great number.We saw another description of bird, called
rhaad, [36] with white wings, which flew like a pigeon, but more
swiftly.Near our tract were the remains of a large tank of ancient
Roman construction.Marched fourteen or fifteen
miles to Zwaneah, which means "little garden," though there is no sign
of such thing, unless it be the few oranges, dates, and pomegranates
which they find here.We had water from a tank of modern construction;
some remains were close to the camp, the ancient cistern and stone duct
leading from the hills.We had two thousand camels with the camp and
following it, for which not a single atom of provender is carried, the
camels subsisting scantily upon the coarse grass, weeds or thorns, which
the soil barely affords.The camel is very fond of sharp, prickly
thorns.You look upon the animal, with its apparently most tender mouth,
chopping the sharpest thorns it can find, full of amazement!Some of the
chiefs who have lately joined us, have brought their wives with them,
riding on camels in a sort of palanquin or shut-up machine.These
palanquins have a kind of mast and shrouds, from which a bell is slung,
tinkling with the swinging motion of the camel.This rude contrivance
makes the camel more than ever "the ship of the Desert."Several fine
horses were brought in as presents to the Bey, one a very fine mare.Our next march was towards Ghafsa, about twenty miles off.We were
joined by a considerable number of fresh Arabs, who "played at powder,"
and kept firing and galloping before the Bey the whole day; some of them
managed themselves and their arms and horses with great address,
balancing the firelock on their heads, firing it, twisting it round,
throwing it into the air, and catching it again, and all without once
losing the command of their horses.An accident happened amidst the fun;
two of the parties came in contact, and one of them received a dreadful
gash on the forehead.The dresses of some of them were very rich, and
looked very graceful on horseback.A ride over sand-hills brought us in
view of the town, embedded in olive and date-trees, looking fresh and
green after our hot and dusty march; it lay stretched at the foot of a
range of hills, which formed the boundaries of another extensive plain.We halted at Ghafsa, [37] which is almost a mass of rubbish filled with
dirty people, although there are plenty of springs about, principally
hot and mineral waters.Although the Moors, by their religion, are
enjoined the constant use of the bath, yet because they do not change
their linen and other clothes, they are always very dirty.They do not,
however, exceed the Maltese and Sicilians, and many other people of the
neighbourhood, in filth, and perhaps the Moors are cleaner in their
hahits than they.The Arabs are extremely disgusting, and their women
are often seen in a cold winter's evening, standing with their legs
extended over a smoky wood fire, holding up their petticoats, and
continuing in this indelicate position for hours together.In these Thermae, or hot, sulphurous, and other mineral springs, is the
phenomenon of the existence of fish and small snakes.These were
observed by our tourists, but I shall give three other authorities
besides them.Shaw says: "'The Ouri-el-Nout,' _i.e_., 'Well of Fish,'
and the springs of Ghasa and Toser, nourish a number of small fishes of
the mullet and perch kind, and are of an easy digestion.Of the like
quality are the other waters of the Jereed, all of them, after they
become cold, being the common drink of the inhabitants."Sir Grenville
Temple remarks: "The thermometer in the water marked ninety-five
degrees; and, what is curious, a considerable number of fish is found in
this stream, which measure from four to six inches in length, and
resemble, in some degree, the gudgeon, having a delicate flavour.Bruce
mentions a similar fact, but he says he saw it in the springs of
Feriana.Part of the ancient structure of these baths still exists, and
pieces of inscriptions are observed in different places."Honneger has made a sketch of this fish.The wood-cut represents it
one half the natural size:

[Illustration]

The snake, not noticed by former tourists, has been observed by Mr.Honneger, which nourishes itself entirely upon the fish.The wood-cut
represents the snake half its natural size:

[Illustration]

The fish and the snake live together, though not very amicably, in the
hot-springs.Prince Puekler Muskau, who travelled in Tunis, narrates
that, "Near the ruins of Utica was a warm spring, in whose almost hot
waters we found several turtles, _which seemed to inhabit this basin_."However, perhaps, there is no such extraordinary difficulty in the
apprehension of this phenomenon, for "The Gulf Stream," on leaving the
Gulf of Mexico, "has a temperature of more than 27 deg.(centigrade), or
80-6/10 degrees of Fahrenheit."[38]

Many a fish must pass through and live in this stream.And after all,
since water is the element of fish, and is hotter or colder in all
regions, like the air, the element of man, which he breathes, warmer or
cooler, according to clime and local circumstances--there appear to be
no physical objections in the way of giving implicit credence to our
tourists.Water is so abundant, that the adjoining plain might be easily
irrigated, and planted with ten thousand palms and forests of olives.God is bountiful in the Desert, but man wilfully neglects these aqueous
riches springing up eternally to repair the ravages of the burning
simoum!In one of the groves we met a dervish, who immediately set about
charming our Boab.He began by an incantation, then seized him round the
middle, and, stooping a little, lifted him on his shoulders, continuing
the while the incantation.He then put him on his feet again, and, after
several attempts, appeared to succeed in bringing off his stomach
something in the shape of leaden bullets, which he then, with an air of
holy swagger, presented to the astonished guard of the Bey.The dervish
next spat on his patient's hands, closed them in his own, then smoothed
him down the back like a mountebank smooths his pony, and stroked also
his head and beard; and, after further gentle and comely ceremonies of
this sort, the charming of the charmer finished, and the Boab presented
the holy man with his fee.We dined at the Kaed's house; this
functionary was a very venerable man, a perfect picture of a patriarch
of the olden Scriptural times of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.There was
not a single article of furniture in the room, except a humble sofa,
upon which he sat.We inspected the old Kasbah at Ghafsa, which is in nearly a state of
ruin, and looked as if it would soon be down about our ears.It is an
irregular square, and built chiefly of the remains of ancient edifices.It was guarded by fifty Turks, whose broken-down appearance was in
perfect harmony with the citadel they inhabited.The square in a
building is the favourite form of the Moors and Mohammedans generally;
the Kaaba of Mecca, the _sanctum sanctorum_, is a square.The Moors
endeavour to imitate the sacred objects of their religion in every way,
even in the commonest affairs of human existence, whilst likewise their
troops of wives and concubines are only an earthly foretaste and an
earnest of the celestial ladies they expect to meet hereafter.We saw them making oil, which was in a very primitive fashion.The
oil-makers were nearly all women.The olives were first ground between
stones worked by the hands, until they became of the consistence of
paste, which was then taken down to the stream and put into a wooden tub
with water.On being stirred up, the oil rises to the top, which they
skim off with their hands and put into skins or jars; when thus skimmed,
they pass the grounds or refuse through a sieve, the water running off;
the stones and pulp are then saved for firing.But in this way much of
the oil is lost, as may be seen by the greasy surface of the water below
where this rude process is going on.Among the oil-women, we noticed a
girl who would have been very pretty and fascinating had she washed
herself instead of the olives.We entered an Arab house inhabited by
some twenty persons, chiefly women, who forthwith unceremoniously took
off our caps, examined very minutely all our clothes with an excited
curiosity, laughed heartily when we put our hands in our pockets, and
wished to do the same, and then pulled our hair, looking under our faces
with amorous glances.On the hill overlooking the town, we also met two
women screaming frightfully and tearing their faces; we learned that one
of them had lost her child.The women make the best blankets here with
handlooms, and do the principal heavy work.We saw some hobaras, also a bird called getah, smaller than a partridge,
something like a ptarmigan, with its summer feathers, and head shaped
like a quail.The Bey sent two live ones to R., besides a couple of
large jerboahs of this part, called here, _gundy_.They are much like
the guinea-pig, but of a sandy colour, and very soft and fine, like a
young hare.The jerboahs in the neighbourhood of Tunis are certainly
more like the rat.The other day, near the south-west gates, we fell in
with a whole colony of them--which, however, were the lesser animal, or
Jerd species--who occupied an entire eminence to themselves, the
sovereignty of which seemed to have been conceded to them by the Bey of
Tunis.They looked upon us as intruders, and came very near to us, as if
asking us why we had the audacity to disturb the tranquillity of their
republic.The ground here in many places was covered with a substance
like the rime of a frosty morning; it tastes like salt, and from it they
get nitre.The water which we drank was
brought from Ghafsa: the Bey drinks water brought from Tunis.We marched
across a vast plain, covered with the salt just mentioned, which was
congealed in shining heaps around bushes or tufts of grass, and among
which also scampered a few hares.We encamped at a place called
Ghorbatah.Close to the camp was a small shallow stream, on each side of
which grew many canes; we bathed in the stream, and felt much refreshed.The evening was pleasantly cool, like a summer evening in England, and
reminded us of the dear land of our birth.Numerous plains in North
Africa are covered with saline and nitrous efflorescence; to the
presence of these minerals is owing the inexhaustible fertility of the
soil, which hardly ever receives any manure, only a little stubble being
occasionally burnt.We saw flights of the getah, and of another bird called the gedur,
nearly the same, but rather lighter in colour.When they rise from the
ground, they make a curious noise, something like a partridge.We were
unusually surprised by a flight of locusts, not unlike grasshoppers, of
about two inches long, and of a reddish colour.Halted by the dry bed of a river, called Furfouwy.A pool supplied the
camp: in the mountains, at a distance, there was, however, a delicious
spring, a stream of liquid pearls in these thirsty lands!A bird called
mokha appeared now and then; it is about the size of a nightingale, and
of a white light-brown colour.We seldom heard such sweet notes as this
bird possesses.Its flying is beautifully novel and curious; it runs on
the ground, and now and then stops and rises about fifteen feet from the
surface, giving, as it ascends, two or three short slow whistles, when
it opens its graceful tail and darts down to the ground, uttering
another series of melodious whistles, but much quicker than when it
rises.We continued our march over nearly the same sort of country, but all was
now flat as far as the eye could see, the hills being left behind us.About eight miles from Furfouwy, we came to a large patch of date-trees,
watered by many springs, but all of them hot.Under the grateful shade
of the lofty palm were flowers and fruits in commingled sweetness and
beauty.Here was the village of Dra-el-Hammah, surrounded, like all the
towns of the Jereed, with date-groves and gardens.The houses were most
humbly built of mud and bricks.After a scorching march, we encamped
just beyond, having made only ten miles.Saw quantities of bright soft
spar, called talc.Here also the ground was covered with a saline
effloresence.Near us were put up about a dozen blue cranes, the only
birds seen to-day.A gazelle was caught, and others chased.We
particularly observed huge patches of ground covered with salt, which,
at a distance, appeared just like water.Toser.--The Bey's Palace.--Blue Doves.--The town described.--Industry

arrived at the top of a rising ground, at the base of which was situate
the famous Toser, the head-quarters of the camp in the Jereed, and as
far as it goes.Behind the city was a forest of date-trees, and beyond
these and all around, as far as the eye could wander, was an
immeasurable waste--an ocean of sand--a great part of which we could
have sworn was water, unless told to the contrary.We were met, before
entering Toser, with some five or six hundred Arabs, who galloped before
the Bey, and fired as usual.The people stared at us Christians with
open mouths; our dress apparently astonished them.At Toser, the Bey
left his tent and entered his palace, so called in courtesy to his
Highness, but a large barn of a house, without any pretensions.We had
also a room allotted to us in this palace, which was the best to be
found in the town, though a small dark affair.Toser is a miserable
assemblage of mud and brick huts, of very small dimensions, the beams
and the doors being all of date-wood.The gardens, however, under the
date-trees are beautiful, and abundantly watered with copious streams,
all of which are warm, and in one of which we bathed ourselves and felt
new vigour run through our veins.We took a walk in the gardens, and
were surprised at the quantities of doves fluttering among the
date-trees; they were the common blue or Barbary doves.In the environs
of Mogador, these doves are the principal birds shot.Toser, or Touzer, the _Tisurus_ of ancient geography, is a considerable
town of about six thousand souls, with several villages in its
neighbourhood.The impression of Toser made upon our tourists agrees with that of the
traveller, Desfontaines, who writes of it in 1784:--"The Bey pitched his
tent on the right side of the city, if such can be called a mass of
_mud-houses_."Shaw,
who says that "the villages of the Jereed are built of mud-walls and
rafters of palm-trees."Evidently, however, some improvement has been
made of late years.The Arabs of Toser, on the contrary, and which very
natural, protested to the French scientific commission that Toser was
the finest city in El-Jereed.They pretend that it has an area as large
as Algiers, surrounded with a mud wall, twelve or fifteen feet high, and
crenated.In the centre is a vast open space, which serves for a
market-place.Toser has mosques, schools, Moorish baths--a luxury rare
on the confines of the Desert, fondouks or inns, &c. The houses have
flat terraces, and are generally well-constructed, the greater part
built from the ruins of a Roman town; but many are now dilapidated from
the common superstitious cause of not repairing or rebuilding old
houses.The choice material for building is brick, mostly unbaked or
sun-dried.Toser, situate in a plain, is commanded from the north-west by a little
rocky mountain, whence an abundant spring takes its source, called
_Meshra_, running along the walls of the city southward, divides itself
afterwards in three branches, waters the gardens, and, after having
irrigated the plantations of several other villages, loses itself in the
sand at a short distance.The wells within the city of Toser are
insufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants, who fetch water
from Wad Meshra.The neighbouring villages are Belad-el-Ader, Zin,
Abbus; and the sacred villages are Zaouweeat, of Tounseea, Sidi Ali Bou
Lifu, and Taliraouee.The Arabs of the open country, and who deposit
their grain in and trade with these villages, are Oulad Sidi Sheikh,
Oulad Sidi Abeed, and Hammania.The dates of Toser are esteemed of the
finest quality.Walked about the town; several of the inhabitants are very wealthy.The
dead saints are, however, here, and perhaps everywhere else in Tunis,
more decently lodged, and their marabets are real "whitewashed
sepulchres."They make many burnouses at Toser, and every house presents
the industrious sight of the needle or shuttle quickly moving.We tasted
the leghma, or "tears of the date," for the first time, and rather liked
it.On going to shoot doves, we, to our astonishment, put up a snipe.The weather was very hot; went to shoot doves in the cool of the
evening.The Bey administers justice, morning and evening, whilst in the
Jereed.An Arab made a present of a fine young ostrich to the Bey, which
his Highness, after his arrival in Tunis, sent to R. The great man here
is the Sheikh Tahid, who was imprisoned for not having the tribute ready
for the Bey.The tax imposed is equivalent to two bunches for each
date-tree.The Sheikh has to collect them, paying a certain yearly sum
when the Bey arrives, a species of farming-out.It was said that he is
very rich, and could well find the money.The dates are almost the only
food here, and the streets are literally gravelled with their stones.Santa Maria again returned his horse to the Bey, and got another in its
stead.He is certainly a man of _delicate_ feeling.This gentleman
carried his impudence so far that he even threatened some of the Bey's
officers with the supreme wrath of the French Government, unless they
attended better to his orders.A new Sheikh was installed, a good thing
for the Bey's officers, as many of them got presents on the occasion.We blessed our stars that a roof was over our heads to shield us from
the burning sun.We blew an ostrich-egg, had the contents cooked, and
found it very good eating.They are sold for fourpence each, and it is
pretended that one makes an ample meal for twelve persons.We are
supplied with leghma every morning; it tastes not unlike cocoa-nut milk,
but with more body and flavour.R. very unwell, attributed it to his
taking copious draughts of the leghma.Rode out of an evening; there was
a large encampment of Arabs outside the town, thoroughly sun-burnt,
hardy-looking fellows, some of them as black as <DW64>s.Many people in
Toser have sore eyes, and several with the loss of one eye, or nearly
so; opthalmia, indeed, is the most prevalent disease in all Barbary.The
neighbourhood of the Desert, where the greater part of the year the air
is filled with hot particles of sand, is very unfavourable to the sight;
the dazzling whiteness of the whitewashed houses also greatly injures
the eyes.But the Moors pretend that lime-washing is necessary to the
preservation of the houses from the weather, as well as from filth of
all sorts.We think really it is useful, by preventing dirty people in
many cases from being eaten up by their own filth and vermin,
particularly the Jews, the Tunisian Jews being the dirtiest persons in
the Regency.The lime-wash is the grand _sanitary_ instrument in North
Africa.There are little birds that frequent the houses, that might be called
Jereed sparrows, and which the Arabs name boo-habeeba, or "friend of my
father;" but their dress and language are very different, having reddish
breasts, being of a small size, and singing prettily.Shaw mentions them
under the name of the Capsa-sparrow, but he is quite wrong in making
them as large as the common house-sparrow.He adds: "It is all over of a
lark-colour, excepting the breast, which is somewhat lighter, and
shineth like that of a pigeon.The boo-habeeba has a note infinitely
preferable to that of the canary, or nightingale."He says that all
attempts to preserve them alive out of the districts of the Jereed have
failed.R. has brought several home from that country, which were alive
whilst I was in Tunis.There are also many at the Bardo in cages, that
live in this way as long as other birds.Went to see the houses of the inhabitants: they were nearly all the
same, the furniture consisting of a burnouse-loom, a couple of
millstones, and a quantity of basins, plates, and dishes, hung upon the
walls for effect, seldom being used; there were also some skins of
grain.The beams across the rooms, which are very high, are hung with
onions, dates, and pomegranates; the houses are nearly all of one story.Some of the women are pretty, with large long black eyes and lashes;
they colour the lower lid black, which does not add to their beauty,
though it shows the bewitching orb more fully and boldly.They were
exceedingly dirty and ragged, wearing, nevertheless, a profusion of
ear-rings, armlets, anclets, bracelets, and all sorts of _lets_, with a
thousand talismanic charms hanging from their necks upon their ample
bosoms, which latter, from the habit of not wearing stays, reach as low
down as their waists.They wrap up the children in swaddling-clothes,
and carry them behind their backs when they go out.Two men were bastinadoed for stealing a horse, and not telling where
they put him; every morning they were to be flogged until they divulged
their hiding-place.A man brought in about a foot of horse's skin, on which was the Bey's
mark, for which he received another horse.This is always done when any
animal dies belonging to the Beys, the man in whose hands the animal is,
receiving a new one on producing the part of the skin marked.The Bey
and his ministers and mamelukes amused themselves with shooting at a
mark.The Bey and his mamelukes also took diversion in spoiling the appearance
of a very nice young horse; they daubed hieroglyphics upon his shoulders
and loins, and dyed the back where the saddle is placed, and the three
legs below the knee with henna, making the other leg look as white as
possible.Another grey horse, a very fine one, was also cribbed.We may
remark here, that there were very few fine horses to be met with, all
the animals looking poor and miserable, whilst these few fine ones fell
into the hands of the Bey.It is probable, however, that the Arabs kept
their best and most beautiful horses out of the way, while the camp was
moving among them.The bastinadoes with which he
had been treated were inflicted on his bare person, cold water being
applied thereto, which made the punishment more severe.After receiving
one hundred, he said he would shew his hiding-place; and some people
being sent with him, dug a hole where he pointed out, but without coming
to anything.This was done several times, but with the same effect.He
was then locked up in chains till the following morning.Millions of
dollars lie buried by the Arabs at this moment in different parts of
Barbary, especially in Morocco, perhaps the half of which will never be
found, the owners of them having died before they could point out their
hoarded treasures to their relatives, as but a single person is usually
in the secret.Money is in this way buried by tribes, who have nothing
whatever to fear from their sovereigns and their sheikhs; they do it
from immemorial custom.It is for this reason the Arabs consider that
under all ancient ruins heaps of money are buried, placed there by men
or demons, who hold the shining hoards under their invincible spell.They cannot comprehend how European tourists can undertake such long
journeys, merely for the purpose of examining old heaps of stones, and
making plans and pictures of such rubbish.When any person attempts to
convince the Arabs that this is the sole object, they only laugh with
incredulity.Went to Nefta, a ride of about fourteen miles, lying somewhat nearer the
Sahara than Toser.The country on the right was undulating sand, on the
left an apparently boundless ocean, where lies, as a vast sheet of
liquid fire, when the sun shines on it, the now long celebrated Palus
Libya.In this so-called lake no water is visible, except a small marsh
like the one near Toser, where we went duck-shooting.Our party was very
respectable, consisting of the Agha of the Arabs, two or three of the
Bey's mamelukes, the Kaed of the Jereed, whose name is Braun, and fifty
or sixty Arab guards, besides ourselves.On entering Nefta, the escort
immediately entered, according to custom, a marabet (that of Sidi Bou
Aly), Captain B. and R. meanwhile standing outside.There were two famous saints here, one of whom was a hundred years of
age.The other, Sidi Mustapha Azouz, had the character of being a very
clever and good man, which also his intelligent and benevolent
appearance betokened, and not a fanatic, like Amour Abeda of Kairwan.There were at the time of our visit to him about two hundred people in
his courtyard, who all subsisted on his charities.We were offered
dates, kouskousou, [39] and a seed which they call sgougou, and which
has the appearance of dried apple-seed.The Arabs eat it with honey,
first dipping their fingers into the honey, and then into the seed,
which deliciously sticks to the honey.The Sheikh's saint also
distributed beads and rosaries.He gave R. a bag of sgougou-seed, as
well as some beads.These two Sheikhs are objects of most religious
veneration amongst all true believers, and there is nothing which would
not be done at their bidding.Nefta, the Negeta of the ancients, is the frontier town of the Tunisian
territories from the south, being five days' journey, or about
thirty-five or forty leagues from the oases of Souf, and fifteen days'
from Ghadumes.Nefta is not so much a town as an agglomeration of
villages, separated from one another by gardens, and occupying an extent
of surface twice the size that of the city of Algiers.These villages
are Hal Guema, Mesaba, Zebda Ouled, Sherif, Beni Zeid, Beni Ali, Sherfa,
and Zaouweeah Sidi Ahmed.The position of Nefta and its environs is very picturesque.The principal source, which, under the name of Wad Nefta,
takes its rise at the north of the city, in the midst of a movement of
earth, enters the villages of Sherfa and Sidi Ahmed; divides them in
two, and fecundates its gardens planted with orange-trees, pomegranates,
and fig-trees.The same spring, by the means of ducts of earth, waters a
forest of date-trees which extends some leagues.A regulator of the
water (kaed-el-ma) distributes it to each proprietor of the plantation.The houses of Nefta are built generally of brick; some with taste and
luxury; the interior is ornamented with Dutch tiles brought from Tunis.Each quarter has its mosque and school, and in the centre of the group
of villages is a place called Rebot, on the banks of Wad Nefta, which
serves for a common market.Here are quarters specially devoted to the
aristocratic landed proprietors, and others to the busy merchants.The
Shereefs are the genuine nobles, or seigneurs of Nefta, from among whom
the Bey is wont to choose the Governors of the city.The complexion of
the population is dark, from its alliance with Negress slaves, like most
towns advanced in the Desert.They
are strict observers of the law, and very hospitable to strangers.Captain B., however, thought that, had he not been under the protection
of the Bey, his head would not have been worth much in these districts.Every traveller almost forms a different opinion, and frequently the
very opposite estimate, respecting the strangers amongst whom he is
sojourning.A few Jewish artizans have always been tolerated here, on
condition of wearing a black handkerchief round their heads, and not
mount a horse, &c. Recently the Bey, however, by solemn decrees, has
placed the Jews exactly on the same footing of rights and privileges as
the rest of his subjects.Nefta is the intermediate _entrepot_ of commerce which Tunis pours
towards the Sahara, and for this reason is called by the Arabs, "the
gate of Tunis;" but the restrictive system established by the Turks
during late years at Ghadumes, has greatly damaged the trade between the
Jereed and the Desert.The movement of the markets and caravans takes
place at the beginning of spring, and at the end of summer.Only a
portion of the inhabitants is devoted to commerce, the rich landed
proprietory and the Shereefs representing the aristocracy, lead the
tranquil life of nobles, the most void of care, and, perhaps, the
happiest of which contemplative philosophy ever dreamed.The oasis of
Nefta, indeed, is said to be the most poetic of the Desert; its gardens
are delicious; its oranges and lemons sweet; its dates the finest fruit
in the "land of dates."Nearly all the women are pretty, of that beauty
peculiar to the Oriental race; and the ladies who do not expose
themselves to the fierce sun of the day, are as fair as Mooresses.Santa Maria left for Ghabs, to which place there is not a correct route
laid down in any chart.There are three routes, but the wells of one are
only known to travellers, a knowledge which cannot be dispensed with in
these dry regions.The wells of the other two routes are known to the
bordering tribes alone, who, when they have taken a supply of water,
cover them up with sand, previously laying a camel-skin over the
well-mouth, to prevent the sand falling into the water, so that, while
dying with thirst, you might be standing on a well and be none the
wiser.The Frenchman has taken with him an escort of twelve men.The
weather is cooler, with a great deal of wind, raising and darkening the
sky with sand; even among the dategroves our eyes and noses were like so
many sand-quarries.Sheikh Tahib has been twice subjected to corporal punishment in the same
way as before mentioned, with the addition of fifty, but they cannot
make him bleed as they wish.He declares he has not got the money, and
that he cannot pay them, though they cut him to pieces.As he has
collected a great portion of the tribute of the people, one cannot much
pity the lying rogue.We were amused with the snake-charmers.These gentry are a company under
the protection of their great saint Sidi Aysa, who has long gone
upwards, but also is now profitably employed in helping the juggling of
these snake-mountebanks.These fellows take their snakes about in small
bags or boxes, which are perfectly harmless, their teeth and poison-bags
being extracted.They carry them in their bosoms, put them in their
mouths, stuffing a long one in of some feet in length, twist them around
their arms, use them as a whip to frighten the people, in the meanwhile
screaming out and crying unto their Heavenly protector for help, the
bystanders devoutly joining in their prayers.The snake-charmers usually
perform other tricks, such as swallowing nails and sticking an iron bar
in their eyes; and they wear their hair long like women, which gives
them a very wild maniacal look.Three of the mamelukes and ourselves went to Wedyen, a town and
date-wood about eight miles from Toser, to the left.The date-grove is
extensive, and there are seven villages in it of the same name.We slept
in the house of the Sheikh, who complained that the Frenchman, in
passing that way, had allowed his escort to plunder, and actually bound
the poor Sheikh, threatening him on his remonstrating.What conduct for
Christians to teach these people!One morning before daylight, we were on horseback, and _en route_
towards the hills, for the purpose of shooting loted, as they call a
species of deer found here.The ground in the neighbourhood of Wedyen is
tossed about like a hay-field, and volcanic looking.About four miles
off we struck into the rocks, on each side of our path, rising
perpendicularly in fantastic shapes.On reaching the highest ground, the
view was exceedingly wild.Much of the rock appeared as if it had only
just been cooled from a state of fusion; there was also a quantity of
tuffo rock, similar to that in the neighbourhood of Naples.The first
animal we saw was a wolf, which, standing on the sky-line of the
opposite hill, looked gigantic.The deep valley between, however,
prevented our nearer approach.We soon after came on a loted, who took to his heels, turning round a
mass of rock; but, soon after, he almost met as, and we had a view of
him within forty yards.Several shots were fired at him without effect,
and he at last made his escape, with a speed which defied all our
attempts at following him.Dismounting, the Sheikh Ali, of the Arab
tribe Hammama, who was with us, and who is the greatest deer-stalker in
the country, preceded us a little distance to look out for deer, the
marks of which were here very numerous.After a short time, an Arab
brought information of a herd of some thirty, with a good many young
ones; but our endeavours to have a shot at them were fruitless, though
one of the Arabs got near enough to loose the dogs at them, and a
greyhound was kicked over for his pains.We saw no more of them; but our
want of success was not surprising, silence not being in the least
attended to, and our party was far too large.The Arabs have such a
horrible habit of vociferation, that it is a wonder they ever take any
game at all.About the hills was scattered a great variety of aromatic
plants, quantities of shells, and whole oyster-beds, looking almost as
fresh as if they had been found by the sea-side.On our return from Toser, we had an extensive view of the Sahara, an
ocean as far as the eye could see, of what one would have taken his oath
was water, the shores, inlets, and bays being clearly defined, but, in
reality, nothing but salt scattered on the surface.Several islets were
apparently breaking its watery expanse, but these also were only heaps
of sand raised from the surrounding flat.The whole country, hills,
plains and deserts, gave us an idea as if the materials had been thrown
together for manufacture, and had never been completed.Nevertheless
these savage deserts of boundless extent are as complete in their kind
as the smiling meadows and fertile corn-fields of England, each being
perfect in itself, necessary to the grand whole of creation, and forming
an essential portion of the works of Divine Providence.The Sheikh Tahib's gardens were sold for 15,000 piastres, his wife also
added to this 1,000, and he was set at liberty.The dates have been
coming in to a great amount.The
principal are:--Degalah, the most esteemed, which are very sweet and
almost transparent.Captain B. preferred the Trungah, another first-rate
sort, which are plum-shaped, and taste something like a plum.There are
also the Monachah, which are larger than the other two, dryer and more
mealy, and not so sweet as Degalah, and other sorts.The dates were very
fine, though in no very great abundance, the superior state of ripeness
being attributed to there only being a single day of rain during the
past year in the Jereed.Rain is bad for the dates, but the roots of the
tree cannot have too much water.The tent-pitchers of the camp went round and performed, in mask, actions
of the most revolting description, some being dressed as women, and
dancing in the most lascivious and indecent manner.One fellow went up
to R., who was just on the point of knocking him down, when, seeing the
Treasurer of the Bey cracking his sides with laughter, he allowed the
brute to go off under such high patronage.It was even said that these
fellows were patronized by his Highness.But, on all Moorish feastdays,
lascivious actions of men and women are an indispensable part of their
entertainment.This is the worst side of the character of the Moors.The
Moorish women were never so profligate as since the arrival of the
French in Algeria.One of the greatest chiefs, Sultan Kaed, of the Hammama has just died.He was an extremely old man, and it is certain that people live to a
good old age in this burning clime.During his life, he had often
distinguished himself, and lastly against the French, before
Constantina.Whilst in the hills one day, we came suddenly upon a set of
Arabs, about nine in number, who took to their heels on seeing us.A man
has just been killed near this place, probably by the same gang.For
robbery and murder, no hills could be better fitted, the passes being so
intricate, and the winds and turns so sudden and sharp.The Sheikh Ali
brought in two loteds, a female and its young one, which he had shot.The head of the loted is like a deer's, but the eye is further up: it is
about a fallowdeer's size.The female has not the beard like a goat, but
long hair, reaching from the head to the bottom of the chest, and over
the fore-legs.These loteds were taken in consequence of an order from
the Bey, that they should not return without some.On our march back to Tunis, we encamped for two days by the foot of a
range of hills at Sheesheeah, about ten miles off.The water, brought
from some distance, was bad and salt.We proceeded to Ghortabah, our old place.Two of the prisoners (about
twelve of whom we had with us), and one of the Turks, died from the
excessive heat.The two couriers that were sent with despatches for the
Government were attacked near this place by the Arabs, and the horse of
one was so injured, that it was necessary to kill him; the man who rode
the horse was also shot through the leg.This was probably in revenge
for the exactions of the Bey of the Camp on the tribes.On our return to Ghafsa, we had rain, hail, and high wind, and
exceedingly cold--a Siberian winter's day on the verge of the scorching
desert.The ground, where there was clay, very slippery; the camels
reeled about as if intoxicated.The consequence was, it was long before
the tents came up, and we endured much from this sudden change of the
weather.Our sufferings were, however, nothing as compared to others,
for during the day, ten men were brought in dead, from the cold (three
died four days before from heat), principally Turks; and, had there been
no change in the temperature, we cannot tell how many would have shared
the same fate.Many of the camels, struggling against the clayey soil,
could not come up.Eight more men were shortly buried, and three were missing.The sudden
transition from the intense heat of the one day to the freezing cold of
the next, probably gave the latter a treble power, producing these
disastrous effects, the poor people being sadly ill-clad, and quite
unprepared for such extreme rigour.Besides, on our arrival at the camp,
all the money in Europe could not have purchased us the required
comforts, or rather necessaries, to preserve our health.We were exceedingly touched on hearing of the
death of a little girl, whom we saw driven out of a kitchen, in which
the poor helpless little thing had taken refuge from the inclemency of
the weather.Santa Maria arrived from Ghabs without accident, having scarcely seen a
soul the whole of the way.He certainly was an enterprizing fellow,
worthy of imitation.He calculated the distance from Ghabs to Toser at
200 miles.There are a number of towns in the districts of Ghabs better
built than those of Nefta and Toser; Ghabs river is also full of water
and the soil of the country is very fertile.The dates are not so good
as those of the Jereed.Ghabs is about 130 miles from Ghafsa.We here
took our farewell of Santa Maria; he went to Beja, the head-quarters of
the summer-camp: thence, of course, he would proceed to Algiers, to give
an account of his _espionage_.Next season, he said, he would go to
Tripoli and Ghadames; he had been many years in North Africa, and spoke
Arabic fluently.We next marched to Byrlafee, about twenty miles, and ninety-one from
Toser, where there are the ruins of an old town.The weather continued
cold and most wintry.Here is a very ancient well still in use.Fragments of cornices and pillars are strewn about.The foundations of
houses, and some massive stone towers, which from their having a pipe up
the centre, must have had something to do with regulating the water, are
all that remain.We had now much wind, but no rain.A great many camels and horses
perished.Altogether, the number of camels that died on the return of
the camp, was 550.The price of a camel varies from 60 to 200 piastres.Many good ones were sold at the camp for eighty piastres each, or about
two pounds ten shillings, English money.A good sheep was disposed of
for four or five piastres, or about three shillings.A horse in the extremities of nature, or near to
the _articulo mortis_, was sold for a piastre, eight pence; a camel, in
a like situation, was sold for a piastre and a half.A tolerably good
horse in Tunis sells at from 800 to 1000 piastres.There are the remains of an aqueduct at Gilma, and several other
buildings, the capitals of the pillars being elaborately worked.It is
seen that nearly the entire surface of Tunis is covered with remains of
aqueducts, Roman, Christian, and Moorish.If railways be applied to this
country--the French, are already talking about forming one from Algiers
to Blidah, across the Mitidjah--unquestionably along the lines will be
constructed ducts for water, which could thus be distributed over the
whole country.Instead of the camels of the "Bey of the Camp" carrying
water from Tunis to the Jereed, the railway would take from Zazwan, the
best and most delicious water in the Regency, to the dry deserts of the
Jereed, with the greatest facility.As to railways paying in this
country, the resources of Tunis, if developed, could pay anything.Marching onwards about eighteen miles, we encamped two or three beyond
an old place called Sidi-Ben-Habeeba.A man murdered a woman from
jealousy in the camp, but made his escape.Almost every eminence we
passed was occupied with the remains of some ancient fort, or temple.There was a good deal of corn in small detached patches, but it must be
remembered, the north-western provinces are the corn-districts.In the course of the following three days, we reached Sidi-Mahammedeah,
where are the magnificent remains of Udina.After about an hour's halt,
and when all the tents had been comfortably pitched, the Bey astonished
us with an order to continue our march, and we pursued our way to
Momakeeah, about thirty miles, which we did not reach until after dark.We passed, for some three or four hours, through a flight of locusts,
the air being darkened, and the ground loaded with them.At a little
distance, a flight of locusts has the appearance of a heavy snow-storm.These insects rarely visit the capital; but, since the appearance of
those near Momakeeah, they have been collected in the neighbourhood of
the city, cooked, and sold among the people.Momakeeah is a countryhouse
belonging to the Bey, to whom, also, belongs a great portion of the land
around.There is a large garden, laid out in the Italian style attached
to this country-seat.On arriving at Tunis, we called at the Bardo as we passed, and saw the
guard mounting.There was rather a fine band of military music; Moorish
musicians, but playing, after the European style, Italian and Moorish
airs.We must give here some account of our Boab's domestic concerns.He
boasted that he had had twenty-seven wives, his religion allowing four
at once, which he had bad several times; he was himself of somewhat
advanced years.According to him, if a man quarrels with his wife, he
can put her in prison, but must, at the same time, support her.A
certain quantity of provision is laid down by law, and he must give her
two suits, or changes, of clothes a year.But he must also visit her
once a week, and the day fixed is Friday.If the wife wishes to be
separated, and to return to her parents, she must first pay the money
which he may demand, and must also have his permission, although he
himself may send her to her parents whenever he chooses, without
assigning any reason.He retains the children, and he may marry again.The woman is generally expected to bring her husband a considerable sum
in the way of dowry, but, on separation, she gets nothing back.This was
the Boab's account, but I think he has overdone the harshness and
injustice of the Mohammedan law of marriage in relating it to our
tourists.It may be observed that the strict law is rarely acted upon,
and many respectable Moors have told me that they have but one wife, and
find that quite enough.It is true that many Moors, especially learned
men, divorce their wives when they get old, feeling the women an
embarrassment to them, and no wonder, when we consider these poor
creatures have no education, and, in their old age, neither afford
connubial pleasure nor society to their husbands.With respect to
divorce, a woman can demand by law and right to be separated from her
husband, or divorced, whenever he ill-treats her, or estranges himself
from her.Eunuchs, who have the charge of the women, are allowed to
marry, although they cannot have any family.The chief eunuch of the
Bardo has the most revolting countenance.Our tourists brought home a variety of curious Jereed things: small
date-baskets full of dates, woollen articles, skins of all sorts, and a
few live animals.Sidi Mohammed also made them many handsome presents.Some deer, Jereed goats, an ostrich, &c., were sent to Mr.R. after his
return, and both Captain B. and Mr.R. have had every reason to be
extremely gratified with the hospitality and kind attentions of the "Bey
of the Camp."It is very difficult to ascertain the amount of tribute collected in the
Jereed, some of which, however, was not got in, owing to various
impediments.Our tourists say generally:--

  Camel-loads.[40]
  Money, dollars, and piastres, (chiefly I
  imagine, the latter.)23

  Burnouses, blankets, and quilts, &c.6

  Dates (these were collected at Toser,
    and brought from Nefta and the surrounding
    districts)                                     500
                                                  ----
                 Total                             529

  It is impossible, with this statement
    before us, to make out any exact
    calculation of the amount of tribute.A cantar of dates varies from fifteen
    to twenty-five shillings, say on an
    average a pound sterling; this will
    make the amount of the 500 camel-loads
    at five cantars per load                    L2,500

  Six camel-loads of woollen manufactures,
    &c., at sixty pound per load, value            360
                                                ------
                   Total                        L2,860

The money, chiefly piastres, must be left to conjecture.Levy, a large merchant at Tunis, thinks the amount might be from 150 to
200,000 piastres, or, taking the largest sum, L6,250 sterling:

  Total amount of the tribute of the Jereed:
  in goods                                      L2,860
  Ditto, in money:                               6,250
                                                ------
                   Total                        L9,110

To this sum may be added the smaller presents of horses, camels, and
other beasts of burden.*       *       *       *       *

Before leaving Mogador, in company with Mr.Willshire, I saw his
Excellency, the Governor again, when I took formal leave of him.He
accompanied me down to the port with several of the authorities, waiting
until I embarked for the Renshaw schooner.Several of the Consuls, and
nearly all the Europeans, were also present.On the whole, I was
satisfied with the civilities of the Moorish authorities, and offer my
cordial thanks to the Europeans of Mogador for their attentions during
my residence in that city.A little circumstance shews the subjection of our merchants, the Consul
not excepted, to the Moorish Government.One of the merchants wished to
accompany me on board, but was not permitted, on account of his
engagements with the Sultan.A merchant cannot even go off the harbour to superintend the stowing of
his goods.Never were prisoners of war, or political offenders, so
closely watched as the boasted imperial merchants of this city.After setting sail, we were soon out of sight of Mogador; and, on the
following day, land disappeared altogether.During the next month, we
were at sea, and out of view of the shore.I find an entry in my
journal, when off the Isle of Wight.We had had most tremendous weather,
successive gales of foul wind, from north and north-east.Our schooner
was a beautiful vessel, a fine sailer with a flat bottom, drawing little
water, made purposely for Barbary ports.She had her bows completely
under water, and pitched her way for twenty-five succeeding days,
through huge rising waves of sea and foam.During the whole of this
time, I never got up, and lived on bread and water with a little
biscuit.Captain Taylor, who was a capital seaman, and took the most
accurate observations, lost all patience, and, though a good methodist,
would now and then rush on deck, and swear at the perverse gale and
wrathful sea.We took on board a fine barb for Mr.Elton, which died
after a few days at sea, in these tempests.I had a young vulture that
died a day before the horse, or we should have fed him on the carcase.[Illustration]

An aoudad which we conveyed on account of Mr.Willshire to London, for
the Zoological Society, outlived these violent gales, and was safely and
comfortably lodged in the Regent's Park.After my return from Africa, I
paid my brave and hardy fellow-passenger a visit, and find the air of
smoky London agrees with him as well as the cloudless region of the
Morocco Desert.The following account of the bombardment of Mogador by the French,
written at the period by an English Resident may be of interest at the
present time.Mogador was bombarded on the 13th of August, 1844.Hostilities began at
9 o'clock A.M., by the Moors firing twenty-one guns before the French
had taken up their position, but the fire was not returned until 2 P.M.The 'Gemappes,' 100; 'Suffren,' 99; 'Triton,' 80; ships of the line.'Belle Poule,' 60, frigate; 'Asmodee' and 'Pluton,' steamers, and some
brigs, constituted the bombarding squadron.The batteries were silenced,
and the Moorish authorities with many of the inhabitants fled, leaving
the city unprotected against the wild tribes, who this evening and the
next morning, sacked and fired the city.On the 16th, nine hundred
French were landed on the isle of Mogador.After a rude encounter with
the garrison, they took possession of it and its forts.Their loss was,
after twenty-eight hours' bombarding, trifling, some twenty killed and
as many more wounded; the Moors lost some five hundred on the isle
killed, besides the casualties in the city.The British Consul and his wife, and Mr.Robertson, with
others, were obliged to remain in the town during the bombardment on
account of their liabilities to the Emperor.The escape of these people
from destruction was most miraculous.The bombarding squadron reached on the 10th, the English frigate,
'Warspite,' on the 13th, and the wind blowing strong from N.E., and
preventing the commencement of hostilities, afforded opportunity to
save, if possible, the British Consul's family and other detained
Europeans; but, notwithstanding the strenuous remonstrances of the
captain of the 'Warspite', nothing whatever could prevail upon the
Moorish Deputy-Governor in command, Sidi Abdallah Deleero, to allow the
British and other Europeans to take their departure.The Governor even
peremptorily refused permission for the wife of the Consul to leave,
upon the cruel sophism that, "The Christian religion asserts the husband
and wife to be one, consequently," added the Governor, "as it is my
duty, which I owe to my Emperor, to prevent the Consul from leaving
Mogador, I must also keep his wife."The fact is the Moors, in their stupidity, and perhaps in their revenge,
thought the retaining of the British Consul and the Europeans might, in
some way or other, contribute to the defence of themselves, save the
city, or mitigate the havoc of the bombardment.At any rate, they would
say, "Let the Christians share the same fate and dangers as ourselves."During the bombardment, the Moors for two hours fought well, but their
best gunner, a Spanish renegade, Omar Ei-Haj, being killed, they became
dispirited and abandoned the batteries.The Governor and his troops,
about sunset, disgracefully and precipitately fled, followed by nearly
all the Moorish population, thereby abandoning Mogador to pillage, and
the European Jews to the merciless wild tribes, who, though levied to
defend the town, had, for some hours past, hovered round it like droves
of famished wolves.As the Governor fled out, terrified as much at the wild tribes as of the
French, in rushed these hordes, led on by their desperate chiefs.These
wretches undismayed, unmoved by the terrors of the bombarding ravages
around, strove and vied with each other in the committal of every act of
the most unlicensed ferocity and depredation, breaking open houses,
assaulting the inmates, murdering such as shewed resistance, denuding
the more submissive of their clothing, abusing women--particularly in
the Jewish quarter--to all which atrocities the Europeans were likewise
exposed.At the most imminent hazard of their lives, the British Consul and his
wife, with a few others, escaped from these ruffians.Truly providential
was their flight through streets, resounding with the most turbulent
confusion and sanguinary violence.It was late when the plunderers
appeared before the Consulates, where, without any ceremony, by
hundreds, they fell to work, breaking open bales of goods, ransacking
places for money and other treasures; and, thus unsatisfied in their
rapacity, they tore and burnt all the account-books and Consular
documents.Other gangs fought over the spoil; some carrying off their booty, and
others setting it on fire.It was a real pandemonium of discord and
licentiousness.During the darkness, and in the midst of such scenes, it
was that the Consul and his wife threaded their precarious flight
through the streets, and in their way were intercepted by a marauding
band, who attacked them; tore off his coat; and, seizing his wife,
insisted upon denuding her, four or five daggers being raised to her
throat, expecting to find money concealed about their persons; nor would
the ruffians desist until they ascertained they had none, the Consul
having prudently resolved to take no money with them.Fortunately, at
this juncture, his wife was able to speak, and in Arabic (being born
here, and daughter of a former Consul), therefore she could give force
to her entreaties by appealing to them not to imbue their hands in the
blood of their countrywomen.The chief of
the party undertook to conduct them to the water-port, when, coming in
contact with another party, a conflict about booty ensued, during which
the Consul's family got out of the town to a place of comparative
security.Incidents of a similar alarming nature attended the escape of Mr.Robertson, his wife, and four children; one, a baby in arms.Robertson, with a child in each hand, lost sight of Mrs.Robertson, with her infant and another child.Distracted by sad
forebodings, poor Mr.Robertson forced his way to the water-port, but
not before a savage mountainer--riding furiously by him--aimed a
sabre-blow at him to cut him down; but, as the murderous arm was poised
above, Mr.Robertson stooped, and, raising his arm at the time, warded
it off; the miscreant then rode off, being satisfied at this cut at the
detested Nazarene.Another ruffian seized one of his little girls, a pretty child of nine
years old, and scratched her arm several times with his dagger, calling
out _flous_ (money) at each stroke.Robertson
joined his fainting wife, and the British Consul and his wife, with Mr.An old Moor never deserted the Consul's family,
"faithful among the faithless;" and a Jewess, much attached to the
family, abandoned them only to return to those allied to her by the ties
of blood.Their situation was now still perilous, for, should they be discovered
by the wild Berbers, they all might be murdered.This night, the 15th,
was a most anxious one, and their apprehensions were dreadful.Dawn of
day was fast approaching, and every hour's delay rendered their
condition more precarious.Lucas, who never once
failed or lost his accustomed suavity and presence of mind amidst these
imminent dangers, resolved upon communicating with the fleet by a most
hazardous experiment.On his way from the town-gate to the water-port,
he noticed some deal planks near the beach.The idea struck him of
turning these into a raft, which, supporting him, could enable their
party to communicate with the squadron.Lucas fetched the planks,
and resolutely set to work.Taking three of them, and luckily finding a
quantity of strong grass cordage, he arranged them in the water, and
with some cross-pieces, bound the whole together; and, besides, having
found two small pieces of board to serve him as paddles, he gallantly
launched forth alone, and, in about an hour, effected his object, for he
excited the attention of the French brig, 'Canard,' from which a boat
came and took him on board.The officers, being assured there were no Moors on guard at the
batteries, and that the Berbers were wholly occupied in plundering the
city, promptly and generously sent off a boat with Mr.Lucas to the
rescue of the alarmed and trembling fugitives.The Prince de Joinville
afterwards ordered them to be conveyed on board the 'Warspite.'The
self-devotedness, sagacity, and indefatigable exertions of the excellent
young man, Mr.Lucas, were above all encomiums, and, at the hands of the
British Government, he deserved some especial mark of favour.Levy (an English Jewess, married to a Maroquine Jew), and her
family were left behind, and accompanied the rest of the miserable Jews
and natives, to be maltreated, stripped naked, and, perhaps, murdered,
like many poor Jews.Amrem Elmelek, the greatest native merchant and
a Jew, died from fright.Carlos Bolelli, a Roman, perished during the
sack of the city.Mogador was left a heap of ruins, scarcely one house standing entire,
and all tenantless.In the fine elegiac bulletin of the bombarding
Prince, "Alas!thy walls are riddled with bullets,
and thy mosques of prayer blackened with fire!"Tangier trades almost exclusively with Gibraltar, between which place
and this, an active intercourse is constantly kept up.The principal articles of importation into Tangier are, cotton goods of
all kinds, cloth, silk-stuffs, velvets, copper, iron, steel, and
hardware of every description; cochineal, indigo, and other dyes; tea,
coffee, sulphur, paper, planks, looking-glasses, tin, thread,
glass-beads, alum, playing-cards, incense, sarsaparilla, and rum.The exports consist in hides, wax, wool, leeches, dates, almonds,
oranges, and other fruit, bark, flax, durra, chick-peas, bird-seed, oxen
and sheep, henna, and other dyes, woollen sashes, haicks, Moorish
slippers, poultry, eggs, flour, &c.

The value of British and foreign goods imported into Tangier in 1856
was: British goods, L101,773 6_s_., foreign goods, L33,793.The goods exported from Tangier during the same year was: For British
ports, L63,580 10_s_., for foreign ports, L13,683.The following is a statement of the number of British and foreign ships
that entered and cleared from this port during the same year.Entered:
British ships 203, the united tonnage of which was 10,883; foreign ships
110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Cleared: British ships 207, the united tonnage of which was 10,934;
foreign ships 110, the total tonnage of which was 4,780.Three thousand head of cattle are annually exported, at a fixed duty of
five dollars per head, to Gibraltar, for the use of that garrison, in
conformity with the terms of special grants that have, from time to
time, been made by the present Sultan and some of his predecessors.In
addition to the above, about 2,000 head are, likewise, exported
annually, for the same destination, at a higher rate of duty, varying
from eight dollars to ten dollars per head.Gibraltar, also, draws from
this place large supplies of poultry, eggs, flour, and other kinds of
provisions.From the port of Mogador are exported the richest articles the country
produces, viz., almonds, sweet and bitter gums, wool, olive-oil, seeds
of various kinds, as cummin, gingelen, aniseed; sheep-skins, calf, and
goat-skins, ostrich-feathers, and occasionally maize.The amount of exports in 1855 was: For British ports, L228,112 3_s_.2_d_., for foreign ports, L55,965 13_s_.The imports are Manchester cotton goods, which have entirely superseded
the East India long cloths, formerly in universal use, blue salampores,
prints, sugar, tea, coffee, Buenos Ayres slides, iron, steel, spices,
drugs, nails, beads and deals, woollen cloth, cotton wool, and mirrors
of small value, partly for consumption in the town, but chiefly for that
of the interior, from Morocco and its environs, as far as Timbuctoo.The amount of imports in 1855 was: British goods, L136,496 7_s_.6_d_.,
foreign goods L31,222 11_s_.The trade last year was greatly increased by the unusually large demand
for olive-oil from all parts, and there is no doubt that, under a more
liberal Government, the commerce might be developed to a vast extent.The principal goods imported at Rabat are, alum, calico of different
qualities, cinnamon, fine cloth, army cloth, cloves, copperas, cotton
prints, raw cotton, sewing cotton, cutlery, dimity, domestics,
earthenware, ginger, glass, handkerchiefs (silk and cotton), hardware,
indigo, iron, linen, madder root, muslin, sugar (refined and raw), tea,
and tin plate.The before-mentioned articles are imported partly for consumption in
Rabat and Sallee, and partly for transmission into the interior.The value of different articles of produce exported at Rabat during the
last five years amounts to L34,860 1_s_.There can be no doubt that the imports and exports at Rabat would
greatly increase, if the present high duties were reduced, and
Government monopolies abolished.Large quantities of hides were exported
before they were a Government monopoly: now the quantity exported is
very inconsiderable._Goods Imported_.--Brown Domestics, called American White, muslins, raw
cotton, cotton-bales, silk and cotton pocket-handkerchiefs; tea, coffee,
sugars, iron, copperas, alum; many other articles imported, but in very
small quantities.A small portion of the importations is consumed at Mazagan and Azimore,
but the major portions in the interior.The amount of the leading goods exported in 1855 was:--Bales of wool,
6,410; almonds, 200 serons; grain, 642,930 fanegas.No doubt the commerce of this port would be increased under better
fiscal laws than those now established.But the primary and immediate thing to be looked after is the wilful
casting into the anchorage-ground of stone-ballast by foreigners.British masters are under control, but foreigners will persist, chiefly
Sardinian masters.THE END




[1] The predecessor of Muley Abd Errahman.[2] On account, of their once possessing the throne, the Shereefs have a
peculiar jealousy of Marabouts, and which latter have not forgotten
their once being sovereigns of Morocco.The _Moravedi_ were "really a
dynasty of priests," as the celebrated Magi, who usurped the throne of
Cyrus.The Shereefs, though descended from the Prophet, are not strictly
priests, or, to make the distinction perfectly clear the Shereefs are to
be considered a dynasty corresponding to the type of Melchizdek, uniting
in themselves the regal and sacerdotal authority, whilst the
_Marabouteen_ were a family of priests like the sons of Aaron.Abd-el-Kader unites in himself the princely and sacerdotal authority
like the Shereefs, though not of the family of the Prophet.Mankind have
always been jealous of mere theocratic government, and dynasties of
priests have always been failures in the arts of governing, and the
Egyptian priests, though they struggled hard, and were the most
accomplished of this class of men, could not make themselves the
sovereigns of Egypt.[3] According to others the Sadia reigned before the Shereefs.[4] I was greatly astonished to read in Mr.Hay's "Western Barbary," (p.123), these words--"During one of the late rebellions, a beautiful young
girl was offered up as a propitiatory sacrifice, her throat being cut
before the tent of the Sultan, and in his presence!"This is an
unmitigated libel on the Shereefian prince ruling Morocco.First of all,
the sacrifice of human beings is repudiated by every class of
inhabitants in Barbary.Such rites, indeed, are unheard of, nay,
unthought of.If the Mahometan religion has been powerful in any one
thing, it is in that of rooting out from the mind of man every notion of
human sacrifice.It is this which makes the sacrifice of the Saviour
such an obnoxious doctrine to Mussulmen.It is true enough, at times,
oxen are immolated to God, but not to Moorish princes, "to appease an
offended potentate."One spring, when there was a great drought, the
people led up to the hill of Ghamart, near Carthage, a red heifer to be
slaughtered, in order to appease the displeasure of Deity; and when the
Bey's frigate, which, a short time ago, carried a present to her
Britannic Majesty, from Tunis to Malta, put back by stress of weather,
two sheep were sacrificed to some tutelar saints, and two guns were
fired in their honour.The companions of Abd-el-Kader in a storm, during
his passage from Oran to Toulon, threw handsful of salt to the raging
deep to appease its wild fury.But as to sacrificing human victims,
either to an incensed Deity, or to man, impiously putting himself in the
place of God, the Moors of Barbary have not the least conception of such
an enormity.It would seem, unfortunately, that the practice of the gentleman, who
travelled a few miles into the interior of Morocco on a horse-mission,
had been to exaggerate everything, and, where effect was wanting, not to
have scrupled to have recourse to unadulterated invention.But this
style of writing cannot be defended on any principle, when so serious a
case is brought forward as that of sacrificing a human victim to appease
the wrath of an incensed sovereign, and that prince now living in
amicable relations with ourselves.[5] Graeberg de Hemso, whilst consul-general for Sweden and Sardinia (at
Morocco!)concludes the genealogy of these Mussulman sovereigns with
this strange, but Catholic-spirited rhapsody:--

"Muley Abd-ur-Bakliman, who is now gloriously and happily reigning, whom
we pray Almighty God, all Goodness and Power, to protect and exalt by
prolonging his life, glory, and reign in this world and in the next; and
giving him, during eternity, the heavenly beatitude, in order that his
soul, in the same manner as flame to flame, river to sea, may be united
with his sweetest, most perfect and ineffable Creator.[6] Yezeed was half-Irish, born of the renegade widow of an Irish
sergeant of the corps of Sappers and Miners, who was placed at the
disposition of this government by England, and who died in Morocco.On
his death, the facile, buxom widow was admitted, "nothing loath," into
the harem of Sidi-Mohammed, who boasted of having within its sacred
enclosure of love and bliss, a woman from every clime.Here the daughter of Erin brought forth this ferocious tyrant, whose
maxim of carnage, and of inflicting suffering on humanity was, "My
empire can never be well governed, unless a stream of blood flows from
the gate of the palace to the gate of the city."To do Yezeed justice,
he followed out the instincts of his birth, and made war on all the
world except the English (or Irish).Tully's Letters on Tripoli give a
graphic account of the exploits of Yezeed, who, to his inherent cruelty,
added a fondness for practical (Hibernian) jokes.His father sent him several times on a pilgrimage to Mecca to expiate
his crimes, when he amused, or alarmed, all the people whose countries
he passed through, by his terrific vagaries.One day he would cut off
the heads of a couple of his domestics, and play at bowls with them;
another day, he would ride across the path of an European, or a consul,
and singe his whiskers with the discharge of a pistol-shot; another day,
he would collect all the poor of a district, and gorge them with a
razzia he had made on the effects of some rich over-fed Bashaw.The
multitude sometimes implored heaven's blessing on the head of Yezeed.at
other times trembled for their own heads.Meanwhile, our European
consuls made profound obeisance to this son of the Shereef, enthroned in
the West.So the tyrant passed the innocent days of his pilgrimage.So
the godless herd of mankind acquiesced in the divine rights of royalty.[7] See Appendix at the end of this volume.[8] The middle Western Region consists of Algiers and part of Tunis.[9] Pliny, the Elder, confirms this tradition mentioned by Pliny.Marcus
Yarron reports, "that in all Spain there are spread Iberians, Persians,
Phoenicians, Celts, and Carthaginians."[10] In Latin, Mauri, Maurice, Maurici, Maurusci, and it is supposed, so
called by the Greeks from their dark complexions.[11] The more probable derivation of this word is from _bar_, signifying
land, or earth, in contradistinction from the sea, or desert, beyond the
cultivable lands to the South.To give the term more force it is
doubled, after the style of the Semitic reduplication.De Haedo de la
Captividad gives a characteristic derivation, like a genuine hidalgo,
who proclaimed eternal war against Los Moros.He says--"Moors, Alartes,
Cabayles, and some Turks, form all of them a dirty, lazy, inhuman,
indomitable nation of beasts, and it is for this reason that, for the
last few years, I have accustomed myself to call that land the land of
Barbary."[12] Procopius, de Bello Vandilico, lib.[13] Some derive it from _Sarak_, an Arabic word which signifies to
steal, and hence, call the conquerors thieves.Others, and with more
probability, derive it from _Sharak_, the east, and make them Orientals,
and others say there is an Arabic word _Saracini_, which means a
pastoral people, and assert that Saracine is a corruption from it, the
new Arabian immigrants being supposed to have been pastoral tribes.[14] Some suppose that _Amayeegh_ means "great," and the tribes thus
distinguished themselves, as our neighbours are wont to do by the phrase
"la grande nation."The Shoulah are vulgarly considered to be descended
from the Philistines, and to have fled before Joshua on the conquest of
Palestine.In his translation of the Description of Spain, by the Shereef El-Edris
(Madrid, 1799), Don Josef Antonio Conde speaks of the Berbers in a
note--

"Masmuda, one of the five principal tribes of Barbaria; the others are
Zeneta, called Zenetes in our novels and histories, Sanhagha which we
name Zenagas; Gomesa is spelt in our histories Gomares and Gomeles.Huroara, some of these were originally from Arabia; there were others,
but not so distinguished.La de Ketama was, according to tradition,
African, one of the most ancient, for having come with Afrikio."Ben Kis Ben Taifi Ben Teba, the younger, who came from the king of the
Assyrians, to the land of the west."None of these primitive tribes appear to have been known to the Romans,
their historians, however, have transmitted to us many names of other
aboriginal tribes, some of which resemble fractions now existing, as the
Getules are probably the present Geudala or Geuzoula.But the present
Berbers do not correspond with the names of the five original people
just mentioned.In Morocco, there are Amayeegh and Shelouh, in Algeria
the Kabyles, in Tunis the Aoures, sometimes the Shouwiah, and in Sahara
the Touarichs.There are, besides, numerous subdivisions and admixtures
of these tribes."[15] Monsieur Balbi is decidedly the most recent, as well as the best
authority to apply to for a short and definite description of this most
celebrated mountain system, called by him "Systeme Atlantique," and I
shall therefore annex what he says on this interesting subject,
"Orographie."He says--"Of the 'Systeme Atlantique,' which derives its
name from the Mount Atlas, renowned for so many centuries, and still so
little known; we include in this vast system, all the heights of the
region of Maghreb--we mean the mountain of the Barbary States--as well
as the elevations scattered in the immense Sahara or Desert.It appears
that the most important ridge extends from the neighbourhood of Cape
Noun, or the Atlantic, as far as the east of the Great Syrte in the
State of Tripoli.In this vast space it crosses the new State of
Sidi-Hesdham, the Empire of Morocco, the former State of Algiers, as
well as the State of Tripoli and the Regency of Tunis.It is in the
Empire of Morocco, and especially in the east of the town of Morocco,
and in the south-east of Fez, that that ridge presents the greatest
heights of the whole system.It goes on diminishing afterwards in height
as it extends towards the east, so that it appears the summits of the
territory of Algiers are higher than those on the territory of Tunis,
and the latter are less high than those to be found in the State of
Tripoli.Several secondary ridges diverge in different directions from
the principal chain; we shall name among them the one which ends at the
Strait of Gibraltar in the Empire of Morocco.Several intermediary
mountains seem to connect with one another the secondary chains which
intersect the territories of Algiers and Tunis.Geographers call Little
Atlas the secondary mountains of the land of Sous, in opposition to the
name of Great Atlas, they give to the high mountains of the Empire of
Morocco.In that part of the principal chain called Mount Gharian, in
the south of Tripoli, several low branches branch off and under the
names of Mounts Maray, Black Mount Haroudje, Mount Liberty, Mount
Tiggerandoumma and others less known, furrow the great solitudes of the
Desert of Lybia and Sahara Proper.From observations made on the spot by
Mr.Bruguiere in the former state of Algiers, the great chain which
several geographers traced beyond the Little Atlas under the name of
Great Atlas does not exist.The inhabitants of Mediah who were
questioned on the subject by this traveller, told him positively, that
the way from that town to the Sahara was through a ground more or less
elevated, and <DW72>s more or less steep, and without having any chain of
mountains to cross.The Pass of Teniah which leads from Algiers to
Mediah is, therefore, included in the principal chain of that part of
the Regency.[16] Xenophon, in his Anabasis, speaks of ostriches in Mesopotamia being
run down by fleet horses.[17] Mount Atlas was called Dyris by the ancient aborigines, or Derem,
its name amongst the modern aborigines.This word has been compared to
the Hebrew, signifying the place or aspect of the sun at noon-day, as if
Mount Atlas was the back of the world, or the cultivated parts of the
globe, and over which the sun was seen at full noon, in all his fierce
and glorious splendour.Bochart connects the term with the Hebrew
meaning 'great' or'mighty,' which epithet would be naturally applied to
the Atlas, and all mountains, by either a savage or civilized people.We
have, also, on the northern coast, Russadirum, the name given by the
Moors to Cape Bon, which is evidently a compound of _Ras_, head, and
_dirum_, mountain, or the head of the mountain.We have again the root of this word in Doa-el-Hamman, Tibet Deera, &c.,
the names of separate chains of the mighty Atlas.Any way, the modern
Der-en is seen to be the same with the ancient Dir-is.[18] The only way of obtaining any information at all, is through the
registers of taxation; and, to the despotism and exactions of these and
most governments, we owe a knowledge of the proximate amount of the
numbers of mankind.[19] Tangier, Mogador, Wadnoun, and Sous have already been described,
wholly, or in part.[20] In 936, Arzila was sacked by the English, and remained for twenty
years uninhabited.Hay, a portion of the Salee Rovers seem to have
finally taken refuge here.Up the river El-Kous, the Imperial squadron
lay in ordinary, consisting of a corvette, two brigs, (once
merchant-vessels, and which had been bought of Christians), and a
schooner, with some few gun-boats, and even these two or three vessels
were said to be all unfit for sea.But, when Great Britain captured the
rock of Gibraltar, we, supplanting the Moors became the formidable
toll-keepers of the Herculean Straits, and the Salee rivers have ever
since been in our power.If the Shereefs have levied war or tribute on
European navies since that periods it has been under our tacit sanction.The opinion of Nelson is not the less true, that, should England engage
in war with any maritime State of Europe, Morocco must be our warm and
active friend or enemy, and, if our enemy, we must again possess
ourselves of our old garrison of Tangier.[22] So called, it is supposed, from the quantity of aniseed grown in
the neighbourhood.[23] Near Cape Blanco is the ruined town of Tit or Tet, supposed to be
of Carthaginian origin, and once also possessed by the Portuguese, when
commerce therein flourished.[24] El-Kesar is a very common name of a fortified town, and is usually
written by the Spaniards Alcazar, being the name of the celebrated royal
palace at Seville.[25] Marmol makes this city to have succeeded the ancient Roman town of
Silda or Gilda.Mequinez has been called Ez-Zetounah, from the immense
quantities of olives in its immediate vicinity.[26] Don J. A. Conde says--"Fes or sea Fez, the capital of the realm of
that name; the fables of its origin, and the grandeur of the Moors, who
always speak of their cities as foundations of heroes, or lords of the
whole world, &c., a foible of which our historians are guilty.Nasir-Eddin and the same Ullug Beig say, for certain, that Fez is the
court of the king in the west.I must observe here, that nothing is less
authentic than the opinions given by Casiri in his Library of the
Escurial, that by the word Algarb, they always mean the west of Spain,
and by the word Almagreb, the west of Africa; one of these appellations
is generally used for the other.The same Casiri says, with regard to
Fez, that it was founded by Edno Ben Abdallah, under the reign of
Almansor Abu Giafar; he is quite satisfied with that assertion, but does
not perceive that it contains a glaring anachronism.Fez was already a
very ancient city before the Mohammed Anuabi of the Mussulmen, and
Joseph, in his A. J., mentions a city of Mauritania; the prophet Nahum
speaks of it also, when he addresses Ninive, he presents it as an
example for No Ammon.He enumerates its districts and cities, and says,
Fut and Lubim, Fez and Lybia, &c.[27] I imagine we shall never know the truth of this until the French
march an army into Fez, and sack the library.[28] It is true enough what the governor says about _quietness_, but the
novelty of the mission turned the heads of the people, and made a great
noise among them.The slave-dealers of Sous vowed vengeance against me,
and threatened to "rip open my bowels" if I went down there.[29] The Sultan's Minister, Ben Oris, addressing our government on the
question says, "Whosoever sets any person free God will set his soul
free from the fire," (hell), quoting the Koran.[30] A person going to the Emperor without a present, is like a menace
at court, for a present corresponds to our "good morning."[31] _Bash_, means chief, as Bash-Mameluke, chief of the Mamelukes.[32] This office answers vulgarly to our _Boots_ at English inns.[33] Bismilla, Arabic for "In the name of God!"the Mohammedan grace
before meat, and also drink.[34] Shaw says.--"The hobara is of the bigness of a capon, it feeds upon
the little grubs or insects, and frequents the confines of the Desert.The body is of a light dun or yellowish colour, and marked over with
little brown touches, whilst the larger feathers of the wing are black,
with each of them a white spot near the middle; those of the neck are
whitish with black streaks, and are long and erected when the bird is
attacked.The bill is flat like the starling's, nearly an inch and a
half long, and the legs agree in shape and in the want of the hinder toe
with the bustard's, but it is not, as Golins says, the bustard, that
bird being twice as big as the hobara.Nothing can be more entertaining
than to see this bird pursued by the hawk, and what a variety of flights
and stratagems it makes use of to escape."The French call the hobara, a
little bustard, _poule de Carthage_, or Carthage-fowl.They are
frequently sold in the market of Tunis, as ordinary fowls, but eat
something like pheasant, and their flesh is red.[35] The most grandly beautiful view in Tunis is that from the
Belvidere, about a mile north-west from the capital, looking immediately
over the Marsa road.Here, on a hill of very moderate elevation, you
have the most beautiful as well as the most magnificent panoramic view
of sea and lake, mountain and plain, town and village, in the whole
Regency, or perhaps in any other part of North Africa.There are besides
many lovely walks around the capital, particularly among and around the
craggy heights of the south-east.But these are little frequented by the
European residents, the women especially, who are so stay-at-homeative
that the greater part of them never walked round the suburbs once in
their lives.Europeans generally prefer the Marina, lined on each side,
not with pleasant trees, but dead animals, sending forth a most
offensive smell.[36] Shaw says: "The rhaad, or safsaf, is a granivorous and gregarious
bird, which wanteth the hinder toe.There are two species, and both
about and a little larger than the ordinary pullet.The belly of both is
white, back and wings of a buff colour spotted with brown, tail lighter
and marked all along with black transverse streaks, beak and legs
stronger than the partridge.The name rhaad, "thunder," is given to it
from the noise it makes on the ground when it rises, safsaf, from its
beating the air, a sound imitating the motion."[37] Ghafsa, whose name Bochart derives from the Hebrew "comprimere,"
is an ancient city, claiming as its august founder, the Libyan
Hercules.It was one of the principal towns in the dominions of
Jugurtha, and well-fortified, rendered secure by being placed in the
midst of immense deserts, fabled to have been inhabited solely by
snakes and serpents.Marius took it by a _coup-de-main_, and put all
the inhabitants to the sword.The modern city is built on a gentle
eminence, between two arid mountains, and, in a great part, with the
materials of the ancient one.Ghafsa has no wall of _euceinte_, or
rather a ruined wall surrounds it, and is defended by a kasbah,
containing a small garrison.This place may be called the gate of the
Tunisian Sahara; it is the limit of Blad-el-Jereed; the sands begin now
to disappear, and the land becomes better, and more suited to the
cultivation of corn.Three villages are situated in the environs, Sala,
El-Kesir, and El-Ghetar.A fraction of the tribe of Hammand deposit
their grain in Ghafsa.This town is famous for its manufactories of
baraeans and blankets ornamented with pretty  flowers.There is
also a nitre and powder-manufactory, the former obtained from the earth
by a very rude process.The environs are beautifully laid out in plantations of the fig, the
pomegranate, and the orange, and especially the datepalm, and the
olive-tree.The oil made here is of peculiarly good quality, and is
exported to Tugurt, and other oases of the Desert.[38] Kaemtz's Meteorology, p.[39] This is the national dish of Barbary, and is a preparation of
wheat-flour granulated, boiled by the steam of meat.It is most
nutritive, and is eaten with or without meat and vegetables.When the
grains are large, it is called hamza.[40] A camel-load is about five cantars, and a cantar is a hundred
weight.[Transcriber's Note: In this electronic edition, the footnotes were

for the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims
on the party for recognition.Both offices were badly in need of
financial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful
one of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.How to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the
problem that confronted the legislature about to assemble.The war of
words between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity.The
editor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times
as "Mr.Timothy Muggins Newson"--his right name being Thomas M.
Newson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr.Foster as the
"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian."To effect a
reconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic
talent of the party leaders.After frequent consultations between the
leading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was
arranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the
paper should be the Minnesotian and Times.It can readily be seen
that a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was
not likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity.The
relations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one
management than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.This unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature
adjourned, when the partnership was dissolved.Foster assumed
entire control of the Minnesotian and Maj.Foster in the
publication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when
the offices separated it was stipulated that Mr.Moore should have the
printing of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part
payment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,
Moore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the
paper he helped to found.After the arrangement was made it was with
the greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville
Brown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state
printer and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that
village.Newson until
the first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R.Marshall
and Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St.The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the
Minnesotian, and in a short time Dr.Foster was compelled to surrender
to its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire
plant.This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies.Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in
the volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W.
Moore was appointed collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he
held for more than twenty years.*       *       *       *       *

Does any one remember that St.Paul had a paper called the Daily North
Star?Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever
have chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet.During
the presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the
Douglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats.There
were only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of
Mr.Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson
Independent--and as they had been designated by the president to
publish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary
to print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the
administration colors at the head of their columns.They were called
"bread and butter papers."Breckinridge thought
their cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an
organ at the capital of the state.Young,
the editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that
village and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance.It was not
necessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a
perfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily
newspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six
cases of type were all that were necessary.This paper was published
regularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the
officeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it
soon collapsed.Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper
history.Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by
Dr.Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to
Gov.This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its
violent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with
much favor, and only existed about eight months.*       *       *       *       *

Some time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about
half a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt.They could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one.Occasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the
better of him and he would uncork a bottle.Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested
in a printing office for more than two years.During the campaign
of 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed
political organizations intended to attract the attention of voters.One dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an
active member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge
Square as they were returning to their hall after a long march.In order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two
organisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian
office in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this
nauseating beverage.The invitation was
readily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the
advocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black
Republican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky.Bottle after
bottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats
of these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much
gusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation
that produced his twenty years' sleep.One of the cardinal principles
of the Democracy, at that time was to "love rum and hate <DW65>s."As
the entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of
march, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of
their platform was rigidly adhered to.THE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862.NARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE
GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH
COULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST.In July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations
calling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of
reinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern
rebellion.It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the
history of the Civil war.McClellan had been compelled to make a
precipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond;
the army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe
reverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not
been able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy;
rebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in
Kentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant
watch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which
they readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid
in the prosecution of their cause.France was preparing to invade
Mexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment
of a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister
republic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save
Russia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to
the success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention
in behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the
government in the North were especially active in their efforts
to prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president;
conspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by
government detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring
to spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North.It was
during this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression
of the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the
history of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of
Minnesota.*       *       *       *       *

It can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope
with an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be.By the
terms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the
Sioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide
on each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big
Stone lake.In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river
was sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow.The selling of
this strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little
Crow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction.The sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the
south side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor.There was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits
of civilization and worked like white men.This was very distasteful
to many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before
the treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game
and sell fur to traders.The government built houses for those who
desired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them
how to farm.At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak
they had several hundred acres of land under cultivation.The
disinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced
dissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the
white man's party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and
the Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who
believed it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform
manual labor.The white man's, or farmer's party, was favored by the
government, some of them having fine houses built for them.The other
Indians did not like this, and became envious of them because they
discontinued the customs of the tribe.There was even said to have
been a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was
to declare war upon the whites.The Indians also claimed that they
were not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely
entirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they
were ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the
paymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and
often leaving many of them in debt.They protested against permitting
the traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and
deduct from their small annuities the amount due them.They had at
least one white man's idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they
got ready.*       *       *       *       *

For several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the
agencies to get their money.Day after day and week after week passed
and there was no sign of paymasters.The year 1862 was the the second
year of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been
taxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war,
it looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota.Many
of the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money
and their families were suffering.The Indians were told that on
account of the great war in which the government was engaged the
payment would never be made.Their annuities were payable in gold and
they were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with.Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go
South, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to
believe that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and
get their land back.It was believed that the men who had enlisted
last had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they
could clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and
Chippewas would come to their assistance.It is known that the Sioux
had been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief,
but the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an
understanding.It was even said at the time that the Confederate
government had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report
and no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness.*       *       *       *       *

Under the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called
upon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth
and Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men
mustered in when the news reached St.Paul that open hostilities had
commenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the
whites was taking place.*       *       *       *       *

The people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that
they were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their
indignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these
treacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers
of the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had,
without a moment's warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of
men, women and children.It was a singular fact that farmer Indians,
whom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard
to civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after
hostilities had actually commenced.*       *       *       *       *

A few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency
a portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county.There they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood.It was
the first step in the great massacre that soon followed.On the
morning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an
indiscriminate massacre was inaugurated.A detachment of Company B of
the Fifth regiment, under command of Capt.Marsh, went to the scene
of the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their
number, including the captain, killed.The horrible work of murder,
pillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux
reservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions
of the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors.*       *       *       *       *

The Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and
Seminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when
compared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this
terrible outbreak.In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed,
several million dollars' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people
rendered homeless.The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern
boundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota
river, had been in a twinkling depopulated.How to repel these
invaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the
state as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied,
was the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national
authorities.*       *       *       *       *

Shortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received,
word was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were
assuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and
Chippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been
influenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an
indiscriminate massacre of the whites.Indian Agent Walker undertook
to arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had
scented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which
caused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and
they were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable
tribes.*       *       *       *       *

The suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the
extraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless
settlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every
side, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session
of the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip
volunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of
shelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky
warriors.Ramsey's picture
of the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature?"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages
could wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from
the category of their crimes," said the governor."Helplessness and
innocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs,
seemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage.Infants hewn
into bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the
murdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her
pulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful
tragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by
these brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into
captivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families
burned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself
with outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating
the bodies of the dead.Such are the spectacles, and a thousand
nameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian
warfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people;
and such the enemy with whom we have to deal."*       *       *       *       *

The old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble
exception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men,
women and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to
Kandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver.Other Day
was an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days,
but experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak
and had adopted the habits of civilization.Paul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver,
and in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll
hall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of
home guards, he said: "I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the
midst of evil.I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing.I
have been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write.I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and
thus learned my vileness.At the present time I have fallen into great
evil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men,
women and children, without moccasins, without food and without a
blanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my
heart is glad.I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit."Other
Day had been a member of the church for several years and his religion
taught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct.*       *       *       *       *

It was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest.Sibley,
on account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed
in command of the troops ordered to assemble at St.Peter, and in
a few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming,
half-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition,
commenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins.The
newspapers and the people were crying "On to Ridgely!"which was then
beleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl "On
to Richmond!"*       *       *       *       *

Any one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of "The Girl
I Left Behind Me" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the
little garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the
forces under command of Gen.Fort Ridgely was a fort only
in name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden
buildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection
when attacked by a large force.The garrison was under the command of
Lieut.His force consisted of about 150 men from the
Fifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of
civilians.He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and
equipped.Although there were only two attempts made to capture the
garrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days.In
addition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support
and protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long
expected, arrived there the day before the outbreak.After bravely
defending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was
relieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command
of Col.McPhail, being the advance of Gen.During
the siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and
spherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with
busy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces
and used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror
among the redskins.Almost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in
large numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident
intention of burning and pillaging the village.Judge Charles E.
Flandrau of this city, who was then residing at St.Peter, organized a
company of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of
that place.The judge received several acquisitions to his force while
en route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of
about 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience.They arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in
driving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several
citizens having been killed and a number of houses burned.Two or
three days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded
the town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts.After
a desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge
Flandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired.There were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or
1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had
the Indian attack been successful.Provisions and ammunition becoming
scarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the
country to Mankato.They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded
them with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the
fight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested.Nearly
two hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving
nothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed
barricade.The long procession of families leaving their desolated
homes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes
in the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the
gallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a
place of safety.*       *       *       *       *

As soon as Gen.Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A
of the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt.Paul,
and seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt.Paul, and several citizen volunteers,
all under the command of Maj.Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with
instructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could
be found, from their perilous surroundings.Paul
organizations and most all of their members were St.They
never had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not
familiar with the use of firearms.After marching for two days, during
which time they interred a large number of victims of the savage
Sioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from
Fort Ridgely.The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of
timber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet
on the other.It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the
command to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been
known that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors.Brown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command.About 4
o'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or
600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate
fire upon the almost helpless little command.For two days they
bravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was
found that about half their number had been killed or wounded.When
the news of the disaster reached St.Relatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in
their denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were
responsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens.It
was feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the
savages.Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view
of the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers.There was no
telegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick
and fast.Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh
outrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover
from the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be
received.Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were
arriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their
houses to be destroyed.The situation was appalling, and many of our
citizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail
to check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin.Every boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees,
and the people of St.Paul were often called upon to assist in
forwarding them to their place of destination.Home guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened
portion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms
or ammunition and their services would have been of little account
against the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked.Paul newspapers offering rewards of
$25 a piece for Sioux scalps.*       *       *       *       *

Gov.Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and
published in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents
of the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of
the Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley,
150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine
county, 210 miles distant.This may have been gratifying to the
residents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the
frontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were
seeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia.*       *       *       *       *

About 12 o'clock one night during the latter part of August a report
was circulated over the northern and western portion of St.Paul that
the savages were near the city, and many women and children were
aroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the
protection of the city authorities.It was an exciting but rather
amusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the
frontier.Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was
not until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St.Paul
felt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux.*       *       *       *       *

As soon as Gen.Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable
him to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations.He had
collected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including
the Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of
Capt.The expedition marched for two or three days
without encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of
September several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment
were fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake.About 800 of the command
were engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal
number of Indians.Marshall, with
about 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded
in utterly routing them.Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty
wounded.This was the only real battle of the war.Other Day was with
the whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter.Pope, who was in command of the department of the
Northwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was
over and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his
command.Pope was met with a decided remonstrance
by the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the
removal of any of the troops until they had made two long marches
through the Dakotas and to Montana.Sibley's command reached Camp
Release on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was
located a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the
massacres.They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods
and white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to
precede at once to their rescue.Sibley was of the opinion that
any hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the
prisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution.After a
few preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the
captives were released.Sibley made inquiries
as to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes
recently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of
them had been guilty of the grossest atrocities.The general decided
to form a military tribunal and try the offenders.After a series of
sittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,
321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of
whom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms
of imprisonment according to their crimes.All of the condemned
prisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail
constructed for the purpose.After the court-martial had completed
its work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities,
a great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale
slaughter of the beloved red man.The Quakers of Philadelphia and the
good people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president
to put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution.The president,
after consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the
execution of only thirty-eight of the most flagrant cases, and
accordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862.*       *       *       *       *

Previous to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed
by Rev.Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions.Nearly
every one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to
them.Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and
when speaking of their wives and children almost every one was
affected to tears.Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of
salvation, and expected to go at once to the abode of the Great
Spirit.Rattling Runner, who was a son-in-law of Wabasha, dictated the
following letter, which is a sample of the confessions made to Dr.Riggs: "Wabasha, you have deceived me.You told me if we followed the
advice of Gen.Sibley and gave ourselves up, all would be well--no
innocent man would be injured.I have not killed or injured a white
man or any white person.I have not participated in the plunder of
their property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution and must
die, while men who are guilty will remain in prison.My wife is your
daughter, my children are your grandchildren.I leave them all in your
care and under your protection.Do not let them suffer, and when they
are grown up let them know that their father died because he followed
the advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man
to answer for to the Holy Spirit.Let them not grieve for me; let them remember that the brave should be
prepared to meet death, and I will do as becomes a Dakotah."Wabasha was a Sioux chief, and although he was not found guilty of
participating in any of the massacres of women and children, he was
probably in all the most important battles.Wabasha county, and
Wabasha street in St.After the execution the bodies were taken down, loaded into wagons and
carried down to a sandbar in front of the city, where they were all
dumped into the same hole.They did not remain there long, but were
spirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a
dissecting knife.Little Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the
number that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a
farmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson.His scalp is now
in the state historical society.Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a
few miles below St.Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian.Little
Crow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish
that his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom
himself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the
old man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute,
quarrelsome and dangerous Indian.He was opposed to all change of
dress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and
teachers.He was seldom known to tell the truth and possessed very few
redeeming qualities.Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians,
he was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent
assumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless
struggle against the whites.*       *       *       *       *

Between the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there
was great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the
president should pardon the condemned.Meetings were held throughout
the valley and organizations were springing into existence for the
purpose of overpowering the strong guard at Mankato and wreaking
summary justice upon the Indians.The situation became so serious
pending the decision of the president that the governor was compelled
to issue a proclamation calling upon all good citizens not to tarnish
the fair name of the state by an act of lawlessness that the outside
world would never forget, however great was the provocation.When
the final order came to execute only thirty-eight there was great
disappointment.Mary journeyed to the bedroom.Paul and generally
signed favoring the removal of the condemned Indians to Massachusetts
to place them under the refining influence of the constituents of
Senator Hoar, the same people who are now so terribly shocked because
a humane government is endeavoring to prevent, in the Philippines, a
repetition of the terrible atrocities committed in Minnesota.*       *       *       *       *

The balance of the condemned were kept in close confinement till
spring, when they were taken to Davenport, and afterward to some point
on the Missouri river, where a beneficent government kindly permitted
them to sow the seed of discontent that finally culminated in the
Custer massacre.When it was known that the balance of the condemned
Indians were to be transported to Davenport by steamer.Paul
people made preparations to give them a warm reception as they passed
down the river, but their intentions were frustrated by the government
officers in charge of their removal, as they arranged to have the
steamer Favorite, on which they were to be transported, pass by the
city in the middle of the night.Paul people were highly indignant
when apprised of their escape.Little Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the
outbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at
Pembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling,
where they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of
10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital
punishment for their great crimes.Little Six confessed to having
murdered fifty white men, women and children.*       *       *       *       *

One of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to
contend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the
frontier.There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to
transport provisions was by wagon.An order was issued by the military
authorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose,
but the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient
alacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it
was necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly
impressing into service of the government any and all teams that could
be found on the streets or in stables.A detachment of Company K of
the Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the
city several days on that especial duty.As soon as the farmers heard
that the government was taking possession of everything that came over
the bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried
it to Hastings.There was one silver-haired farmer living near the
city limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with
the South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could
not locate his team.One of the members of Company K was a former
neighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty
to see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government.A
close watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down
to the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where
he thought they would be safe until he returned.As soon as the old
man passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses,
and when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden
with supplies for the troops at the fort.Of course the government
subsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in
this particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it.Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the
military squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in
charge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it
exempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that a power
higher than the governor required that team and that it must go to
Abercrombie.*       *       *       *       *

It was necessary to send out a large escort with these supply trains
and It was easier to procure men for that purpose than it was for the
regular term of enlistment.Paul
was a young man by the name of Hines.He was as brave as Julius
Caesar.He was so heavily loaded with various
weapons of destruction that his companions called him a walking
arsenal.If Little Crow had attacked this particular train the Indian
war would have ended.This young man had been so very demonstrative of
his ability to cope with the entire Sioux force that his companions
resolved to test his bravery.One night when the train was camped
about half way between St.Cloud and Sauk Center, several of the
guards attached to the train painted their faces, arrayed themselves
in Indian costume and charged through the camp, yelling the Indian war
hoop and firing guns in every direction.Young Hines was the first to
hear the alarm, and didn't stop running until he reached St.Cloud,
spreading the news in every direction that the entire tribe of
Little Crow was only a short distance behind.Of course there was
consternation along the line of this young man's masterly retreat,
and it was some time before the panic-stricken citizens knew what had
actually happened.*       *       *       *       *

In response to the appeal of Gov.Sibley and other officers on the
frontier, the ladies of St.Paul early organized for the purpose of
furnishing sick and wounded soldiers with such supplies as were not
obtainable through the regular channels of the then crude condition of
the various hospitals.Notices like the following often appeared in
the daily papers at that time: "Ladies Aid Society--A meeting of the
ladies' aid society for the purpose of sewing for the relief of the
wounded soldiers at our forts, and also for the assistance of the
destitute refugees now thronging our city, is called to meet this
morning at Ingersoll hall.All ladies interested in this object are
earnestly invited to attend.All contributions of either money or
clothing will be thankfully received.By order of the president,

"Mrs.Selby was the wife of John W. Selby, one of the first residents
of the city, Miss Holyoke was the Clara Barton of Minnesota, devoting
her whole time and energy to the work of collecting sanitary supplies
for the needy soldiers in the hospitals.Scores of poor soldiers who were languishing in hospital tents on
the sunburnt and treeless prairies of the Dakotas, or suffering from
disease contracted in the miasmatic swamps of the rebellious South
have had their hearts gladdened and their bodies strengthened by being
supplied with the delicacies collected through the efforts of
the noble and patriotic ladies of this and kindred organizations
throughout the state.Many instances are recorded of farmers leaving their harvesters in the
field and joining the grand army then forming for the defense of the
imperilled state and nation, while their courageous and energetic
wives have gone to the fields and finished harvesting the ripened
crops.*       *       *       *       *

By reason of the outbreak the Sioux forfeited to the government, in
addition to an annual annuity of $68,000 for fifty years, all the
lands they held in Minnesota, amounting in the aggregate to about
750,000 acres, worth at the present time something like $15,000,000.Had they behaved themselves and remained In possession of this immense
tract of land, they would have been worth twice as much per capita as
any community in the United States.FIREMEN AND FIRES OF PIONEER DAYS.A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ST.PAUL, FIRE DEPARTMENT--PIONEER HOOK AND
LADDER COMPANY--HOPE ENGINE COMPANY AND MINNEHAHA ENGINE COMPANY--A
LARGE NUMBER OF HOTEL FIRES.WHEN WE RAN WITH THE OLD MACHINE.*       *       *       *       *

  Brave relics of the past are we,
    Old firemen, staunch and true,
  We're thinking now of days gone by
    And all that we've gone through.Thro' fire and flames we've made our way,
    And danger we have seen;
  We never can forget the time
    When we ran with the old machine.In numbers now we are but few,
  A host have pased away,
  But still we're happy, light and free,
    Our spirits never decay
  We often sigh for those old days
    Whose memory we keep green,
  Oh!there was joy for man and boy,
    When we ran with the old machine.*       *       *       *       *

Instruments for extinguishing fires were introduced in various parts
of Europe more than three hundred years ago.The fire laddies of that
period would probably look aghast if they could see the implements
in use at the present time.One of the old time machines is said to
consist of a huge tank of water placed upon wheels, drawn by a large
number of men, and to which was attached a small hose.When the water
in the tank became exhausted it was supplied by a bucket brigade,
something on the plan in use at the present time in villages not able
to support an engine.The oldest record of a fire engine in Paris was one used in the king's
library in 1684, which, having but one cylinder, threw water to a
great height, a result obtained by the use of an air chamber.Leather
hose was introduced into Amsterdam in 1670, by two Dutchmen, and they
also invented the suction pipe at about the same period.About the
close of the seventeenth century an improved engine was patented in
England.It was a strong cistern of oak placed upon wheels, furnished
with a pump, an air chamber and a suction pipe of strong leather,
through which run a spiral piece of metal.This engine was little
improved until the early part of the last century.In the United States bucket fire departments were organized in most of
the cities in the early part of the last century, and hand engines,
used by the old volunteer firemen, did not come into general use until
about fifty years later.The New York volunteer fire department was
for a long time one of the institutions of the country.When they had
their annual parade the people of the surrounding towns would flock
to the city and the streets would be as impassible as they are to-day
when a representative of one of the royal families of Europe is placed
on exhibition.At the New York state fairs during the early '50s the
tournaments of the volunteer fire department of the various cities
throughout the state formed one of the principal attractions.Many
a melee occurred between the different organizations because they
considered that they had not been properly recognized in the line of
march or had not been awarded a medal for throwing a stream of water
farther than other competitors.A Berlin correspondent of the Pioneer Press many years ago, said that
when an alarm of fire was sounded in the city, the members of the fire
companies would put on their uniforms and report to their various
engine houses.When a sufficient number had assembled to make a
showing the foreman would call the roll, beer would be passed down the
line, the health of the kaiser properly remembered and then they would
start out in search of the fire.As a general thing the fire would
be out long before they arrived upon the scene, and they would then
return to their quarters, have another beer and be dismissed.To Cincinnati belongs the credit of having introduced the first paid
steam fire department in the United States, but all the other large
cities rapidly followed.*       *       *       *       *

In the fall of 1850 the town fathers of St.Paul passed an ordinance
requiring the owners of all buildings, public or private, to provide
and keep in good repair, substantial buckets, marked with paint the
word "Fire" on one side and the owner's name on the other, subject
to inspection by the fire warden and to be under his control when
occasion required.The first attempt at organizing a fire brigade, was
made by R.C.Knox raised a small sum of
money by subscription, with which he purchased several ladders, and
they were frequently brought into requisition by the little band of
men whom Mr.Knox was a man of
enormous stature, and it was said he could tire out a dozen ordinary
men at a fire.*       *       *       *       *

Two public-spirited citizens of St.Paul, John McCloud and Thompson
Ritchie, purchased in the East and brought to the city at their own
expense the first fire engine introduced in the Northwest.Although
it was a miniature affair, on numerous occasions it rendered valuable
assistance in protecting the property of our pioneer merchants.Ritchie is still living, his home being in Philadelphia.*       *       *       *       *

In November, 1854, Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No.1 was organized
under provisions of the city charter.A constitution and by-laws were
adopted and the members agreed to turn out promptly on all occasions
of fire alarms.As compensation for their services they were excused
from jury duty, poll tax, work on the roads, or state military
service, for the period of five years.The original constitution of
the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company contained the following membership
roll: Foreman, Isaac A. Banker; assistant foremen, H.B.Pearson and
George F. Blake; treasurer, Richard Galloway; secretary, Robert Mason;
members, Henry Buell, John W. Cathcart, Charles D. Elfelt, Edward
Heenan, Thompson Ritchie, Philip Ross, Wash.Stevenson,
Benjamin F. Irvine, R.I.Thomson, John McCloud, J.Q.A.Of the above John McCloud is the only one living in the
city at the present time.McCloud was a member of the firm of
McCloud & Bro., hardware dealers, and they occupied the building on
the southwest corner of Third and Cedar streets.This was the first full-fledged fire organization in the city, and as
Mr.McCloud took the initiative in forming this company he may justly
be called the "Father of the Volunteer Fire Department of St.The old hook and ladder company was one of the representative
institutions of the city.From the date of its organization up to the
time of the establishment of the paid fire department many of the most
prominent men of the city were enrolled among its members.All of the
property of the company was owned by the organization, but in 1856,
having become somewhat financially embarrassed, their accounts were
turned over to the city and they were thereafter under the control of
the city fathers.At that time they possessed one truck, hooks and
ladders, and one fire engine with hose.Washington M. Stees was
made chief engineer and Charles H. Williams assistant.This scanty
equipment did not prove adequate for extinguishing fires and petitions
were circulated requesting the council to purchase two fire engines of
the more approved pattern, and also to construct a number of cisterns
in the central part of the city, so that an adequate supply of water
could be readily obtained.The city fathers concluded to comply with
the request of the petitioners and they accordingly purchased two
double-deck hand fire engines and they arrived in the city in August,
1858.Our citizens
then congratulated themselves upon the possession of a first-class
fire department and they predicted that thereafter a great fire would
be a thing of the past.One of the most irrepressible members of Pioneer Hook and Ladder
company in the early days was a little red-headed Irishman by the name
of A.D.He was foreman of the Daily Minnesotian office and he
usually went by the name of "Johnny Martin."Now Johnny always kept
his fire paraphernalia close at hand, and every time a fire bell
sounded he was "Johnny on the spot."After the fire was over Johnny
generally had to celebrate, and every time Johnny celebrated he would
make a solemn declaration that it was his duty to kill an Irishman
before he returned to work.He would accordingly provide himself with
an immense Derringer and start out in quest of a subject upon whom he
proposed to execute his sanguinary threat.Strange to relate he
never succeeded in finding one of his unfortunate countrymen, and it
generally required two or three days to restore him to his former
equilibrium.If Johnny was a member of the fire department to-day he
would probably discover that the task of finding one of his countrymen
would not be so difficult.*       *       *       *       *

In 1857 Hope Engine Company No.1 was organized, and they petitioned
the common council to purchase 500 feet of hose for their use.In
the fall of 1858 this company was given possession of one of the new
engines recently purchased and it was comfortably housed at their
headquarters in an old frame building on the southwest corner of
Franklin and Fourth streets, and in a short time removed to a new
brick building on Third street, fronting on Washington.Michael Leroy
was made the first foreman and R.C.Wiley and Joseph S. Herey were
his assistants.The membership contained the names of John H. Dodge,
Porteus Dodge, John E. Missen, Joseph Elfelt, Fred Whipperman, John T.
Toal, J.H.Grand, Charles Riehl, John Raguet, E. Rhodes,
B. Bradley, Charles Hughes, Bird Boesch, T.F.Masterson, John J.
Williams and V. Metzger.During the fall of 1858 a large number of the
most prominent business men in the vicinity of Seven Corners joined
the organization and continued in active membership until the arrival
of the first steamer.*       *       *       *       *

In the winter of 1857-1858 Minnehaha Engine.2 was
organized, and it was provided with an engine house near the corner
of Third and Jackson streets.Grant,
foreman; M.J.Terwilliger, assistants; members,
Harry M. Shaw, Nicholas Hendy, John B. Oliver, F.A.Hadway, N. Nicuhaus, L.R.Storing, William T. Donaldson,
Daniel Rohrer, J. Fletcher Williams, N. W. Kittson, Alfred Bayace,
John McCauley and a number of others.The Minnehahas were a prosperous
organization from the first, and their engine house was always kept
open and served as a general lounging and reading-room for such of its
members as had nothing particular to do.*       *       *       *       *

Rotary Independent Company No.1 was the third engine connected with
the St.Paul fire department, but that was a private institution and
was only used when there was a general alarm and on the days of the
annual parade of the department.This engine was purchased from the
government by John S. Prince when Fort Snelling was abandoned, and was
used for the protection of the property of the mill, which was located
on lower Third street.*       *       *       *       *

By the formation of Minnehaha Engine company the city fathers thought
they were possessed of quite a respectable fire department, and from
that time on the annual parade of the St.Paul fire department was one
of the events of the year.The first parade occurred on the 12th
of September, 1859, and was participated in by the following
organizations:

  Pioneer Hook and Ladder Company No.These four companies numbered 175 men, and after completing their line
of march were reviewed by the mayor and common council in front of the
old city hall.In 1858 the legislature passed an act requiring the sextons of the
different churches to ring the church bells fifteen minutes whenever
there was an alarm of fire.The uptown churches would ring their
bells, the downtown churches would ring their bells, and the churches
in the central part of the city would ring their bells.There was a
regular banging and clanging of the bells."In the startled air of night,
  They would scream out their afright,
  Too much horrified to speak,
  They could only shriek, shriek,
  Out of tune."Every one turned out when the fire bells rang.Unless the fire was of
sufficient volume to be readily located, the uptown people would be
seen rushing downtown, and the downtown people would be seen rushing
uptown, in fact, general pandemonium prevailed until the exact
location of the fire could be determined.Whenever there was a large fire the regular firemen would soon tire
of working on the brakes and they would appeal to the spectators to
relieve them for a short time.As a general thing the appeal would be
readily responded to, but occasionally it would be necessary for the
police to impress into service a force sufficient to keep the brakes
working.Any person refusing to work on the brakes was liable to
arrest and fine, and it was often amusing to see the crowds disperse
whenever the police were in search of a relief force.*       *       *       *       *

Upon the breaking out of the war a large number of the firemen
enlisted in the defense of the country and the ranks of the department
were sadly decimated.It was during the early part of the war that the
mayor of St.Paul made a speech to the firemen at the close of their
annual parade in which he referred to them as being as brave if not
braver than the boys at the front.The friends of the boys in blue
took serious umbrage at this break of the mayor, and the press of the
city and throughout the state were very indignant to think that the
capital city possessed a mayor of doubtful loyalty.The excitement
soon died away and the mayor was re-elected by a large majority.*       *       *       *       *

There was not much change in the condition of the department until
the arrival of the first steamer, Aug.The new steamer was
lodged with Hope Engine company, and an engineer and fireman appointed
at a salary of $1,600 per year for the two.The boys of Hope Engine
company did not like the selection of the engineer of the new steamer
and took the matter so seriously that their organization was disbanded
and St.1 was organized, and they took charge
of the new steamer.The rapid growth of the city necessitated the
frequent purchase of new fire apparatus, and at the present time the
St.Paul fire department has 211 paid men, 15 steamers, 4 chemicals, 8
hook and ladder companies and 122 horses.*       *       *       *       *

The volunteer fire department had no better friend than the late Mrs.She was the guardian angel of the fire department.No night so cold or storm so great that Mrs.Presley was not present
and with her own hands provide coffee and sandwiches for the tired and
hungry firemen who had been heroically battling with the flames.She
was an honored guest at all entertainments with which the firemen
were connected, and was always toasted and feasted by the boys at the
brakes.She will ever be remembered, not only by the firemen, but by
all old settlers, as one of the many noble women in St.Paul whose
unostentatious deeds of charity have caused a ray of sunshine in many
sad homes.Presley's death was deeply regretted, not only by the fire
department, but by every resident of the city.*       *       *       *       *

Among the many brilliant members of the legal fraternity in St.Paul
in early times no one possessed a more enviable reputation than
the Hon.He was the very personification of
punctiliousness and always displayed sublime imperturbability in
exigencies of great moment.One dreary winter night his sleeping
apartment in uppertown was discovered to be on fire, and in a short
time the fire laddies appeared in front of his quarters and commenced
operations.Ames discovered the nature of the
disturbance he arose from his bed, opened the window, and with
outstretched arms and in a supplicating manner, as if addressing a
jury in an important case, exclaimed: "Gentlemen, if you will be kind
enough to desist from operations until I arrange my toilet, I will be
down."The learned counsel escaped with his toilet properly adjusted,
but his apartments were soon incinerated.*       *       *       *       *

HOTEL FIRES.*       *       *       *       *

LIST OF HOTELS DESTROYED BY FIRE DURING ST.Daniels house, near Seven Corners.New England hotel, Third street
  Hotel to the Wild Hunter, Jackson street.*       *       *       *       *

The first hotel fire of any importance was that of the Daniels house,
located on Eagle street near Seven Corners, which occurred in 1852.The building had just been finished and furnished for occupancy.A
strong wind was raging and the little band of firemen were unable
to save the structure.Neill, Isaac Markley,
Bartlett Presley and W.M.Stees were among the firemen who assisted in
saving the furniture.*       *       *       *       *

The Sintominie hotel on the corner of Sixth and John streets, was the
second hotel to receive a visit from the fire king.This hotel was
constructed by the late C.W.Borup, and it was the pride of lower
town.Rich were preparing to open it when the
fire occurred.Owing to the lack of fire protection the building was
totally destroyed.*       *       *       *       *

Early in the winter of 1856 the Rice house, commonly supposed to
be the first brick building erected in St.It was three stories high, and when in process of building was
considered a visionary enterprise.The building was constructed by
Henry M. Rice, and he spared no expense to make it as complete as the
times would allow.It was situated on Third street near Market, and
in the early days was considered St.In its
parlor and barroom the second session of the territorial legislature
was held, and the supreme court of the territory also used it for
several terms.*       *       *       *       *

The Canada house and the Galena house, two small frame structures on
Robert near Third, were the next hotels to be visited by the fiery
element.These hotels, though small, were well patronized at the time
of their destruction.*       *       *       *       *

On the 16th of March, 1860, the most destructive fire that had ever
occurred in St.Paul broke out in a small wooden building on Third
street near Jackson, and though the entire fire department--three
engines and one truck, manned by one hundred men--were promptly on
hand, the flames rapidly got beyond their reach.Nearly all the
buildings on Third street at that time from Robert to Jackson were
two-story frame structures, and in their rear were small houses
occupied by the owners of the stores.When the fire was at its height
it was feared that the whole of lower town would be destroyed before
the flames could be subdued, but by dint of superhuman effort the
firemen managed to cut off the leap across Robert street and soon had
the immense smouldering mass under control.Thirty-four buildings, the
largest number ever destroyed in St.Of the two
blocks which lined the north and south sides of Third street above
Jackson, only three buildings were left standing, two being stone
structures occupied by Beaumont & Gordon and Bidwell & Co., and
the other a four-story brick building owned and occupied by A.L.The New England, a two-story log house, and one of the
first hotels built in St.The New England
was a feature in St.Paul, and it was pointed out to newcomers as the
first gubernatorial mansion, and in which Gov.Ramsey had
begun housekeeping in 1849.The Empire saloon was another historic
ruin, for in its main portion the first printing office of the
territory had long held forth, and from it was issued the first
Pioneer, April 10, 1849.The Hotel to the Wild Hunter was also
destroyed at this fire.*       *       *       *       *

In the fall of 1862 the Winslow house, located at Seven Corners, was
entirely destroyed by fire.A defective stovepipe in the cupola caused
the fire, and it spread so rapidly that it was beyond the control
of the firemen when they arrived upon the scene.A few pieces of
furniture, badly damaged, was all that was saved of this once popular
hotel.The Winslow was a four-story brick building, and with the
exception of the Fuller house the largest hotel in the city.The hotel
was constructed in 1854 by the late J.M.Winslow was one
of the most ingenious hotel constructors in the West.In some peculiar
manner he was enabled to commence the construction of a building
without any capital, but when the building was completed he not only
had the building, but a bank account that indicated that he was a
financier as well as a builder.The proprietors of the Winslow were
arrested for incendarism, but after a preliminary examination were
discharged.*       *       *       *       *

The American house, on the corner of Third and Exchange streets, was
one of the landmarks of the city for a good many years.It was built
in 1849, and the territorial politicians generally selected this hotel
as their headquarters.Although it was of very peculiar architecture,
the interior fittings were of a modern character.On a stormy night in
the month of December, 1863, an alarm of fire was sent in from this
hotel, but before the fire department reached the locality the fire
was beyond their control.The weather was bitter cold, and the water
would be frozen almost as soon as it left the hose.Finding their
efforts fruitless to save the building, the firemen turned their
attention to saving the guests.There were some very narrow escapes,
but no accidents of a very serious nature.As usual, thieves were
present and succeeded in carrying off a large amount of jewelry and
wearing apparel belonging to the guests.*       *       *       *       *

In the year of 1856 Mackubin & Edgerton erected a fine three-story
brick building on the corner of Third and Franklin streets.It was
occupied by them as a banking house for a long time.The business
center having been moved further down the street, they were compelled
to seek quarters on Bridge Square.After the bank moved out of
this building it was leased to Bechtner & Kottman, and was by them
remodeled into a hotel on the European plan at an expense of about
$20,000.It was named the Cosmopolitan hotel, and was well patronized.When the alarm of fire was given it was full of lodgers, many of whom
lost all they possessed.The Linden theatrical company, which was
playing at the Athenaeum, was among the heavy sufferers.At this fire
a large number of frame buildings on the opposite side of the street
were destroyed.When the Cosmopolitan hotel burned the walls of the old building were
left standing, and although they were pronounced dangerous by the city
authorities, had not been demolished.Schell, one of the best
known physicians of the city, occupied a little frame building near
the hotel, and he severely denounced the city authorities for their
lax enforcement of the law.One night at 10 o'clock the city was
visited by a terrific windstorm, and suddenly a loud crash was heard
in the vicinity of the doctor's office.A portion of the walls of the
hotel had fallen and the little building occupied by the doctor had
been crushed in.The fire alarm was turned on and the fire laddies
were soon on the spot.No one supposed the doctor was alive, but after
the firemen had been at work a short time they could hear the voice
of the doctor from underneath the rubbish.In very vigorous English,
which the doctor knew so well how to use, he roundly upbraided the
fire department for not being more expeditious in extricating him from
his perilous position.After the doctor had been taken out of the
ruins It was found that he had not been seriously injured, and in the
course of a few weeks was able to resume practice.*       *       *       *       *

During the winter of 1868 the Emmert house, situated on Bench street
near Wabasha, was destroyed by fire.The Emmert house was built in
territorial times by Fred Emmert, who for some time kept a hotel and
boarding house at that place.It had not been used for hotel purposes
for some time, but was occupied by a  family and used as a
boarding-house for <DW52> people.While the flames were rapidly
consuming the old building the discovery was made that a man and
his wife were sick in one of the rooms with smallpox.The crowd of
onlookers fled in terror, and they would have been burned alive had
not two courageous firemen carried them out of the building.It was
an unusually cold night and the <DW52> people were dumped into the
middle of the street and there allowed to remain.They were provided
with clothing and some of the more venturesome even built a fire for
them, but no one would volunteer to take them to a place of shelter.About 10 o'clock on the following day the late W.L.Wilson learned
of the unfortunate situation of the two <DW52> people, and he
immediately procured a vehicle and took them to a place of safety, and
also saw that they were thereafter properly cared for.*       *       *       *       *

On the site of the old postoffice on the corner of Wabasha and Fifth
streets stood the Mansion house, a three-story frame building erected
by Nicholas Pottgieser in early days at an expense of $12,000.It was
a very popular resort and for many years the weary traveler there
received a hearty welcome.A very exciting event occurred at this house during the summer of
1866.A man by the name of Hawkes, a guest at the hotel, accidentally
shot and instantly killed his young and beautiful wife.He was
arrested and tried for murder, but after a long and sensational trial
was acquited.*       *       *       *       *

The greatest hotel fire in the history of St.The International hotel (formerly the Fuller
house) was situated on the northeast corner of Seventh and Jackson
streets, and was erected by A.G.It was built of brick
and was five stories high.It cost when completed, about $110,000.For
years it had been the best hotel in the West.William H. Seward and
the distinguished party that accompanied him made this hotel their
headquarters during their famous trip to the West in 1860.Sibley had their headquarters in this building, and from here
emanated all the orders relating to the war against the rebellious
Sioux.In 1861 the property came into the possession of Samuel Mayall,
and he changed the name of it from Fuller house to International
hotel.Belote, who had formerly been the landlord of the
Merchants, was the manager of the hotel.The fire broke out in the
basement, it was supposed from a lamp in the laundry.The night was
intensely cold, a strong gale blowing from the northwest.Not a soul
could be seen upon the street.Within this great structure more than
two hundred guests were wrapped in silent slumber.To rescue them from
their perilous position was the problem that required instant action
on the part of the firemen and the hotel authorities.The legislature
was then in session, and many of the members were among the guests who
crowded the hotel.A porter was the first to notice the blaze, and
he threw a pail water upon it, but with the result that it made no
impression upon the flames.The fire continued to extend, and the
smoke became very dense and spread into the halls, filling them
completely, rendering breathing almost an impossibility.In the
meantime the alarm had been given throughout the house, and the
guests, both male and female, came rushing out of the rooms in their
night Clothes.The broad halls of the hotel were soon filled with a
crowd of people who hardly knew which way to go in order to find their
way to the street.The servant girls succeeded in getting out first,
and made their way to the snow-covered streets without sufficient
clothing to protect their persons, and most of them were without
shoes.While the people were escaping from the building the fire was
making furious and rapid progress.From the laundry the smoke issued
into every portion of the building.There was no nook or corner that
the flames did not penetrate.The interior of the building burned with
great rapidity until the fire had eaten out the eastern and southern
rooms, when the walls began to give indications of falling.The upper
portion of them waved back and forth in response to a strong wind,
which filled the night air with cinders.At last different portions of
the walls fell, thus giving the flames an opportunity to sweep from
the lower portions of the building.Great gusts, which seemed to
almost lift the upper floors, swept through the broken walls.High up
over the building the flames climbed, carrying with them sparks and
cinders, and in come instances large pieces of timber.All that saved
the lower part of the city from fiery destruction was the fact that a
solid bed of snow a foot deep lay upon the roofs of all the buildings.During all this time there was comparative quiet, notwithstanding the
fact that the fire gradually extended across Jackson street and also
across Seventh street.Besides the hotel, six or eight other buildings
were also on fire, four of which were destroyed.Women and men were to
be seen hurrying out of the burning buildings in their night
clothes, furniture was thrown into the street, costly pianos, richly
upholstered furniture, valuable pictures and a great many other
expensive articles were dropped in the snow in a helter-skelter
manner.Although nearly every room in the hotel was occupied and
rumors flew thick and fast that many of the guests were still in their
rooms, fortunately no lives were lost and no one was injured.The
coolest person in the building was a young man by the name of Pete
O'Brien, the night watchman.When he heard of the fire he comprehended
in a moment the danger of a panic among over two hundred people who
were locked in sleep, unconscious of danger.He went from room to room
and from floor to floor, telling them of the danger, but assuring them
all that they had plenty of time to escape.He apparently took command
of the excited guests and issued orders like a general on the field of
battle.To his presence of mind and coolness many of the guests were
indebted for their escape from a frightful death.The fire department
worked hard and did good service.The city had no waterworks at that
time, but relied for water entirely upon cisterns located in different
parts of the city.When the cisterns became dry it was necessary
to place the steamer at the river and pump water through over two
thousand feet of hose.Among the guests at the hotel at the time of the fire were Gen.Le Duc, Selah
Chamberlain, Gov.Armstrong and wife, Charles A. Gilman and wife,
Dr.Charles N. Hewitt, M.H.Dunnell, Judge
Thomas Wilson and more than two hundred others.*       *       *       *       *

The Park Place hotel on the corner of Summit avenue and St.Peter
street, was at one time one of of the swell hotels of the city.It
was a frame building, four stories high and nicely situated.The
proprietors of it intended it should be a family hotel, but it did not
meet with the success anticipated, and when, on the 19th of May, 1878,
it was burned to the ground it was unoccupied.The fire was thought
to be the work of incendiaries.The loss was about $20,000, partially
insured.Four firemen were quite seriously injured at this fire, but
all recovered.*       *       *       *       *

The Carpenter house, on the corner of Summit avenue and Ramsey street,
was built by Warren Carpenter.Carpenter was a man of colossal
ideas, and from the picturesque location of his hotel, overlooking the
city, he could see millions of tourists flocking to his hostelry.The
panic of 1857, soon followed by the great Civil war, put a quietus on
immigration, and left him stranded high on the beach.Carpenter's
dream of millions were far from being realized, and when on the 26th
of January, 1879, the hotel was burned to the ground, it had for some
time previous passed beyond his control.*       *       *       *       *

At one time there were three flourishing hotels on Bench street.The average citizen of to-day does not know that such a street ever
existed.The Central house, on the corner of Bench and Minnesota
streets, was the first hotel of any pretension built in the city,
and it was one of the last to be burned.The first session of the
territorial legislature of Minnesota was held in the dining room of
this old hotel building, and for a number of years the hotel did a
thriving business.As the city grew it was made over into a large
boarding house, and before the war Mrs.Ferguson, George Pulford and Ben
Ferris, the latter being in possession of it when it was destroyed by
fire.The building was burned In August, 1873.*       *       *       *       *

A hotel that was very popular for some time was the Greenman house,
situated on the corner of Fifth and St.Peter streets, the site of the
Windsor hotel.It was a three-story frame structure and was built in
the early seventies.Greenman kept the hotel for some time, and
then sold it to John Summers, who was the owner of it when it was
burned.*       *       *       *       *

The Merchants is the only one of the old hotels still existing, and
that only in name, as the original structure was torn down to make
room for the present building many years ago.*       *       *       *       *

Aside from the hotel fires one of the most appalling calamities that
ever occurred at a fire in St.Paul took place in May, 1870, when the
old Concert Hall building on Third street, near Market, was destroyed.Concert Hall was built by the late J.W.McClung in 1857, and the hall
in the basement was one of the largest in the city.The building was
three stories high in front and six or seven on the river side.It
was located about twenty-five feet back from the sidewalk.Under the
sidewalk all kinds of inflamable material was stored and it was from
here that the fire was first noticed.In an incredibly short time
flames reached the top of the building, thus making escape almost
impossible.On the river side of the building on the top floor two
brothers, Charles and August Mueller, had a tailor shop.The fire
spread so rapidly that the building was completely enveloped in flames
before they even thought their lives were endangered.In front of them
was a seething mass of flames and the distance to the ground on the
river side was so great that a leap from the window meant almost
certain death.They could be plainly seen frantically calling for
help.Finally Charles Mueller
jumped out on the window sill and made a leap for life, and an instant
later he was followed by his brother.The bewildered spectators did
not suppose for a moment that either could live.They were too much
horrified to speak, but when it was over and they were lifted into
beds provided for them doctors were called and recovery was pronounced
possible.August Mueller is
still living in the city.A lady by the name of McClellan, who had a
dressmaking establishment in the building, was burned to death and it
was several days before her body was recovered.The following named men have been chiefs of the St.Paul fire
department:

HALL--DAN EMMET AND DIXIE--THE HUTCHINSONS--MAZURKA HALL, MOZART HALL,
ETC.Very few of the 200,000 inhabitants of St.Paul are aware that the
three-story, three-cornered building on Third street at Seven Corners
once contained one of the most popular amusement halls in the city.It
was called Irvine hall, and at one time Melodeon hall.Dan Emmet had a
minstrel company at this hall during the years 1857 and 1858, and an
excellent company it was, too.There was Frank Lombard, the great
baritone; Max Irwin, bones, and one of the funniest men who ever sat
on the stage; Johnny Ritter, female impersonator and clog dancer, and
a large number of others.Frank Lombard afterward achieved a national
reputation as one of the best baritone singers in the country.He
was much sought after for patriotic entertainments and political
conventions.His masterpiece was the Star-Spangled Banner, and his
great baritone voice, which could be heard for blocks, always brought
enthusiastic applause.Some time during the summer of 1858 the
Hutchinson family arranged to have the hall for a one-night
entertainment.By some means or other the troupe got separated and one
of the brothers got stalled on Pig's Eye bar.When their performance
was about half over the belated brother reached the hall and rushed
frantically down the aisle, with carpetbag in hand, leaped upon the
stage, and in full view of the audience proceeded to kiss the entire
tribe.The audience was under the impression they had been separated
for years instead of only twenty-four hours.John went back to the garden.The next evening Max
Irwin was missing from his accustomed place as one of the end men, and
when the performance had been in progress for about fifteen minutes
Max came rushing down the aisle with carpetbag in hand and went
through the same performance as did the lost brother of the Hutchinson
family.The effect was electrical, and for some time Max's innovation
was the talk of the town.Dan Emmet, though a wondering minstrel, was
a very superior man and was his own worst enemy.He was a brother of
Lafayette S. Emmett, chief justice of the supreme court of the State
of Minnesota.The judge, dignified and aristocratic, did not take
kindly to the idea of his brother being a minstrel.Dan was not
particularly elated because his brother was on the supreme bench.They
were wholly indifferent as to each other's welfare.They did not even
spell their names the same way.Dan had only one "t" at the end of his
name, while the judge used two.Whether the judge used two because
he was ashamed of Dan, or whether Dan used only one because he was
ashamed of the judge, no one seemed to know.Dan Emmet left a legacy
that will be remembered by the lovers of melody for many years.Paul they got stranded
and many of them found engagements in other organizations.Dan turned
his attention to writing <DW64> melodies.He wrote several popular
airs, one of them being "Dixie," which afterward became the national
air of the Confederate States.When "Dixie" was written Emmet was
connected with Bryant's Minstrels in New York city, and he sent a copy
to his friend in St.Munger, and asked his opinion
as to its merits and whether he thought it advisable to place it
in the hands of a publisher.Munger assured his friend that he
thought it would make a great hit, and he financially assisted Mr.Emmet in placing it before the public.One of the first copies printed
was sent to Mr.Munger, and the first time this celebrated composition
was ever sung in the West was in the music store of Munger Bros, in
the old concert hall building on Third street."Dixie" at once became
very popular, and was soon on the program of every minstrel troupe in
the country.Dan Emmet devoted his whole life to minstrelsy and he
organized the first traveling minstrel troupe in the United States,
starting from some point in Ohio in 1843.The father of the Emmets was a gallant soldier of the War of 1812, and
at one time lived in the old brown frame house at the intersection of
Ramsey and West Seventh streets, recently demolished.A correspondent
of one of the magazines gives the following account of how "Dixie"
happened to become the national air of the Confederate States:

"Early in the war a spectacular performance was being given in New
Orleans.Every part had been filled, and all that was lacking was a
march and war song for the grand chorus.A great many marches and
songs were tried, but none could be decided upon until 'Dixie' was
suggested and tried, and all were so enthusiastic over it that it
was at once adopted and given in the performance.It was taken up
immediately by the populace and was sung in the streets and in homes
and concert halls daily.It was taken to the battlefields, and there
became the great song of the South, and made many battles harder
for the Northerner, many easier for the Southerner.Though it has
particularly endeared itself to the South, the reunion of American
hearts has made it a national song.Lincoln ever regarded it as a
national property by capture."*       *       *       *       *

The Hutchinson family often visited St.Paul, the enterprising town of
Hutchinson, McLeod county, being named after them.They were a very
patriotic family and generally sang their own music.How deliberate
the leader of the tribe would announce the title of the song about to
be produced.Asa Hutchinson would stand up behind the melodeon,
and with a pause between each word inform the audience that
"Sister--Abby--will--now--sing--the--beautiful--song--composed--
by--Lucy--Larcum--entitled--'Hannah--Is--at--the--Window--Binding--
Shoes.'"During the early
part of the war the Hutchinson family was ordered out of the Army of
the Potomac by Gen.McClellan on account of the abolition sentiments
expressed in its songs.The general was apparently unable to interpret
the handwriting on the wall, as long before the war was ended the
entire army was enthusiastically chanting that beautiful melody to the
king of abolitionists--

  "John Brown's body lies moldering in the grave
  And his soul is marching on."McClellan was at one time the idol of the army, as well as of the
entire American people.Before the war he was chief engineer of the
Illinois Central railroad and made frequent trips to St.McClellan, a Miss Marcy, daughter of Maj.Marcy
of the regular army, who lived in the old Henry M. Rice homestead on
Summit avenue.McClellan was in command of the Army of the
Potomac Maj.One of the original Hutchinsons is still living, as indicated by the
following dispatch, published since the above was written:

"Chicago, Ill., Jan.4, 1902.--John W. Hutchinson, the last survivor
of the famous old concert-giving Hutchinson family, which
was especially prominent in anti-bellum times, received many
congratulations to-day on the occasion of his eighty-first birthday,
Mr.Hutchinson enjoys good health and is about to start on a new
singing and speaking crusade through the South, this time against the
sale and us of cigarettes.Hutchinson made a few remarks to the
friends who had called upon him, in the course of which he said: 'I
never spent a more enjoyable birthday than this, except upon the
occasion of my seventy-fifth, which I spent in New York and was
tendered a reception by the American Temperance union, of which I was
the organizer.Of course you will want me to sing to you, and I
think I will sing my favorite song, which I wrote myself.It is "The
Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man."I have written a great
many songs, among them "The Blue and the Gray," "Good old Days of
Yore," and some others that I cannot remember now.I sang the "Blue
and the Gray" in Atlanta six years ago, at the time of the exposition
there, and McKinley was there.I had the pleasure of saying a few
words at that time about woman's suffrage.I wrote the first song
about woman's suffrage and called it "Good Times for Women."This is
the 11,667th concert which I have taken part in.'"The venerable singer is reputed to be quite wealthy.A few years ago
one of the children thought the old man was becoming entirely too
liberal in the distribution of his wealth, and brought an action in
the New York courts requesting the appointment of a guardian to
his estate.The white-haired musician appeared in court without an
attorney, and when the case was about to be disposed of made a request
of the judge, which was granted, that he might be sworn.Hutchinson had made his statement to the court the judge asked a few
questions."I remember the flavor of the milk at the maternal fountain."Hutchinson was fully capable of managing
his own affairs.*       *       *       *       *

Concert hall, built in 1857 by J.W.McClung, had room for 400 or 500
people, but it was somewhat inaccessible on account of its being in
the basement of the building and was not very much in demand.Horatio
Seymour made a great speech to the Douglas wing of the Democracy in
the hall during the campaign of 1880, and Tom Marshall, the great
Kentucky orator, delivered a lecture on Napoleon to a large audience
In the same place.On the night of the presidential election in 1860 a
number of musicians who had been practicing on "Dixie" and other music
in Munger's music store came down to the hall and entertained the
Republicans who had gathered there for the purpose of hearing the
election returns.There was a great deal more singing than there was
election returns, as about all the news they were able to get was from
the four precincts of St.Paul, New Canada, Rose and Reserve townships
and West St.We had a telegraph line, to be sure, but Mr.Winslow, who owned the line, would not permit the newspapers, or any
one else, to obtain the faintest hint of how the election had gone in
other localities.After singing until 11 or 12 o'clock, and abusing
Mr.Winslow in language that the linotype is wholly unable to
reproduce, the crowd dispersed.Nothing could be heard of how the
election had gone until the following afternoon, when Gov.Ramsey
received a dispatch from New York announcing that that state had
given Mr.As that was the pivotal state the
Republicans immediately held a jollification meeting.*       *       *       *       *

Tom Marshall was one of the most eloquent orators America ever
produced.He was spending the summer in Minnesota endeavoring to
recover from the effects of an over-indulgence of Kentucky's great
staple product, but the glorious climate of Minnesota did not seem to
have the desired effect, as he seldom appeared on the street without
presenting the appearance of having discovered in the North Star State
an elixer fully as invigorating as any produced in the land where
colonels, orators and moonshiners comprise the major portion of the
population.One day as Marshall came sauntering down Third street he
met a club of Little Giants marching to a Democratic gathering.They thought they would have a little sport at the expense of the
distinguished orator from Kentucky, and they haulted immediately in
front of him and demanded a speech.Marshall was a
pronounced Whig and supported the candidacy of Bell and Everett, but
as he was from a slave state they did not think he would say anything
reflecting on the character of their cherished leader.Marshall
stepped to the front of the sidewalk and held up his hand and said:
"Do you think Douglas will ever be president?He will not, as no man
of his peculiar physique ever entered the sacred portals of the White
House."He then proceeded to denounce Douglas and the Democratic party
in language that was very edifying to the few Republicans who chanced
to be present.The Little Giants concluded that it was not the proper
caper to select a casual passer-by for speaker, and were afterward
more particular in their choice of an orator.*       *       *       *       *

One night there was a Democratic meeting in the hall and after a
number of speakers had been called upon for an address, De Witt C.
Cooley, who was a great wag, went around in the back part of the hall
and called upon the unterrified to "Holler for Cooley."Cooley's name was soon on the lips of nearly
the whole audience.Cooley mounted the platform an Irishman
in the back part of the hall inquired in a voice loud enough to be
heard by the entire audience, "Is that Cooley?"Upon being assured
that it was, he replied in a still louder voice: "Be jabers, that's
the man that told me to holler for Cooley."The laugh was decidedly on
Cooley, and his attempted flight of oratory did not materialize.Cooley was at one time governor of the third house and if his message
to that body could be reproduced it would make very interesting
reading.*       *       *       *       *

The Athenaeum was constructed in 1859 by the German Reading society,
and for a number of years was the only amusement hall in St.In 1861 Peter and Caroline Richings spent
a part of the summer in St.Paul, and local amusement lovers were
delightfully entertained by these celebrities during their sojourn.During the war a number of dramatic and musical performances were
given at the Athenaeum for the boys in blue.The cantata of "The
Haymakers," for the benefit of the sanitary commission made quite a
hit, and old residents will recollect Mrs.Phil Roher and Otto
Dreher gave dramatic performances both in German and English for some
time after the close of the war.Plunkett's Dramatic company, with
Susan Denin as the star, filled the boards at this hall a short time
before the little old opera house was constructed on Wabasha street.During the Sioux massacre a large number of maimed refugees were
brought to the city and found temporary shelter in this place.*       *       *       *       *

In 1853 Market hall, on the corner of Wabasha and Seventh streets, was
built, and it was one of the principal places of amusement.The Hough
Dramatic company, with Bernard, C.W.Clair and
others were among the notable performers who entertained theatergoers.In 1860 the Wide Awakes used this place for a drill hall, and so
proficient did the members become that many of them were enabled to
take charge of squads, companies and even regiments in the great
struggle that was soon to follow.*       *       *       *       *

In 1860 the Ingersoll block on Bridge Square was constructed, and as
that was near the center of the city the hall on the third floor
was liberally patronized for a number of years.Many distinguished
speakers have entertained large and enthusiastic audiences from the
platform of this popular hall.Edward Everett, Ralph Waldo Emerson and
John B. Gough are among the great orators who have electrified and
instructed the older inhabitants, and the musical notes of the Black
Swan, Mlle.Whiting and Madame Varian will ever be remembered by
those whose pleasure it was to listen to them.Scott Siddons, an
elocutionist of great ability and a descendant of the famous English
family of actors of that name, gave several dramatic readings to her
numerous admirers.Acker used
this hall as a rendezvous and drill hall for Company C, First regiment
of Minnesota volunteers, and many rousing war meetings for the purpose
of devising ways and means for the furtherance of enlistments took
place in this building.In February, 1861, the ladies of the different Protestant churches of
St.Paul, with the aid of the Young Men's Christian association, gave
a social and supper in this building for the purpose of raising funds
for the establishment of a library.It was a sort of dedicatory
opening of the building and hall, and was attended by large
delegations from the different churches.A room was fitted up on the second story and the beginning
of what is now the St.About 350 books were purchased with the funds raised by the social,
and the patrons of the library were required to pay one dollar per
year for permission to read them.Simonton was the first
librarian.Subsequently this library was consolidated with the St.Paul Mercantile Library association and the number of books more than
doubled.A regular librarian was then installed with the privilege of
reading the library's books raised to two dollars per annum.*       *       *       *       *

The People's theater, an old frame building on the corner of Fourth
and St.Peter streets, was the only real theatrical building in
the city.H. Van Liew was the lessee and manager of this place of
entertainment, and he was provided with a very good stock company.Emily Dow and her brother, Harry Gossan and Azelene Allen were among
the members.They were the most
prominent actors who had yet appeared in this part of the country."The Man in the Iron Mask" and "Macbeth" were on their repertoire.Probably "Macbeth" was never played to better advantage or to more
appreciative audiences than it was during the stay of the Wallacks.Wallack's Lady Macbeth was a piece of acting that few of the
present generation can equal.Miles was one of the stars
at this theater, and it was at this place that he first produced the
play of "Mazeppa," which afterward made him famous.Carver,
foreman of the job department of the St.Paul Times, often assisted in
theatrical productions.Carver was not only a first-class printer,
but he was also a very clever actor.His portrayal of the character of
Uncle Tom in "Uncle Tom's Cabin," which had quite a run, and was fully
equal to any later production by full fledged members of the dramatic
profession.Carver was one of the first presidents of the
International Typographical union, and died in Cincinnati many years
ago, leaving a memory that will ever be cherished by all members of
the art preservative.This theater had a  gallery, and the shaded gentry were
required to pay as much for admission to the gallery at the far end of
the building as did the nabobs in the parquet.Joe Rolette, the member
from "Pembina" county, occasionally entertained the audience at this
theater by having epileptic fits, but Joe's friends always promptly
removed him from the building and the performance would go on
undisturbed.*       *       *       *       *

On the second story of an old frame building on the southeast corner
of Third and Exchange streets there was a hall that was at one time
the principal amusement hall of the city.The building was constructed
in 1850 by the Elfelt brothers and the ground floor was occupied by
them as a dry goods store.It is one of the very oldest buildings in
the city.The name of Elfelt brothers until quite recently could be
seen on the Exchange street side of the building.The hall was named
Mazurka hall, and all of the swell entertainments of the early '50s
took place in this old building.At a ball given in the hall during
one of the winter months more than forty years ago, J.Q.A.Ward,
bookkeeper for the Minnesotian, met a Miss Pratt, who was a daughter
of one of the proprietors of the same paper, and after an acquaintance
of about twenty minutes mysteriously disappeared from the hall and got
married.They intended to keep it a secret for a while, but it was
known all over the town the next day and produced great commotion.Miss Pratt's parents would not permit her to see her husband, and they
were finally divorced without having lived together.For a number of years Napoleon Heitz kept a saloon and restaurant in
this building.Heitz had participated in a number of battles under
the great Napoleon, and the patrons of his place well recollect the
graphic descriptions of the battle of Waterloo which he would often
relate while the guest was partaking of a Tom and Jerry or an oyster
stew.*       *       *       *       *

During the summer of 1860 Charles N. Mackubin erected two large
buildings on the site of the Metropolitan hotel.Mozart hall was on
the Third street end and Masonic hall on the Fourth street corner.At
a sanitary fair held during the winter of 1864 both of these halls
were thrown together and an entertainment on a large scale was
held for the benefit of the almost depleted fundes of the sanitary
commission.Fairs had been given for this fund in nearly all the
principal cities of the North, and it was customary to vote a sword
to the most popular volunteer officer whom the state had sent to the
front.A large amount of money had been raised in the different cities
on this plan, and the name of Col.Marshall of the Seventh regiment
and Col.Uline of the Second were selected as two officers in whom it
was thought the people would take sufficient interest to bring out a
large vote.The friends of both candidates were numerous and each side
had some one stationed at the voting booth keeping tab on the number
of votes cast and the probable number it would require at the close
to carry off the prize.Uline had been a fireman and was very
popular with the young men of the city.Marshall was backed by
friends in the different newspaper offices.The contest was very
spirited and resulted in Col.Uline capturing the sword, he having
received more than two thousand votes in one bundle during the last
five minutes the polls were open.This fair was very successful,
the patriotic citizens of St.Paul having enriched the funds of the
sanitary commission by several thousand dollars.*       *       *       *       *

One of the first free concert halls in the city was located on Bridge
Square, and it bore the agonizing name of Agony hall.Whether it
was named for its agonizing music or the agonizing effects of its
beverages was a question that its patrons were not able to determine.*       *       *       *       *

In anti-bellum times Washington's birthday was celebrated with more
pomp and glory than any holiday during the year.The Pioneer Guards,
the City Guards, the St.Paul fire
department and numerous secret organizations would form in
procession and march to the capitol, and in the hall of the house of
representatives elaborate exercises commemorative of the birth of the
nation's first great hero would take place.Business was generally
suspended and none of the daily papers would be issued on the
following day.In 1857 Adalina Patti appeared in St.She was
about sixteen years old and was with the Ole Bull Concert company.They traveled on a small steamboat and gave concerts in the river
towns.Their concert took place in the hall of the house of
representatives of the old capitol, that being the only available
place at the time.Patti's concert came near being nipped in the bud
by an incident that has never been printed.Two boys employed as
messengers at the capitol, both of whom are now prominent business
men in the city, procured a key to the house, and, in company with a
number of other kids, proceeded to representative hall, where they
were frequently in the habit of congregating for the purpose of
playing cards, smoking cigars, and committing such other depradations
as it was possible for kids to conceive.After an hour or so of
revelry the boys returned the key to its proper place and separated.In a few minutes smoke was seen issuing from the windows of the hall
and an alarm of fire was sounded.The door leading to the house was
forced open and it was discovered that the fire had nearly burned
through the floor.The boys knew at once that it was their
carelessness that had caused the alarm, and two more frightened kids
never got together.They could see visions of policemen, prison bars,
and even Stillwater, day and night for many years.They would often
get together on a back street and in whispered tones wonder if they
had yet been suspected.For more than a quarter of a century these two
kids kept this secret in the innermost recesses of their hearts,
and it is only recently that they dared to reveal their terrible
predicament.*       *       *       *       *

A few days after Maj.Anderson was compelled to lower the Stars and
Stripes on Sumter's walls a mass meeting of citizens, irrespective of
party, was called to meet at the hall of the house of representatives
for the purpose of expressing the indignation of the community at the
dastardly attempt of the Cotton States to disrupt the government.Long before the time for the commencement of the meeting the hall was
packed and it was found necessary to adjourn to the front steps of
the building in order that all who desired might take part in the
proceedings.John S. Prince, mayor of the city, presided,
assisted by half a dozen prominent citizens as vice presidents.John M. Gilman, an honored resident of the city, was one of the
principal speakers.Gilman had been the Democratic candidate for
congress the fall previous, and considerable interest was manifested
to hear what position he would take regarding the impending conflict.Gilman was in hearty sympathy with
the object of the meeting and his remarks were received with great
demonstrations of approbation.Gilman
and made a strong speech in favor of sustaining Mr.There
were a number of other addresses, after which resolutions were adopted
pledging the government the earnest support of the citizens, calling
on the young men to enroll their names on the roster of the rapidly
forming companies and declaring that they would furnish financial aid
when necessary to the dependant families of those left behind.Similar
meetings were held in different parts of the city a great many times
before the Rebellion was subdued.*       *       *       *       *

The first Republican state convention after the state was admitted
into the Union was held in the hall of the house of representatives.The state was not divided into congressional districts at that time
and Col.Aldrich and William Windom were named as the candidates for
representatives in congress.Aldrich did not pretend to be much
of an orator, and in his speech of acceptance he stated that while
he was not endowed with as much oratorical ability as some of his
associates on the ticket, yet he could work as hard as any one, and
he promised that he would sweat at least a barrel in his efforts to
promote the success of the ticket.*       *       *       *       *

Aromory hall, on Third street, between Cedar and Minnesota, was built
in 1859, and was used by the Pioneer Guards up to the breaking out of
the war.The annual ball of the Pioneer Guards was the swell affair of
the social whirl, and it was anticipated with as much interest by
the Four Hundred as the charity ball is to-day.The Pioneer Guards
disbanded shortly after the war broke out, and many of its members
were officers in the Union army, although two or three of them stole
away and joined the Confederate forces, one of them serving on Lee's
staff during the entire war.Tuttle were early in the fray, while a number of others
followed as the war progressed.*       *       *       *       *

It was not until the winter of 1866-67 that St.Paul could boast of a
genuine opera house.The old opera house fronting on Wabasha street,
on the ground that is now occupied by the Grand block, was finished
that winter and opened with a grand entertainment given by local
talent.The boxes and a number of seats in the parquet were sold at
auction, the highest bidder being a man by the name of Philbrick, who
paid $72 for a seat in the parquet.This man Philbrick was a visitor
in St.Paul, and had a retinue of seven or eight people with him.It
was whispered around that he was some kind of a royal personage, and
when he paid $72 for a seat at the opening of the opera house people
were sure that he was at least a duke.He disappeared as mysteriously
as he had appeared.It was learned afterward that this mysterious
person was Coal Oil Johnny out on a lark.The first regular company to
occupy this theater was the Macfarland Dramatic company, with Emily
Melville as the chief attraction.This little theater could seat about
1,000 people, and its seating capacity was taxed many a time long
before the Grand opera house in the rear was constructed.Wendell
Philips, Henry Ward Beecher, Theodore Tilton, Frederick Douglass and
many others have addressed large audiences from the stage of this old
opera house.An amusing incident occurred while Frederick Douglass was
in St.Nearly every seat in the house had been sold long before
the lecture was to commence, and when Mr.Douglass commenced speaking
there was standing room only.A couple of enthusiastic Republicans
found standing room in one of the small upper boxes, and directly in
front of them was a well-known Democratic politician by the name of
W.H.Shelley had at one time been quite prominent in
local Republican circles, but when Andrew Johnson made his famous
swing around the circle Shelley got an idea that the proper thing to
do was to swing around with him.Consequently the Republicans who
stood up behind Mr.Shelley thought they would have a little amusement
at his expense.Douglass made a point worthy
of applause these ungenerous Republicans would make a great
demonstration, and as the audience could not see them and could
only see the huge outline of Mr.Shelley they concluded that he was
thoroughly enjoying the lecture and had probably come back to the
Republican fold.Shelley stood it until the lecture was about
half over, when he left the opera house in disgust.Shelley was a
candidate for the position of collector of customs of the port of St.Paul and his name had been sent to the senate by President Johnson,
but as that body was largely Republican his nomination lacked
confirmation.*       *       *       *       *

About the time of the great Heenan and Sayers prize fight in England
a number of local sports arranged to have a mock engagement at the
Athenaeum.There was no kneitoscopic method of reproducing a fight at
that time, but it was planned to imitate the great fight as closely as
possible.James J. Hill was to imitate Sayers and Theodore Borup the
Benecia boy.They were provided with seconds, surgeons and all
the attendants necessary for properly staging the melee.It was
prearranged that Theodore, in the sixth or seventh round, was to knock
Hill out, but as the battle progressed, Theodore made a false pass and
Hill could not desist from taking advantage of it, and the prearranged
plan was reversed by Hill knocking Theodore out.And Hill has kept
right on taking advantage of the false movements of his adversaries,
and is now knocking them out with more adroitness than he did forty
years ago.PRINTERS AND EDITORS OF TERRITORIAL DAYS.SHELLEY THE PIONEER PRINTER OF MINNESOTA--A LARGE NUMBER OF

  Thos.Of the above long list of territorial printers the following are the
only known survivors: H.O.Bassford, George W. Benedict, David Brock,
John C. Devereux, Barrett Smith, J.B.H.Mitchell, David Ramaley, M.R.Prendergast, Jacob T. McCoy, A.S.Much has been written of the trials and tribulations of the pioneer
editors of Minnesota and what they have accomplished in bringing to
the attention of the outside world the numerous advantages possessed
by this state as a place of permanent location for all classes of
people, but seldom, if ever, has the nomadic printer, "the man behind
the gun," received even partial recognition from the chroniclers of
our early history.In the spring of 1849 James M. Goodhue arrived in
St.Paul from Lancaster, Wis., with a Washington hand press and a few
fonts of type, and he prepared to start a paper at the capital of the
new territory of Minnesota.Accompanying him were two young printers,
named Ditmarth and Dempsey, they being the first printers to set foot
on the site of what was soon destined to be the metropolis of the
great Northwest.These two young men quickly tired of their isolation
and returned to their former home.They were soon followed by another
young man, who had only recently returned from the sunny plains
of far-off Mexico, where he had been heroically battling for his
country's honor.Shelly was born in Bucks county, Pa.,
on the 25th of September, 1827.When a mere lad he removed to
Philadelphia, where he was instructed in the art preservative, and, on
the breaking out of the Mexican war, he laid aside the stick and rule
and placed his name on the roster of a company that was forming to
take part in the campaign against the Mexicans.He was assigned to
the Third United States dragoons and started at once for the scene of
hostilities.On arriving at New Orleans the Third dragoons was ordered
to report to Gen.Taylor, who was then in the vicinity of Matamoras.Taylor was in readiness he drove the Mexicans across
the Rio Grande, and the battles of Palo Alto, Monterey and Buena Vista
followed in quick succession, in all of which the American forces
were successful against an overwhelming force of Mexicans, the Third
dragoons being in all the engagements, and they received special
mention for their conspicuous gallantry in defending their position
against the terrible onslaught of the Mexican forces under the
leadership of Santa Ana.Soon after the battle of Buena Vista, Santa
Ana withdrew from Gen.Taylor's front and retreated toward the City
of Mexico, in order to assist in the defense of that city against the
American forces under the command of Gen.Peace was declared in
1848 and the Third dragoons were ordered to Jefferson barracks, St.Louis, where they were mustered out of the service.Shelly took
passage in a steamer for St.Paul, where he arrived in July, 1849,
being the first printer to permanently locate in Minnesota.The
Pioneer was the first paper printed in St.Paul, but the Register and
Chronicle soon followed.Shelly's first engagement was in the
office of the Register, but he soon changed to the Pioneer, and was
employed by Mr.Goodhue at the time of his tragic death.Shelly was connected
with that office, and remained there until the Pioneer and Democrat
consolidated.Shelly was a member of the old Pioneer guards, and
when President Lincoln called for men to suppress the rebellion the
old patriotism was aroused in him, and he organized, in company with
Major Brackett, a company for what was afterward known as Brackett's
battalion.Brackett's battalion consisted of three Minnesota companies, and they
were mustered into service in September, 1861.They were ordered to
report at Benton barracks, Mo., and were assigned to a regiment known
as Curtis horse, but afterward changed to Fifth Iowa cavalry.In
February, 1862, the regiment was ordered to Fort Henry, Tenn., and
arrived just in time to take an important part in the attack and
surrender of Fort Donelson.Brackett's battalion was the only
Minnesota force engaged at Fort Donelson, and, although they were
not in the thickest of the fight, yet they performed tremendous and
exhaustive service in preventing the rebel Gen.Buckner from receiving
reinforcements.After the surrender the regiment was kept on continual
scout duty, as the country was overrun with bands of guerrillas and
the inhabitants nearly all sympathized with them.From Fort Donelson
three companies of the regiment went to Savannah, (one of them being
Capt.Shelly's) where preparations were being made to meet Gen.Beauregard, who was only a short distance away.Brackett's company was
sent out in the direction of Louisville with orders to see that the
roads and bridges were not molested, so that the forces under Gen.Buell would not be obstructed on the march to reinforce Gen.Buell to arrive at Pittsburg
Landing just in time to save Gen.Shelly's company was engaged in
protecting the long line of railroad from Columbus, Ky., to Corinth,
Miss.On the 25th of August, 1862, Fort Donalson was attacked by the
rebels and this regiment was ordered to its relief.This attack of the
rebels did not prove to be very serious, but on the 5th of February,
1863, the rebels under Forrest and Wheeler made a third attack on Fort
Donelson.They were forced to retire, leaving a large number of their
dead on the field, but fortunately none of the men under Capt.Nearly the entire spring and summer of 1863 was spent in
scouring the country in the vicinity of the Tennessee river, sometimes
on guard duty, sometimes on the picket line and often in battle.They
were frequently days and nights without food or sleep, but ever kept
themselves in readiness for an attack from the wily foes.Opposed to
them were the commands of Forest and Wheeler, the very best cavalry
officers in the Confederate service.A number of severe actions ended
in the battle of Chickamauga, in which the First cavalry took a
prominent part.After the battle of Chickamauga the regiment was kept
on duty on the dividing line between the two forces.About the 1st
of January, 1864, most of Capt.Shelly's company reinlisted and they
returned home on a thirty days' furlough.After receiving a number
of recruits at Fort Snelling, the command, on the 14th of May, 1864,
received orders to report to Gen.Sully at Sioux City, who was
preparing to make a final campaign against the rebellious Sioux.On
the 28th of June the expedition started on its long and weary march
over the plains of the Dakotas toward Montana.It encountered the
Indians a number of times, routing them, and continued on its way.About the middle of August the expedition entered the Bad Lands, and
the members were the first white men to traverse that unexplored
region.In the fall the battalion returned to Fort Ridgley, where
they went into winter quarters, having marched over 3,000 miles since
leaving Fort Snelling.Shelly was mustered out of the service in
the spring of 1865, and since that time, until within a few years, has
been engaged at his old profession.Shelly was almost painfully modest, seldom alluding to the many
stirring events with which he had been an active participant, and it
could well be said of him, as Cardinal Wolsey said of himself, that
"had he served his God with half the zeal he has served his country,
he would not in his old age have forsaken him."Political preferment
and self-assurance keep some men constantly before the public eye,
while others, the men of real merit, who have spent the best part of
their lives in the service of their country, are often permitted by an
ungrateful community to go down to their graves unhonored and unsung.*       *       *       *       *

OTHER PRINTERS IN THE CIVIL WAR.Henry C. Coates was foreman of the job department of the Pioneer
office.He was an officer in the Pioneer Guards, and when the war
broke out was made a lieutenant in the First regiment, was in all the
battles of that famous organization up to and including Gettysburg;
was commander of the regiment for some time after the battle.After
the war he settled in Philadelphia, where he now resides.Jacob J. Noah at one time set type, with Robert Bonner.He was elected
clerk of the supreme court at the first election of state officers;
was captain of Company K Second Minnesota regiment, but resigned early
in the war and moved to New York City, his former home.Frank H. Pratt was an officer in the Seventh regiment and served
through the war.He published a paper at Taylor's Falls at one time.After the war he was engaged in the mercantile business in St.John C. Devereux was foreman of the old Pioneer and was an officer in
the Third regiment, and still resides in the city.Jacob T. McCoy was an old-time typo and worked in all the St.Paul
offices before and after the rebellion.McCoy was a fine singer
and his voice was always heard at typographical gatherings.He
enlisted as private in the Second Minnesota and served more than four
years, returning as first lieutenant.He now resides in Meadeville,
Pa.Martin Williams was printer, editor, reporter and publisher, both
before and after the war.He was quartermaster of the Second Minnesota
cavalry.Robert P. Slaughter and his brother, Thomas Slaughter, were both
officers in the volunteer service and just previous to the rebellion
were engaged in the real estate business.Edward Richards was foreman of the Pioneer and Minnesotian before the
war and foreman of the old St.He enlisted
during the darkest days of the rebellion in the Eighth regiment and
served in the dual capacity of correspondent and soldier.No better
soldier ever left the state.He was collector of customs of the port
of St.Paul under the administration of Presidents Garfield and
Arthur, and later was on the editorial staff of the Pioneer Press.The most remarkable compositor ever in the Northwest, if not in the
United States, was the late Charles R. Stuart.He claimed to be a
lineal descendant of the royal house of Stuart.For two years in
succession he won the silver cup in New York city for setting more
type than any of his competitors.At an endurance test in New York he
is reported to have set and distributed 26,000 ems solid brevier in
twenty-four hours.In the spring of
1858 he wandered into the Minnesotian office and applied for work.The
Minnesotian was city printer and was very much in need of some one
that day to help them out.Stuart was put to work and soon
distributed two cases of type, and the other comps wondered what he
was going to do with it.After he had been at work a short time
they discovered that he would be able to set up all the type he had
distributed and probably more, too.When he pasted up the next morning
the foreman measured his string and remeasured it, and then went over
and took a survey of Mr.Stuart, and then went back and measured it
again.He then called up the comps, and they looked it over, but no
one could discover anything wrong with it.The string measured 23,000
ems, and was the most remarkable feat of composition ever heard of in
this section of the country.Stuart to set 2,000 ems of solid bourgeois an hour, and keep it up for
the entire day.Stuart's reputation as a rapid compositor spread
all over the city in a short time and people used to come to the
office to see him set type, with as much curiosity as they do now to
see the typesetting machine.Stuart enlisted in the Eighth
regiment and served for three years, returning home a lieutenant.For
a number of years he published a paper at Sault Ste Marie, in which
place he died about five years ago.He was not only a good printer,
but a very forceful writer, in fact he was an expert in everything
connected with the printing business.Lightbourn was one of the old-time printers.He served three
years in the Seventh Minnesota and after the war was foreman of the
Pioneer.Clum is one of the oldest printers in St.He was born in
Rensselar county, New York, in 1832, and came to St.He learned his trade in Troy, and worked with John M. Francis, late
minister to Greece, and also with C.L.McArthur, editor of the
Northern Budget.Clum was a member of Company D, Second Minnesota,
and took part in several battles in the early part of the rebellion.Chancy came to Minnesota before the state was admitted to the
Union.At one time he was foreman of a daily paper at St.During the war he was a member of Berdan's sharpshooters, who
were attached to the First regiment.S J. Albright worked on the Pioneer in territorial days.In 1859 he
went to Yankton, Dak., and started the first paper in that territory.He was an officer in a Michigan regiment during the rebellion.For
many years was a publisher of a paper in Michigan, and under the last
administration of Grover Cleveland was governor of Alaska.Prendergast, though not connected with the printing business
for some time, yet he is an old time printer, and was in the Tenth
Minnesota during the rebellion.Underwood was a member of Berdan's Sharp-shooters, and was
connected with a paper at Fergus Falls for a number of years.Robert V. Hesselgrave was employed in nearly all the St.He was lieutenant in the First Minnesota Heavy
Artillery, and is now engaged in farming in the Minnesota valley.He was a
member of the Seventh Minnesota.Ole Johnson was a member of the First Minnesota regiment, and died in
a hospital in Virginia.William F. Russel, a compositor on the Pioneer, organized a company of
sharpshooters in St.Paul, and they served throughout the war in the
army of the Potomac.S. Teverbaugh and H.I.Vance were territorial printers, and were both
in the army, but served in regiments outside the state.There were a large number of other printers in the military service
during the civil war, but they were not territorial printers and their
names are not included in the above list.TERRITORIAL PRINTERS IN CIVIL LIFE.One of the brightest of the many bright young men who came to
Minnesota at an early day was Mr.For a time he worked on
the case at the old Pioneer office, but was soon transferred to the
editorial department, where he remained for a number of years.After
the war he returned to Pittsburgh, his former home, and is now and for
a number of years has been editor-in-chief of the Pittsburgh Post.Paul who were musically inclined
no one was better known than the late O.G.He belonged to the
Great Western band, and was tenor singer in several churches in the
city for a number of years.Miller was a 33d Degree Mason, and
when he died a midnight funeral service was held for him in Masonic
hall, the first instance on record of a similar service in the city.Paul in 1850, and for a short time was
foreman for Mr.In 1852 he formed a partnership with John P.
Owens in the publication of the Minnesotian.He sold his interest
in that paper to Dr.Foster in 1860, and in 1861 was appointed by
President Lincoln collector of the port of St.Paul, a position he
held for more than twenty years.Louis E. Fisher was one of God's noblemen.Paul he was foreman of the Commercial Advertiser.For a long time he
was one of the editors of the Pioneer, and also the Pioneer Press.He
was a staunch democrat and a firm believer in Jeffersonian simplicity.At one time he was a candidate for governor on the democratic ticket.Had it not been for a little political chicanery he would have been
nominated, and had he been elected would have made a model governor.George W. Armstrong was the Beau Brummel of the early printers.He
wore kid gloves when he made up the forms of the old Pioneer, and he
always appeared as if he devoted more attention to his toilet than
most of his co-laborers.He was elected state treasurer on the
democratic ticket in 1857, and at the expiration of his term of office
devoted his attention to the real estate business.Another old printer that was somewhat fastidious was James M.
Culver.Old members of the Sons of Malta will recollect
how strenuously he resisted the canine portion of the ceremony when
taking the third degree of that noble order.He is one of the best as well as
one of the best known printers in the Northwest.He has been printer,
reporter, editor, publisher and type founder.Although he has been
constantly in the harness for nearly fifty years, he is still active
and energetic and looks as if it might be an easy matter to round out
the century mark.Bassford, now of the Austin Register, was one of the fleetest and
cleanest compositers among the territorial printers.He was employed
on the Minnesotian.Francis P. McNamee occupied most all positions connected with the
printing business--printer, reporter, editor.He was a most estimable
man, but of very delicate constitution, and he has long since gone to
his reward.The genial, jovial face of George W. Benedict was for many years
familiar to most old-time residents.At one time he was foreman of the
old St.He is now editor and publisher of the Sauk Rapids
Sentinel.Paul Times had no more reliable man than the late Richard
Bradley.He was foreman of the job department of that paper, and held
the same position on the Press and Pioneer Press for many years.Paine was the author of the famous poem entitled "Who Stole Ben
Johnson's Spaces."The late John O. Terry was the first hand pressman in St.Owens in the publication of the
Minnesotian.For a long time he was assistant postmaster of St.Paul,
and held several other positions of trust.Mitchell was a, member of the firm of Newson, Mitchell & Clum,
publishers of the Daily Times.For several years after the war he was
engaged as compositor in the St.Paul offices, and is now farming in
Northern Minnesota.Among the freaks connected with the printing business was a poet
printer by the name of Wentworth.He was called "Long Haired
Wentworth."Early in the war he enlisted in the First Minnesota regiment.Gorman caught sight of him he ordered his hair cut.Wentworth
would not permit his flowing locks to be taken off, and he was
summarly dismissed from the service.After being ordered out of the
regiment he wrote several letters of doubtful loyalty and Secretary
Stanton had him arrested and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette with other
political prisoners.Marshall Robinson was a partner of the late John H. Stevens in the
publication of the first paper at Glencoe.At one time he was a
compositor on the Pioneer, and the last heard from him he was state
printer for Nevada.Robertson and made foreman of the Democrat.He was a
printer-politician and possessed considerable ability.At one time he
was one of the editors of the Democrat.He was said to bear a striking
resemblance to the late Stephen A. Douglas, and seldom conversed with
any one without informing them of the fact.He was one of the original
Jacksonian Democrats, and always carried with him a silver dollar,
which he claimed was given him by Andrew Jackson when he was
christened.No matter how much Democratic principle Jack would consume
on one of his electioneering tours he always clung to the silver
dollar.He died in Ohio more than forty years ago, and it is said that
the immediate occasion of his demise was an overdose of hilarity.Another old timer entitled to a good position in the hilarity column
was J.Q.A.He was business manager
of the Minnesotian during the prosperous days of that paper.The first
immigration pamphlet ever gotten out in the territory was the product
of Jack's ingenuity.Jack created quite a sensation at one time by
marrying the daughter of his employer on half an hour's ball room
acquaintance.He was a very bright man and should have been one of the
foremost business men of the city, but, like many other men, he was
his own worst enemy.Another Jack that should not be overlooked was Jack
