"Don't give way so, darling," said the mother, as her other hand stroked
the brown hair.We have prayed, and we
now feel that he will do what is best.""It will come in time--when long years have taught you his goodness."She slowly wiped her eyes, and stole a glance at Mr.His
earlier half-desperate restlessness had passed away, and he sat quietly
in his chair gazing into the fire, occasionally wiping a tear from his
eyes, and again looking upward with an expression of sublime submission.Soon, as if conscious of her wondering observation, he said, "Come to me,
Amy."She stood beside him, and he drew her close as he continued:

"My child, one of the hardest lessons we can learn in this world is to
say, 'Not my will, but Thine be done.'I have lived fourscore years, and
yet I could not say it at first; but now" (with a calm glance heavenward)
"I can say, 'My Father, thy will be done.'If he takes Burt, he has given
us you;" and he kissed her so tenderly that she bowed her head upon his
shoulder, and said, brokenly:

"You are my father in very truth."There was a Presence in the room that
filled her with awe, and yet banished her former overwhelming dread and
grief.They watched and waited; there was no sound in the room except the soft
crackle of the fire, and Amy thought deeply on the noble example before
her of calm, trustful waiting.At last she became conscious that the
house was growing strangely still; the faint tick of the great clock on
the landing of the stairs struck her ear; the rush and roar of the wind
had ceased.Bewildered, she rose softly and went to Maggie's room, and
found that the tired mother in watching over her children had fallen
asleep in her chair.She lifted a curtain, and could scarcely believe her
eyes when she saw that the trees that had been writhing and moaning in
the gale now stood white and spectral as the lamp-light fell upon them.It seemed as if the calm that had fallen upon
her spirit had extended to nature; that the storm had hushed its rude
clamor even while it continued.From the window she watched the white
flakes flutter through the light she knew not how long: the old clock
chimed out midnight, and then, faint and far away, she thought she heard
the sleigh-bells.With swift, silent tread, she rushed to a side door and
threw it open.Yes, clear and distinct she now heard them on the mountain
road.With a low cry she returned and wakened Maggie, then flew to the
old people, and, with a voice that she tried in vain to steady, said,
"They are coming."Clifford started up, and was about to rush from the room, but paused
a moment irresolutely, then returned, sat down by his wife, and put his
arm around her.The invalid had grown
faint and white, but his touch and presence were the cordials she needed.Amy fled back to the side door, and the sled soon appeared.There was no
light at this entrance, and she was unobserved.She saw them begin to
lift some one out, and she dashed through an intervening drift nearly to
her waist.Webb felt a hand close on his arm with a grip that he long
remembered.she cried, in a tone of agonizing inquiry."Heigh-ho, Amy," said the much-muffled figure that they were taking from
the sled; "I'm all right."In strong reaction, the girl would have fallen, had not Webb supported
her.He felt that she trembled and clung almost helplessly to him."Why, Amy," he said, gently, "you will take your death out here in the
cold and snow"; and leaving the others to care for Burt, he lifted her in
his arms and carried her in."Thank God, he's safe," she murmured.There,
I'm better now," she said, hastily, and with a swift color coming into
her pale cheeks, as they reached the door."You must not expose yourself so again, sister Amy.""I thought--I thought when you began to lift Burt out--" But she could
not finish the sentence.Perhaps there is no joy like that which fills loving hearts when the lost
is found.It is so pure and exalted that it is one of the ecstasies of
heaven.It would be hard to describe how the old house waked up with its
sudden accession of life--life that was so warm and vivid against the
background of the shadow of death.There were murmured thanksgivings as
feet hurried to and fro, and an opening fire of questions, which Maggie
checked by saying:

"Possess your souls in patience.Burt's safe--that's enough to know until
he is cared for, and my half-famished husband and the rest get their
supper.Pretty soon we can all sit down, for I want a chance to hear
too.""And no one has a better right, Maggie," said her husband, chafing his
hands over the fire."After what we've seen to-night, this place is the
very abode of comfort, and you its presiding genius;" and Leonard beamed
and thawed until the air grew tropical around him.Clifford's request (for it was felt that it was not best to cross
the invalid), Burt, in the rocking-chair wherein he had been placed, was
carried to her room, and received a greeting from his parents that
brought tears to the young fellow's eyes.Marvin soon did all within
his power at that stage for the sprained ankle and frost-bitten fingers,
the mother advising, and feeling that she was still caring for her boy as
she had done a dozen years before.Then Burt was carried back to the
dining-room, where all were soon gathered.The table groaned under
Maggie's bountiful provision, and lamp-light and fire-light revealed a
group upon which fell the richer light of a great joy.Burt was ravenously hungry, but the doctor put him on limited diet,
remarking, "You can soon make up for lost time."He and Leonard, however,
made such havoc that Amy pretended to be aghast; but she soon noted that
Webb ate sparingly, that his face was not only scratched and torn, but
almost haggard, and that he was unusually quiet.When all were helped, and Maggie had a chance to sit down, she
said:

"Now tell us about it.We just heard enough when you first arrived to
curdle our blood.How in the world, Burt, did you allow yourself to get
caught in such a storm?""If it had not been for this confounded sprain I should have come out all
right;" and then followed the details with which the reader is acquainted,
although little could be got out of Webb."The upshot of it all is," said Leonard, as he beamed upon the party with
ineffable content, "between mother's praying and Webb's looking, Burt is
here, not much the worse for his eagle hunt."They would not hear of the doctor's departure, and very soon afterward
old Mr.Clifford gathered them around the family altar in a thanksgiving
prayer that moistened every eye.Then all prepared for the rest so sorely needed.As Webb went to the hall
to hang up his gun, Amy saw that he staggered in his almost mortal
weariness, and she followed him."There are your colors, Amy," he said, laughingly, taking her scarf from
an inner pocket."I wore it till an envious scrub-oak tore it off.It was
of very great help to me--the scarf, not the oak.""Webb," she said, earnestly, "you can't disguise the truth from me by any
such light words.I've been watching
you ever since your return.You are ill--you have gone beyond your
strength, and in addition to it all I let you carry me in."It's wonderfully nice to have a little sister to worry about a fellow.""But can't I do something for you?You've thought about everybody, and no
one thinks for you.""_You_ have, and so have the rest, as far as there was occasion.Let me
tell you how wan and weary you look.Oh, Amy, our home is so much more to
us since you came!""What would our home be to us to-night, Webb, were it not for you!And I
said you took Burt's danger too coolly.How I have reproached myself for
those words.you did not resent them; and you saved
Burt;" and she impulsively put her arm around his neck and kissed him,
then fled to her room.The philosophical Webb might have had much to think about that night had
he been in an analytical mood, for by some magic his sense of utter
weariness was marvellously relieved.With a low laugh, he thought,

"I'd be tempted to cross the mountains again for such a reward."CHAPTER XIV

HINTS OF SPRING


When Amy awoke on the following morning she was almost dazzled, so
brilliant was the light that flooded the room.Long, quiet sleep and the
elasticity of youth had banished all depression from mind and body, and
she sprang eagerly to the window that she might see the effects of the
storm, expecting to witness its ravages on every side.Imagine her wonder
and delight when, instead of widespread wreck and ruin, a scene of
indescribable beauty met her eyes!The snow had draped all things in
white.The trees that had seemed so gaunt and skeleton-like as they
writhed and moaned in the gale were now clothed with a beauty surpassing
that of their summer foliage, for every branch, even to the smallest
twig, had been incased in the downy flakes.The evergreens looked like
old-time gallants well powdered for a festival.The shrubbery of the
garden was scarcely more than mounds of snow.The fences had almost
disappeared; while away as far as the eye could reach all was sparkling
whiteness.Nature was like a bride adorned for her nuptials.Under the
earlier influences of the gale the snow had drifted here and there,
making the undulations of her robe, and under the cloudless sun every
crystal glittered, as if over all had been flung a profusion of diamond
dust.Nor did she seem a cold, pallid bride without heart or gladness.Her breath was warm and sweet, and full of an indefinable suggestion of
spring.She seemed to stand radiant in maidenly purity and loveliness,
watching in almost breathless expectation the rising of the sun above the
eastern mountains.A happy group gathered at the breakfast-table that morning.Best of mind
and thankfulness of heart had conduced to refreshing repose, and the
brightness of the new day was reflected in every face.Burt's ankle was
painful, but this was a slight matter in contrast with what might have
been his fate.He had insisted on being dressed and brought to the lounge
in the breakfast-room.John went back to the garden.Webb seemed wonderfully restored, and Amy thought
he looked almost handsome in his unwonted animation, in spite of the
honorable scars that marked his face.Marvin exclaimed, exultingly:

"Miss Amy, you can begin the study of ornithology at once.There are
bluebirds all about the house, and you have no idea what exquisite bits
of color they are against the snow on this bright morning.After
breakfast you must go out and greet these first arrivals from the South.""Yes, Amy," put in Leonard, laughing, "it's a lovely morning for a
stroll.The snow is only two feet deep, and drifted in many places higher
than your head.The 'beautiful snow' brings us plenty of prose in the
form of back-aching work with our shovels.""No matter," said Webb; "it has also brought us warmth, exquisitely pure
air, and a splendid covering for grass and grain that will be apt to last
well into the spring.Anything rather than mud and the alternate freezing
and thawing that are as provoking as a capricious friend.""Why, Webb, what a burst of sentiment!""Doctor, the bluebirds seem to come like the south wind that Leonard says
is blowing this morning," Mrs.and how have they reached us after such a storm?""I imagine that those we hear this morning have been with us all winter,
or they may have arrived before the storm.I scarcely remember a winter
when I have not seen some around, and their instinct guides them where to
find shelter.When the weather is very cold they are comparatively
silent, but even a January thaw will make them tuneful.They are also
migrants, and have been coming northward for a week or two past, and this
accounts for the numbers this morning.they must have
had a hard time of it last night, wherever they were.""Oh, I do wish I could make them know how glad I'd be to take them in and
keep them warm every cold night!""They have a better mother than even you could be," said the doctor,
nodding at the little girl."Indeed they have, and all the other birds also, and this mother takes
care of them the year round--Mother Nature, that's her name.Your heart
may be big enough, but your house would not begin to hold all the
bluebirds, so Mother Nature tells the greater part of them to go where
it's warm about the 1st of December, and she finds them winter homes all
the way from Virginia to Florida.Then toward spring she whispers when it
is safe to come back, and if you want to see how she can take care of
those that are here even during such a storm as that of last night,
bundle up and come out on the sunny back piazza."There all the household soon after assembled, the men armed with shovels
to aid in the path-making in which Abram was already engaged.Burt was
placed in a rocking-chair by a window that he might enjoy the prospect
also.A charming winter outlook it was, brilliant with light and gemmed
with innumerable crystals.To Amy's delight, she heard for the first time
the soft, down-like notes of the bluebird.At first they seemed like mere
"wandering voices in the air," sweet, plaintive, and delicate as the
wind-swayed anemone.Then came a soft rustle of wings, and a bird darted
downward, probably from the eaves, but seemingly it was a bit of the sky
that had taken form and substance.He flew past her and dislodged a
miniature avalanche from the spray on which he alighted.The little
creature sat still a moment, then lifted and stretched one wing by an odd
coquettish movement while it uttered its low musical warble."Why," exclaimed Amy, "he is almost the counterpart of our robin-redbreast
of England!"Marvin, "he resembles your English redbreast closely
both in appearance and habits, and our New England forefathers called him
the 'blue robin.'To my taste the bluebird is the superior of the two,
for what he lacks in stronger and more varied song he makes up in softer,
sweeter notes.You have no blue birds of any
kind in England, Amy.It seems to require our deeper-tinted skies to
produce them.You can tell her by the lighter
blue of her plumage, and the tinge of brown on her head and back.She is
a cold, coy beauty, even as a wife; but how gallant is her azure-coated
beau!Flirt away, my little chap, and make the most of your courting and
honeymoon.You will soon have family cares enough to discourage anybody
but a bluebird;" and the doctor looked at his favorites with an exulting
affection that caused a general laugh."I shall give our little friends something better than compliments," said
Mr.Clifford, obeying his hospitable instincts, and he waded through the
snow to the sunny side of an evergreen, and there cleared a space until
the ground was bare.Then he scattered over this little plot an abundance
of bread-crumbs and hay seed, and they all soon had the pleasure of
seeing half a dozen little bobbing heads at breakfast.Johnnie and Alf,
who on account of the deep snow did not go to school, were unwearied in
watching the lovely little pensioners on their grandfather's bounty--not
pensioners either, for, as the old man said, "They pay their way with
notes that I am always glad to accept."The work of path-making and shovelling snow from the doors and roofs of
the out-buildings went on vigorously all the morning.Abram also attached
the farm horses to the heavy snow-plow, to which he added his weight, and
a broad, track-like furrow was made from the house to the road, and then
for a mile or more each way upon the street, for the benefit of the
neighbors.Before the day was very far advanced, the south wind, which
had been a scarcely perceptible breath, freshened, and between the busy
shovels and the swaying branches the air was full of glittering crystals.The bride-like world was throwing off her ornaments and preparing for the
prose of every-day life; and yet she did so in a cheerful, lightsome
mood.The sunny eaves dropped a profusion of gems from the melting snow.There was a tinkle of water in the pipes leading to the cistern.From the
cackle in the barn-yard it appeared that the hens had resolved on
unwonted industry, and were receiving applause from the oft-crowing
chanticleers.The horses, led out to drink, were in exuberant spirits,
and appeared to find a child's delight in kicking up the snow.The cows
came briskly from their stalls to the space cleared for them, and were
soon ruminating in placid content.What though the snow covered the
ground deeper than at any time during the winter, the subtile spirit of
spring was recognized and welcomed not only by man, but also by the lower
creation!After putting Burt in a fair way of recovery, Dr.Marvin, armed with a
shovel to burrow his way through the heavier drifts, drove homeward.Alf
floundered off to his traps, and returned exultant with two rabbits.Amy
was soon busy sketching them previous to their transformation into a
pot-pie, Burt looking on with a deeper interest in the artist than in her
art, although he had already learned that she had not a little skill with
her pencil.Indeed, Burt promised to become quite reconciled to his part of
invalid, in spite of protestations to the contrary; and his inclination to
think that Amy's companionship would be an antidote for every ill of life
was increasing rapidly, in accordance with his hasty temperament, which
arrived at conclusions long before others had begun to consider the steps
leading to them.Amy was still more a child than a woman; but a girl must be young indeed
who does not recognize an admirer, especially so transparent a one as
Burt would ever be.His ardent glances and compliments both amused and
annoyed her.From his brothers she had obtained several hints of his
previous and diversified gallantries, and was not at all assured that
those in the future might not be equally varied.She did not doubt the
sincerity of his homage, however; and since she had found it so easy to
love him as a brother, it did not seem impossible that she should learn
to regard him in another light, if all thought it best, and he "would
only be sensible and understand that she did not wish to think about such
things for years to come."Thus it may be seen that in one respect her
heart was not much more advanced than that of little Johnnie.She
expected to be married some time or other, and supposed it might as well
be to Burt as to another, if their friends so desired it; but she was for
putting off submission to woman's natural lot as long as possible.Possessing much tact, she was able in a great measure to repress the
young fellow's demonstrativeness, and maintain their brotherly and
sisterly relations; but it cost her effort, and sometimes she left his
society flurried and wearied.With Webb she enjoyed perfect rest and a
pleasing content.He was so quiet and strong that his very presence
seemed to soothe her jarring nerves.He appeared to understand her, to
have the power to make much that interested her more interesting, while
upon her little feminine mysteries of needle and fancy work he looked
with an admiring helplessness, as if she were more unapproachable in her
sphere than he could ever be in his, with all his scientific facts and
theories.Women like this tribute to their womanly ways from the sterner
sex.Maggie's wifehood was made happy by it, for by a hundred little
things she knew that the great, stalwart Leonard would be lost without
her.Moreover, by his rescue of Burt, Webb had won a higher place in
Amy's esteem.He had shown the prompt energy and courage which satisfy
woman's ideal of manhood, and assure her of protection.Amy did not
analyze her feelings or consciously assure herself of all this.She only
felt that Webb was restful, and would give her a sense of safety, no
matter what happened.CHAPTER XV

NATURE'S BUILDING MATERIALS


Some days after Burt's adventure, Dr.Marvin made his professional call
in the evening.Alvord, Squire Bartley, and the minister also
happened in, and all were soon chatting around Mr.Clifford's ruddy
hearth.The pastor of this country parish was a sensible man, who, if he
did not electrify his flock of a Sunday morning, honestly tried to guide
it along safe paths, and led those whom he asked to follow.His power lay
chiefly in the homes of his people, where his genial presence was ever
welcomed.He did not regard those to whom he ministered as so many souls
and subjects of theological dogma, but as flesh-and-blood men, women, and
children, with complex interests and relations; and the heartiness of his
laugh over a joke, often his own, and the havoc that he made in the
dishes of nuts and apples, proved that he had plenty of good healthful
blood himself.Although his hair was touched with frost, and he had never
received any degree except his simple A.M., although the prospect of a
metropolitan pulpit had grown remote indeed, he seemed the picture of
content as he pared his apple and joined in the neighborly talk.Squire Bartley had a growing sense of shortcoming in his farming
operations.Notwithstanding his many acres, he felt himself growing
"land-poor," as country people phrase it.He was not a reader, and looked
with undisguised suspicion on book-farming.As for the agricultural
journals, he said "they were full of new-fangled notions, and were kept
up by people who liked to see their names in print."Nevertheless, he was
compelled to admit that the Cliffords, who kept abreast of the age,
obtained better crops, and made their business pay far better than he
did, and he was inclined to turn his neighborly calls into thrifty use by
questioning Leonard and Webb concerning their methods and management.Therefore he remarked to Leonard: "Do you find that you can keep your
land in good condition by rotation of crops?Folks say this will do it,
but I find some of our upland is getting mighty thin, and crops uncertain.""What is your idea of rotation, squire?""Why, not growin' the same crop too often on the same ground."For the majority of soils the following
rotation has been found most beneficial: corn and potatoes, which
thoroughly subdue the sod the first year; root crops, as far as we grow
them, and oats the second; then wheat or rye, seeded at the same time
with clover or grass of some kind.We always try to plow our sod land in
the fall, for in the intervening time before planting the sod partially
decays, the land is sweetened and pulverized by the action of frost, and
a good many injurious insects are killed also.But all rules need
modification, and we try to study the nature of our various soils, and
treat them accordingly".have a chemist prescribe for 'em like a doctor?"Walters, the rich city chap who bought Roger's worn-out
farm, tried that to his heart's content, and mine too.He had a little of
the dirt of each part of his farm analyzed, you know, and then he sent to
New York for his phosphates, his potashes, his muriates, and his
compound-super-universal panacea vegetates, and with all these bad-smelling
mixtures--his barn was like a big agricultural drug-store--he was going to
put into his skinned land just the elements lacking.In short, he gave his
soil a big dose of powders, and we all know the result.If he had given his
farm a pinch of snuff better crops ought to have been sneezed.No chemicals
and land doctors for me, thank you.no reflections on
your calling, but doctorin' land don't seem profitable for those who pay
for the medicine."They all laughed except Webb, who seemed nettled, but who quietly said,
"Squire, will you please tell us what your house is made of?""Well, when passing one day, I saw a fine stalk of corn in one of your
fields.Will you also tell us what that was made of?It must have
weighed, with the ears upon it, several pounds, and it was all of six
feet high."Why, it grew," said the squire, sententiously."That utterance was worthy of Solomon," remarked Dr."It grew," continued Webb, "because it found the needed material at hand.I do not see how Nature can build a well-eared stalk of corn without
proper material any more than you could have built your house without
lumber.Suppose we have a soil in which the elements that make a crop of
corn do not exist, or are present in a very deficient degree, what course
is left for us but to supply what is lacking?Walters did not
do this in the right way, is no reason why we should do nothing.If soil
does not contain the ingredients of a crop, we must put them there, or
our labor goes for nothing"."Well, of course there's no gettin' around that; but yard manure is all I
want.It's like a square meal to a man, and not a bit of powder on his
tongue.""No one wants anything better than barn-yard manure for most purposes,
for it contains nearly all the elements needed by growing plants, and its
mechanical action is most beneficial to the soil.But how many acres will
you be able to cover with this fertilizer this spring?""That's just the rub," the squire answered."We use all we have, and when
I can pick it up cheap I buy some; but one can't cover a whole farm with
it, and so in spite of you some fields get all run out.""I don't think there's any need of their running out," said Leonard,
emphatically."I agree with Webb in one thing, if I can't follow him in
all of his scientific theories--we have both decided never to let a
field grow poor, any more than we would permit a horse or cow to so lose
in flesh as to be nearly useless; therefore we not only buy fertilizers
liberally, but use all the skill and care within our power to increase
them.Barn-yard manure can be doubled in bulk and almost doubled in value
by composting with the right materials.We make the most of our peat
swamps, fallen leaves, and rubbish in general.Enough goes to waste on
many farms every year to keep several acres in good heart.But, as you
say, we cannot begin to procure enough to go over all the land from which
we are taking crops of some kind; therefore we maintain a rotation which
is adapted to our various soils, and every now and then plow under a
heavy green crop of clover, buckwheat, or rye.A green crop plowed under
is my great stand-by.""I plowed under a crop of buckwheat once," said the squire, discontentedly,
"and I didn't see much good from it, except that the ground was light and
mellow afterward.""That, at least, was a gain," Leonard continued; "but I can tell you why
your ground was not much benefited, and perhaps injured.You scarcely
plowed under a green crop, for I remember that the grain in your
buckwheat straw was partly ripe.It is the forming seed or grain that
takes the substance out of land.You should have plowed the buckwheat
under just as it was coming into blossom.Up to that time the chief
growth had been derived from the air, and there had been very little
drain upon the soil."exclaimed the squire, incredulously, "I didn't know the air was
so nourishing."Webb had been showing increasing signs of disquietude during the last few
moments, and now said, with some emphasis: "It seems to me, squire, that
there is not much hope of our farming successfully unless we do know
something of the materials that make our crops, and the conditions under
which they grow.When you built your house you did not employ a man who
had only a vague idea of how it was to be constructed, and what it was to
be built of.Before your house was finished you had used lumber as your
chief material, but you also employed brick, stone, lime, sand, nails,
etc.If we examine a house, we find all these materials.If we wish to
build another house, we know we must use them in their proper proportions.Now it is just as much a matter of fact, and is just as capable of proof,
that a plant of any kind is built up on a regular plan, and from
well-defined materials, as that a house is so built.The materials in
various houses differ just as the elements in different kinds of plants
vary.A man can decide what he will build of; Nature has decided forever
what she will build of.She will construct a stalk of corn or wheat with
its grain out of essentially the same materials to the end of time.Now
suppose one or more of these necessary ingredients is limited in the soil,
or has been taken from it by a succession of crops, what rational hope can
we have for a good crop unless we place the absent material in the ground,
and also put it there in a form suitable for the use of the plant?""What you say sounds plausible enough," answered the squire, scratching
his head with the worried, perplexed air of a man convinced against his
will."How was it, then, that Walters made such a mess of it?He had his
soil analyzed by a land doctor, and boasted that he was going to put into
it just what was lacking.His soil may not be lacking now, but his crops
are.""It is possible that there are quacks among land doctors, as you call
them, as well as among doctors of medicine", remarked Dr."Or doctors of theology," added the minister."I looked into the Walters experiment somewhat carefully," Webb resumed,
"and the causes of his failure were apparent to any one who has given a
little study to the nature of soils and plant food.The ground is sour and cold from stagnant water beneath
the surface, and the plant food which Nature originally placed in it is
inert and in no condition to be used.Nearly all of his uplands have been
depleted of organic or vegetable matter.He did not put into the soil all
that the plants needed, and the fact that his crops were poor proves it.The materials he used may have been adulterated, or not in a form which
the plants could, assimilate at the time.Give Nature a soil in the right
mechanical condition--that is, light, mellow, moist, but not wet, and
containing the essential elements of a crop--and she will produce it
unless the season is so adverse that it cannot grow.I do not see how one
can hope to be successful unless he studies Nature's methods and learns
her needs, adapting his labor to the former, and supplying the latter.For instance, nitrogen in the form of ammonia is so essential to our
crops that without it they could never come to maturity were all the
other elements of plant food present in excess.Suppose that for several
successive years we grow wheat upon a field with an average crop of
twenty-five bushels to the acre.This amount of grain with its straw will
take from the soil about fifty-one pounds of ammonia annually, and when
the nitrogen (which is the main element of ammonia) gives out, the wheat
will fail, although other plant food may be present in abundance.This is
one reason why dairy farms from which all the milk is sold often grow
poor.Milk is exceedingly rich in nitrogen, and through the milk the farm
is depleted of this essential element faster than it is replaced by
fertilizers.A man may thus be virtually selling his farm, or that which
gives it value, without knowing it."asked the squire, with a look of helpless
perplexity."How is one to know when his land needs nitrogen or ammonia
and all the other kinds of plant food, as you call it, and how must he go
to work to get and apply it?""You are asking large questions, squire," Webb replied, with a quiet
smile."In the course of a year you decide a number of legal questions,
and I suppose read books, consult authorities, and use considerable
judgment.It certainly never would do for people to settle these
questions at hap-hazard or according to their own individual notions.Whatever the courts may do, Nature is
certain to reverse our decisions and bring to naught our action unless we
comply with her laws and requirements."The squire's experience coincided so truly with Webb's words that he
urged no further objections against accurate agricultural knowledge, even
though the information must be obtained in part at least from books and
journals.CHAPTER XVI

GOSSIP ABOUT BIRD-NEIGHBORS


"Doctor," said Mrs.Leonard, "Amy and I have been indulging in some
surmises over a remark you made the other day about the bluebirds.You
said the female was a cold, coy beauty, and that her mate would soon be
overburdened with family cares.Indeed, I think you rather reflected on
our sex as represented by Mrs.The female bluebird is singularly devoid of
sentiment, and takes life in the most serious and matter-of-fact way.Her
nest and her young are all in all to her.John Burroughs, who is a very
close observer, says she shows no affection for the male and no pleasure
in his society, and if he is killed she goes in quest of another mate in
the most business-like manner, as one would go to a shop on an errand."cried Maggie, with a glance at Leonard which
plainly said that such was not her style at all."Nevertheless," continued the doctor, "she awakens a love in her husband
which is blind to every defect.He is gallantry itself, and at the same
time the happiest and most hilarious of lovers.Since she insists on
building her nest herself, and having everything to her own mind, he does
not shrug his blue shoulders and stand indifferently or sullenly aloof.He goes with her everywhere, flying a little in advance as if for
protection, inspects her work with flattering minuteness, applauds and
compliments continually.Indeed, he is the ideal French beau very much in
love.""In other words, the counterpart of Leonard," said Burt, at which they
all laughed."But you spoke of his family cares," Webb remarked: "he contributes
something more than compliments, does he not?"He settles down into the most devoted of husbands and
fathers.The female usually hatches three broods, and as the season
advances he has his hands, or his beak rather, very full of business.I
think Burroughs is mistaken in saying that he is in most cases the
ornamental member of the firm.He feeds his wife as she sits on the nest,
and often the first brood is not out of the way before he has another to
provide for.Therefore he is seen bringing food to his wife and two sets
of children, and occasionally taking her place on the nest.Nor does he
ever get over his delusion that his mate is delighted with his song and
little gallantries, for he kepps them up also to the last.So he has to
be up early and late, and altogether must be a very tired little bird
when he gets a chance to put his head under his wing."and to think that she doesn't care for him!"sighed
Amy, pityingly; and they all laughed so heartily that she bent her head
over her work to hide the rich color that stole into her face--all
laughed except Mr.Alvord, who, as usual, was an attentive and quiet
listener, sitting a little in the background, so that his face was in
partial shadow.Keen-eyed Maggie, whose sympathies were deeply enlisted
in behalf of her sad and taciturn neighbor, observed that he regarded Amy
with a close, wistful scrutiny, as if he were reading her thoughts.Then
an expression of anguish, of something like despair, flitted across his
face."He has lavished the best treasures of his heart and life on some
one who did not care," was her mental comment."You won't be like our little friend in blue, eh, Amy?"Clifford; but with girlish shyness she would not reply to any such
question."Don't take it so to heart, Miss Amy.B. is never disenchanted," the
doctor remarked.B. at all," said Maggie, decidedly; "and it seems to
me that I know women of whom she is a type--women whose whole souls are
engrossed with their material life.Human husbands are not so blind as
bluebirds, and they want something more than housekeepers and nurses in
their wives."Barkdale; "you improve the occasion better
than I could.But, doctor, how about our callous widow bluebird finding
another mate after the mating season is over?""There are always some bachelors around, unsuccessful wooers whose early
blandishments were vain.""And are there no respectable spinsters with whom they might take up as a
last resort?"Think of that, ye maiden of New England, where the
males are nearly all migrants and do not return!The only chance for a
bird-bachelor is to console some widow whom accident has bereaved of her
mate.Widowers also are ready for an immediate second marriage.Birds and
beasts of prey and boys--hey, Alf--bring about a good many step-parents.""Alf don't kill any little birds, do you, Alf?"You said they felt so bad over it But if they get over
it so easy as the doctor says--"

"Now, doctor, you see the result of your scientific teaching."Leonard, are you in sympathy with the priestcraft that would
keep people virtuous through ignorance?""Alf must learn to do right, knowing all the facts.I don't believe he
will shy a stone at a bird this coming year unless it is in mischief.""Well," said Squire Bartley, who had relapsed into a half-doze as the
conversation lost its practical bent, "between the birds and boys I don't
see as we shall be able to raise any fruit before long.If our boys
hadn't killed about all the robins round our house last summer, I don't
think we'd 'a had a cherry or strawberry.""I'm afraid, squire," put in Webb, quietly, "that if all followed your
boys' example, insects would soon have the better of us.They are far
worse than the birds.I've seen it stated on good authority that a
fledgling robin eats forty per cent more than its own weight every
twenty-four hours, and I suppose it would be almost impossible to compute
the number of noxious worms and moths destroyed by a family of robins in
one season."Webb is right, squire," added the doctor, emphatically."Were it not for
the birds, the country would soon be as bare as the locusts left Egypt.Even the crow, against which you are so vindictive, is one of your best
friends.""Oh, now, come, I can't swallow that.Crows pull up my corn, rob hens'
nests', carry off young chickens.They even rob the nests of the other
birds you're so fond of.Why, some state legislatures give a bounty for
their destruction.""If there had only been a bounty for killing off the legislators, the
states would have fared better," replied the doctor, with some heat."It
can be proved beyond a doubt that the crow is unsurpassed by any other
bird in usefulness.He is one of the best friends you have.""Deliver me from my friends, then," said the squire, rising; and he
departed, with his prejudices against modern ideas and methods somewhat
confirmed.Like multitudes of his class, he observed in nature only that which was
forced upon his attention through the medium of immediate profit and
loss.The crows pulled up his corn, and carried off an occasional
chicken; the robins ate a little fruit; therefore death to crows and
robins.They all felt a certain sense of relief at his departure, for
while their sympathies touched his on the lower plane of mere utility and
money value, it would be bondage to them to be kept from other and higher
considerations.Moreover, in his own material sphere his narrow prejudices
were ever a jarring element that often exasperated Webb, who had been known
to mutter, "Such clods of earth bring discredit on our calling."Burt, with a mischievous purpose illuminating his face, remarked: "I'll
try to put the squire into a dilemma.If I can catch one of his boys
shooting robins out of season, I will lodge a complaint with him, and
insist on the fine;" and his design was laughingly applauded.Clifford, "that Webb has won me over to a toleration
of crows, but until late years I regarded them as unmitigated pests.""Undeserved enmity comes about in this way," Webb replied."We see a crow
in mischief occasionally, and the fact is laid up against him.If we
sought to know what he was about when not in mischief, our views would
soon change.It would be far better to have a little corn pulled up than
to be unable to raise corn at all.Crows can be kept from the field
during the brief periods when they do harm, but myriads of grasshoppers
cannot be managed.Moreover, the crow destroys very many field-mice and
other rodents, but chief of all he is the worst enemy of the May-beetle
and its larvae.In regions of the country where the crow has been almost
exterminated by poison and other means, this insect has left the meadows
brown and sear, while grasshoppers have partially destroyed the most
valuable crops.Why can't farmers get out of their plodding, ox-like
ways, and learn to co-work with Nature like men?""Who would have thought that the squire
and a crow could evoke such a peroration?That flower of eloquence surely
grew from a rank, dark soil.""Squire Bartley amuses me very much," said Mrs.Clifford, from the sofa,
with a low laugh."He seems the only one who has the power to ruffle
Webb.""Little wonder," thought Amy, "for it would be hard to find two natures
more antagonistic.""It seems to me that this has been a very silent winter," the minister
remarked."In my walks and drives of late I have scarcely heard the chirp
of a bird.Are there many that stay with us through this season, doctor?"But you would not be apt to meet many of
them unless you sought for them.At this time they are gathered in
sheltered localities abounding in their favorite food.Shall I tell you
about some that I have observed throughout several successive winters?"Having received eager encouragement, he resumed: "My favorites, the
bluebirds, we have considered quite at length.They are very useful, for
their food in summer consists chiefly of the smaller beetles and the
larvae of little butterflies and moths.It
is a question of food, not climate, with them.In certain valleys of the
White Mountains there is an abundance of berries, and flocks of robins
feed on them all winter, although the cold reaches the freezing-point of
mercury.As we have said, they are among the most useful of the insect
destroyers.The golden-crested kinglet is a little mite of a bird, not
four inches long, with a central patch of orange-red on his crown.He
breeds in the far North, and wintering here is for him like going to the
South.In summer he is a flycatcher, but here he searches the bark of
forest trees with microscopic scrutiny for the larvae of insects.We all
know the lively black-capped chickadees that fly around in flocks
throughout the winter.Sometimes their search for food leads them into
the heart of towns and cities, where they are as bold and as much at home
as the English sparrow.They also gather around the camps of log-cutters
in the forest, become very tame, and plaintively cry for their share in
the meals.They remain all the year, nesting in decayed logs, posts,
stumps, and even in sides of houses, although they prefer the edge of a
wood.If they can find a hole to suit them, very well; if they can't,
they will make one.A nest
in a decayed stump was uncovered, and the mother bird twice taken off by
hand, and each time she returned and covered her brood.She uttered no
cries or complaints, but devotedly interposed her little form between
what must have seemed terrific monsters and her young, and looked at the
human ogres with the resolute eyes of self-sacrifice.If she could have
known it, the monsters only wished to satisfy their curiosity, and were
admiring her beyond measure.Chickadees are exceedingly useful birds, and
make great havoc among the insects."Our next bird is merely a winter sojourner, for he goes north in spring
like the kinglet.The scientists, with a fine sense of the fitness of
things, have given him a name in harmony, _Troglodytes parvulus_, var."He is about as big as your thumb, and ordinary mortals are content to
call him the winter wren.He is a saucy little atom of a bird, with his
tail pointing rakishly toward his head.I regret exceedingly to add that
he is but a winter resident with us, and we rarely hear his song.Burroughs says that he is a'marvellous songster,' his notes having a
'sweet rhythmical cadence that holds you entranced.'By the way, if you
wish to fall in love with birds, you should read the books of John
Burroughs.A little mite of a creature, like the hermit-thrush, he fills
the wild, remote woods of the North with melody, and has not been known
to breed further south than Lake Mohunk.The brown creeper and the
yellow-rumped warbler I will merely mention.Both migrate to the North in
the spring, and the latter is only an occasional winter resident.The
former is a queer little creature that alights at the base of a tree and
creeps spirally round and round to its very top, when it sweeps down to
the base of another tree to repeat the process.Purple finches are usually abundant in winter, though, not very
numerous in summer.I value them because they are handsome birds, and
both male and female sing in autumn and winter, when bird music is at a
premium.I won't speak of the Carolina wax-wing, _alias_ cedar or cherry
bird, now.Next June, when strawberries and cherries are ripe, we can
form his intimate acquaintance.""We have already made it, to the cost of both our patience and purse,"
said Webb."He is one of the birds for whom I have no mercy.""That is because you are not sufficiently acquainted with him.I admit
that he is an arrant thief of fruit, and that, as his advocate, I have a
difficult case.I shall not plead for him until summer, when he is in
such imminent danger of capital punishment He's a little beauty, though,
with his jaunty crest and gold-tipped tail.I shall not say one word in
favor of the next bird that I mention, the great Northern shrike, or
butcher-bird.He is not an honest bird of prey that all the smaller
feathered tribes know at a glance, like the hawk; he is a disguised
assassin, and possessed by the very demon of cruelty.He is a handsome
fellow, little over ten inches long, with a short, powerful beak, the
upper mandible sharply curved.His body is of a bluish-gray color, with
'markings of white' on his dusky wings and tail.Three shrikes once made
such havoc among the sparrows of Boston Common that it became necessary
to take much pains to destroy them.He is not only a murderer, but an
exceedingly treacherous one, for both Mr.Nuttall speak
of his efforts to decoy little birds within his reach by imitating their
notes, and he does this so closely that he is called a mocking-bird in
some parts of New England.When he utters his usual note and reveals
himself, his voice very properly resembles the 'discordant creaking of a
sign-board hinge.'A flock of snow-birds or finches may be sporting and
feeding in some low shrubbery, for instance.They may hear a bird
approaching, imitating their own notes.A moment later the shrike will be
seen among them, causing no alarm, for his appearance is in his favor.Suddenly he will pounce upon an unsuspecting neighbor, and with one blow
of his beak take off the top of its head, dining on its brains.If there
is a chance to kill several more, he will, like a butcher, hang his prey
on a thorn, or in the crotch of a tree, and return for his favorite
morsel when his hunt is over.After devouring the head of a bird he will
leave the body, unless game is scarce.It is well they are not plentiful,
or else our canary pets would be in danger, for a shrike will dart
through an open window and attack birds in cages, even when members of
the family are present.Brewer, the ornithologist,
was sitting by a closed window with a canary in a cage above his head,
and a shrike, ignorant of the intervening glass, dashed against the
window, and fell stunned upon the snow.He was taken in, and found to be
tame, but sullen.He refused raw meat, but tore and devoured little birds
very readily.As I said before, it is fortunate he is rare, though why he
is so I scarcely know.He may have enemies in the North, where he breeds;
for I am glad to say that he is only a winter resident."It gives one a genuine sense of relief to turn from this Apache, this
treacherous scalper of birds, to those genuinely useful little songsters,
the tree and the song sparrow.The former is essentially a Northern bird,
and breeds in the high arctic regions.He has a fine song, which we hear
in early April as his parting souvenir.The song sparrow will be a great
favorite with you, Miss Amy, for he is one of our finest singers, whose
song resembles the opening notes of a canary, but has more sweetness and
expression.Those that remain with us depart for the North at the first
tokens of spring, and are replaced by myriads of other migrants that
usually arrive early in March.They are very useful in destroying the worst kinds of insects.A fit
associate for the song sparrow is the American goldfinch, or yellow-bird,
which is as destructive of the seeds of weeds as the former is of the
smaller insect pests.In summer it is of a bright gamboge yellow, with
black crown, wings, and tail.At this time he is a little olive-brown
bird, and mingles with his fellows in small flocks.They are sometimes
killed and sold as reed-birds."The snow-bird and snow-bunting are not identical by any means; indeed,
each is of a different genus.The bunting's true home is in the far
North, and it is not apt to be abundant here except in severe weather.Specimens have been found, however, early in November, but more often
they appear with a late December snowstorm, their wild notes suggesting
the arctic wastes from which they have recently drifted southward.The
sleigh tracks on the frozen Hudson are among their favorite haunts, and
they are not often abundant in the woods on this side of the river.Flocks can usually be found spending the winter along the railroad on the
eastern shore.Here they become very fat, and so begrimed with the dirt
and grease on the track that you would never associate them with the
snowy North.They ever make, however, a singular and pretty spectacle
when flying up between one and the late afternoon sun, for the predominant
white in their wings and tail seems almost transparent.They breed at the
extreme North, even along the Arctic Sea, in Greenland and Iceland, and are
fond of marine localities at all times.It's hard to realize that the
little fellows with whom we are now so familiar start within a month for
regions above the Arctic Circle.I once, when a boy, fired into a flock
feeding in a sleigh track on the ice of the river.Some of those that
escaped soon returned to their dead and wounded companions, and in their
solicitude would let me come very near, nor, unless driven away, would they
leave the injured ones until life was extinct.On another occasion I
brought some wounded ones home, and they ate as if starved, and soon became
very tame, alighting upon the table at mealtimes with a freedom from
ceremony which made it necessary to shut them up.They spent most of their
time among the house plants by the window, but toward spring the migratory
instinct asserted itself, and they became very restless, pecking at the
panes in their eagerness to get away.Soon afterward our little guests may
have been sporting on an arctic beach.An effort was once made in
Massachusetts to keep a wounded snow-bunting through the summer, but at
last it died from the heat.They are usually on the wing northward early in
March."The ordinary snow-bird is a very unpretentious and familiar little
friend.You can find him almost any day from the 1st of October to the
1st of May, and may know him by his grayish or ashy black head, back, and
wings, white body underneath from the middle of his breast backward, and
white external tail-feathers.He is said to be abundant all over America
east of the Black Hills, and breeds as far south as the mountains of
Virginia.There are plenty of them in summer along the Shawangunk range,
just west of us, in the Catskills, and so northward above the Arctic
Circle.In the spring, before it leaves us, you will often hear its
pretty little song.They are very much afraid of hawks, which make havoc
among them at all times, but are fearless of their human--and especially
of their humane--neighbors.Severe weather will often bring them to our
very doors, and drive them into the outskirts of large cities.They are
not only harmless, but very useful, for they devour innumerable seeds,
and small insects with their larvae."And we could listen to you," chorused several voices."I never before realized that we had such interesting winter neighbors
and visitors," said Mrs.Clifford, and the lustre of her eyes and the
faint bloom on her cheeks proved how deeply these little children of
nature had enlisted her sympathies."They are interesting, even when in one short evening I can give but in
bald, brief outline a few of their characteristics.Your words suggest
the true way of becoming acquainted with them.Regard them as neighbors
and guests, in the main very useful friends, and then you will naturally
wish to know more about them.In most instances they are quite susceptible
to kindness, and are ready to be intimate with us.That handsome bird, the
blue jay, so wild at the East, is as tame and domestic as the robin in many
parts of the West, because treated well.He is also a winter resident, and
one of the most intelligent birds in existence.Indeed, he is a genuine
humorist, and many amusing stories are told of his pranks.His powers of
mimicry are but slightly surpassed by those of the mocking-bird, and it is
his delight to send the smaller feathered tribes to covert by imitating the
cries of the sparrow, hawk, and other birds of prey.When so tame as to
haunt the neighborhood of dwellings, he is unwearied in playing his tricks
on domestic fowls, and they--silly creatures!--never learn to detect the
practical joke, for, no matter how often it is repeated, they hasten
panic-stricken to shelter.Wilson speaks of him as the trumpeter of the
feathered chorus, but his range of notes is very great, passing from harsh,
grating sounds, like the screeching of an unlubricated axle, to a warbling
as soft and modulated as that of a bluebird, and again, prompted by his
mercurial nature, screaming like a derisive fish-wife.Fledglings will
develop contentedly in a cage, and become tame and amusing pets.They will
learn to imitate the human voice and almost every other familiar sound.A
gentleman in South Carolina had one that was as loquacious as a parrot, and
could utter distinctly several words.In this region they are hunted, and
too shy for familiar acquaintance.When a boy, I have been tantalized
almost beyond endurance by them, and they seemed to know and delight in the
fact.I was wild to get a shot at them, but they would keep just out of
range, mocking me with discordant cries, and alarming all the other game in
the vicinity.They often had more sport than I. It is a pity that the small
boy with his gun cannot be taught to let them alone.If they were as
domestic and plentiful as robins, they would render us immense service.A
colony of jays would soon destroy all the tent-caterpillars on your place,
and many other pests.In Indiana they will build in the shrubbery around
dwellings, but we usually hear their cries from mountain-sides and distant
groves.Pleasant memories of rambles and nutting excursions they always
awaken.The blue jay belongs to the crow family, and has all the brains of
his black-coated and more sedate cousins.At the North, he will, like a
squirrel, lay up for winter a hoard of acorns and beech mast.An
experienced bird-fancier asserts that he found the jay'more ingenious,
cunning, and teachable than any other species of birds that he had ever
attempted to instruct.'"One of our most beautiful and interesting winter visitants is the pine
grosbeak.Although very abundant in some seasons, even extending its
migrations to the latitude of Philadelphia, it is irregular, and only the
coldest weather prompts its excursions southward.The general color of
the males is a light carmine, or rose, and if only plentiful they would
make a beautiful feature in our snowy landscape.As a general thing, the
red tints are brighter in the American than in the European birds.The
females, however, are much more modest in their plumage, being ash-
above, with a trace of carmine behind their heads and upon their upper tail
coverts, and sometimes tinged with greenish-yellow beneath.The females are
by far our more abundant visitants, for in the winter of '75 I saw numerous
flocks, and not over two per cent were males in red plumage.Still, strange
to say, I saw a large flock of adult males the preceding November, feeding
on the seeds of a Norway spruce before our house.Oh, what a brilliant
assemblage they made among the dark branches!In their usual haunts they
live a very retired life.The deepest recesses of the pine forests at the
far North are their favorite haunts, and here the majority generally remain
throughout the year.In these remote wilds is bred the fearlessness of man
which is the result of ignorance, for they are among the tamest of all wild
birds, finding, in this respect, their counterpart in the American red
cross-bill, another occasional cold-weather visitant.For several winters
the grosbeaks were exceedingly abundant in the vicinity of Boston, and were
so tame that they could be captured in butterfly nets, and knocked down
with poles.The markets became full of them, and many were caged.While
tame they were very unhappy in confinement, and as spring advanced their
mournful cries over their captivity became incessant.They can be kept as
pets, however, and will often sing in the night.Audubon observed that
when he fired at one of their number, the others, instead of flying away,
would approach within a few feet, and gaze at him with undisguised
curiosity, unmingled with fear.I have seen some large flocks this winter,
and a few fed daily on a bare plot of ground at the end of our piazza.I
was standing above this plot one day, when a magnificent red male flew just
beneath my feet and drank at a little pool.I never saw anything more
lovely in my life than the varying sheen of his brilliant tropical-like
plumage.He was like a many-hued animated flower, and was so fearless that
I could have touched him with a cane.One very severe, stormy winter the
grosbeaks fairly crowded the streets of Pictou.A gentleman took one of
these half-starved birds into his room, where it lived at large, and soon
became the tamest and most affectionate of pets.But in the spring, when
its mates were migrating north, Nature asserted herself, and it lost its
familiarity, and filled the house with its piteous wailings, refused food,
and sought constantly to escape.When the grosbeaks are with us you would
not be apt to notice them unless you stumbled directly upon them, for they
are the most silent of birds, which is remarkable, since the great majority
of them are females"."That is just the reason why they are so still," remarked Mrs."Ladies never speak unless they have something to say.""Far be it from me to contradict you.The lady grosbeaks certainly have
very little to say to one another, though when mating in their secluded
haunts they probably express their preferences decidedly.If they have an
ear for music, they must enjoy their wooing immensely, for there is
scarcely a lovelier song than that of the male grosbeak.I never heard it
but once, and may never again; but the thrill of delight that I experienced
that intensely cold March day can never be forgotten.I was following the
course of a stream that flowed at the bottom of a deep ravine, when, most
unexpectedly, I heard a new song, which proceeded from far up the glen.The
notes were loud, rich, and sweet, and I hastened on to identify the new
vocalist.I soon discovered a superb red pine grosbeak perched on the top
of a tall hemlock.His rose- plumage and mellow notes on that bleak
day caused me to regret exceedingly that he was only an uncertain and
transient visitor to our region."We have a large family of resident hawks in this vicinity; indeed, there
are nine varieties of this species of bird with us at this time, although
some of them are rarely seen.The marsh-hawk has a bluish or brown
plumage, and in either case is distinguished by a patch of white on its
upper tail coverts.You would not be apt to meet with it except in its
favorite haunts.I found a nest in the centre of Consook Marsh, below
West Point.The nests of this hawk are usually made
of hay, lined with pine needles, and sometimes at the North with
feathers.This bird is found nearly everywhere in North America, and
breeds as high as Hudson Bay.In the marshes on the Delaware it is often
called the mouse-hawk, for it sweeps swiftly along the low ground in
search of a species of mouse common in that locality.It is said to be
very useful in the Southern rice-fields, since, as it sails low, it
interrupts the flocks of bobolinks, or rice-birds, in their depredations.Planters say that one marsh-hawk accomplishes more than several <DW64>s
in alarming these greedy little gourmands.In this region they do us no
practical harm."Our most abundant hawk is the broad-winged, which will measure about
thirty-six inches with wings extended.The plumage of this bird is so
dusky as to impart a prevalent brownish color, and the species is
distributed generally over eastern North America.Unlike the marsh-hawk,
it builds in trees, and Mr.Audubon describes a nest as similar to that
of the crow--a resemblance easily accounted for by the frequency with
which this hawk will repair crows' nests of former years for its own use.I once shot one upon such a nest, from which I had taken crows' eggs the
preceding summer.I had only wounded the bird, and he clawed me severely
before I was able to capture him.I once took a fledgling from a nest,
and he became very fond of me, and quite gentle, but he would not let any
one else handle him.On another occasion, when I was examining a nest,
the male bird flew to a branch just over it, uttering loud, squealing
cries, thence darted swiftly past me, and so close that I could feel the
rush of air made by his wings; then he perched near again, and threatened
me in every way he could, extending his wings, inclining his head and
body toward me, making meanwhile a queer whistling sound.Only when I
reached the nest would the female leave it, and then she withdrew but a
short distance, returning as soon as I began to descend.The devotion of
these wild creatures to their young is often marvellous.Audubon
describes this hawk as'spiritless, inactive, and so deficient in courage
that he is often chased by the little sparrow-hawk and kingbird.'Another
naturalist dissents emphatically from this view, and regards the
broad-winged as the most courageous and spirited of his family, citing an
instance of a man in his employ who, while ascending to a nest, was
assailed with great fury.His hat was torn from his head, and he would
have been injured had not the bird been shot.He also gives another
example of courage in an attack by this hawk upon a boy seeking to rob
its nest.It fastened its talons in his arm, and could not be beaten off
until it was killed.It is brave and
fierce when its home is disturbed, and lacks the courage to attack other
birds of its own kind.At any rate, it has no hesitancy in making
hawk-love to chickens and ducklings, but as a rule subsists on insects
and small quardrupeds.It is not a very common winter resident, but early
in March it begins to come northward in flocks."Next to the broad-winged, the sharp-shinned is our most abundant hawk,
and is found throughout the entire continent from Hudson Bay to Mexico.It
usually builds its nest in trees, and occasionally on ledges of rocks,
and as a general thing takes some pains in its construction.Its domicile
approaches the eagle's nest in form, is broad and shallow, and made of
sticks and twigs lined thinly with dried leaves, mosses, etc.A full-grown
female--which, as I told you once before, is always larger than the male
among birds of prey--measures about twenty-six inches with wings extended.It is lead- above, and lighter beneath.You can easily recognize
this hawk by its short wings, long tail, and swift, irregular flight.One
moment it is high in the air, the next it disappears in the grass, having
seized the object of its pursuit.It is capable of surprisingly sudden
dashes, and its pursuit is so rapid that escape is wellnigh hopeless.Audubon saw one dart into a thicket of
briers, strike and instantly kill a thrush, and emerge with it on the
opposite side.One came every
day to a poultry-yard until it had carried off over twenty.It does not
hesitate to pounce down upon a chicken even in the farmer's presence; and
one, in a headlong pursuit, broke through the glass of a greenhouse, then
dashed through another glass partition, and was only brought up by a third.Pigeons are also quite in its line.Indeed, it is a bold red-taloned
freebooter, and only condescends to insects and the smaller reptiles when
there are no little birds at hand.During the spring migration this hawk
is sometimes seen in large flocks."The American goshawk is the next bird of this family that I will
mention, and I am very glad to say that he is only a winter resident.He
is the dreaded blue hen-hawk of New England, and is about twenty-three
inches long, and forty-four from tip to tip of wings.One good authority
says that for strength, intrepidity, and fury he cannot be surpassed.He
will swoop down into a poultry-yard and carry off a chicken almost before
you can take a breath.He is swift, cunning, and adroit rather than
heedless and headlong, like the sharp-shinned hawk, and although the
bereaved farmer may be on the alert with his gun, this marauder will
watch his chance, dash into the yard, then out again with his prey, so
suddenly that only the despairing cries of the fowl reveal the murderous
onslaught.A housewife will
hear a rush of wings and cries of terror, and can only reach the door in
time to see one of these robbers sailing off with the finest of her
pullets.Hares and wild-ducks are favorite game also.The goshawk will
take a mallard with perfect ease, neatly and deliberately strip off the
feathers, and then, like an epicure, eat the breast only.Audubon once
saw a large flock of blackbirds crossing the Ohio.Like an arrow a
goshawk darted upon them, while they, in their fright, huddled together.The hawk seized one after another, giving each a death-squeeze, then
dropping it into the water.In this way he killed five before the flock
escaped into the woods.He then leisurely went back, picked them up one
by one, and carried them to the spot selected for his lunch.With us, I
am happy to say, he is shy and distant, preferring the river marshes to
the vicinity of our farmyards.He usually takes his prey while swooping
swiftly along on the wing."Have we any hawks similar to those employed in the old-time falconry of
Europe?""Yes; our duck or great-footed hawk is almost identical with the
well-known peregrine falcon of Europe.It is a permanent resident, and
breeds on the inaccessible cliffs of the Highlands, although preferring
similar localities along a rocky sea-coast.There is no reason to doubt
that our duck-hawk might be trained for the chase as readily as its
foreign congener.It has the same wonderful powers of flight, equal
docility in confinement, and can be taught to love and obey its master.I
have often wondered why falconry has not been revived, like other ancient
sports.The Germans are said to have employed trained hawks to capture
carrier-pigeons that were sent out with missives by the French during the
siege of Paris.In a few instances the duck-hawk has been known to nest
in trees.It is a solitary bird, and the sexes do not associate except at
the breeding season.While it prefers water-fowl, it does not confine
itself to them.I shot one on a Long Island beach and found in its crop
whole legs of the robin, Alice's thrush, catbird, and warblers.It
measures about forty-five inches in the stretch of its wings, and its
prevailing color is of a dark blue."The pigeon-hawk is not very rare at this season.Professor Baird
describes this bird as remarkable for its rapid flight, its courage, and
its enterprise in attacking birds even larger than itself.This accords
with my experience, for my only specimen was shot in the act of destroying
a hen.He is about the size of our common flicker, or high-holder, which
bird, with robins, pigeons, and others of similar size, is his favorite
game.The sparrow-hawk is rare at this time, and is only abundant
occasionally during its migrations.The red-shouldered hawk is a handsome
bird, with some very good traits, and is a common permanent resident.Unless hunted, these birds are not shy, and they remain mated throughout
the year.Many a human pair might learn much from their affectionate and
considerate treatment of each other.They do not trouble poultry-yards, and
are fond of frogs, cray-fish, and even insects.Occasionally they will
attack birds as large as a meadow-lark.They have a high and very irregular
flight, but occasionally they so stuff themselves with frogs that they can
scarcely move.Wilson found one with the remains of ten frogs in his crop."Last among the winter residents I can merely mention the red-tailed
hawk, so named from the deep rufus color of its tail feathers.It is a
heavy, robust bird, and while it usually feeds on mice, moles, and shrews
that abound in meadows, its depredations on farmyards are not infrequent.It is widely distributed throughout the continent, and abundant here.It
is a powerful bird, and can compass long distances with a strong, steady
flight, often moving with no apparent motion of the wings.It rarely
seizes its prey while flying, like the goshawk, but with its keen vision
will inspect the immediate vicinity from the branch of a tree, and thence
dart upon it.Insects, birds, and
reptiles are alike welcome game, and in summer it may be seen carrying a
writhing snake through the air.While flying it utters a very harsh,
peculiar, and disagreeable scream, and by some is called the squealing
hawk.The social habits of this bird are in appropriate concord with its
voice.After rearing their young the sexes separate, and are jealous of
and hostile to each other.It may easily happen that if the wife of the
spring captures any prey, her former mate will struggle fiercely for its
possession, and the screaming clamor of the fight will rival a conjugal
quarrel in the Bowery.In this respect they form an unpleasing contrast
with the red-shouldered hawks, among whom marriage is permanent, and
maintained with lover-like attentions.Thus it would appear that there
are contrasts of character even in the hawk world; and when you remember
that we have fifteen other varieties of this bird, besides the nine I
have mentioned, you may think that nature, like society, is rather
prodigal in hawks.As civilization advances, however, innocence stands a
better chance.At least this is true of the harmless song-birds."I have now given you free-hand sketches of the great majority of our
winter residents, and these outlines are necessarily very defective from
their brevity as well as for other reasons.I have already talked an
unconscionably long time; but what else could you expect from a man with
a hobby?As it is, I am not near through, for the queer little
white-bellied nut-hatch, and his associates in habits, the downy, the
hairy, the golden-winged, and the yellow-bellied woodpeckers, and four
species of owls, are also with us at this season.With the bluebirds the
great tide of migration has already turned northward, and all through
March, April, and May I expect to greet the successive arrivals of old
friends every time I go out to visit my patients.I can assure you that I
have no stupid, lonely drives, unless the nights are dark and stormy.Little Johnnie, I see, has gone to sleep.I must try to meet some fairies
and banshees in the moonlight for her benefit But, Alf, I'm delighted to
see you so wide-awake.Shooting birds as game merely is very well, but
capturing them in a way to know all about them is a sport that is always
in season, and would grow more and more absorbing if you lived a thousand
years."A bent for life was probably given to the boy's mind that night.CHAPTER XVII

FISHING THROUGH THE ICE


Every day through the latter part of February the sun grew higher, and
its rays more potent.The snow gave rapidly in warm southern nooks and
<DW72>s, and the icicles lengthened from the eaves and overhanging rocks,
forming in many instances beautiful crystal fringes.On northern <DW72>s
and shaded places the snow scarcely wasted at all, and Amy often wondered
how the vast white body that covered the earth could ever disappear in
time for spring.But there soon came a raw, chilly, cloudy day, with a
high south wind, and the snow sank away, increasing the apparent height
of the fences, and revealing objects hitherto hidden, as if some magic
were at work.Clifford, "that a day like this, raw
and cold as it seems, does more to carry off the snow than a week of
spring sunshine, although it may be warm for the season.What is more,
the snow is wasted evenly, and not merely on sunny <DW72>s.The wind seems
to soak up the melting snow like a great sponge, for the streams are not
perceptibly raised.""The air does take it up the form of vapor," said Webb, "and that is why
we have such a chilly snow atmosphere.Rapidly melting snow tends to
lower the temperature proportionately, just as ice around a form of
cream, when made to melt quickly the addition of salt, absorbs all heat
in its vicinity so fast that the cream is congealed.But this accumulation
of vapor in the air must come down again, perhaps in the form of snow, and
so there will be no apparent gain.""If no apparent gain, could there be a real gain by another fall of
snow?"Amy asked; for to inexperienced eyes there certainly seemed more
than could be disposed of in time for April flowers."Yes," he replied, "a fall of snow might make this whole section warmer
for a time, and so hasten spring materially.We shall have
plenty of snowstorms yet, and still spring will be here practically on
time."But instead of snow the vapor-burdened air relieved itself by a rain of
several hours' duration, and in the morning the river that had been so
white looked icy and glistening, and by the aid of a glass was seen to be
covered with water, which rippled under the rising breeze.The following
night was clear and cold, and the surface of the bay became a comparatively
smooth glare of ice.At dinner next day Webb remarked:

"I hear that they are catching a good many striped bass through the ice,
and I learned that the tide would be right for them to raise the nets
this afternoon.I propose, Amy, that we go down and see the process, and
get some of the fish direct from the water for supper."Burt groaned, and was almost jealous that during his enforced confinement
so many opportunities to take Amy out fell naturally to Webb.The latter,
however, was so entirely fraternal in his manner toward the young girl
that Burt was ever able to convince himself that his misgivings were
absurd.Webb was soon ready, and had provided himself with his skates and a small
sleigh with a back.When they arrived at the landing he tied his horse,
and said:

"The ice is too poor to drive on any longer, I am informed, but perfectly
safe still for foot-passengers.As a precaution we will follow the tracks
of the fishermen, and I will give you a swift ride on this little sledge,
in which I can wrap you up well."Like most young men brought up in the vicinity, he was a good and powerful
skater, and Amy was soon enjoying the exhilarating sense of rapid motion
over the smooth ice, with a superb view of the grand mountains rising on
either side of the river a little to the south.They soon reached the nets,
which stretched across the river through narrow longitudinal cuts so as to
be at right angles to each tide, with which the fish usually swim.These
nets are such in shape as were formerly suspended between the old-fashioned
shad-poles, and are sunk perpendicularly in the water by weights at each
end, so that the meshes are expanded nearly to their full extent.The fish
swim into these precisely as do the shad, and in their attempts to back out
their gills catch, and there they hang.The nests are about twelve feet square, and the meshes of different nets
are from to and a half to five and a quarter inches in size.A bass of
nine pounds' weight can be "gilled" in the ordinary manner; but in one
instance a fish weighing one hundred and two pounds was caught, and
during the present season they were informed that a lucky fisherman at
Marlborough had secured "a 52-pounder."These heavy fellows, it was
explained, "would go through a net like a cannon-ball" if they came "head
on," and with ordinary speed; but if they are playing around gently, the
swift tide carries them sidewise into the "slack of the net," from which
they seem unable to escape.There are usually about forty-five feet
between the surface of the water and the top of the nets, therefore the
fish are caught at an average depth of fifty feet.The best winter
fishing is from December to March, and as many as one hundred and seventy
pounds, or about two hundred bass, have been taken in twenty-four hours
from one line of nets; at other times the luck is very bad, for the fish
seem to run in streaks.The luck was exceedingly moderate on the present occasion, but enough
fish were caught to satisfy Webb's needs.As they were watching the
lifting of the nets and angling for information, they saw an ice-boat
slowly and gracefully leaving the landing, and were told that since the
ice had grown thin it had taken the place of the sleigh in which the
passengers were conveyed to and from the railroad station on the further
shore.The wind, being adverse, necessitated several tacks, and on one of
them the boat passed so near Webb and Amy that they recognized Mr.Barkdale, the clergyman, who, as he sped by, saluted them.When the boat
had passed on about an eighth of a mile, it tacked so suddenly and
sharply that the unwary minister was rolled out upon the ice.The speed
and impetus of the little craft were so great that before it could be
brought up it was about half a mile away, and the good man was left in
what might be a dangerous isolation, for ice over which the boat could
skim in security might be very unsafe under the stationary weight of a
solidly built man like Mr.Webb therefore seized a pole
belonging to one of the fishermen, and came speedily to the clergyman's
side.Happily the ice, although it had wasted rapidly from the action of
the tide in that part of the river, sustained them until the boat
returned, and the good man resumed his journey with laughing words, by
which he nevertheless conveyed to Webb his honest gratitude for the
promptness with which the young fellow had shared his possible danger.When Webb returned he found Amy pale and agitated, for an indiscreet
fisherman had remarked that the ice was "mighty poor out in that
direction.""Won't you please come off the river?""But you were not here a moment since, and I've no confidence in your
discretion when any one is in danger.""I did not run any risks worth speaking of."The men explained, in answer to my questions, that the
ice toward spring becomes honeycombed--that's the way they expressed
it--and lets one through without much warning.They also said the tides
wore it away underneath about as fast as the rain and sun wasted the
surface.""Supposing it had let me through, I should have caught on the pole, and
so have easily scrambled out, while poor Mr.Barkdale would have been
quite helpless.""Oh, I know it was right for you to go, and I know you will go again
should there be the slightest occasion.Therefore I am eager to reach
solid ground.Her tone was so earnest that he complied, and they were soon in the
sleigh again.As they were driving up the hill she turned a shy glance
toward him, and said, hesitatingly: "Don't mistake me, Webb.I am proud
to think that you are so brave and uncalculating at times; but then I--I
never like to think that you are in danger.Remember how very much you
are to us all.""Well, that is rather a new thought to me."Yes, you are," she said, gravely and earnestly, looking him frankly in
the face."From the first moment you spoke to me as'sister Amy' you made
the relation seem real.And then your manner is so strong and even that
it's restful to be with you.You may give one a terrible fright, as you
did me this afternoon, but you would never make one nervous."His face flushed with deep pleasure, but he made good her opinion by
quietly changing the subject, and giving her a brisk, bracing drive over
one of her favorite roads.All at the supper table agreed that the striped bass were delicious, and
Burt, as the recognized sportsman of the family, had much to say about
the habits of this fine game fish.Among his remarks he explained that
the "catch" was small at present because the recent rain and melting snow
had made the water of the river so fresh that the fish had been driven
back toward the sea."But they reascend," he said, "as soon as the
freshet subsides.They are a sea fish, and only ascend fresh-water
streams for shelter in winter, and to breed in spring.They spawn in May,
and by August the little fish will weigh a quarter of a pound.A good
many are taken with seines after the ice breaks up, but I never had any
luck with pole and line in the river.While striped bass are found all
along the coast from Florida to Cape Cod, the largest fish are taken
between the latter place and Montauk Point.I once had some rare sport
off the east end of Long Island.I was still-fishing, with a pole and
reel, and fastened on my hook a peeled shedder crab.My line was of
linen, six hundred feet long, and no heavier than that used for trout,
but very strong.By a quick movement which an old bass-fisherman taught
me I made my bait dart like an arrow straight over the water more than
one hundred feet, my reel at the same moment whirling, in paying out, as
if it would fuse from friction.Well, I soon hooked a fifty-pound fish,
and we had a tussle that I shall never forget.It took me an hour to tire
him out, and I had to use all the skill I possessed to keep him from
breaking the line.It was rare sport, I can tell you--the finest bit of
excitement I ever had fishing;" and the young fellow's eyes sparkled at
the memory.Strange as it may appear to some, his mother shared most largely in his
enthusiasm.The reason was that, apart from the interest which she took
in the pleasure of all her children, she lived much in her imagination,
which was unusually strong, and Burt's words called up a marine picture
with an athletic young fellow in the foreground all on the _qui
vive_, his blue eyes flashing with the sparkle and light of the sea as
he matched his skill and science against a creature stronger than
himself."Are larger bass ever taken with rod and line?""Yes, one weighing seventy-five pounds has been captured."How big do they grow, anyhow?""To almost your size, Len, and that's a heavy compliment to the bass.They have been known to reach the weight of one hundred and fifty
pounds."CHAPTER XVIII

PLANNING AND OPENING THE CAMPAIGN


The last day of February was clear, cloudless, and cold, the evening
serene and still.Winter's tempestuous course was run, its icy breath
apparently had ceased, and darkness closed on its quiet, pallid face."March came in like a lamb"--an ominous circumstance for the future
record of this month of most uncertain weather, according to the
traditions of the old weather-prophets.The sun rose clear and warm, the
snow sparkled and melted, the bluebirds rejoiced, and their soft notes of
mutual congratulation found many echoes among their human neighbors.By
noon the air was wonderfully soft and balmy, and Webb brought in a number
of sprays from peach-trees cut in different parts of the place, and
redeemed his promise to Amy, showing her the fruit germs, either green,
or rather of a delicate gold-color, or else blackened by frost.She was
astonished to find how perfect the embryo blossom appeared under the
microscope.It needed no glass, however, to reveal the blackened heart of
the bud, and Webb, having cut through a goodly number, remarked: "It
would now appear as if nature had performed a very important labor for
us, for I find about eight out of nine buds killed.It will save us
thinning the fruit next summer, for if one-ninth of the buds mature into
peaches they will not only bring more money, but will measure more by the
bushel.""How can one peach measure more than eight peaches?"If all these buds grew into peaches, and
were left on these slender boughs, the tree might be killed outright by
overbearing, and would assuredly be much injured and disfigured by broken
limbs and exhaustion, while the fruit itself would be so small and poor
as to be unsalable.Thousands of trees annually perish from this cause,
and millions of peaches are either not picked, or, if marketed, may bring
the grower into debt for freight and other expenses.A profitable crop of
peaches can only be grown by careful hand-thinning when they are as large
as marbles, unless the frost does the work for us by killing the greater
part of the buds.It is a dangerous ally, however, for our constant fear
is that it will destroy _all_ the buds.There are plenty left yet, and I
find that cherry, apple, plum, and pear buds are still safe.Indeed,
there is little fear for them as long as peach buds are not entirely
destroyed, for they are much hardier."In the afternoon Burt, who had become expert in the use of crutches,
determined on an airing, and invited Amy to join him."I now intend to
begin giving you driving lessons," he said."You will soon acquire entire
confidence, for skill, far more than strength, is required.As long as
one keeps cool and shows no fear there is rarely danger.Horses often
catch their senseless panic from their drivers, and, even when frightened
with good cause, can usually be reassured by a few quiet words and a firm
rein."Amy was delighted at the prospect of a lesson in driving, especially as
Bart, because of his lameness, did not venture to take his over-spirited
steed Thunder.She sincerely hoped, however, that he would confine his
thoughts and attentions to the ostensible object of the drive, for his
manner at times was embarrassingly ardent.Burt was sufficiently politic
to fulfil her hope, for he had many other drives in view, and had
discovered that attentions not fraternal were unwelcome to Amy.With a
self-restraint and prudence which he thought most praiseworthy and
sagacious, but which were ludicrous in their limitations, he resolved to
take a few weeks to make the impression which he had often succeeded in
producing in a few hours, judging from the relentings and favors received
in a rather extended career of gallantry, although it puzzled the young
fellow that he could have been so fascinated on former occasions.He
merely proposed that now she should enjoy the drive so thoroughly that
she would wish to go again, and his effort met with entire success.During the first week of March there were many indications of the opening
campaign on the Clifford farm.There was the overhauling and furbishing
of weapons, otherwise tools, and the mending or strengthening of those in
a decrepit state.A list of such additional ones as were wanted was made
at this time, and an order sent for them at once.Amy also observed that
practical Leonard was conning several catalogues of implements."Len is
always on the scent of some new patent hoe or cultivator," Burt remarked."My game pays better than yours," was the reply, "for the right kind of
tools about doubles the effectiveness of labor."The chief topic of discussion and form of industry at this time were the
pruning and cleansing of trees, and Amy often observed Webb from her
windows in what seemed to her most perilous positions in the tops of
apple and other trees, with saw and pruning shears or nippers--a light
little instrument with such a powerful leverage that a good-sized bough
could be lopped away by one slight pressure of the hand."It seems to me," remarked Leonard, one evening, "that there is much
diversity of opinion in regard to the time and method of trimming trees.While the majority of our neighbors prune in March, some say fall or
winter is the best time.Others are in favor of June, and in some paper
I've read, 'Prune when your knife is sharp.'As for cleansing the bark of
the trees, very few take the trouble.""Well," replied his father, "I've always performed these labors in March
with good results.I have often observed that taking off large limbs from
old and feeble trees is apt to injure them.A decay begins at the point
of amputation and extends down into the body of the tree.Sap-suckers and
other wood peckers, in making their nests, soon excavate this rotten wood
back into the trunk, to which the moisture of every storm is admitted,
and the life of the tree is shortened."At this point Webb went out, and soon returned with something like
exultation blending with his usually grave expression."I think father's views are correct, and I have confirmation here in
autograph letters from three of the most eminent horticulturists in the
world--"

"Good gracious, Webb!don't take away our breath in that style,"
exclaimed Burt."Have you autograph letters from several autocrats also?"As usual Webb ignored his brother's nonsense, and resumed: "The first is
from the Hon.Marshall P. Wilder, President of the American Pomological
Society, and is as follows: 'I prune my trees early in March, as soon as
the heavy frosts are over, when the sap is dormant.If the branch is
large I do not cut quite close in, and recut close in June, when the
wound heals more readily.I do not approve of rigorous pruning of old
trees showing signs of feebleness.Such operations would increase
decline--only the dead wood should be removed, the loss of live wood
depriving old trees of the supply of sap which they need for support.Grafting-wax is good to cover the wounds of trees, or a thick paint of
the color of the bark answers well.Trees also may be pruned in safety in
June after the first growth is made--then the wounds heal quickly.'Charles Downing, editor of 'The Fruits and
Fruit-Trees of America.''When the extreme cold weather is over,' he
says,'say the last of February or first of March, begin to trim trees,
and finish as rapidly as convenient.Do not trim a tree too much at one
time, and cut no large limbs if possible, but thin out the small
branches.If the trees are old and bark-bound, scrape off the roughest
bark and wash the bodies and large limbs with whale-oil soap, or
soft-soap such as the farmers make, putting it on quite thick.Give the
ground plenty of compost manure, bone-dust, ashes, and salt.The best and
most convenient preparation for covering wounds is gum-shellac dissolved
in alcohol to the thickness of paint, and put on with a brush.'Patrick Barry, of the eminent Rochester firm, and author of
'The Fruit Garden.''In our climate pruning may be done at convenience,
from the fall of the leaf until the 1st of April.In resuscitating old
neglected apple-trees, _rigorous_ pruning may be combined with plowing
and manuring of the ground.For covering wounds made in pruning, nothing
is better than common grafting wax laid on warm with a brush.'Hon P. T.
Quinn, in his work on 'Pear Culture,' writes: 'On our own place we begin
to prune our pear-trees from the 1st to the 15th of March, and go on with
the work through April.It is not best to do much cutting, except on very
young trees, while the foliage is coming out.'""Well," remarked Leonard, "I can go to work to-morrow with entire
content; and very pleasant work it is, too, especially on the young
trees, where by a little forethought and a few cuts one can regulate the
form and appearance of the future tree.""Well, you see there are plenty of buds on all the young branches, and we
can cut a branch just above the bud we wish to grow which will continue
to grow in the direction in which it points.Thus we can shape each
summer's growth in any direction we choose.""How can you be sure to find a bud just where you want it?""Of course we do," said Webb, "for buds are arranged spirally on trees
in mathematical order.On most trees it is termed-the 'five-ranked
arrangement,' and every bud is just two-fifths of the circumference of the
stem from the next.This will bring every sixth bud or leaf over the first,
or the one we start with.Thus in the length of stem occupied by five buds
you have buds facing in five different directions--plenty of choice for
all pruning purposes.""Oh, nonsense, Webb; you are too everlastingly scientific.Buds and
leaves are scattered at haphazard all over the branches.""That shows you observe at haphazard.Wait, and I'll prove I'm right;"
and he seized his hat and went out.Returning after a few minutes with
long, slender shoots of peach, apple, and pear trees, he said: "Now put
your finger on any bud, and count.See if the sixth bud does not stand
invariably over the one you start from, and if the intervening buds do
not wind spirally twice around the stem, each facing in a different
direction."He laughed, and said: "There, Len,
you've seen buds and branches for over forty years, and never noticed
this.Here, Alf, you begin right, and learn to see things just as they
are.There's no telling how often accurate knowledge may be useful.""But, Webb, all plants have not the five-ranked arrangement, as you term
it," his mother protested.There is the two-ranked, in which the third leaf stands over the
first; the three-ranked, in which the fourth leaf stands over the first.Then we also find the eighth and thirteenth ranked arrangements,
according to the construction of various species of plants or trees.But
having once observed an arrangement of buds or leaves in a species, you
will find it maintained with absolute symmetry and accuracy, although the
spaces between the buds lengthwise upon the stem may vary very much.Nature, with all her seeming carelessness and _abandon_, works on strict
mathematical principles.""Well," said Alf, "I'm going to see if you are right tomorrow.And on the following day he tried his best to
prove Webb wrong, but failed.Before the week was over there was a decided return of winter.The sky
lost its spring-like blue.Cold, ragged clouds were driven wildly by a
northeast gale, which, penetrating the heaviest wraps, caused a shivering
sense of discomfort.Only by the most vigorous exercise could one cope
with the raw, icy wind, and yet the effort to do so brought a rich return
in warm, purified blood.All outdoor labor, except such as required
strong, rapid action, came to an end, for it was the very season and
opportunity for pneumonia to seize upon its chilled victim.To a family
constituted like the Cliffords such weather brought no _ennui_.They
had time for more music and reading aloud than usual.The pets in the
flower-room needed extra care and watching, for the bitter wind searched
out every crevice and cranny.Entering the dining-room on one occasion,
Amy found the brothers poring over a map spread out on the table."It certainly is a severe stress of
weather that has brought you all to that."These are our Western Territories," Burt promptly responded."This
prominent point here is Fort Totem, and these indications of adjacent
buildings are for the storage of furs, bear-meat, and the accommodation
of Indian hunters."Burt tried to look serious, but Webb's and Leonard's
laughter betrayed him.Amy turned inquiringly to Webb, as she ever did
when perplexed."Don't mind Burt's chaff," he said."This is merely a map of the farm,
and we are doing a little planning for our spring work--deciding what
crop we shall put on that field and how treat this one, etc.You can see,
Amy, that each field is numbered, and here in this book are corresponding
numbers, with a record of the crops grown upon each field for a good many
years back, to what extent and how often they have been enriched, and the
kind of fertilizers used.Of course such a book of manuscript would be
the dreariest prose in the world to you, but it is exceedingly interesting
to us; and what's more, these past records are the best possible guides for
future action.""Oh, I know all about your book now," she said, with an air of entire
confidence, "for I've heard papa say that land and crop records have been
kept in England for generations.I don't think I will sit up nights to
read your manuscript, however.If Burt's version had been true, it might
have been quite exciting."Clifford in overhauling the seed-chest,
however.This was a wooden box, all tinned over to keep out the mice, and
was divided into many little compartments, in which were paper bags of
seeds, with the date on which they were gathered or purchased.Some of
the seeds were condemned because too old; others, like those of melons
and cucumbers, improved with a moderate degree of age, she was told.Clifford brought out from her part of the chest a rich store of flower
seeds, and the young girl looked with much curiosity on the odd-appearing
little grains and scale-like objects in which, in miniature, was wrapped
some beautiful and fragrant plant."Queer little promises, ain't they?"said the old lady; "for every seed is a promise to me.""I tell you what it is, Amy," the old gentleman remarked, "this chest
contains the assurance of many a good dinner and many a beautiful
bouquet.Now, like a good girl, help us make an inventory.We will first
have a list of what we may consider trustworthy seeds on hand, and then,
with the aid of these catalogues, we can make out another list of what we
shall buy.Seed catalogues, with their long list of novelties, never lose
their fascination for me.I know that most of the new things are not half
so good as the old tried sorts, but still I like to try some every year.It's a harmless sort of gambling, you see, and now and then I draw a
genuine prize.Mother has the gambling mania far worse than I, as is
evident from the way she goes into the flower novelties.""I own up to it," said Mrs.Clifford, "and I do love to see the almost
endless diversity in beauty which one species of plants will exhibit.Why, do you know, Amy, I grew from seeds one summer fifty distinct
varieties of the dianthus.Suppose we take asters this year, and see how
many distinct kinds we can grow.Here, in this catalogue, is a long list
of named varieties, and, in addition, there are packages of mixed seeds
from which we may get something distinct from all the others.""How full of zest life becomes in the country," cried Amy, "if one only
goes to work in the right way!"Life was growing fuller and richer to her
every day in the varied and abounding interests of the family with which
she was now entirely identified."Webb," his mother asked at dinner, "how do you explain the varying
vitality of seeds?Some we can keep six or eight years, and others only
two.""That's a question I am unable to answer.It cannot be the amount of
material stored up in the cotyledons, or embryo seed leaves, for small
seeds like the beet and cucumber will retain their vitality ten years,
and lettuce, turnip, and tomato seed five or more years, while I do not
care to plant large, fleshy seeds like pease and beans that are over
three years old, and much prefer those gathered the previous season.The
whole question of the germinating of seeds is a curious one.Wheat taken
from the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy has grown.Many seeds appear to
have a certain instinct when to grow, and will lie dormant in the ground
for indefinite periods waiting for favorable conditions.For instance,
sow wood-ashes copiously and you speedily have a crop of white clover.Again, when one kind of timber is cut from land, another and diverse kind
will spring up, as if the soil were full of seeds that had been biding
their time.For all practical purposes the duration of vitality is known,
and is usually given in seed catalogues, I think, or ought to be.""Some say that certain fertilizers or conditions will produce certain
kinds of vegetation without the aid of seeds--just develop them, you
know," Leonard remarked."Well, I think the sensible answer is that all vegetation is developed
from seeds, spores, or whatever was designed to continue the chain of
being from one plant to another.For the life of me I can't see how mere
organic or inorganic matter can produce life.It can only sustain and
nourish the life which exists in it or is placed in it, and which by a
law of nature develops when the conditions are favorable.I am quite sure
that there is not an instance on record of the spontaneous production of
life, even down to the smallest animalcule in liquids, or the minutest
plant life that is propagated by invisible spores.That the microscope
does not reveal these spores or germs proves nothing, for the strongest
microscope in the world has not begun to reach the final atom of which
matter is composed.Indeed, it would seem to be as limited in its power
to explore the infinitely little and near as the telescope to reveal the
infinitely distant and great.Up to this time science has discovered
nothing to contravene the assurance that God, or some one, 'created every
living creature that moveth, and every herb yielding seed after his
kind.'After a series of most careful and accurate experiments, Professor
Tyndall could find no proof of the spontaneous production of even
microscopic life, and found much proof to the contrary.How far original
creations are changed or modified by evolution, natural selection, is a
question that is to be settled neither by dogmatism on the one hand, nor
by baseless theories on the other, but by facts, and plenty of them.""Do you think there is anything atheistical in evolution?"his mother
asked, and with some solicitude in her large eyes, for, like all trained
in the old beliefs, she felt that the new philosophies led away into a
realm of vague negations.Webb understood her anxiety lest the faith she
had taught him should become unsettled, and he reassured her in a
characteristic way."If evolution is the true explanation of the world,
as it now appears to us, it is no more atheistical than some theologies I
have heard preached, which contained plenty of doctrines and attributes,
but no God.If God with his infinite leisure chooses to evolve his
universe, why shouldn't he?In any case a creative, intelligent power is
equally essential.It would be just as easy for me to believe that all
the watches and jewelry at Tiffany's were the result of fortuitous causes
as to believe that the world as we find it has no mind back of it."Mother smiled with satisfaction, for she saw that he still stood just
where she did, only his horizon had widened."Well," said his father, contentedly, "I read much in the papers and
magazines of theories and isms of which I never heard when I was young,
but eighty years of experience have convinced me that the Lord reigns."They all laughed at this customary settlement of knotty problems, on the
part of the old gentleman, and Burt, rising from the table, looked out,
with the remark that the prospects were that "the Lord would rain heavily
that afternoon."The oldest and most infallible weather-prophet in the
region--Storm King--was certainly giving portentous indications of a
storm of no ordinary dimensions.The vapor was pouring over its summit in
Niagara-like volume, and the wind, no longer rushing with its recent
boisterous roar, was moaning and sighing as if nature was in pain and
trouble.The barometer, which had been low for two days, sank lower; the
temperature rose as the gale veered to the eastward.This fact, and the
moisture laden atmosphere, indicated that it came from the Gulf Stream
region of the Atlantic.The rain, which began with a fine drizzle,
increased fast, and soon fell in blinding sheets.The day grew dusky
early, and the twilight was brief and obscure; then followed a long night
of Egyptian darkness, through which the storm rushed, warred, and
splashed with increasing vehemence.Before the evening was over, the
sound of tumultuously flowing water became an appreciable element in the
uproar without, and Webb, opening a window on the sheltered side of the
house, called Amy to hear the torrents pouring down the sides of Storm
King."What tremendous alternations of mood Nature indulges in!"she said, as
she came shivering back to the fire."Contrast such a night with a sunny
June day.""It would seem as if'mild, ethereal spring' had got her back up," Burt
remarked, "and regarding the return of winter as a trespass, had taken
him by the throat, determined to have it out once for all.Something will
give way before morning, probably half our bridges.""Well, that _is_ a way of explaining the jar among the elements that I
had not thought of," she said, laughing."You needn't think Webb can do all the explaining.I have my theories
also--sounder than his, too, most of 'em.""There is surely no lack of sound accompanying your theory to-night.Indeed, it is not all'sound and fury!'""It's all the more impressive, then.What's the use of your delicate,
weak-backed theories that require a score of centuries to substantiate
them?""Your theory about the bridges will soon be settled," remarked Leonard,
ominously, "and I fear it will prove correct.At this rate the town will
have to pay for half a dozen new ones--bridges, I mean."There was a heavy body of
snow still in the mountains and on northern <DW72>s, and much ice on the
streams and ponds."There certainly will be no little trouble if this
continues.""Don't worry, children," said Mr."I have generally
found everything standing after the storms were over."CHAPTER XIX

WINTER'S EXIT


The old house seemed so full of strange sounds that Amy found it
impossible to sleep.Seasoned as were its timbers, they creaked and
groaned, and the casements rattled as if giant hands were seeking to open
them.The wind at times would sigh and sob so mournfully, like a human
voice, that her imagination peopled the darkness with strange creatures
in distress, and then she would shudder as a more violent gust raised the
prolonged wail into a loud shriek.Thoughts of her dead father--not the
resigned, peaceful thoughts which the knowledge of his rest had brought
of late--came surging into her mind.Her organization was peculiarly fine
and especially sensitive to excited atmospherical conditions, and the
tumult of the night raised in her mind an irrepressible, although
unreasoning, panic.At last she felt that she would scream if she
remained alone any longer.She put on her wrapper, purposing to ask Mrs.Leonard to come and stay with her for a time, feeling assured that if she
could only speak to some one, the horrid spell of nervous fear would be
broken.As she stepped into the hall she saw a light gleaming from the
open door of the sitting-room, and in the hope that some one was still
up, she stole noiselessly down the stairway to a point that commanded a
view of the apartment.Only Webb was there, and he sat quietly reading by
the shaded lamp and flickering fire.The scene and his very attitude
suggested calmness and safety.There was nothing to be afraid of, and he
was not afraid.With every moment that she watched him the nervous
agitation passed from mind and body.His strong, intent profile proved
that he was occupied wholly with the thought of his author.The quiet
deliberation with which he turned the leaves was more potent than
soothing words."I wouldn't for the world have him know I'm so weak and
foolish," she said to herself, as she crept noiselessly back to her room."He little dreamed who was watching him," she whispered, smilingly, as
she dropped asleep.When she waked next morning the rain had ceased, the wind blew in fitful
gusts, and the sky was still covered with wildly hurrying clouds that
seemed like the straggling rearguard which the storm had left behind.So
far as she could see from her window, everything was still standing, as
Mr.Familiar objects greeted her reassuringly, and
never before had the light even of a lowering morning seemed more blessed
in contrast with the black, black night.As she recalled the incidents of
that night--her nervous panic, and the scene which had brought quiet and
peace--she smiled again, and, it must be admitted, blushed slightly."I
wonder if he affects others as he does me," she thought."Papa used to
say, when I was a little thing, that I was just a bundle of nerves, but
when Webb is near I am not conscious I ever had a nerve."Every little brook had become a torrent; Moodna Creek was reported to be
in angry mood, and the family hastened through breakfast that they might
drive out to see the floods and the possible devastation.Several bridges
over the smaller streams had barely escaped, and the Idlewild brook,
whose spring and summer music the poet Willis had caused to be heard even
in other lands, now gave forth a hoarse roar from the deep glen through
which it raved.An iron bridge over the Moodna, on the depot road, had
evidently been in danger in the night.The ice had been piled up in the
road at each end of the bridge, and a cottage a little above it was
surrounded by huge cakes.The inmates had realized their danger, for part
of their furniture had been carried to higher ground.Although the volume
of water passing was still immense, all danger was now over.As they were
looking at the evidences of the violent breaking up of winter, the first
phoebe-bird of the season alighted in a tree overhanging the torrent, and
in her plaintive notes seemed to say, as interpreted by John Burroughs,
"If you please, spring has come."They gave the brown little harbinger
such an enthusiastic welcome that she speedily took flight to the further
shore."Where was that wee bit of life last night?"said Webb; "and how could it
keep up heart?""Possibly it looked in at a window and saw some one reading," thought
Amy; and she smiled so sweetly at the conceit that Webb asked, "How many
pennies will you take for your thoughts?""They are not in the market;" and she laughed outright as she turned
away."The true place to witness the flood will be at the old red bridge
further down the stream," said Leonard; and they drove as rapidly as the
bad wheeling permitted to that point, and found that Leonard was right.Just above the bridge was a stone dam, by which the water was backed up a
long distance, and a precipitous wooded bank rose on the south side.This
had shielded the ice from the sun, and it was still very thick when the
pressure of the flood came upon it.Up to this time it had not given way,
and had become the cause of an ice-gorge that every moment grew more
threatening.The impeded torrent chafed and ground the cakes together,
surging them up at one point and permitting them to sink at another, as
the imprisoned waters struggled for an outlet.The solid ice still held
near the edge of the dam, although it was beginning to lift and crack
with the tawny flood pouring over, under, and around it."Suppose we cross to the other side, nearest home," said Burt, who was
driving; and with the word he whipped up the horses and dashed through
the old covered structure."You ought not to have done that, Burt," said Webb, almost sternly."The
gorge may give way at any moment, and the bridge will probably go with
it.We shall now have to drive several hundred yards to a safe place to
leave the horses, for the low ground on this side will probably be
flooded."cried Amy; and they all noticed that she was trembling.But a few minutes sufficed to tie the horses and return to a point of
safety near the bridge."I did not mean to expose you to the slightest
danger," Burt whispered, tenderly, to Amy."See, the bridge is safe
enough, and we might drive over it again."Even as he spoke there was a long grinding, crunching sound.A great
volume of black water had forced its way under the gorge, and now lifted
it bodily over the dam.It sank in a chaotic mass, surged onward and
upward again, struck the bridge, and in a moment lifted it from its
foundations and swept it away, a shattered wreck, the red covering
showing in the distance like ensanguined stains among the tossing cakes
of ice.They all drew a long breath, and Amy was as pale as if she had witnessed
the destruction of some living creature.No doubt she realized what would
have been their fate had the break occurred while they were crossing."Good-by, old bridge," said Leonard, pensively."I played and fished
under you when a boy, and in the friendly dusk of its cover I kissed
Maggie one summer afternoon of our courting days--"

"Well, well," exclaimed Burt, "the old bridge's exit has been a moving
object in every sense, since it has evoked such a flood of sentiment from
Len.Let us take him home to Maggie at once."As they were about to depart they saw Dr.Marvin driving down to the
opposite side, and they mockingly beckoned him to cross the raging
torrent.He shook his head ruefully, and returned up the hill again.A
rapid drive through the Moodna Valley brought them to the second bridge,
which would evidently escape, for the flats above it were covered with
_debris_ and ice, and the main channel was sufficiently clear to permit
the flood to pass harmlessly on.They then took the river road homeward.The bridge over the Idlewild brook, near its entrance into the Moodna,
was safe, although it had a narrow graze.They also found that the ice in
the river at the mouth of the creek had been broken up in a wide
semicircle, and as they ascended a hill that commanded an extensive view
of Newburgh Bay they saw that the ice remaining had a black, sodden
appearance."It will all break up in a few hours," said Burt, "and then hurrah for
duck-shooting!"Although spring had made such a desperate onset the previous night, it
seemed to have gained but a partial advantage over winter.The weather
continued raw and blustering for several days, and the overcast sky
permitted but chance and watery gleams of sunshine.Slush and mud
completed the ideal of the worst phase of March.The surface of the earth
had apparently returned to that period before the dry land was made to
appear.As the frost came out of the open spaces of the garden, plowed
fields, and even the country roads, they became quagmires in which one
sank indefinitely.Seeing the vast advantage afforded to the men-folk by
rubber boots, Amy provided herself with a pair, and with something of the
exultation of the ancient Hebrews passed dry-shod through the general
moisture.CHAPTER XX

A ROYAL CAPTIVE


In the midst of this dreary transition period Nature gave proof that she
has unlimited materials of beauty at her command at any time.Early one
afternoon the brothers were driven in from their outdoor labors by a cold,
sleety rain, and Leonard predicted an ice-storm.The next morning the world
appeared as if heavily plated with silver.The sun at last was unclouded,
and as he looked over the top of Storm King his long-missed beams
transformed the landscape into a scene of wonder and beauty beyond anything
described in Johnnie's fairy tales.Trees, shrubs, the roofs and sidings of
the buildings, the wooden and even the stone fences, the spires of dead
grass, and the unsightly skeletons of weeds, were all incased in ice and
touched by the magic wand of beauty.The mountain-tops, however, surpassed
all other objects in the transfigured world, for upon them a heavy mist had
rested and frozen, clothing every branch and spray with a feathery
frost-work of crystals, which, in the sun-lighted distance, was like a
great shock of silver hair.There were drawbacks, however, to this
marvellous scene.There were not a few branches already broken from the
trees, and Mr.Clifford said that if the wind rose the weight of the ice
would cause great destruction.They all hastened through breakfast, Leonard
and Webb that they might relieve the more valuable fruit and evergreen
trees of the weight of ice, and Burt and Amy for a drive up the mountain.As they slowly ascended, the scene under the increasing sunlight took on
every moment more strange and magical effects.The ice-incased twigs and
boughs acted as prisms, and reflected every hue of the rainbow, and as
they approached the summit the feathery frost-work grew more and more
exquisitely delicate and beautiful, and yet it was proving to be as
evanescent as a dream, for in all sunny place it was already vanishing.They had scarcely passed beyond the second summit when Burt uttered an
exclamation of regretful disgust."By all that's unlucky," he cried, "if
there isn't an eagle sitting on yonder ledge!I could kill him with
bird-shot, and I haven't even a popgun with me.""It's too bad," sympathized Amy."Let us drive as near as we can, and get
a good view before he flies."To their great surprise, he did not move as they approached, but only
glared at them with his savage eye."Well," said Burt, "after trying for hours to get within rifle range,
this exceeds anything I ever saw.I wonder if he is wounded and cannot
fly."Suddenly he sprang out, and took a strap from the harness.I think I know what is the trouble with his majesty, and
we may be able to return with a royal captive."He drew near the eagle slowly and warily, and soon perceived that he was
incased in ice from head to foot, and only retained the power of slightly
moving his head.The creature was completely helpless, and must remain so
until his icy fetters thawed out.His wings were frozen to his sides, his
legs covered with ice, as were also his talons, and the dead branch of a
low pine on which he had perched hours before.Icicles hung around him,
making a most fantastic fringe.Only his defiant eye and open beak could
give expression to his untamed, undaunted spirit.It was evident that the
bird made a fierce internal struggle to escape, but was held as in a
vise.Burt was so elated that his hand trembled with eagerness; but he resolved
to act prudently, and grasping the bird firmly but gently by the neck, he
succeeded in severing the branch upon which the eagle was perched, for it
was his purpose to exhibit the bird just as he had found him.Having
carefully carried his prize to the buggy, he induced Amy, who viewed the
creature with mingled wonder and alarm, to receive this strange addition
to their number for the homeward journey.He wrapped her so completely
with the carriage robe that the eagle could not injure her with his beak,
and she saw he could no more move in other respects than a block of ice.As an additional precaution, Burt passed the strap around the bird's neck
and tied him to the dash-board.Even with his heavy gloves he had to act
cautiously, for the eagle in his disabled state could still strike a
powerful blow.Then, with an exultation beyond all words, he drove to Dr.Marvin's, in order to have one of the "loudest crows" over him that he
had ever enjoyed.The doctor did not mind the "crow" in the least, but
was delighted with the adventure and capture, for the whole affair had
just the flavor to please him.As he was a skilful taxidermist, he
good-naturedly promised to "set the eagle up" on the selfsame branch on
which he had been found, for it was agreed that he would prove too
dangerous a pet to keep in the vicinity of the irrepressible little Ned.Indeed, from the look of this fellow's eye, it was evident that he would
be dangerous to any one."I will follow you home, and after you have
exhibited him we will kill him scientifically.He is a splendid specimen,
and not a feather need be ruffled."Barkdale's and some others of his
nearest neighbors and friends in a sort of triumphal progress; but Amy
grew uneasy at her close proximity to so formidable a companion, fearing
that he would thaw out.Many were the exclamations of wonder and
curiosity when they reached home.Alf went nearly wild, and little
Johnnie's eyes overflowed with tears when she learned that the regal bird
must die.As for Ned, had he not been restrained he would have given the
eagle a chance to devour him."So, Burt, you have your eagle after all," said his mother, looking with
more pleasure and interest on the flushed, eager face of her handsome boy
than upon his captive."Well, you and Amy have had an adventure.""I always have good fortune and good times when you are with me," Burt
whispered in an aside to Amy."Always is a long time," she replied, turning away; but he was too
excited to note that she did not reciprocate his manner, and he was
speedily engaged in a discussion as to the best method of preserving the
eagle in the most life-like attitude.After a general family council it
was decided that his future perch should be in a corner of the parlor,
and within a few days he occupied it, looking so natural that callers
were often startled by his lifelike appearance.Maggie would often say, remorsefully.As the day grew old the ice on the trees melted and fell away in myriads
of gemlike drops.Although the sun shone brightly, there was a sound
without as of rain.By four in the afternoon the pageant was over, the
sky clouded again, and the typical March outlook was re-established.CHAPTER XXI

SPRING'S HARBINGERS


Amy was awakened on the following morning by innumerable bird-notes, not
songs, but loud calls.Hastening to the window, she witnessed a scene
very strange to her eyes.All over the grass of the lawn and on the
ground of the orchard beyond was a countless flock of what seemed to her
quarter-grown chickens.A moment later the voice of Alf resounded through
the house, crying, "The robins have come!"Very soon nearly all the
household were on the piazza to greet these latest arrivals from the
South; and a pretty scene of life and animation they made, with their
yellow bills, jaunty black heads, and brownish red breasts."_Turdus migratorius_, as the doctor would say," remarked Burt; "and
migrants they are with a vengeance.Last night there was not one to be
seen, and now here are thousands.They are on their way north, and have
merely alighted to feed.""Isn't it odd how they keep their distance from each other?""You can scarcely see two near together, but every few feet there is a
robin, as far as the eye can reach.Yes, and there are some high-holders
in the orchard also.They are shyer than the robins, and don't come so
near the house.You can tell them, Amy, by their yellow bodies and brown
wings.I have read that they usually migrate with the robins.I wonder
how far this flock flew last--ah, listen!"Clear and sweet came an exquisite bird-song from an adjacent maple.Webb
took off his hat in respectful greeting to the minstrel."Why," cried Amy, "that little brown bird cannot be a robin.""No," he answered, "that is my favorite of all the earliest birds--the
song-sparrow.Marvin said about him the other
evening?I have been looking for my little friend for a week past, and
here he is.The great tide of migration has turned northward.""He is my favorite too," said his father."Every spring for over seventy
years I remember hearing his song, and it is just as sweet and fresh to
me as ever.Indeed, it is enriched by a thousand memories."For two or three days the robins continued plentiful around the house,
and their loud "military calls," as Burroughs describes them, were heard
at all hours from before the dawn into the dusk of night, but they seemed
to be too excited over their northward journey or their arrival at their
old haunts to indulge in the leisure of song.They reminded one of the
advent of an opera company.There was incessant chattering, a flitting to
and fro, bustle and excitement, each one having much to say, and no one
apparently stopping to listen.The majority undoubtedly continued their
migration, for the great flocks disappeared.It is said that the birds
that survive the vicissitudes of the year return to their former haunts,
and it would seem that they drop out of the general advance as they reach
the locality of the previous summer's nest, to which they are guided by
an unerring instinct.The evening of the third day after their arrival was comparatively mild,
and the early twilight serene and quiet.The family were just sitting
down to supper when they heard a clear, mellow whistle, so resonant and
penetrating as to arrest their attention, although doors and windows were
closed.Hastening to the door they saw on the top of one of the tallest
elms a robin, with his crimson breast lighted up by the setting sun, and
his little head lifted heavenward in the utterance of what seemed the
perfection of an evening hymn.Indeed, in that bleak, dim March evening,
with the long, chill night fast falling and the stormy weeks yet to come,
it would be hard to find a finer expression of hope and faith.Peculiarly domestic in his haunts and
habits, he resembles his human neighbors in more respects than one.He is
much taken up with his material life, and is very fond of indulging his
large appetite.He is far from being aesthetic in his house or
housekeeping, and builds a strong, coarse nest of the handiest materials
and in the handiest place, selecting the latter with a confidence in
boy-nature and cat-nature that is often misplaced.He is noisy, bustling,
and important, and as ready to make a raid on a cherry-tree or a
strawberry-bed as is the average youth to visit a melon-patch by
moonlight.He has a careless, happy-go-lucky air, unless irritated, and
then is as eager for a "square set-to" in robin fashion as the most
approved scion of chivalry.Like man, he also seems to have a spiritual
element in his nature; and, as if inspired and lifted out of his grosser
self by the dewy freshness of the morning and the shadowy beauty of the
evening, he sings like a saint, and his pure, sweet notes would never
lead one to suspect that he was guilty of habitual gormandizing.He
settles down into a good husband and father, and, in brief, reminds one
of the sturdy English squire who is sincerely devout over his prayer-book
on proper occasions, and between times takes all the goods the gods send.In the morning little Johnnie came to the breakfast-table in a state of
great excitement.It soon appeared that she had a secret that she would
tell no one but Amy--indeed, she would not tell it, but show it; and
after breakfast she told Amy to put on her rubber boots and come with
her, warning curious Alf meanwhile to keep his distance.Leading the way
to a sunny angle in the garden fence, she showed Amy the first flower of
the year.Although it was a warm, sunny spot, the snow had drifted there
to such an extent that the icy base of the drift still partially covered
the ground, and through a weak place in the melting ice a snow-drop had
pushed its green, succulent leaves and hung out its modest little
blossom.The child, brought up from infancy to feel the closest sympathy
with nature, fairly trembled with delight over this _avant-coureur_ of
the innumerable flowers which it was her chief happiness to gather.As if
in sympathy with the exultation of the child, and in appreciation of all
that the pale little blossom foreshadowed, a song-sparrow near trilled
out its sweetest lay, a robin took up the song, and a pair of bluebirds
passed overhead with their undulating flight and soft warble.Truly
spring had come in that nook of the old garden, even though the mountains
were still covered with snow, the river was full of floating ice, and the
wind chill with the breath of winter.Could there have been a fairer or
more fitting committee of reception than little Johnnie, believing in all
things, hoping all things, and brown-haired, hazel-eyed Amy, with the
first awakenings of womanhood in her heart?CHAPTER XXII

"FIRST TIMES"


At last Nature was truly awakening, and color was coming into her pallid
face.On every side were increasing movement and evidences of life.Sunny
hillsides were free from snow, and the oozing frost loosed the hold of
stones upon the soil or the clay of precipitous banks, leaving them to
the play of gravitation.Will the world become level if there are no more
upheavals?The ice of the upper Hudson was journeying toward the sea that
it would never reach.The sun smote it, the high winds ground the
honey-combed cakes together, and the ebb and flow of the tide permitted
no pause in the work of disintegration.By the middle of March the blue
water predominated, and adventurous steamers had already picked and
pounded their way to and from the city.Only those deeply enamored of Nature feel much enthusiasm for the first
month of spring; but for them this season possesses a peculiar fascination.The beauty that has been so cold and repellent in relenting--yielding,
seemingly against her will, to a wooing that cannot be repulsed by even her
harshest moods.To the vigilance of love, sudden, unexpected smiles are
granted; and though, as if these were regretted, the frown quickly returns,
it is often less forbidding.It is a period full of delicious,
soul-thrilling "first times," the coy, exquisite beginnings of that final
abandonment to her suitor in the sky.Although she veils her face for days
with clouds, and again and again greets him in the dawn, wrapped in her old
icy reserve, he smiles back his answer, and she cannot resist.Indeed,
there soon come warm, still, bright days whereon she feels herself going,
but does not even protest.Mary travelled to the bedroom.Then, as if suddenly conscious of lost ground,
she makes a passionate effort to regain her wintry aspect.It is so
passionate as to betray her, so stormy as to insure a profounder relenting,
a warmer, more tearful, and penitent smile after her wild mood is over.She
finds that she cannot return to her former sustained coldness, and so at
last surrenders, and the frost passes wholly from her heart.To Alf's and Johnnie's delight it so happened that one of these gentlest
moods of early spring occurred on Saturday--that weekly millennium of
school-children.With plans and preparations matured, they had risen with
the sun, and, scampering back and forth over the frozen ground and the
remaining patches of ice and snow, had carried every pail and pan that
they could coax from their mother to a rocky hillside whereon clustered a
few sugar-maples.Webb, the evening before, had inserted into the sunny
sides of the trees little wooden troughs, and from these the tinkling
drip of the sap made a music sweeter than that of the robins to the eager
boy and girl.At the breakfast-table each one was expatiating on the rare promise of
the day.Clifford, awakened by the half subdued clatter of the
children, had seen the brilliant, rose tinted dawn."The day cannot be more beautiful than was the night," Webb remarked."A
little after midnight I was awakened by a clamor from the poultry, and
suspecting either two or four footed thieves, I was soon covering the
hennery with my gun.As a result, Sir Mephitis, as Burroughs calls him,
lies stark and stiff near the door.After watching awhile, and finding no
other marauders abroad, I became aware that it was one of the most
perfect nights I had ever seen.It was hard to imagine that, a few hours
before, a gale had been blowing under a cloudy sky.The moonlight was so
clear that I could see to read distinctly.So attractive and still was
the night that I started for an hour's walk up the boulevard, and when
near Idlewild brook had the fortune to empty the other barrel of my gun
into a great horned owl.How the echoes resounded in the quiet night!The
changes in April are more rapid, but they are on a grander scale this
month.""It seems to me," laughed Burt, "that your range of topics is even more
sublime.From Sir Mephitis to romantic moonlight and lofty musings, no
doubt, which ended with a screech-owl.""The great horned is not a screech-owl, as you ought to know.Well,
Nature is to blame for my alternations.I only took the goods the gods
sent.""I hope you did not take cold," said Maggie."The idea of prowling around
at that time of night!""Webb was in hopes that Nature might bestow upon him some confidences by
moonlight that he could not coax from her in broad day.I shall seek
better game than you found.Ducks are becoming plenty in the river, and
all the conditions are favorable for a crack at them this morning.So I
shall paddle out with a white coat over my clothes, and pretend to be a
cake of ice.If I bring you a canvas-back, Amy, will you put the wishbone
over the door?""Not till I have locked it and hidden the key."Without any pre-arranged purpose the day promised to be given up largely
to country sport.Burt had taken a lunch, and would not return until
night, while the increasing warmth and brilliancy of the sunshine, and
the children's voices from the maple grove, soon lured Amy to the piazza."Come," cried Webb, who emerged from the wood-house with an axe on his
shoulder, "don rubber boots and wraps, and we'll improvise a male-sugar
camp of the New England style a hundred years ago.We should make the
most of a day like this."They soon joined the children on the hillside, whither Abram had already
carried a capacious iron pot as black as himself.On a little terrace
that was warm and bare of snow, Webb set up cross-sticks in gypsy
fashion, and then with a chain supended the pot, the children dancing
like witches around it.Clifford and little Ned now appeared, the
latter joining in the eager quest for dry sticks.Not far away was a
large tree that for several years had been slowly dying, its few living
branches having flushed early in September, in their last glow, which had
been premature and hectic.Dry sticks would make little impression on the
sap that now in the warmer light dropped faster from the wounded maples,
and therefore to supply the intense heat that should give them at least a
rich syrup before night, Webb threw off his coat and attacked the defunct
veteran of the grove.Amy watched his vigorous strokes with growing zest;
and he, conscious of her eyes, struck strong and true.Leonard, not far
away, was removing impediments from the courses, thus securing a more
rapid flow of the water and promoting the drainage of the land.He had
sent up his cheery voice from time to time, but now joined the group, to
witness the fall of a tree that had been old when he had played near it
like his own children to-day.The echoes of the ringing axe came back to
them from an adjacent hillside; a squirrel barked and "snickered," as if
he too were a party to the fun; crows overhead cawed a protest at the
destruction of their ancient perch; but with steady and remorseless
stroke the axe was driven through the concentric rings on either side
into the tree's dead heart.At last, as fibre after fibre was cut away,
it began to tremble.The children stood breathless and almost pitying as
they saw the shiver, apparently conscious, which followed each blow.Something of the same callousness of custom with which the fall of a man
is witnessed must blunt one's nature before he can look unmoved upon the
destruction of a familiar tree.As the dead maple trembled more and more violently, and at last swayed to
and fro in the breathless air, Amy cried, "Webb!She had hardly spoken when, with a slow and stately motion, the lofty
head bowed; there was a rush through the air, an echoing crash upon the
rocks.She sprang forward with a slight cry, but Webb, leaning his axe on
the prostrate bole, looked smilingly at her, and said, "Why, Amy, there
is no more danger in this work than in cutting a stalk of corn, if one
knows how.""There appears to be more," she replied."I never saw a large tree cut
down before, but have certainly read of people being crushed."By the way, Amy," said Leonard, "the wood-chopper that you visited with
me is doing so well that we shall give him work on the farm this summer.There was a little wheat in all that chaff of a man, and it's beginning
to grow.He says he would like to work where he
can see you occasionally.""I have been there twice with Webb since, and shall go oftener when the
roads are better," she replied, simply."That's right, Amy; follow up a thing," said Mr."It's better
to _help_ one family than to try to help a dozen.That was a good
clean cut, Webb," he added, examining the stump."I dislike to see a tree
haggled down.""I suppose that if you had lived a
few hundred years ago you would have been hacking at people in the same
way.""And so might have been a hero, and won your admiration if you had lived
then in some gray castle, with the floor of your bower strewn with
rushes.Now there is no career for me but that of a plain farmer.""What manly task was given long before knighthood, eh, Webb?It seems to me
that you are striving after the higher mastery, one into which you can
put all your mind as well as muscle.Knocking people on the head wasn't a
very high art.""I imagine there will always be distressed damsels in the world.Indeed,
in fiction it would seem that many would be nothing if not distressed.You can surely find one, Webb, and so be a knight in spite of our prosaic
times.""I shall not try," he replied, laughing."I am content to be a farmer,
and am glad you do not think our work is coarse and common.You obtained
some good ideas in England, Amy.The tastes of the average American girl
incline too much toward the manhood of the shop and office.There, Len, I
am rested now;" and he took the axe from his brother, who had been
lopping the branches from the prostrate tree.Amy again watched his athletic figure with pleasure as he rapidly
prepared billets for the seething caldron of sap.The blue of the sky
seemed intense after so many gray and steel-hued days, and there was not
a trace of cloud.The flowing sap was not sweeter than the air, to which
the brilliant sunlight imparted an exhilarating warmth far removed from
sultriness.From the hillside came the woody odor of decaying leaves, and
from the adjacent meadow the delicate perfume of grasses whose roots
began to tingle with life the moment the iron grip of the frost relaxed.Sitting on a rock near the crackling fire, Amy made as fair a gypsy as
one would wish to see.On every side were evidences that spring was
taking possession of the land.In the hollows of the meadow at her feet
were glassy pools, kept from sinking away by a substratum of frost, and
among these migratory robins and high-holders were feeding.The brook
beyond was running full from the melting of the snow in the mountains,
and its hoarse murmur was the bass in the musical babble and tinkle of
smaller rills hastening toward it on either side.Thus in all directions
the scene was lighted up with the glint and sparkle of water.The rays of
the sun idealized even the muddy road, of which a glimpse was caught, for
the pasty clay glistened like the surface of a stream.The returning
birds appeared as jubilant over the day as the children whose voices
blended with their songs--as do all the sounds that are absolutely
natural.The migratory tide of robins, song-sparrows, phoebes, and other
early birds was still moving northward; but multitudes had dropped out of
line, having reached their haunts of the previous year.The sunny
hillsides and its immediate vicinity seemed a favorite lounging-place
both for the birds of passage and for those already at home.The
excitement of travel to some, and the delight at having regained the
scene of last year's love and nesting to others, added to the universal
joy of spring, so exhilarated their hearts that they could scarcely be
still a moment.Although the sun was approaching the zenith, there was
not the comparative silence that pervades a summer noon.Bird calls
resounded everywhere; there was a constant flutter of wings, as if all
were bent upon making or renewing acquaintance--an occupation frequently
interrupted by transports of song."Do you suppose they really recognize each other?"Amy asked Webb, as he
threw down an armful of wood near her.Marvin would insist that they do," he replied, laughing."When with
him, one must be wary in denying to the birds any of the virtues and
powers.He would probably say that they understood each other as well as
we do.They certainly seem to be comparing notes, in one sense of the
word at least.Listen, and you will hear at this moment the song of
bluebird, robin, both song and fox sparrow, phoebe, blue jay, high-holder,
and crow--that is, if you can call the notes of the last two birds a song."she cried, after a few moments' pause."Wait till two months have passed, and you will hear a grand symphony
every morning and evening.All the members of our summer opera troupe do
not arrive till June, and several weeks must still pass before the great
star of the season appears.""Both he and she--the woodthrush and his mate.They are very aristocratic
kin of these robins.A little before them will come two other
blood-relations, Mr.Brownthrasher, who, notwithstanding their
family connection with the high toned woodthrush and jolly, honest robin,
are stealthy in their manner, and will skulk away before you as if ashamed
of something.When the musical fit is on them, however, they will sing
openly from the loftiest tree-top, and with a sweetness, too, that few
birds can equal.""Why, Webb, you almost equal Dr."Oh no; I only become acquainted with my favorites.If a bird is rare,
though commonplace in itself, he will pursue it as if it laid golden
eggs."A howl from Ned proved that even the brightest days and scenes have their
drawbacks.The little fellow had been prowling around among the pails and
pans, intent on obtaining a drink of the sap, and thus had put his hand on
a honey-bee seeking the first sweet of the year.In an instant Webb reached
his side, and saw what the trouble was.Carrying him to the fire, he drew a
key from his pocket, and pressed its hollow ward over the spot stung.This
caused the poison to work out.Nature's remedy--mud--abounded, and soon a
little moist clay covered the wound, and Amy took him in her arms and tried
to pacify him, while his father, who had strolled away with Mr.The grandfather looked down commiseratingly on the
sobbing little companion of his earlier morning walk, and soon brought, not
merely serenity, but joy unbounded, by a quiet proposition."I will go back to the house," he said, "and have mamma put up a nice
lunch, and you and the other children can eat your dinner here by the fire.So can you, Webb and Amy, and then you can look after the youngsters.Suppose you have a little picnic, which, in March, will
be a thing to remember.Alf, you can come with me, and while mamma is
preparing the lunch you can run to the market and get some oysters and
clams, and these, with potatoes, you can roast in the ashes of a smaller
fire, which Ned and Johnnie can look after under Webb's superintendence.Wouldn't you like my little plan, Amy?""Yes, indeed," she replied, putting her hands caressingly within his arm."It's hard to think you are old when you know so well what we young
people like.I didn't believe that this day could be brighter or jollier,
and yet your plan has made the children half-wild."Indeed, Alf had already given his approval by tearing off toward the
house for the materials of this unprecedented March feast in the woods,
and the old gentleman, as if made buoyant by the good promise of his
little project in the children's behalf, followed with a step wonderfully
elastic for a man of fourscore."Well, Heaven grant I may attain an age like that!"said Webb, looking
wistfully after him."There is more of spring than autumn in father yet,
and I don't believe there will be any winter in his life.Well, Amy, like
the birds and squirrels around us, we shall dine out-of-doors today.You
must be mistress of the banquet; Ned, Johnnie, and I place ourselves
under your orders; don't we, Johnnie?""To be sure, uncle Webb; only I'm so crazy over all this fun that I'm
sure I can never do anything straight.""Well, then, 'bustle!"I believe with Maggie that
housekeeping and dining well are high arts, and not humdrum necessities.Webb, I need a broad, flat rock.Please provide one at once, while
Johnnie gathers clean dry leaves for plates.You, Ned, can put lots of
dry sticks between the stones there, and uncle Webb will kindle the right
kind of a fire to leave plenty of hot coals and ashes.Now is the time
for him to make his science useful."Was it the exquisitely pure air
and the exhilarating spring sunshine that sent the blood tingling through
his veins?Or was it the presence, tones, and gestures of a girl with
brow and neck like the snow that glistened on the mountain <DW72>s above
them, and large true eyes that sometimes seemed gray and again blue?Amy's developing beauty was far removed from a fixed type of prettiness,
and he felt this in a vague way.The majority of the girls of his
acquaintance had a manner rather than an individuality, and looked and
acted much the same whenever he saw them.They were conventionalized
after some received country type, and although farmers' daughters, they
seemed unnatural to this lover of nature.Allowing for the difference in
years, Amy was as devoid of self-consciousness as Alf or Johnnie.Not the
slightest trace of mannerism perverted her girlish ways.She moved,
talked, and acted with no more effort or thought of effort than had the
bluebirds that were passing to and fro with their simple notes and
graceful flight, She was nature in its phase of girlhood.To one of his
temperament and training the perfect day itself would have been full of
unalloyed enjoyment, although occupied with his ordinary labors; but for
some reason this unpremeditated holiday, with Amy's companionship, gave
him a pleasure before unknown--a pleasure deep and satisfying, unmarred
by jarring discords or uneasy protests of conscience or reason.Truly, on
this spring day a "first time" came to him, a new element was entering
into his life.He did not think of defining it; he did not even recognize
it, except in the old and general way that Amy's presence had enriched them
all, and in his own case had arrested a tendency to become materialistic
and narrow.On a like day the year before he would have been absorbed in
the occupations of the farm, and merely conscious to a certain extent of
the sky above him and the bird song and beauty around him.His zest in living
and working was enhanced a thousand-fold, because life and work were
illumined by happiness, as the scene was brightened by sunshine.He felt
that he had only half seen the world before; now he had the joy of one
gradually gaining vision after partial blindness.Amy saw that he was enjoying the day immensely in his quiet way; she also
saw that she had not a little to do with the result, and the reflection
that she could please and interest the grave and thoughtful man, who was
six years her senior, conveyed a delicious sense of power.And yet she
was pleased much as a child would be."He knows so much more than I do,"
she thought, "and is usually so wrapped up in some deep subject, or so
busy, that it's awfully jolly to find that one can beguile him into
having such a good time.Burt is so exuberant in everything that I am
afraid of being carried away, as by a swift stream, I know not where.I
feel like checking and restraining him all the time.For me to add my
small stock of mirth to his immense spirits would be like lighting a
candle on a day like this; but when I smile on Webb the effect is
wonderful, and I can never get over my pleased surprise at the fact."Thus, like the awakening forces in the soil around them, a vital force
was developing in two human hearts equally unconscious.Alf and his grandfather at last returned, each well laden, and preparations
went on apace.Clifford made as if he would return and dine at home,
but they all clamored for his company.With a twinkle in his eye, he said:

"Well, I told mother that I might lunch with you, and I was only waiting
to be pressed a little.I've lived a good many years, but never was on a
picnic in March before.""Grandpa, you shall be squeezed as well as pressed," cried Johnnie,
putting her arms about his neck."You shall stay and see what a lovely
time you have given us.and she gave
one little sigh, the first of the day."Possibly Cinderella may appear in time for lunch;" and with a significant
look he directed Amy to the basket he had brought, from the bottom of which
was drawn a doll with absurdly diminutive feet, and for once in her life
Johnnie's heart craved nothing more."Maggie knew that this little mother could not be content long without
her doll, and so she put it in.You children have a thoughtful mother,
and you must be thoughtful of her," added the old man, who felt that the
incident admitted of a little homily.If some of the potatoes were slightly burned
and others a little raw, the occasion added a flavor better than Attic
salt.A flock of chickadees approached near enough to gather the crumbs
that were thrown to them."It's strange," said Webb, "how tame the birds are when they return in
the spring.In the fall the robins are among the wildest of the birds,
and now they are all around us.I believe that if I place some crumbs on
yonder rock, they'll come and dine with us, in a sense;" and the event
proved that he was right."Hey, Johnnie," said her grandfather, "you never took dinner with the
birds before, did you?This is almost as wonderful as if Cinderella sat
up and asked for an oyster."But Johnnie was only pleased with the fact, not surprised.Wonderland was
her land, and she said, "I don't see why the birds can't understand that
I'd like to have dinner with them every day.""By the way, Webb," continued his father, "I brought out the field-glass
with me, for I thought that with your good eyes you might see Burt;" and
he drew it from his pocket.The idea of seeing Burt shooting ducks nearly broke up the feast, and
Webb swept the distant river, full of floating ice that in the sunlight
looked like snow."I can see several out in boats," he said, "and Burt,
no doubt, is among them."Then Amy, Alf, and Johnnie must have a look, but Ned devoted himself
strictly to business, and Amy remarked that he was becoming like a little
sausage."Can the glass make us hear the noise of the gun better?"Johnnie asked,
at which they all laughed, Ned louder than any, because of the laughter
of the others.It required but a little thing to make these banqueters
hilarious.But there was one who heard them and did not laugh.From the brow of the
hill a dark, sad face looked down upon them.Lured by the beauty of the
day, Mr.Alvord had wandered aimlessly into the woods, and, attracted by
merry voices, had drawn sufficiently near to witness a scene that
awakened within him indescribable pain and longing.It was not a fear that he would be unwelcomed that kept him
away; he knew the family too well to imagine that.Something in the past darkened even that bright day, and
built in the crystal air a barrier that he could not pass.They would
give him a place at their rustic board, but he could not take it.He knew
that he would be a discord in their harmony, and their innocent merriment
smote his morbid nature with almost intolerable pain.With a gesture
indicating immeasurable regret, he turned and hastened away to his lonely
home.As he mounted the little piazza his steps were arrested.The
exposed end of a post that supported the inner side of its roof formed a
little sheltered nook in which a pair of bluebirds had begun to build
their nest.They looked at him with curious and distrustful eyes as they
flitted to and fro in a neighboring tree, and he sat down and looked at
them.The birds were evidently in doubt and in perturbed consultation.They would fly to the post, then away and all around the house, but
scarcely a moment passed that Mr.Alvord did not see that he was observed
and discussed.With singular interest and deep suspense he awaited their
decision.The female bird came flying
to the post with a beakful of fine dry grass, and her mate, on a spray
near, broke out into his soft, rapturous song.The master of the house
gave a great sigh of relief.A glimmer of a smile passed over his wan
face as he muttered, "I expected to be alone this summer, but I am to
have a family with me, after all."Soon after the lunch had been discussed leisurely and hilariously the
maple-sugar camp was left in the care of Alf and Johnnie, with Abram to
assist them.Amy longed for a stroll, but even with the protection of
rubber boots she found that the departing frost had left the sodded
meadow too wet and spongy for safety.Under Webb's direction she picked
her way to the margin of the swollen stream, and gathered some pussy
willows that were bursting their sheaths.CHAPTER XXIII

REGRETS AND DUCK-SHOOTING


Saturday afternoon, as is usual in the country, brought an increased number
of duties to the inhabitants of the farmhouse, but at the supper hour they
all, except Burt, looked back upon the day with unwonted satisfaction.He
had returned weary, hungry, and discontented, notwithstanding the fact that
several brace of ducks hung on the piazza as trophies of his skill.He was
in that uncomfortable frame of mind which results from charging one's self
with a blunder.In the morning he had entered on the sport with his usual
zest, but it had soon declined, and he wished he had remained at home.He
remembered the children's intention of spending the day among the maples,
and as the sun grew warm, and the air balmy, the thought occurred with
increasing frequency that he might have induced Amy to join them, and so
have enjoyed long hours of companionship under circumstances most favorable
to his suit.He now admitted that were the river alive with ducks, the
imagined opportunities of the maple grove were tenfold more attractive.At
one time he half decided to return, but pride prevented until he should
have secured a fair amount of game.He would not go home to be laughed at.Moreover, Amy had not been so approachable of late as he could wish, and he
proposed to punish her a little, hoping that she would miss his presence
and attentions.The many reminiscences at the supper-table were not
consoling.It was evident that he had not been missed in the way that he
desired to be, and that the day had been one of rich enjoyment to her.Neither was Webb's quiet satisfaction agreeable, and Burt mildly
anathematized himself at the thought that he might have had his share in
giving Amy so much pleasure.He took counsel of experience, however, and
having learned that even duck-shooting under the most favorable auspices
palled when contrasted with Amy's smiles and society, he resolved to be
present in the future when she, like Nature, was in a propitious mood.Impetuous as he was, he had not yet reached the point of love's blindness
which would lead him to press his suit in season and out of season.He soon
found a chance to inform Amy of his regret, but she laughed merrily back at
him as she went up to her room, saying that the air of a martyr sat upon
him with very poor grace in view of his success and persistence in the
sport, and that he had better put a white mark against the day, as she had
done.Marks, one of the most
noted duck-shooters and fishermen on the river, and they brought in three
superb specimens of a rare bird in this region, the American swan, that
queen of water-fowls and embodiment of grace."Shot 'em an hour or two ago, near Polopel's Island," said Mr.Marks,
"and we don't often have the luck to get within range of such game.Marvin was down visiting one of my children, and he said how he would
like to prepare the skin of one, and he thought some of you folks here
might like to have another mounted, and he'd do it if you wished."Exclamations of pleasure followed this proposition.Alf examined them
with deep interest, while Burt whispered to Amy that he would rather have
brought her home a swan like one of those than all the ducks that ever
quacked.In accordance with their hospitable ways, the Cliffords soon had the
doctor and Mr.Marks seated by their fireside, and the veteran sportsman
was readily induced to enlarge upon some of his experiences.He had killed two of the swans, he told them, as they were swimming, and
the other as it rose.He did not propose to let any such uncommon
visitors get away.He had never seen more than ten since he had lived in
this region.With the proverbial experience of meeting game when without
a gun, he had seen five fly over, one Sunday, while taking a ramble on
Plum Point."Have you ever obtained any snow-geese in our waters?"That's the scarcest water-fowl we have.Once in a wild snowstorm I
saw a flock of about two hundred far out upon the river, and would have
had a shot into them, but some fellows from the other side started out
and began firing at long range, and that has been my only chance.I
occasionally get some brant-geese, and they are rare enough.I once saw a
flock of eight, and got them all-took five out of the flock in the first
two shots--but I've never killed more than twenty-five in all.""I don't think I have ever seen one," remarked Mrs.Clifford, who, in her
feebleness and in her home-nook, loved to hear about these bold,
adventurous travellers.They brought to her vivid fancy remote wild
scenes, desolate waters, and storm-beaten rocks.The tremendous endurance
and power of wing in these shy children of nature never ceased to be
marvels to her."Burt has occasionally shot wild-geese--we have one
mounted there--but I do not know what a brant is, nor much about its
habits," she added."Its markings are like the ordinary Canada wild-goose," Dr.Marvin
explained, "and it is about midway in size between a goose and a duck.""I've shot a good many of the common wild-geese in my time," Mr.Marks
resumed; "killed nineteen four years ago.I once knocked down ten out of
a flock of thirteen by giving them both barrels.I have a flock of eight
now in a pond not far away--broke their wings, you know, and so they
can't fly.They soon become tame, and might be domesticated easily, only
you must always keep one wing cut, or they will leave in the spring or
fall.""Well, they never lose their instinct to migrate, and if they heard other
wild-geese flying over, they'd rise quick enough if they could and go
with them.""Do you think there would be any profit in domesticating them?"I know a man up the river who used to cross them with
our common geese, and so produced a hybrid, a sort of a mule-goose, that
grew very large.I've known 'em to weigh eighteen pounds or more, and
they were fine eating, I can tell you.I don't suppose there is much in
it, though, or some cute Yankee would have made a business of it before
this.""How many ducks do you suppose you have shot all together?""Oh, I don't know--a great many."What's the greatest number you ever got out of a flock, Marks?""Well, there is the old squaw, or long-tailed duck.They go in big
flocks, you now--have seen four or five hundred together.In the spring,
just after they have come from feeding on mussels in the southern
oyster-beds, they are fishy, but in the fall they are much better, and
the young ducks are scarcely fishy at all.I've taken twenty-three out of
a flock by firing at them in the water and again when they rose; and in
the same way I once knocked over eighteen black or dusky ducks; and they
are always fine, you know.""Are the fancy kinds, like the mallards and canvas-backs that are in such
demand by the epicures, still plentiful in their season?"I get a few now and then, but don't calculate on them any longer.It
was my luck with canvas-backs that got me into my duck-shooting ways.I
was cuffed and patted on the back the same day on their account."In response to their laughing expressions of curiosity he resumed: "I was
but a little chap at the time; still I believed I could shoot ducks, but
my father wouldn't trust me with either a gun or boat, and my only chance
was to circumvent the old man.So one night I hid the gun outside the
house, climbed out of a window as soon as it was light, and paddled round
a point where I would not be seen, and I tell you I had a grand time.I
did not come in till the middle of the afternoon, but I reached a point
when I must have my dinner, no matter what came before it.The old man
was waiting for me, and he cuffed me well.I didn't say a word, but went
to my mother, and she, mother-like, comforted me with a big dinner which
she had kept for me.I was content to throw the cuffing in, and still
feel that I had the best of the bargain.An elder brother began to chaff
me and ask, 'Where are your ducks?''Better go and look under the seat in
the stern-sheets before you make any more faces,' I answered, huffily.I
suppose he thought at first I wanted to get rid of him, but he had just
enough curiosity to go and see, and he pulled out sixteen canvas-backs.The old man was reconciled at once, for I had made better wages than he
that day; and from that time on I've had all the duck-shooting I've
wanted.""That's a form of argument to which the world always yields," said
Leonard, laughing."How many kinds of wild-ducks do we have here in the bay, that you can
shoot so many?""I've prepared the skins of twenty-four different kinds that were shot in
this vicinity," replied Dr.Clifford, "I think you once had a rather severe
experience while out upon the river.My favorite sport came nigh being the death of me, and it always
makes me shiver to think of it.I started out one spring morning at five
o'clock, and did not get home till two o'clock the next morning, and not
a mouthful did I have to eat.I had fair success during the day, but was
bothered by the quantities of ice running, and a high wind.About four
o'clock in the afternoon I concluded to return home, for I was tired and
hungry.I was then out in the river off Plum Point.I saw an opening
leading south, and paddled into it, but had not gone far before the wind
drove the ice in upon me, and blocked the passage.There I was, helpless,
and it began to blow a gale.The wind held the ice immovable on the west
shore, even though the tide was running out.For a time I thought the
boat would be crushed by the grinding cakes in spite of all I could do.If it had, I'd 'a been drowned at once, but I worked like a Trojan,
shouting, meanwhile, loud enough to raise the dead.No one seemed to hear
or notice me.At last I made my way to a cake that was heavy enough to
bear my weight, and on this I pulled up the boat, and lay down exhausted.It was now almost night, and I was too tired to shout any more.There on
that mass of ice I stayed till two o'clock the next morning.I thought
I'd freeze to death, if I did not drown.I shouted from time to time,
till I found it was of no use, and then gave my thoughts to keeping awake
and warm enough to live.I knew that my chance would be with the next
turn of the tide, when the ice would move with it, and also the wind, up
the river.I was at last able to break my way through
the loosened ice to Plain Point, and then had a two-mile walk home; and I
can tell you that it never seemed so like home before.""Oh, Burt, please don't go out again when the ice is running," was his
mother's comment on the story."Thoreau speaks of seeing black ducks asleep on a pond whereon thin ice
had formed, inclosing them, daring the March night," said Webb."Have you
ever caught them napping in this way?"Marks; "though it might easily happen on a still pond.The tides and wind usually break up the very thin ice on the river, and
if there is any open water near, the ducks will stay in it."Marvin, have you caught any glimpses of spring to-day that we have
not?"The doctor laughed--having heard of Webb's exploit in the night near the
hennery--and said: "I might mention that I have seen 'Sir Mephitis'
cabbage, as I suppose I should all it, growing vigorously.It is about
the first green thing we have.Around certain springs, however, the grass
keeps green all winter, and I passed one to-day surrounded by an emerald
hue that was distinct in the distance.It has been very cold and backward
thus far.""Possess your souls in patience," said Mr."Springtime and
harvest are sure.After over half a century's observation I have noted
that, no matter what the weather may have been, Nature always catches up
with the season about the middle or last of June."CHAPTER XXIV

APRIL


The remainder of March passed quickly away, with more alternations of
mood than there were days; but in spite of snow, sleet, wind, and rain,
the most forbidding frowns and tempestuous tears, all knew that Nature
had yielded, and more often she half-smilingly acknowledged the truth
herself.All sights and sounds about the farmhouse betokened increasing activity.During the morning hours the cackling in the barn and out-buildings
developed into a perfect clamor, for the more commonplace the event of a
new-born egg became, the greater attention the hens inclined to call to
it.Possibly they also felt the spring-time impulse of all the feathered
tribes to use their voice to the extent of its compass.The clatter was
music to Alf and Johnnie, however, for gathering the eggs was one of
their chief sources of revenue, and the hunting of nests--stolen so
cunningly and cackled over so sillily--with their accumulated treasures
was like prospecting for mines.The great basketful they brought in daily
after their return from school proved that if the egg manufactory ran
noisily, it did not run in vain.Occasionally their father gave them a
peep into the dusky brooding-room.Under his thrifty management the
majority of the nests were simply loose boxes, each inscribed with a
number.When a biddy wished to sit, she was removed at night upon the
nest, and the box was placed on a low shelf in the brooding-room.If she
remained quiet and contented in the new location, eggs were placed under
her, a note of the number of the box was taken, with the date, and the
character of the eggs, if they represented any special breed.By these
simple precautions little was left to what Squire Bartley termed "luck."Some of the hens had been on the nest nearly three weeks, and eagerly did
the children listen for the first faint peep that should announce the
senior chick of the year.Webb and Burt had already opened the campaign in the garden.On the black
soil in the hot-bed, which had been made in a sheltered nook, were even
now lines of cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, tomatoes, etc.These nursling
vegetables were cared for as Maggie had watched her babies.On mild sunny
days the sash was shoved down and air given.High winds and frosty nights
prompted to careful covering and tucking away.The Cliffords were not of
those who believe that pork, cabbage, and potatoes are a farmer's
birthright, when by a small outlay of time and skill every delicacy can
be enjoyed, even in advance of the season.On a warm <DW72> from which the
frost ever took its earliest departure, peas, potatoes, and other hardy
products of the garden were planted, and as the ground grew firm enough,
the fertilizers of the barn-yard were carted to the designated places,
whereon, by Nature's alchemy, they would be transmuted into forms of use
and beauty.It so happened that the 1st of April was an ideal spring day.During the
morning the brow of Storm King, still clothed with snow, was shrouded in
mist, through which the light broke uncertainly in gleams of watery
sunshine.A succession of showers took place, but so slight and mild that
they were scarcely heeded by the busy workers; there was almost a profusion
of half-formed rainbows; and atmosphere and cloud so blended that it was
hard to say where one began and the other ceased.On every twig, dead weed,
and spire of withered grass hung innumerable drops that now were water and
again diamonds when touched by the inconstant sun.Sweet-fern grass
abounded in the lawn, and from it exuded an indescribably delicious odor.The birds were so ecstatic in their songs, so constant in their calls, that
one might think that they, like the children, were making the most of
All-fools' Day, and playing endless pranks on each other.The robins acted
as if nothing were left to be desired.They were all this time in all
stages of relationship.Some had already paired, and were at work upon
their domiciles, but more were in the blissful and excited state of
courtship, and their conversational notes, wooings, and pleadings, as they
warbled the _pros_ and _cons_, were quite different from their
matin and vesper songs.Not unfrequently there were two aspirants for the
same claw or bill, and the rivals usually fought it out like their human
neighbors in the olden time, the red-breasted object of their affections
standing demurely aloof on the sward, quietly watching the contest with a
sidelong look, undoubtedly conscious, however, of a little feminine
exultation that she should be sought thus fiercely by more than one.After
all, the chief joy of the robin world that day resulted from the fact that
the mild, humid air lured the earth-worms from their burrowing, and Amy
laughed more than once as, from her window, she saw a little gourmand
pulling at a worm, which clung so desperately to its hole that the bird at
last almost fell over backward with its prize.Courtship, nest-building,
family cares--nothing disturbs a robin's appetite, and it was, indeed, a
sorry fools'-day for myriads of angle-worms that ventured out.Managing a country place is like sailing a ship: one's labors are, or
should be, much modified by the weather.This still day, when the leaves
were heavy with moisture, afforded Webb the chance he had desired to rake
the lawn and other grass-plots about the house, and store the material
for future use.He was not one to attempt this task when the wind would
half undo his labor.In the afternoon the showery phase passed, and the sun shone with a misty
brightness.Although so early in a backward spring, the day was full of
the suggestion of wild flowers, and Amy and the children started on their
first search into Nature's calendar of the seasons.All knew where to
look for the earliest blossoms, and in the twilight the explorers
returned with handfuls of hepatica and arbutus buds, which, from
experience, they knew would bloom in a vase of water.Who has ever
forgotten his childish exultation over the first wild flowers of the
year!Pale, delicate little blossoms though they be, and most of them
odorless, their memory grows sweet with our age.Burt, who had been away to purchase a horse--he gave considerable of his
time to the buying and selling of these animals--drove up as Amy
approached the house, and pleaded for a spray of arbutus."But the buds are not open yet," she said."No matter; I should value the spray just as much, since you gathered
it.""Why, Burt," she cried, laughing, "on that principle I might as well give
you a chip.""Amy," Webb asked at the supper-table, "didn't you hear the peepers this
afternoon while out walking?""Yes; and I asked Alf what they were.He said they were peepers, and that
they always made a noise in the spring.""Why, Alf," Webb resumed, in mock gravity, "you should have told Amy that
the sounds came from the _Hylodes pickeringii_.""If that is all that you can tell me," said Amy, laughing, "I prefer
Alf's explanation.I have known people to cover up their ignorance by
big words before.Indeed, I think it is a way you scientists have.""I must admit it; and yet that close observer, John Burroughs, gives a
charming account of these little frogs that we call 'hylas' for short.Shy as they are, and quick to disappear when approached, he has seen
them, as they climb out of the mud upon a sedge or stick in the marshes,
inflate their throats until they'suggest a little drummer-boy with his
drum hung high.'In this bubble-like swelling at its throat the noise is
made; and to me it is a welcome note of spring, although I have heard
people speak of it as one of the most lonesome and melancholy of sounds.It is a common saying among old farmers that the peepers must be shut up
three times by frost before we can expect steady spring weather.I
believe that naturalists think these little mites of frogs leave the mud
and marshes later on, and become tree-toads.Try to find out what you can at once about the things you see or hear:
that's the way to get an education.""Please don't think me a born pedagogue," he answered, smiling; "but you
have no idea how fast we obtain knowledge of certain kinds if we follow
up the object-lessons presented every day."CHAPTER XXV

EASTER


Easter-Sunday came early in the month, and there had been great
preparations for it, for with the Cliffords it was one of the chief
festivals of the year.To the children was given a week's vacation, and
they scoured the woods for all the arbutus that gave any promise of
opening in time.Clumps of bloodroot, hepaticas, dicentras, dog-tooth
violets, and lilies-of-the-valley had been taken up at the first
relaxation of frost, and forced in the flower-room.Hyacinth and tulip
bulbs, kept back the earlier part of the winter, were timed to bloom
artificially at this season so sacred to flowers, and, under Mrs.Clifford's fostering care, all the exotics of the little conservatory had
been stimulated to do their best to grace the day.Barkdale's pulpit was embowered with plants and vines growing in
pots, tubs, and rustic boxes, and the good man beamed upon the work,
gaining meanwhile an inspiration that would put a soul into his words on
the morrow.No such brilliant morning dawned on the worship of the Saxon goddess
Eostre, in cloudy, forest-clad England in the centuries long past, as
broke over the eastern mountains on that sacred day.At half-past five
the sun appeared above the shaggy summit of the Beacon, and the steel
hues of the placid Hudson were changed into sparkling silver.A white
mist rested on the water between Storm King, Break Neck, and Mount
Taurus.In the distance it appeared as if snow had drifted in and half
filled the gorge of the Highlands.The orange and rose-tinted sky
gradually deepened into an intense blue, and although the land was as
bare and the forests were as gaunt as in December, a soft glamour over
all proclaimed spring.Spring was also in Amy's eyes, in the oval delicacy of her girlish face
with its exquisite flush, in her quick, deft hands and elastic step as she
arranged baskets and vases of flowers.Webb watched her with his deep eyes,
and his Easter worship began early in the day.True homage it was, because
so involuntary, so unquestioning and devoid of analysis, so utterly free
from the self-conscious spirit that expects a large and definite return for
adoration.His sense of beauty, the poetic capabilities of his nature, were
kindled.Like the flowers that seemed to know their place in a harmony of
color when she touched them, Amy herself was emblematic of Easter, of its
brightness and hopefulness, of the new, richer spiritual life that was
coming to him.He loved his homely work and calling as never before,
because he saw how on every side it touched and blended with the beautiful
and sacred.Its highest outcome was like the blossoms before him which had
developed from a rank soil, dark roots, and prosaic woody stems.The grain
he raised fed and matured the delicate human perfection shown in every
graceful and unconscious pose of the young girl.She was Nature's priestess
interpreting to him a higher, gentler world which before he had seen but
dimly--interpreting it all the more clearly because she made no effort to
reveal it.She led the way, he followed, and the earth ceased to be an
aggregate of forms and material forces.With his larger capabilities he
might yet become her master, but now, with an utter absence of vanity, he
recognized how much she was doing for him, how she was widening his horizon
and uplifting his thoughts and motives, and he reverenced her as such men
ever do a woman that leads them to a higher plane of life.No such deep thoughts and vague homage perplexed Burt as he assisted Amy
with attentions that were assiduous and almost garrulous.The brightness
of the morning was in his handsome face, and the gladness of his buoyant
temperament in his heart.Amy was just to his taste--pretty, piquant,
rose-hued, and a trifle thorny too, at times, he thought.He believed
that he loved her with a boundless devotion--at least it seemed so that
morning.It was delightful to be near her, to touch her fingers
occasionally as he handed her flowers, and to win smiles, arch looks, and
even words that contained a minute prick like spines on the rose stems.He
felt sure that his suit would prosper in time, and she was all the more
fascinating because showing no sentimental tendencies to respond with a
promptness that in other objects of his attention in the past had even
proved embarrassing.She was a little conscious of Webb's silent
observation, and, looking up suddenly, caught an expression that deepened
her color slightly."That for your thoughts," she said, tossing him a flower with sisterly
freedom."Webb is pondering deeply," explained the observant Burt, "on the
reflection of light as shown not only by the color in these flowers, but
also in your cheeks under his fixed stare."There was an access of rose-hued reflection at these words, but Webb rose
quietly and said: "If you will let me keep the flower I will tell you my
thoughts another time.That
basket is now ready, and I will take it to the church."Burt was soon despatched with another, while she and Johnnie, who had
been flitting about, eager and interested, followed with light and
delicate vases.Alvord intercepted them near the
church vestibule.He had never been seen at any place of worship, and the
reserve and dignity of his manner had prevented the most zealous from
interfering with his habits.From the porch of his cottage he had seen
Amy and the little girl approaching with their floral offerings.Nature's
smile that morning had softened his bitter mood, and, obeying an impulse
to look nearer upon two beings that belonged to another world than his,
he joined them, and asked:

"Won't you let me see your flowers before you take them into the church?""Certainly," said Amy, cordially; "but there are lovelier ones on the
pulpit; won't you come in and see them?"cried Johnnie, "not going to church to-day?"She had lost much of
her fear of him, for in his rambles he frequently met her and Alf, and
usually spoke to them.Moreover, she had repeatedly seen him at their
fireside, and he ever had a smile for her.The morbid are often fearless
with children, believing that, like the lower orders of life, they have
little power to observe that anything is amiss, and therefore are neither
apt to be repelled nor curious and suspicious.This in a sense is true,
and yet their instincts are keen.Alvord was not selfish or
coarse; above all he was not harsh.To Johnnie he only seemed strange,
quiet, and unhappy, and she had often heard her mother say, "Poor Mr.Therefore, when he said, "I don't go to church; if I had a
little girl like you to sit by me, I might feel differently," her heart
was touched, and she replied, impulsively: "I'll sit by you, Mr.I'll sit with you all by ourselves, if you will only go to church to-day.Alvord," said Amy, gently, "that's an unusual offer for shy Johnnie
to make.You don't know what a compliment you have received, and I think
you will make the child very happy if you comply.""Could I make you happier by sitting with you in church to-day?"he
asked, in a low voice, offering the child his hand.You lead the way, for you know best where to go."She gave
her vase to Amy, and led him into a side seat near her father's pew--one
that she had noted as unoccupied of late."It's early yet Do you mind
sitting here until service begins?"I like to sit here and look at the flowers;" and the first
comers glanced wonderingly at the little girl and her companion, who was
a stranger to them and to the sanctuary.Amy explained matters to Leonard
and Maggie at the door when they arrived, and Easter-Sunday had new and
sweeter meanings to them.The spring had surely found its way into Mr.Barkdale's sermon also, and
its leaves, as he turned them, were not autumn leaves, which, even though
brilliant, suggest death and sad changes.One of his thoughts was much
commented upon by the Cliffords, when, in good old country style, the
sermon was spoken of at dinner."The God we worship," he said, "is the
God of life, of nature.In his own time and way he puts forth his power.We can employ this power and make it ours.Many of you will do this
practically during the coming weeks.You sow seed, plant trees, and seek
to shape others into symmetrical form by pruning-knife and saw.Why, that the great power that is revivifying nature
will take up the work here you leave off, and carry it forward.All the
skill and science in the world could not create a field of waving grain,
nor all the art of one of these flowers.How immensely the power of God
supplements the labor of man in those things which minister chiefly to
his lower nature!Can you believe that he will put forth so much energy
that the grain may mature and the flower bloom, and yet not exert far
greater power than man himself may develop according to the capabilities
of his being?The forces now exist in the earth and in the air to make
the year fruitful, but you must intelligently avail yourselves of them.The power ever exists that can redeem
us from evil, heal the wounds that sin has made, and develop the manhood
and womanhood that Heaven receives and rewards.With the same resolute
intelligence you must lay hold upon this ever-present spiritual force if
you would be lifted up."After the service there were those who would ostentatiously recognize and
encourage Mr.Alvord; but the Cliffords, with better breeding, quietly
and cordially greeted him, and that was all.At the door he placed
Johnnie's hand in her mother's, and gently said, "Good-by;" but the
pleased smile of the child and Mrs.As he entered
his porch, other maternal eyes rested upon him, and the brooding bluebird
on her nest seemed to say, with Johnnie, "I am not afraid of you."Possibly to the lonely man this may prove Easter-Sunday in very truth,
and hope, that he had thought buried forever, come from its grave.In the afternoon all the young people started for the hills, gleaning the
earliest flowers, and feasting their eyes on the sunlit landscapes veiled
with soft haze from the abundant moisture with which the air was charged.As the sun sank low in the many-hued west, and the eastern mountains
clothed themselves in royal purple, Webb chanced to be alone, near Amy,
and she said:

"You have had that flower all day, and I have not had your thoughts.""Oh, yes, you have--a great many of them.""You know that isn't what I mean.You promised to tell me what you were
thinking about so deeply this morning."He looked at her smilingly a moment, and then his face grew gentle and
grave as he replied: "I can scarcely explain, Amy.I am learning that
thoughts which are not clear-cut and definite may make upon us the
strongest impressions.They cause us to feel that there is much that we
only half know and half understand as yet.You and your flowers seemed to
interpret to me the meaning of this day as I never understood it before.Surely its deepest significance is life, happy, hopeful life, with escape
from its grosser elements, and as you stood there you embodied that
idea.""Oh, Webb," she cried, in comic perplexity, "you are getting too deep for
me.I was only arranging flowers, and not thinking about embodying
anything."If you had been, you would have spoiled everything," he resumed,
laughing."I can't explain; I can only suggest the rest in a sentence or
two.Look at the shadow creeping up yonder mountain--very dark blue on
the lower side of the moving line and deep purple above.Well, every day I see and hear and appreciate these
things better, and I thought that you were to blame.""Yes, very much," was his laughing answer."It seems to me that a few
months since I was like the old man with the muck-rake in 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' seeking to gather only money, facts, and knowledge--things of
use.I now am finding so much that is useful which I scarcely looked at
before that I am revising my philosophy, and like it much better.The
simple truth is, I needed just such a sister as you are to keep me from
plodding."Burt now appeared with a handful of rue-anemones, obtained by a rapid
climb to a very sunny nook.They were the first of the season, and he
justly believed that Amy would be delighted with them.But the words of
Webb were more treasured, for they filled her with a pleased wonder.She
had seen the changes herself to which he referred; but how could a simple
girl wield such an influence over the grave, studious man?It was an enigma that she would be long in solving,
and yet the explanation was her own simplicity, her truthfulness to all
the conditions of unaffected girlhood.On the way to the house Webb delighted Johnnie and Alf by gathering
sprays of the cherry, peach, pear, and plum, saying, "Put them in water
by a sunny window, and see which will bloom first, these sprays or the
trees out-of-doors."The supper-table was graced by many woodland
trophies--the "tawny pendants" of the alder that Thoreau said dusted his
coat with sulphur-like pollen as he pressed through them to "look for
mud-turtles," pussy willows now well developed, the hardy ferns, arbutus,
and other harbingers of spring, while the flowers that had been brought
back from the church filled the room with fragrance.Clifford, dwelling as she ever must among the shadows of pain and
disease, this was the happiest day of the year, for it pointed forward to
immortal youth and strength, and she loved to see it decked and garlanded
like a bride.And so Easter passed, and became a happy memory.CHAPTER XXVI

VERY MOODY


The next morning Amy, on looking from her window, could scarcely believe
she was awake.She had retired with her mind full of spring and
spring-time beauty, but the world without had now the aspect of January.The air was one swirl of snow, and trees, buildings--everything was
white.In dismay she hastened to join the family, but was speedily
reassured."There is nothing monotonous in American weather, and you must get used
to our sharp alternations," said Mr."This snow will do good
rather than harm, and the lawn will actually look green after it has
melted, as it will speedily.The thing we dread is a severe frost at a
far later date than this.The buds are still too dormant to be injured,
but I have known the apples to be frozen on the trees when as large as
walnuts.""Such snows are called the poor man's manure," Webb remarked, "and
fertilizing gases, to a certain amount, do become entangled in the large
wet flakes, and so are carried into the soil.But the poor man will
assuredly remain poor if he has no other means of enriching his land.The house on the northeast side looks as if built
of snow, so evenly is it plastered over.They have
scarcely sung this morning, and they look as if thoroughly disgusted."Amy and Johnnie shared in the birds' disapproval, but Alf had a boy's
affinity for snow, and resolved to construct an immense fort as soon as
the storm permitted.Before the day had far declined the heavy flakes
ceased, and the gusty wind died away.Johnnie forgot the budding flowers
in their winding-sheet, and joyously aided in the construction of the
fort.Down the sloping lawn they rolled the snowballs, that so increased
with every revolution that they soon rose above the children's heads, and
Webb and Burt's good-natured help was required to pile them into
ramparts.At the entrance of the stronghold an immense snow sentinel was
fashioned, with a cord-wood stick for a musket.The children fairly
sighed for another month of winter.All night long Nature, in a heavy fall of rain, appeared to weep that she
had been so capricious, and the morning found her in as uncomfortable a
mood as could be imagined.The slush was ankle-deep, with indefinite
degrees of mud beneath, the air chilly and raw, and the sky filled with
great ragged masses of cloud, so opaque and low that they appeared as if
disrupted by some dynamic force, and threatened to fall upon the shadowed
land.But between them the sun darted many a smile at his tear-stained
mistress.At last they took themselves off like ill-affected meddlers in
a love match, and the day grew bright and warm.By evening, spring,
literally and figuratively, had more than regained lost ground, for, as
Mr.Clifford had predicted, the lawn had a distinct emerald hue.Thenceforth the season moved forward as if there were to be no more regrets
and nonsense.An efficient ally in the form of a southwest wind came to the
aid of the sun, and every day Nature responded with increasing favor.Amy
no more complained that an American April was like early March in England;
and as the surface of the land grew warm and dry it was hard for her to
remain in-doors, there was so much of life, bustle, and movement without.Those of the lilac were nearly an inch
long, and emitted a perfume of the rarest delicacy, far superior to that of
the blossoms to come.The nests of the earlier birds were in all stages of
construction, and could be seen readily in the leafless trees.Snakes were
crawling from their holes, and lay sunning themselves in the roads, to her
and Johnnie's dismay.Alf captured turtles that, deep in the mud, had
learned the advent of spring as readily as the creatures of the air."Each rill," as Thoreau wrote, "is
peopled with new life rushing up it."Abram and Alf were planning a
momentous expedition to a tumbling dam on the Moodna, the favorite resort
of the sluggish suckers.New chicks were daily breaking their shells, and
their soft, downy, ball-like little bodies were more to Amy's taste than
the peepers of the marsh.One Saturday morning Alf rushed in, announcing with breathless haste that
"Kitten had a calf."Kitten was a fawn- Alderney, the favorite of
the barnyard, and so gentle that even Johnnie did not fear to rub her
rough nose, scratch her between her horns, or bring her wisps of grass
when she was tied near the house.There was no rest until Amy had seen it, and she admitted that she had
never looked upon a more innocent and droll little visage.At the
children's pleading the infant cow was given to them, but they were
warned to leave it for the present to Abram and Kitten's care, for the
latter was inclined to act like a veritable old cat when any one made too
free with her bovine baby.This bright Saturday occurring about the middle of the month completely
enthroned spring in the children's hearts.The air was sweet with
fragrance from the springing grass and swelling buds, and so still and
humid that sounds from other farms and gardens, and songs from distant
fields and groves, blended softly yet distinctly with those of the
immediate vicinage.The sunshine was warm, but veiled by fleecy clouds;
and as the day advanced every member of the family was out-of-doors, even
to Mrs.Clifford, for whom had been constructed, under her husband's
direction, a low garden-chair which was so light that even Alf or Amy
could draw it easily along the walks.From it she stepped down on her
first visit of the year to her beloved flower-beds, which Alf and Burt
were patting in order for her, the latter blending with, his filial
attentions the hope of seeing more of Amy.Nor was he unrewarded, for his
manner toward his mother, whom he alternately petted and chaffed, while
at the same time doing her bidding with manly tenderness, won the young
girl's hearty good-will.The only drawback was his inclination to pet her
furtively even more.She wished that Webb was preparing the flower-beds,
for then there would be nothing to perplex or worry her.But he, with his
father and Leonard, was more prosaically employed, for they were at work
in the main or vegetable garden.It was with a sense of immense relief
that she heard Mrs.Clifford, after she had given her final directions,
and gloated over the blooming crocuses and daffodils, and the budding
hyacinths and tulips, express a wish to join her husband."I'm your mother's pony to-day," she replied, and hastened away.A wide
path bordered on either side by old-fashioned perennials and shrubbery
led down through the garden.Amy breathed more freely as soon as she
gained it, and at once gave herself up to the enjoyment of the pleasing
sights and sounds on every side.Clifford was the picture of placid
content as he sat on a box in the sun, cutting potatoes into the proper
size for planting.Johnnie was perched on another box near, chattering
incessantly as she handed him the tubers, and asking no other response
than the old gentleman's amused smile.Leonard with a pair of stout
horses was turning up the rich black mould, sinking his plow to the beam,
and going twice in a furrow.It would require a very severe drought to
affect land pulverized thus deeply, for under Leonard's thorough work the
root pasturage was extended downward eighteen inches.On the side of the
plot nearest to the house Webb was breaking the lumps and levelling the
ground with a heavy iron-toothed rake, and also forking deeply the ends
of the furrows that had been trampled by the turning horses.Clifford chatting and laughing with her husband and Johnnie, Amy stood in
the walk opposite to him, and he said presently:

"Come, Amy, you can help me.You said you wanted a finger in our
horticultural pies, and no doubt had in your mind nothing less plebeian
than flower seeds and roses.Will your nose become _retrousse_ if I ask
you to aid me in planting parsnips, oyster-plant, carrots, and--think of
it!--onions?""The idea of my helping you, when the best I can do is to amuse you with
my ignorance!I do not look forward to an
exclusive diet of roses, and am quite curious to know what part I can
have in earning my daily vegetables.""A useful and typical part--that of keeping straight men and things in
general.Wait a little;" and taking up a coiled garden line, he attached
one end of it to a stout stake pressed firmly into the ground.He then
walked rapidly over the levelled soil to the further side of the plot,
drew the line "taut," as the sailors say, and tied it to another stake.He next returned toward Amy, making a shallow drill by drawing a
sharp-pointed hoe along under the line.From a basket near, containing
labelled packages of seeds, he made a selection, and poured into a bowl
something that looked like gunpowder grains, and sowed it rapidly in the
little furrow."Now, Amy," he cried, from the further side of the plot,
"do you see that measuring-stick at your feet?Place one end of it
against the stake to which the line is fastened, and move the stake with
the line forward to the other end of the measuring-stick, just as I am
doing here.You now see how many steps you save me, and how
much faster I can get on.""Are those black-looking grains you are sowing seed?""Indeed they are, as a few weeks may prove to you by more senses than
one.These are the seeds of a vegetable inseparable in its associations
from classic Italy and renowned in sacred story.You may not share in the
longings of the ancient Hebrews, but with its aid I could easily bring
tears of deep feeling to your eyes.""The vegetable is more pungent than your wit, Webb," she laughed; but she
stood near the path at the end of the line, which she moved forward from
time to time as requested, meanwhile enjoying an April day that lacked
few elements of perfection.The garden is one of the favorite haunts of the song-sparrow.In the
flower-border near, Amy would hear such a vigorous scratching among the
leaves that she might well believe that a motherly hen was at work, but
presently one of these little sober-coated creatures that Thoreau well
calls a "ground-bird" would fly to the top of a plum-tree and trill out a
song as sweet as the perfume that came from the blossoming willows not
far away.The busy plows made it a high festival for the robins, for with
a confidence not misplaced they followed near in the furrows that Leonard
was making in the garden, and that Abram was turning on an adjacent
hillside, and not only the comparatively harmless earth-worms suffered,
but also the pestiferous larvae of the May-beetle, the arch-enemy of the
strawberry plant.Even on that day of such varied and etherealized
fragrance, the fresh, wholesome odor of the upturned earth was grateful.Suddenly Webb straightened himself from the sowing of the scale-like
parsnip-seed in which he was then engaged, and said, "Listen."Remote yet
distinct, like a dream of a bird-song, came a simple melody from a
distant field."That's our meadow-lark, Amy; not
equal to your skylark, I admit.Indeed, it is not a lark at all, for Dr.Marvin says it belongs to the oriole family.Brief and simple as is its
song, I think you will agree with me that spring brings few more lovely
sounds.That is the first one that I have heard this year."She scarcely more than caught the ethereal song before Burt and Alf came
down the path, trundling immense wheelbarrow-loads of the prunings of the
shrubbery around the house.These were added to a great pile of brush and
refuse that had accumulated on the other side of the walk, and to Alf was
given the wild excitement of igniting the inflammable mass, and soon
there was a fierce crackling as the flames devoured their way into the
loose dry centre of the rejected debris of the previous year.Then to Alf
and Johnnie's unmeasured delight they were permitted to improvise a
miniature prairie fire.A part of the garden had been left to grow very
weedy in the preceding summer, and they were shown how that by lighting
the dry, dead material on the windward side, the flames, driven by a
gentle western breeze, would sweep across the entire plot, leaving it
bare and blackened, ready for the fertilizers and the plow.With merry
cries they followed the sweeping line of fire, aiding it forward by
catching up on iron rakes burning wisps and transferring them to spots in
the weedy plot that did not kindle readily.Little Ned, clinging to the
hand of Maggie, who had joined the family in the garden, looked on with
awe-struck eyes.From the bonfire and the consuming weeds great volumes
of smoke poured up and floated away, the air was full of pungent odors,
and the robins called vociferously back and forth through the garden,
their alarmed and excited cries vying with the children's shouts.In half
an hour only a faint haze of smoke to the eastward indicated the brief
conflagration; the family had gone to the house for their one-o'clock
dinner, and the birds were content with the normal aspect of the old
garden in April.The promise of the bright spring day was not fulfilled.Cold rains
followed by frosty mornings and high cool winds prevailed with depressing
persistency.It required almost as much vigor, courage, and activity as
had been essential in March to enjoy out-door life.In many of her
aspects Nature appeared almost to stand still and wait for more genial
skies, and yet for those who watched to greet and to welcome, the mighty
impulse of spring manifested itself in many ways.The currant and
gooseberry bushes, as if remembering their original haunts in dim, cold,
boggy forests, put forth their foliage without hesitation.From the
elm-trees swung the little pendent blossoms that precede the leaves.The
lilacs and some other hardy shrubs grew green and fragrant daily.Nothing
daunted, the crocuses, hyacinths, and tulips pushed upward their
succulent leaves with steady resolution.In the woods the flowers had all
kinds of experiences.On the north side of Storm King it was still
winter, with great areas of December's ice unmelted.On the south side of
the mountain, spring almost kept pace with the calendar.The only result
was that the hardy little children of April, on which had hung more
snow-flakes than dew, obtained a longer lease of blooming life, and could
have their share in garlanding the May Queen.They bravely faced the
frosty nights and drenching rains, becoming types of those lives whose
beauty is only enhanced by adversity--of those who make better use of a
little sunny prosperity to bless the world than others on whom good-fortune
ever seems to wait.The last Saturday of the month was looked forward to with hopeful
expectations, as a genial earnest of May, and a chance for out-door
pleasures; but with it came a dismal rain-storm, which left the ground as
cold, wet, and sodden as it had been a month before.The backward season,
of which the whole country was now complaining, culminated on the
following morning, which ushered in a day of remarkable vicissitude.By
rapid transition the rain passed into sleet, then snow, which flurried
down so rapidly that the land grew white and wintry, making it almost
impossible to imagine that two months of spring had passed.the whirling flakes ceased, but a more sullen, leaden, March-like sky
never lowered over a cold, dripping earth.On the north side of the house
a white hyacinth was seen hanging its pendent blossoms half in and half
out of the snow, and Alf, who in response to Dr.Marvin's suggestion was
following some of the family fortunes among the homes in the trees, came
in and said that he had found nests well hidden by a covering all too
cold, with the resolute mother bird protecting her eggs, although
chilled, wet, and shivering herself.the clouds grew thin,
rolled away, and disappeared.The sun broke out with a determined warmth
and power, and the snow vanished like a spectre of the long-past winter.The birds took heart, and their songs of exultation resounded from far
and near.A warm south breeze sprang up and fanned Amy's cheek, as she,
with the children and Burt, went out for their usual Sunday-afternoon
walk.They found the flowers looking up hopefully, but with melted snow
hanging like tears on their pale little faces.The sun at last sank into
the unclouded west, illumining the sky with a warm, golden promise for
the future.Amy gazed at its departing glory, but Burt looked at
her--looked so earnestly, so wistfully, that she was full of compunction
even while she welcomed the return of the children, which delayed the
words that were trembling on his lips.He was ready, she was not; and he
walked homeward at her side silent and depressed, feeling that the
receptive, responsive spring was later in her heart than in Nature.CHAPTER XXVII

SHAD-FISHING BY PROXY


According to the almanac, May was on time to a second, but Nature seemed
unaware of the fact.Great bodies of snow covered the Adirondack region,
and not a little still remained all the way southward through the
Catskills and the Highlands, about the headwaters of the Delaware, and
its cold breath benumbed the land.Johnnie's chosen intimates had given
her their suffrages as May Queen; but prudent Maggie had decided that the
crowning ceremonies should not take place until May truly appeared, with
its warmth and floral wealth.Therefore, on the first Saturday of the
month, Leonard planned a half-holiday, which should not only compensate
the disappointed children, but also give his busy wife a little outing.He had learned that the tide was right for crossing the shallows of the
Moodna Creek, and they would all go fishing.Marvin were invited, and great were the preparations.Reed and
all kinds of poles were taken down from their hooks, or cut in a
neighboring thicket, the country store was depleted of its stock of rusty
hooks, and stray corks were fastened on the brown linen lines for floats.Burt disdained to take his scientific tackle, and indeed there was little
use for it in Moodna Creek, but he joined readily in the frolic.He would
be willing to fish indefinitely for even minnows, if at the same time
there was a chance to angle for Amy.Some preferred to walk to the river,
and with the aid of the family rockaway the entire party were at the
boat-house before the sun had passed much beyond the meridian.Burt, from
his intimate knowledge of the channel, acted as pilot, and was jubilant
over the fact that Amy consented to take an oar with him and receive a
lesson in rowing.Marvin held the tiller-ropes, and the doctor was
to use a pair of oars when requested to do so.Webb and Leonard took
charge of the larger boat, of which Johnnie, as hostess, was captain, and
a jolly group of little boys and girls made the echoes ring, while Ned,
with his thumb in his mouth, clung close to his mother, and regarded the
nautical expedition rather dubiously.They swept across the flats to the
deeper water near Plum Point, and so up the Moodna, whose shores were
becoming green with the rank growth of the bordering marsh.Passing under
an old covered bridge they were soon skirting an island from which rose a
noble grove of trees, whose swollen buds were only waiting for a warmer
caress of the sun to unfold.Returning, they beached their boats below
the bridge, under whose shadow the fish were fond of lying.The little
people were disembarked, and placed at safe distances; for, if near, they
would surely hook each other, if never a fin.Silence was enjoined, and
there was a breathless hush for the space of two minutes; then began
whispers more resonant than those of the stage, followed by acclamations
as Johnnie pulled up a wriggling eel, of which she was in mortal terror.They all had good sport, however, for the smaller fry of the finny tribes
that haunted the vicinity of the old bridge suffered from the well-known
tendency of extreme youth to take everything into its mouth.Indeed, at
that season, an immature sun-fish will take a hook if there is but a
remnant of a worm upon it.The day was good for fishing, since thin
clouds darkened the water.Amy was the heroine of the party, for Burt had
furnished her with a long, light pole, and taught her to throw her line
well away from the others.As a result she soon took, amidst excited
plaudits, several fine yellow perch.At last Leonard shouted:

"You shall not have all the honors, Amy.I have a hook in my pocket that
will catch bigger fish than you have seen to-day.Come, the tide is going
out, and we must go out of the creek with it unless we wish to spend the
night on a sand-bar.I shall now try my luck at shad-fishing over by
Polopel's Island."The prospect of crossing the river and following the drift-nets down into
the Highlands was a glad surprise to all, and they were soon in Newburgh
Bay, whose broad lake-like surface was unruffled by a breath.The sun,
declining toward the west, scattered rose-hues among the clouds.Sloops
and schooners had lost steerage-way, and their sails flapped idly against
the masts.The grind of oars between the thole-pins came distinctly
across the water from far-distant boats, while songs and calls of birds,
faint and etherealized, reached them from the shores.Rowing toward a man
rapidly paying out a net from the stern of his boat they were soon hailed
by Mr.Marks, who with genial good-nature invited them to see the sport.He had begun throwing his net over in the middle of the river, his
oarsman rowing eastward with a slight inclination toward the south, for
the reason that the tide is swifter on the western side.The aim is to
keep the net as straight as possible and at right angles with the tide.Marks on either side, the smooth
water and the absence of wind enabling them to keep near and converse
without effort.Away in their wake bobbed the cork floats in an irregular
line, and from these floats, about twenty feet below the surface, was
suspended the net, which extended down thirty or forty feet further,
being kept in a vertical position by iron rings strung along its lower
edge at regular intervals.Thus the lower side of the net was from fifty
to sixty feet below the surface.In shallow water narrower nets are
rigged to float vertically much nearer the surface.Marks explained
that his net was about half a mile long, adding,

"It's fun fishing on a day like this, but it's rather tough in a gale of
wind, with your eyes half blinded by rain, and the waves breaking into
your boat.Yes, we catch just as many then, perhaps more, for there are
fewer men out, and I suppose the weather is always about the same, except
as to temperature, down where the shad are.The fish don't mind wet
weather; neither must we if we make a business of catching them.""Do you always throw out your net from the west shore toward the east?""No, we usually pay out against the wind.With the wind the boat is apt
to go too fast.The great point is to keep the net straight and not all
tangled and wobbled up.Sometimes a float
will catch on a paddle-wheel, and like enough half of the net will be
torn away.A pilot with any human feeling will usually steer one side,
and give a fellow a chance, and we can often bribe the skipper of
sailing-craft by holding up a shad and throwing it aboard as he tacks
around us.As a rule, however, boats of all kinds pass over a net without
doing any harm.Occasionally a net breaks from the floats and drags on
the bottom.This is covered with cinders thrown out by steamers, and they
play the mischief.""Usually, but they come in on both sides."Marks, how can you catch fish in a net that is straight up and
down?""You'll soon see, but I'll explain.The meshes of the net will stretch
five inches.A shad swims into one of these and then, like many others
that go into things, finds he can't back out, for his gills catch on the
sides of the mesh and there he hangs.Occasionally a shad will just
tangle himself up and so be caught, and sometimes we take a large striped
bass in this way."In answer to a question of Burt's he continued: "I just let my net float
with the tide as you see, giving it a pull from one end or the other now
and then to keep it as straight and as near at right angles with the
river as possible.When the tide stops running out and turns a little we
begin at one end of the net and pull it up, taking out the fish, at the
same time laying it carefully in folds on a platform in the stern-sheets,
so as to prevent any tangles.If the net comes up clear and free, I may
throw it in again and float back with the tide.So far from being able to
depend on this, we often have to go ashore where there is a smooth beach
before our drift is over and disentangle our net.There, now, I'm
through, with paying out.Haven't you noticed the floats bobbing here and
there?""We've been too busy listening and watching you," said Leonard.If you see one bob under and wobble, a shad
has struck the net near it, and I can go and take him out.In smooth
water it's like fishing with one of your little cork bobblers there on
your lines.I'll give the shad to the first one that sees a float bob
under."Alf nearly sprang out of the boat as he pointed and shouted, "There,
there."Laughing good-naturedly, Mr.Marks lifted the net beneath the float, and,
sure enough, there was a great roe-shad hanging by his gills, and Alf
gloated over his supper, already secured.The fish were running well, and there were excited calls and frantic
pointings, in which at first even the older members of the party joined,
and every few moments a writhing shad flashed in the slanting rays as it
was tossed into the boat.Up and down the long, irregular line of floats
the boats passed and repassed until excitement verged toward satiety, and
the sun, near the horizon, with a cloud canopy of crimson and gold,
warned the merry fishers by proxy that their boats should be turned
homeward.Leonard pulled out what he termed his silver hook, and supplied
not only the Clifford family, but all of Johnnie's guests, with fish so
fresh that they had as yet scarcely realized that they were out of water."Now, Amy," said Burt, "keep stroke with me," adding, in a whisper, "no
fear but that we can pull well together."Her response was, "One always associates a song with rowing.Come, strike
up, and let us keep the boats abreast that all may join."He, well content, started a familiar boating song, to which the splash of
their oars made musical accompaniment.A passing steamer saluted them,
and a moment later the boats rose gracefully over the swells.The glassy
river flashed back the crimson of the clouds, the eastern <DW72>s of the
mountains donned their royal purple, the intervening shadows of valleys
making the folds of their robes.As they approached the shore the
resonant song of the robins blended with the human voices.Burt, however,
heard only Amy's girlish soprano, and saw but the pearl of her teeth
through her parted lips, the rose in her cheeks, and the snow of her
neck.Final words were spoken and all were soon at home.Maggie took the
household helm with a fresh and vigorous grasp.The maids never dawdled when she directed, and by the time
the hungry fishermen were ready, the shad that two hours before had been
swimming deep in the Hudson lay browned to a turn on the ample platter."It is this quick transition that gives to game fish their most exquisite
flavor," Burt remarked."Are shad put down among the game fish?""Yes; they were included not very long ago, and most justly, too, as I
can testify to-night.I never tasted anything more delicious, except
trout.If a shad were not so bony it would be almost perfection when
eaten under the right conditions.Not many on the Hudson are aware of the
fact, perhaps, but angling for them is fine sport in some rivers.They
will take a fly in the Connecticut and Housatonic; but angle-worms and
other bait are employed in the Delaware and Southern rivers.The best
time to catch them is early in the morning, and from six to eight in the
evening.At dusk one may cast for them in still water, as for trout.The
Hudson is too big, I suppose, and the water too deep, although I see no
reason why the young fry should not be caught in our river as well as in
the Delaware.I have read of their biting voraciously in September at a
short distance above Philadelphia.""Do you mean to say that our rivers are full of shad in August and
September?""Yes; that is, of young shad on the way to the sea.The females that are
running up now will spawn in the upper and shallow waters of the river,
and return to the ocean by the end of June, and in the autumn the small
fry will also go to the sea, the females to remain there two years.The
males will come back next spring, and these young males are called
'chicken shad' on the Connecticut.Multitudes of these half-grown fish
are taken in seines, and sold as herrings or 'alewives'; for the true
herring does not run up into fresh water.Young shad are said to have
teeth, and they live largely on insects, while the full-grown fish have
no teeth, and feed chiefly on animalcules that form the greater part of
the slimy growths that cover nearly everything that is long under water.""Well, I never had so much shad before in my life," said his father,
laughing, and pushing lack his chair; "and, Burt, I have enjoyed those
you have served up in the water almost as much as those dished under
Maggie's superintendence.""I should suppose that the present mode of fishing with drift-nets was
cheaper and more profitable than the old method of suspending the nets
between poles," Leonard remarked."It is indeed," Burt continued, vivaciously, for he observed that Amy was
listening with interest."Poles, too, form a serious obstruction.Once,
years ago, I was standing near the guards of a steamboat, when I heard
the most awful grating, rasping sound, and a moment later a shad-pole
gyrated past me with force enough to brain an elephant had it struck him.It was good fun, though, in old times to go out and see them raise the
nets, for they often came up heavy with fish.Strange to say, a loon was
once pulled up with the shad.Driven by fear, it must have dived so
vigorously as to entangle itself, for there it hung with its head and one
leg fast.I suppose that the last moment of consciousness that the poor
bird had was one of strong surprise."CHAPTER XXVIII

MAY AND GIRLHOOD


May came in reality the following morning.Perhaps she thought that the
leisure of Sunday would secure her a more appreciative welcome.The wind
no longer blew from the chill and still snowy North, but from lands that
had long since responded to the sun's genial power.Therefore, the breeze
that came and went fitfully was like a warm, fragrant breath, and truly
it seemed to breathe life and beauty into all things.During the morning
hours the cluster buds of the cherry burst their varnished-looking
sheath, revealing one-third of the little green stems on which the
blossoms would soon appear.The currant-bushes were hanging out their
lengthening racemes, and the hum of many bees proved that honey may be
gathered even from gooseberry-bushes, thus suggesting a genial philosophy.The sugar-maples were beginning to unfold their leaves and to dangle their
emerald gold flowers from long, drooping pedicles.Few objects have more
exquisite and delicate beauty than this inflorescence when lighted up by
the low afternoon sun.The meadows and oat fields were passing into a vivid
green, and the hardy rye had pushed on so resolutely in all weathers, that
it was becoming billowy under the wind.All through the week the hues of
life and beauty became more and more apparent upon the face of Nature, and
by the following Saturday May had provided everything in perfection for
Johnnie's coronation ceremonies.For weeks past there had been distinguished arrivals from the South
almost daily.Some of these songsters, like the fox-sparrow, sojourned a
few weeks, favoring all listeners with their sweet and simple melodies;
but the chief musician of the American forests, the hermit thrush, passed
silently, and would not deign to utter a note of his unrivalled minstrelsy
until he had reached his remote haunts at the North.Marvin evidently
had a grudge against this shy, distant bird, and often complained, "Why
can't he give us a song or two as he lingers here in his journey?I often
see him flitting about in the mountains, and have watched him by the hour
with the curiosity that prompts one to look at a great soprano or tenor,
hoping that he might indulge me with a brief song as a sample of what he
could do, but he was always royally indifferent and reserved.I am going to
the Adirondacks on purpose to hear him some day.There's the winter wren,
too-saucy, inquisitive little imp!--he was here all winter, and has left us
without vouchsafing a note.But, then, great singers are a law unto
themselves the world over."But the doctor had small cause for complaint, for there are few regions
more richly endowed with birds than the valley of the Hudson.As has been
seen, it is the winter resort of not a few, and is, moreover, a great
highway of migration, for birds are ever prone to follow the watercourses
that run north and south.The region also affords so wide a choice of
locality and condition that the tastes of very many birds are suited.There are numerous gardens and a profusion of fruit for those that are
half domesticated; orchards abounding in old trees with knotholes,
admirably fitted for summer homes; elms on which to hang the graceful
pensile nests--"castles in air," as Burroughs calls them; meadows in
which the lark, vesper sparrow, and bobolink can disport; and forests
stretching up into the mountains, wherein the shyest birds can enjoy all
the seclusion they desire, content to sing unheard, as the flowers around
them bloom unseen, except by those who love them well enough to seek them
in their remotest haunts.The week which preceded the May party was a memorable one to Amy, for
during its sunny days she saw an American spring in its perfection.Each
morning brought rich surprises to her, Johnnie, and Alf, and to Webb an
increasing wonder that he had never before truly seen the world in which
he lived.The pent-up forces of Nature, long restrained, seemed finding
new expression every hour.Tulips opened their gaudy chalices to catch
the morning dew.Massive spikes of hyacinths distilled a rich perfume
that was none too sweet in the open air.Whenever Amy stepped from the
door it seemed that some new flower had opened and some new development
of greenery and beauty had been revealed.But the crowning glory in the
near landscape were the fruit trees.The cherry boughs grew white every
day, and were closely followed by the plum and pear and the pink-hued
peach blossoms.Even Squire Bartley's unattractive place was transformed
for a time into fairyland; but he, poor man, saw not the blossoms, and
the birds and boys stole his fruit.Amy wondered at the wealth of flowers
that made many of the trees as white as they had been on the snowiest day
of winter, and Johnnie revelled in them, often climbing up into some
low-branched tree, that she might bury herself in their beauty, and
inhale their fragrance in long breaths of delight.The bees that filled
the air about her with their busy hum never molested her, believing, no
doubt, that she had as good a right as themselves to enjoy the sweets in
her way.Clifford, perhaps, who obtained the
profoundest enjoyment from the season.Seated by her window or in a sunny
corner of the piazza, she would watch the unfolding buds as if she were
listening to some sweet old story that had grown dearer with every
repetition.Indeed, this was true, for with the blossoms of every year
were interwoven the memories of a long life, and their associations had
scarcely ever been more to her heart than the new ones now forming.She
often saw, with her children and grandchildren, the form of a tall girl
passing to and fro, and to her loving eyes Amy seemed to be the fairest
and sweetest flower of this gala period.She, and indeed they all, had
observed Burt's strongly manifested preference, but, with innate
refinement and good sense, there had been a tacit agreement to appear
blind.The orphan girl should not be annoyed by even the most delicate
raillery, but the old lady and her husband could not but feel the deepest
satisfaction that Bart was making so wise a choice.They liked Amy all
the better because she was so little disposed to sentiment, and proved
that she was not to be won easily.But they all failed to understand her, and gave her credit for a maturity
that she did not possess.In her happy, healthful country life the
girlish form that had seemed so fragile when she first came to them was
taking on the rounded lines of womanhood.Why should she not be wooed
like other girls at her age?Burt was further astray than any one else,
and was even inclined to complain mentally that her nature was cold and
unresponsive.And yet her very reserve and elusiveness increased his
passion, which daily acquired a stronger mastery.Webb alone half guessed
the truth in regard to her.As time passed, and he saw the increasing
evidences of Burt's feeling, he was careful that his manner should be
strictly fraternal toward Amy, for his impetuous brother was not always
disposed to be reasonable even in his normal condition, and now he was
afflicted with a malady that has often brought to shame the wisdom of the
wisest.The elder brother saw how easily Burt's jealousy could be
aroused, and therefore denied himself many an hour of the young girl's
society, although it caused him a strange little heartache to do so.But
he was very observant, for Amy was becoming a deeply interesting study.He saw and appreciated her delicate fence with Burt, in which tact,
kindness, and a little girlish brusqueness were almost equally blended.Was it the natural coyness of a high-spirited girl, who could be won only
by long and patient effort?or was it an instinctive self-defence from a
suit that she could not repulse decisively without giving pain to those
she loved?Their home-life, even at that busy
season, gave him opportunities to see her often, and glimmerings of the
truth began to dawn upon him.He saw that she enjoyed the society of Alf
and Johnnie almost as much as that of the other members of the family,
that her delight at every new manifestation of spring was as unforced as
that of the children, while at the same time it was an intelligent and
questioning interest.The beauty of the world without impressed her
deeply, as it did Johnnie, but to the latter it was a matter of course,
while to Amy it was becoming an inviting mystery.The little girl would
bring some new flower from the woods or garden, the first of the season,
in contented triumph, but to Amy the flower had a stronger interest.It
represented something unknown, a phase of life which it was the impulse
of her developing mind to explore.Her botany was not altogether
satisfactory, for analysis and classification do not reveal to us a
flower or plant any more than the mention of a name and family connection
makes known individual character.Her love for natural objects was too
real to be satisfied with a few scientific facts about them.If a plant,
tree, or bird, interested her she would look at it with a loving,
lingering glance until she felt that she was learning to know it somewhat
as she would recognize a friend.The rapid changes which each day brought
were like new chapters in a story, or new verses in a poem.She watched
with admiring wonder the transition of buds into blossoms; and their
changes of form and color.She shared in Alf's excitement over the
arrival of every new bird from the South, and, having a good ear for
music, found absorbing pleasure in learning and estimating the quality
and characteristics of their various songs.Their little oddities
appealed to her sense of humor.A pair of cat-birds that had begun their
nest near the house received from her more ridicule than admiration."They seem to be regular society birds and gossips," she said, "and I can
never step out-of-doors but I feel that they are watching me, and trying
to attract my attention.They have a pretty song, but they seem to have
learned it by heart, and as soon as they are through they make that
horrid noise, as if in their own natural tone they were saying something
disagreeable about you."But on the morning of Johnnie's coronation she was wakened by songs as
entrancing as they were unfamiliar.Running to the window, she saw
darting through the trees birds of such a brilliant flame color that they
seemed direct from the tropics, and their notes were almost as varied as
their colors.She speedily ceased to heed them, however, for from the
edge of the nearest grove came a melody so ethereal and sustained that it
thrilled her with the delight that one experiences when some great singer
lifts up her voice with a power and sweetness that we feel to be divine.At the same moment she saw Alf running toward the house.Seeing her at
the window, he shouted, "Amy, the orioles and the wood-thrushes--the
finest birds of the year--have come.Hurry up and go with me to the grove
yonder."Soon after Webb, returning from a distant field to breakfast, met her
near the grove.She was almost as breathless and excited as the boy, and
passed him with a bright hurried smile, while she pressed on after her
guide with noiseless steps lest the shy songster should be frightened.He
looked after her and listened, feeling that eye and ear could ask for no
fuller enchantment.At last she came back to him with the fresh loveliness
of the morning in her face, and exclaimed, "I have seen an ideal bird, and
he wears his plumage like a quiet-toned elegant costume that simply
suggests a perfect form.He was superbly indifferent, and scarcely looked
at us until we came too near, and then, with a reserved dignity, flew away.He is the true poet of the woods, and would sing just as sweetly if there
was never a listener."Yes, he is a poet, and your true
aristocrat, who commands admiration without seeking it," Webb replied."I am sure he justifies all your praises, past and present.Oh, isn't the
morning lovely--so fresh, dewy, and fragrant?and the world looks so
young and glad!""You also look young and glad this morning, Amy."This May beauty makes me feel as young as Alf," she
replied, placing her hand on the boy's shoulder.Her face was flushed with exercise; her step buoyant; her eyes were
roaming over the landscape tinted with fruit blossoms and the expanding
foliage.Webb saw in what deep accord her spirit was with the season, and
he thought, "She _is_ young--in the very May of her life.She is scarcely
more ready for the words that Burt would speak than little Johnnie.I
wish he would wait till the girl becomes a woman;" and then for some
reason he sighed deeply.Amy gave him an arch look, and said:

"Then came from the depths, Webb.What secret sorrow can you have on a
day like this?"Oh, isn't it
beautiful?--almost equal to the thrush's song.He seems to sing as if
his notes were written for him in couplets."She spoke at intervals,
looking toward the grove they had just left, and when the bird paused
Webb replied:

"That is the wood-thrush's own cousin, and a distinguished member of the
thrush family, the brown-thrasher.Well, Johnnie," he added, to the
little girl who had come to meet them, "you are honored to-day.Three of
our most noted minstrels have arrived just in time to furnish music for
the May Queen."But Johnnie was not surprised, only pleased, as Webb and others
congratulated her.She would be queen that day with scarcely more
self-consciousness than one of the flowers that decked her.It was the
occasion, the carnival of spring, that occupied her thoughts, and, since
the fairest blossoms of the season were to be gathered, why should not
the finest birds be present also?Feeling that he had lost an opportunity in the improvised festival of the
maple-sugar grove, Burt resolved to make the most of this occasion, and
he had the wisdom to decide upon a course that relieved Amy of not a
little foreboding.He determined to show his devotion by thoughtful
considerateness, by making the day so charming and satisfactory as to
prove that he could be a companion after her own heart.And he succeeded
fairly well for a time, only the girl's intuition divined his motive and
guessed his sentiments.She was ever in fear that his restraint would
give way.And yet she felt that she ought to reward him for what she
mentally termed his "sensible behavior" and indicate that such should be
his course in the future.In
spite of all the accumulated beauty of the season the day was less
bright, less full of the restful, happy _abandon_ of the previous one in
March, when Webb had been her undemonstrative attendant.He, with
Leonard, at that busy period found time to look in upon the revellers in
the woods but once.Clifford spent more time with them, but the old
gentleman was governed by his habit of promptness, and the time called
for despatch.For the children, however, it was a revel that left nothing to be
desired.They had decided that it should be a congress of flowers, from
the earliest that had bloomed to those now opening in the sunniest
haunts.Alf, with one or two other adventurous boys, had climbed the
northern face of old Storm King, and brought away the last hepaticas,
fragrant clusters of arbutus, and dicentras, for "pattykers, arbuties,
and Dutcher's breeches," as Ned called them, were favorites that could
not be spared.On a sunny <DW72> dogwood, well advanced, was found.There
were banks white with the rue-anemone, and they were marked, that some of
the little tuber-like roots might be taken up in the fall for forcing in
the house.Myriads of violets gave a purple tinge to parts of a low
meadow near, and chubby hands were stained with the last of the star-like
bloodroot blossoms, many of which dropped white petals on their way to
Johnnie's throne.Some brought handfuls of columbine from rocky nooks,
and others the purple trillium, that is near of kin to Burroughs's white
"wake-robin."There were so many Jacks-in-the-pulpit that one might fear
a controversy, but the innumerable dandelions and dogtooth violets which
carpeted the ground around the throne diffused so mellow a light that all
the blossoms felt that they looked well and were amiable.But it would
require pages even to mention all the flowers that were brought from
gardens, orchards, meadows, groves, and rugged mountain <DW72>s.Each
delegation of blossoms and young tinted foliage was received by Amy, as
mistress of ceremonies, and arranged in harmonious positions; while
Johnnie, quite forgetful of her royalty, was as ready to help at anything
as the humblest maid of honor.All the flowers were treated tenderly
except the poor purple violets, and these were slaughtered by hundreds,
for the projecting spur under the curved stem at the base of the flower
enabled the boys to hook them together, and "fight roosters," as they
termed it.Now and then some tough-stemmed violet would "hook-off" a
dozen blue heads before losing its own, and it became the temporary hero.At last the little queen asserted her power by saying, with a sudden
flash in her dark blue eyes, that she "wouldn't have any more fighting
roosters.By one o'clock the queen had been crowned, the lunch had met the capacity
of even the boys, and the children, circling round the throne, were
singing: "Oats, peas, beans, and barley grows," and kindred rhymes, their
voices rising and falling with the breeze, the birds warbling an
accompaniment.Webb and Leonard, at work in a field not far away, often
paused to listen, the former never failing to catch Amy's clear notes as
she sat on a rock, the gentle power behind the throne, that had maintained
peace and good-will among all the little fractious subjects.The day had grown almost sultry, and early in the afternoon there was a
distant jar of thunder.Burt, who from a bed of dry leaves had been
watching Amy, started up and saw that there was an ominous cloud in the
west.She agreed with him that it would be prudent to return at once, for
she was growing weary and depressed.Burt, with all his effort to be
quietly and unobtrusively devoted, had never permitted her to become
unconscious of his presence and feeling.Therefore her experience had
been a divided one.She could not abandon herself to her hearty sympathy
with the children and their pleasure, for he, by manner at least, ever
insisted that she was a young lady, and the object of thoughts all too
warm.Her nature was so fine that it was wounded and annoyed by an
unwelcome admiration.She did not wish to think about it, but was not
permitted to forget it.She had been genial, merry, yet guarded toward
him all day, and now had begun to long for the rest and refuge of her own
room.He felt that he had not made progress, and was also depressed, and
he showed this so plainly on their way home that she was still more
perplexed and troubled."If he would only be sensible, and treat me as
Webb does!"she exclaimed, as she threw herself on the lounge in her
room, exhausted rather than exhilarated by the experience of the day.CHAPTER XXIX NATURE'S WORKSHOP


During the hour she slept an ideal shower crossed the sky.In the lower
strata of air there was scarcely any wind, and the rain came down
vertically, copiously, and without beating violence.The sun-warmed earth
took in every drop like a great sponge.Beyond the first muttered warning to the little May party in the grove
there was no thunder.The patter of the rain was a gentle lullaby to Amy,
and at last she was wakened by a ray of sunlight playing upon her face,
yet she still heard the soft fall of rain.With the elasticity of youth,
she sprang up, feeling that the other cloud that had shadowed her
thoughts might soon pass also.As she went singing down the stairway,
Webb called from the front door: "Amy, look here!The cloud still hung heavily over the eastern
mountains, while against it was a magnificent arch, and so distinctly
defined that its feet appeared to rest on the two banks of the river.They watched it in silence until it faded away, and the whole scene,
crowned with flowers and opening foliage tinted like blossoms of varied
hues, was gemmed with crystals by the now unclouded sun, for the soft
rain had clung to everything, from the loftiest tree-top to the tiniest
spire of grass.Flame-like orioles were flashing through the perfumed
air.Robins, with their heads lifted heavenward, were singing as
rapturously as if they were saints rather than rollicking gormandizers.Every bird that had a voice was lifting it up in thanksgiving, but clear,
sweet, and distinct above them all came the notes of the wood-thrush,
with his Beethoven-like melody."Have you no words for a scene like this, Webb?"My wonder
exceeds even my admiration, for the greater part of this infinite variety
of beauty is created out of so few materials and by so simple yet
mysterious a method that I can scarcely believe it, although I see it and
know it.Men have always agreed to worship the genius which could achieve
the most with the least.And yet the basis of nearly all we see is a
microscopic cell endowed with essential powers.That large apple-tree
yonder, whose buds are becoming so pink, started from one of these minute
cells, and all the growth, beauty, and fruitfulness since attained were
the result of the power of this one cell to add to itself myriads of like
cells, which form the whole structure.It is cell adding cells that is
transforming the world around us."He spoke earnestly, and almost as if
he were thinking aloud, and he looked like one in the presence of a
mystery that awed him.The hue of Amy's eyes deepened, and her face
flushed in her quickened interest.Her own mind had been turning to
kindred thoughts and questionings.She had passed beyond the period when
a mind like hers could be satisfied with the mere surface of things, and
Webb's direct approach to the very foundation principles of what she saw
sent a thrill through all her nerves as an heroic deed would have done."Can you not show me one of those cells with your microscope?""Yes, easily, and some of its contents through the cell's transparent
walls, as, for instance, the minute grains of _chlorophyll_, that is, the
green of leaves.All the hues of foliage and flowers are caused by what
the cells contain, and these, to a certain extent, can be seen and
analyzed.But there is one thing within the cell which I cannot show you,
and which has never been seen, and yet it accounts for everything, and is
the architect of all--life.When we reach the cell we are at the
threshold of this mysterious presence.We can
see its work, for its workshop is under our eye, and in this minute shop
it is building all the vegetation of the world, but the artisan itself
ever remains invisible.""Ah, Webb, do not say artisan, but rather artist.Does not the beauty all
around us prove it?Surely there is but one explanation, the one papa
taught me: it is the power of God.He is in the little as well as in the
great."Well, Amy," he replied, smilingly, "the faith taught you by your father
is, to my mind, more rational than any of the explanations that I have
read, and I have studied several.But then I know little, indeed,
compared with multitudes of others.I am sure, however, that the life of
God is in some way the source of all the life we see.But perplexing
questions arise on every side.Much of life is so repulsive and noxious--
But there!what a fog-bank I am leading you into this crystal May
evening!Most young girls would vote me an insufferable bore should I
talk to them in this style.""So much the worse for the young girls then.I should think they would
feel that no compliment could exceed that of being talked to as if they
had brains.But I do not wish to put on learned airs.You know how
ignorant I am of even the beginnings of this knowledge.All that I can
say is that I am not content to be ignorant.The curiosity of Mother Eve
is growing stronger every day; and is it strange that it should turn
toward the objects, so beautiful and yet so mysterious, that meet my eyes
on every side?""No," said he, musingly, "the strange thing is that people have so little
curiosity in regard to their surroundings.Why, multitudes of intelligent
persons are almost as indifferent as the cattle that browse around among
the trees and flowers.I once used to
investigate things, but did not see them.I have thought about it very
much this spring.It is said that great painters and sculptors study
anatomy as well as outward form.Perhaps here is a good hint for those
who are trying to appreciate nature.I am not so shallow as to imagine
that I can ever understand nature any more than I can you with your
direct, honest gaze.So to the thoughtful mystery is ever close at hand,
but it seems no little thing to trace back what one sees as far as one
can, and you have made me feel that it is a great thing to see the Divine
Artist's finished work."They were now joined by others, and the perfect beauty of the evening as
it slowly faded into night attracted much attention from all the family.The new moon hung in the afterglow of the western sky, and as the dusk
deepened the weird notes of the whip-poor-will were heard for the first
time from the mountain-sides.At the supper-table Leonard beamed on every one."A rain like this, after
a week of sunshine has warmed the earth" he exclaimed, "is worth millions
to the country."Yes," added his father, "the old Indian sign, the unfolding of the oak
leaves, indicates that it is now safe to plant.After long years of observation I am satisfied that the true secret
of success in farming is the doing of everything at just the right time.Crops put in too early or too late often partially fail; but if the right
conditions are complied with from the beginning, they start with a vigor
which is not lost until maturity."Burt indulged in a gayety that was phenomenal even for him, but after
supper he disappeared.Amy retired to her room early, but she sat a long
time at her window and looked out into the warm, fragrant night.She had
forgotten poor Burt, who was thinking of her, as in his unrest he rode
mile after mile, holding his spirited horse down to a walk.She had
almost forgotten Webb, but she thought deeply of his words, of the life
that was working all around her so silently and yet so powerfully.Unseen
it had created the beauty she had enjoyed that day.From the very
contrast of ideas it made her think of death, of her father, who once had
been so strong and full of life.The mystery of one seemed as great as
that of the other, and a loneliness such as she had not felt before for
months depressed her."I wish I could talk to Webb again," she thought."He says he does not
understand me.It would seem
that when one began to think nothing that appeared simple before is
understood; but his words are strong and assured.He leads one to the
boundaries of the known, and then says, quietly, we can go no further;
but he makes you feel that what is beyond is all right.Oh, I wish Burt
was like him!"CHAPTER XXX

SPRING-TIME PASSION


But little chance had Amy to talk with Webb for the next few days.He had
seen the cloud on Burt's brow, and had observed that he was suspicious,
unhappy, and irritable; that reason and good sense were not in the
ascendant; and he understood his brother sufficiently well to believe
that his attack must run its natural course, as like fevers had done
before.From what he had seen he also thought that Amy could deal with
Burt better than any one else, for although high-strung, he was also
manly and generous when once he got his bearings.In his present mood he
would bitterly resent interference from any one, but would be bound to
obey Amy and to respect her wishes.Therefore he took especial pains to
be most kindly, but also to appear busy and pre-occupied.It must not be thought that Burt was offensive or even openly obtrusive
in his attentions.He was far too well-bred for that.There was nothing
for which even his mother could reprove him, or of which Amy herself
could complain.It was the suit itself from which she shrank, or rather
which she would put off indefinitely.But Burt was not disposed to put
anything that he craved into the distance.Spring-tide impulses were in
his veins, and his heart was so overcharged that it must find expression.A long, exquisite day had merged into
a moonlight evening.The apple-blossoms were in all their white-and-pink
glory, and filled the summer-like air with a fragrance as delicate as
that of the arbutus.The petals of the cherry were floating down like
snow in every passing breeze, glimmering momentarily in the pale
radiance.The night was growing so beautiful that Amy was tempted to
stroll out in the grounds, and soon she yielded to a fancy to see the
effect of moonlight through an apple-tree that towered like a mound of
snow at some little distance from the house.She would not have been
human had the witchery of the May evening been without its influence.If
Burt could have understood her, this was his opportunity.If he had come
with step and tone that accorded with the quiet evening, and simply said,
"Amy, you know--you have seen that I love you; what hope can you give
me?"she in her present mood would have answered him as gently and
frankly as a child.She might have laughingly pointed him to the tree,
and said: "See, it is in blossom now.It will be a long time before you
pick the apples.If you will be sensible, and treat me as
you would Johnnie, were she older, I will ride and walk with you, and be
as nice to you as I can."But this Burt could not do and still remain Burt.He was like an
overcharged cloud, and when he spoke at last his words seemed to the
sensitive girl to have the vividness and abruptness of the lightning.It
was her custom to make a special toilet for the evening, and when she had
come down to supper with a rose in her hair, and dressed in some light
clinging fabric, she had proved so attractive to the young fellow that he
felt that the limit of his restraint was reached.He would appeal to her
so earnestly, so passionately, as to kindle her cold nature.In his lack
of appreciation of Amy he had come to deem this his true course, and she
unconsciously enabled him to carry out the rash plan.He had seen her
stroll away, and had followed her until she should be so far from the
house that she must listen.As she emerged from under the apple-tree,
through which as a white cloud she had been looking at the moon, he
appeared so suddenly as to startle her, and without any gentle reassurance
he seized her hand, and poured out his feelings in a way that at first
wounded and frightened her."Burt," she cried, "why do you speak to me so?Can't you see that I do
not feel as you do?I've given you no reason to say such words to me."Are you as cold and elusive as this moonlight?I
have waited patiently, and now I must and will speak.Every man has a
right to speak and a right to an answer.""Well then," she replied, her spirit rising; "if you will insist on my
being a woman instead of a young girl just coming from the shadow of a
great sorrow, I also have my rights.I've tried to show you gently and
with all the tact I possessed that I did not want to think about such
things.I'm just at the beginning of my girlhood and I want to be a young
girl as long as I can and not an engaged young woman.No matter who spoke
the words you have said, they would pain me.Why couldn't you see this
from my manner and save both yourself and me from this scene?I'll gladly
be your loving sister, but you must not speak to me in this way again.""You refuse me then," he said, throwing back his head haughtily.I simply tell you that I won't listen to such words from
any one.Why can't you be sensible and understand me?I no more wish to
talk about such things than do Alf and Johnnie.""I do understand you," he exclaimed, passionately, "and better perhaps
than you understand yourself.You are a woman, but
you seem to lack a woman's heart, as far as I am concerned;" and with a
gesture that was very tragic and despairing he strode away.She was deeply troubled and incensed also, and she returned to the house
with drooping head and fast-falling tears."Why, Amy, what is the matter?"Looking up, she saw Webb coming down the
piazza steps.Yielding to her impulse, she sprang forward and took his
arm, as she said:

"Webb, you have always acted toward me like a brother.is it unnatural in me that I do not wish to hear
such words as Burt would speak to-night?All I ask is that he will let me
stay a happy young girl till I am ready for something else.This is no
way for a flower to bloom"--she snatched the rose from her hair, and
pushed open the red petals--"and yet Burt expects me to respond at once
to feelings that I do not even understand.If it's best in the future--but
surely I've a right to my freedom for a long time yet.Tell me, do you
think I'm unnatural?""No, Amy," he answered, gently."It is because you are so perfectly
natural, so true to your girlhood, that you feel as you do.In that
little parable of the rose you explain yourself fully.You have no cause
for self-reproach, nor has Burt for complaint.You say you do not understand me, and yet always prove that
you do.If Burt would only treat me as you do, I should be perfectly
happy.""Well, Burt's good-hearted, but sometimes he mislays his judgment," said
Webb, laughing.There is no occasion for any high
tragedy on his part or for grieving on yours.You go and tell mother all
about it, and just how you feel.She is the right one to manage this
affair, and her influence over Burt is almost unbounded.Do this, and,
take my word for it, all will soon be serene."Amy felt that night what it is to have a mother's
boundless love and sympathy, and she went to her rest comforted, soothed,
and more assured as to the future than she had been for a long time."How
quiet and sensible Webb was about it all!"was her last smiling thought
before she slept.His thought as he strolled away in the moonlight after
she left him was, "It is just as if I half believed.She has the mind of
a woman, but the heart of a child.Burt did not stroll; he strode mile after mile, and the uncomfortable
feeling that he had been very unwise, to say the least, and perhaps very
unjust, was growing upon him.When at last he returned, his mother called
to him through the open door.Clifford always
obtained the confidence of her children, and they ever found that it was
sacred.All that can be said, therefore, was, that he came from her
presence penitent, ashamed, and hopeful.His mood may best be explained,
perhaps, by a note written before he retired."My dear sister Amy," it
ran, "I wish to ask your pardon.I was
so blinded and engrossed by my own feelings that I did not understand
you.I have proved myself unworthy of even a sister's love; but I will
try to make amends.Do not judge me harshly because I was so headlong.There is no use in trying to disguise the truth.What I have said so
unwisely and prematurely I cannot unsay, and I shall always be true to my
words.But I will wait patiently as long as you please; and if you find,
in future years, that you cannot feel as I do, I will not complain or
blame you, however sad the truth may be to me.In the meantime, let there
be no constraint between us.Let me become once more your trusted brother
Burt."This note he pushed under her door, and then slept too soundly for
the blighted youth he had a few hours before deemed himself.He felt a little embarrassed at the prospect of meeting her the next
morning, but she broke the ice at once by coming to him on the piazza and
extending her hand in smiling frankness as she said: "You are neither
unjust nor ungenerous, Burt, or you would not have written me such a
note.As you said the first evening I came, we
shall have jolly times together."The young fellow was immensely relieved and grateful, and he showed it.Soon afterward he went about the affairs of the day happier than he had
been for a long time.Indeed, it soon became evident that his explosion
on the previous evening had cleared the air generally.Amy felt that the
one threatening cloud had sunk below the horizon.As the days passed, and
Burt proved that he could keep his promise, her thoughts grew as serene
as those of Johnnie.Her household duties were not very many, and yet she
did certain things regularly.The old people found that she rarely forgot
them, and she had the grace to see when she could help and cheer.Attentions that must be constantly asked for have little charm.A day
rarely passed that did she not give one or more of its best hours to her
music and drawing; for, while she never expected to excel in these arts,
she had already learned that they would enable her to give much pleasure
to others.Her pencil, also, was of great assistance in her study of
out-door life, for the fixed attention which it required to draw a plant,
tree, or bit of scenery revealed its characteristics.She had been even
more interested in the unfolding of the leaf-buds than in the flowering
of the trees, and the gradual advance of the foliage, like a tinted
cloud, up the mountain-<DW72>s, was something she never tired of watching.When she spoke of this one day to Webb, he replied:

"I have often wondered that more is not said and written about our spring
foliage, before it passes into its general hue of green.To me it has a
more delicate beauty and charm than anything seen in October.Different
trees have their distinct coloring now as then, but it is evanescent, and
the shades usually are less clearly marked.This very fact, however,
teaches the eye to have a nicety of distinction that is pleasing."The blossoms faded from the trees, and
the miniature fruit was soon apparent.The strawberry rows, that had been
like lines of snow, were now full of little promising cones.The grass
grew so lusty and strong that the dandelions were hidden except as the
breeze caught up the winged seeds that the tuneful yellow-birds often
seized in the air.The rye had almost reached its height, and Johnnie
said it was "as good as going to the ocean to see it wave."At last the
swelling buds on the rose-bushes proclaimed the advent of June.CHAPTER XXXI

JUNE AND HONEY-BEES


It is said that there is no heaven anywhere for those incapable of
recognizing and enjoying it.Be this as it may, the month of June is a
segment of heaven annually bestowed on those whose eyes and ears have been
opened to beauty in sight and sound.Indeed, what sense in man is not
gratified to the point of imaginary perfection during this early fruition
of the varied promise of spring?Even to the sense of touch, how exquisite
is the "feel" of the fragrant rose-petals, the soft young foliage that has
transformed the world, and the queer downy fledglings in innumerable nests!To the eye informed by a heart in love with nature the longest days of the
year are all too short to note half that exists and takes place.Who sees
and distinguishes the varied blossoming of the many kinds of grain and
grasses that are waving in every field?And yet here is a beauty as
distinct and delicate as can be found in some of Mendelssohn's "Songs
without Words"--blossomings so odd, delicate, and evanescent as to suggest
a child's dream of a flower.Place them under a strong glass, and who can
fail to wonder at the miracles of form and color that are revealed?From
these tiny flowerets the scale runs upward until it touches the hybrid
rose.During this period, also, many of the forest trees emulate the wild
flowers at their feet until their inflorescence culminates in the white
cord-like fringe that foretells the spiny chestnut burrs.So much has been written comparing this exquisite season when spring
passes insensibly into summer with the fulfilled prophecy of girlhood,
that no attempt shall be made to repeat the simile.Amy's birthday should
have been in May, but it came early in June.May was still in her heart,
and might linger there indefinitely; but her mind, her thoughts, kept
pace with nature as unconsciously as the flowers that bloomed in their
season.There were little remembrances from all the family, but Webb's
gift promised the most pleasure.It was a powerful opera-glass; and as he
handed it to her on the piazza in the early morning he said:

"Our troupe are all here now, Amy, and I thought that you would like to
see the singers, and observe their costumes and expressions.Some birds
have a good deal of expression and a very charming manner while singing--a
manner much more to my taste than that of many a _prima donna_ whom I
have heard, although my taste may be uncultivated.Focus your glass on that
indigo-bird in yonder tree-top.Don't you see him?--the one that is
favoring us with such a lively strain, beginning with a repetition of
short, sprightly notes.The glass may enable you to see his markings
accurately."and it grows so deep and rich about
the head, throat, and breast!How plain I can see him, even to the black
velvet under his eyes!Why, I can look
right into his little throat, and almost imagine I see the notes he is
flinging abroad so vivaciously.I can even make out his claws closed on a
twig, and the dew on the leaves around him is like gems.Truly, Webb, you
were inspired when you thought of this gift.""Yes," he replied, quietly, looking much pleased, however, "with a very
honest wish to add to your enjoyment of the summer.I must confess, too,
that I had one thought at least for myself.You have described the
indigo-bird far more accurately than I could have done, although I have
seen it every summer as long as I can remember.You have taught me to
see; why should I not help you to see more when I can do it so easily?My
thought was that you would lend me the glass occasionally, so that I
might try to keep pace with you.I've been using the microscope too
much--prying into nature, as Burt would say, with the spirit of an
anatomist.""I shall value the glass a great deal more if you share it with me," she
said, simply, with a sincere, direct gaze into his eyes; "and be assured,
Webb," she added, earnestly, "you are helping me more than I can help
you.I'm not an artist, and never can be, but if I were I should want
something more than mere surface, however beautiful it might be.Think of
it, Webb, I'm eighteen to-day, and I know so little!You always make me
feel that there is so much to learn, and, what is more, that it is worth
knowing.You should have been a teacher, for you would make the children
feel, when learning their lessons, as Alf does when after game.she added, sweeping the scene with her
glass."I can go every day now on an exploring expedition.Clifford came in a little late, rubbing his hands felicitously, as he
said:

"I have just come from the apiary, and think we shall have another swarm
to-day.Did you ever hear the old saying, Amy,

  'A swarm of bees in June
   Is worth a silver spoon'?If one comes out to-day, and we hive it safely, we shall call it yours, and
you shall have the honey.""How much you are all doing to sweeten my life!"she said, laughing; "but I
never expected the present of a swarm of bees.I assure you it is a gift
that you will have to keep for me, and yet I should like to see how the
bees swarm, and how you hive them.I've heard that bees
are so wise, and know when people are afraid of them.""You can fix yourself up with a thick veil and a pair of gloves so that
there will be no danger, and your swarm of bees, when once in hive, will
take care of themselves, and help take care of you.That's the beauty of
bee-culture.""Our bees are literally in clover this year," Leonard remarked."That heavy
coating of wood-ashes that I gave
