so powerful a myth?And what occasioned the identification of the ocean

preaching from written sermons was first introduced, and the
circumstances which gave rise to it._Pallavicino and the Conte d'Olivares._--I have in my possession an old
Italian MS., 27 pages of large foolscap paper.It is headed "Caduta del
Conte d'Olivares," and at the end is signed "Scritta da Ferrante
Pallavicino," and dated "28 Genaro, 1643."Of course this Count
d'Olivares was the great favourite of Philip IV.of Spain; but who was
Pallavicino?Could it have been the Paravicino who was court chaplain to
Philip III.or was he of the Genoese family of Pallavicini
mentioned by Leigh Hunt (_Autobiography_, vol.as having
been connected with the Cromwell family?What favours the latter
presumption is, that a gentleman to whom I showed the MS.said at once,
"That is Genoa paper, just the same I got there for rough copies;" and
he also told me that the water-mark was a well-known Genoa mark: it
consists of a bird standing on an eight pointed starlike flower.If any one can give me any likely account of this Pallavicino, or tell
me whether the MS.is at all valuable in any way, I shall owe him many
thanks._Athelney Castle, Somersetshire._--Can any of your readers inform me,
whether Athelney Castle, built by King Alfred, as a monastery, in token
of his gratitude to God for his preservation, when compelled to fly from
his throne, is in existence; or if any remains of it can be traced, as I
do not find it mentioned either in several maps, gazetteers, or
topographical dictionaries?It was situate about four miles from
Bridgewater, near the conflux of the rivers Parrot and Tone?J. S.

  Islington, May 15._Athelney._--In a visit which I recently paid to the field of
_Sedgemoor_ and the Isle of _Athelney_ in Somersetshire, I found on the
latter a stone pillar, inclosed by an iron railing, designed to point
the traveller's eye to the spot, so closely associated with his earliest
historical studies, with the burnt cakes, the angry housewife, and the
castigated king.The pillar bears the following inscription, which you
may think perhaps worthy of preservation in your useful pages:--

  "King Alfred the Great, in the year of our Lord 879, having been
  defeated by the Danes, fled for refuge to the forest of Athelney,
  where he lay concealed from his enemies for the space of a whole
  year.He soon after regained possession of his throne, and in
  grateful remembrance of the protection he had received, under the
  favour of Heaven, he erected a monastery on this spot and endowed
  it with all the lands contained in the Isle of Athelney.To
  perpetuate the memorial of so remarkable an incident in the life
  of that illustrious prince, this edifice was founded by John
  Slade, Esq., of Mansell, the proprietor of Athelney and Lord of
  the Manor of North Petherton, A. D.J. R. W.

  Bristol.).--Can you tell me anything
more about this MS., and in whose possession it now is?Molaisse" was sold in a sale at Puttick and

_Bogatzky._--Who was Bogatzky, the author of the well-known _Golden
Treasury_?[Bogatzky was a Polish nobleman, the pupil of the great Professor
  Francke, and of a kindred spirit.He died at an advanced age in
  1768.It is not generally known that Bogatzky published a Second
  Volume of his _Golden Treasury_, which Dr.Steinkopff revised and
  edited in 1812, to which he prefixed a short but interesting
  account of the author.See also _Allgemeine Enyclopaedie von Ersch

respecting Shakspeare in this work has descended to us in its genuine
state," I beg to inform him that I possess a copy of the edition of
1596, as well as of those of 1617 and 1621, from the latter of which the
reprint by Sir Egerton Brydges was taken, and that the passage in
question is exactly the same in all the three editions.For the general
information of your readers interested in Greene's works, I beg to
state, that the variations in the edition of 1596 from the other two,
consist of the words "written before his death, and published at his
dying request," on the title; and instead of the introductory address
"To Wittie Poets, or Poeticall Wittes," signed I. H., there are a few
lines on A 2, "The Printer to the Gentle Readers:"

  "I haue published heere, Gentlemen, for your mirth and benefit,
  Greene's Groateswoorth of Wit.With sundry of his pleasant
  discourses ye haue beene before delighted: But now hath death
  giuen a period to his pen, onely this happened into my hands which
  I haue published for your pleasures: Accept it fauourably because
  it was his last birth, and not least worth, in my poore opinion.But I will cease to praise that which is aboue my conceit, and
  leaue it selfe to speake for it selfe: and so abide your learned
  censuring.Then follows another short address, "To the Gentlemen Readers," by
Greene himself; and as this edition is so rare, only two copies being
known, and the address is short, I transcribe it entire for your
insertion:

  "Gentlemen, The Swan sings melodiously before death, that in all
  his life time vseth but a iarring sound._Greene_, though able
  inough to write, yet deeplyer searched with sicknesse than euer
  heretofore, sendes you his swanne-like song, for that he feares he
  shall neuer againe carroll to you woonted loue layes, neuer againe
  discouer to you youth's pleasures.Howeuer yet sicknesse, riot,
  incontinence, haue at once shown their extremitie, yet if I
  recouer, you shall all see more fresh springs then euer sprang
  from me, directing you how to liue, yet not diswading you from
  loue.This is the last I haue writ, and I feare me the last I
  shall write.And how euer I haue beene censured for some of my
  former bookes, yet, Gentlemen, I protest, they were as I had
  special information.But passing them, I commend this to your
  fauourable censures, and like an Embrion without shape, I feare me
  will bee thrust into the world.If I liue to ende it, it shall be
  otherwise: if not, yet will I commend it to your courtesies, that
  you may as wel be acquainted with my repentant death, as you haue
  lamented my carelesse course of life.But as _Nemo ante obitum
  felix_, so _Acta exitus probat_: Beseeching therefore to bee
  deemed hereof as I deserue, I leaue the worke to your liking, and
  leaue you to your delights."Greene died in September, 1592; and this is curious, as being probably
the last thing that ever came from his pen.A 4, the other three leaves being occupied
with the title and the two addresses.It concludes with Greene's "letter
written to his wife," and has not "Greene's Epitaph: Discoursed
Dialogue-wise betweene Life and Death," which is in the two later
editions.I may here mention that I possess a copy of an extremely rare work
relating to Robert Greene, which has only lately become known, viz.:

  "Greene's Newes both from Heaven and Hell.Prohibited the first
  for writing of Bookes, and banished out of the last for displaying
  of Connycatchers.(Barnabee
  Rich) 4to.Concerning the great rarity of this interesting tract, which was unknown
to the Rev.A. Dyce when publishing his edition of Greene's works, your
readers may see a notice by Mr.Collier in his _Extracts from the
Registry of the Stat.233., apparently from the
present copy, no other being known.Besides the copy of the above work mentioned by your correspondent J. H.
T., several others are known to exist in this country.Among them I may
mention one in the library of the Baptist College, Bristol.My own copy
was supplied by a London bookseller, who has likewise imported several
other copies from Holland, where it is by no means a scarce work.The second illustrated edition was published twenty years after the
decease of Van Braght.The first edition, without engravings, now before
me, appeared in 1660, which was the edition used by Danvers.But Danvers
does not appear to have known its existence, when the first edition of
his treatise came out in 1673.The "large additions" of his second
edition in 1674, are chiefly made from the work of Van Braght.The original portion of Van Braght's work is, however, confined to the
first part.The second part, _The Martyrology_, strictly so called, is
of much earlier date.Many single narratives appeared at the time, and
collections of these were early made.The earliest collection of
martyrdoms bears the date of 1542.This was enlarged in 1562, 1578,
1580, and 1595.This fact I give on the authority of Professor Mueller of
Amsterdam, from the _Jaarboekje voor de Doopsgezinde Gemeenten in de
Nederlanden, 1838 en 1839_, pp.An edition, dated 1599, of these very rare books is now before me.John moved to the kitchen.It
has the following curious and affecting title:

  "Dit Boeck wort genaemt: Het Offer des Heeren, Om het inhout van
  sommige opgeofferde Kinderen Gods, de welcke voort gebrocht
  hebben, wt den goeden schat haers herten, Belijdinghen,
  Sentbrieuen ende Testamenten, de welcke sy met den monde beleden,
  ende met den bloede bezeghelt hebben, &c.By
  my Peter Sebastiaenzoon, Int jaer ons Heeren MDXCIX."of 229 folios, and contains the martyrdoms of
thirty-three persons (the first of which is Stephen), which were
subsequently embodied in the larger martyrologies.Each narrative is
followed by a versified version of it.A small book of hymns is added,
some of them composed by the martyrs; and the letters and confession of
one Joos de Tollenaer, who was put to death at Ghent in 1589.In 1615, a large collection of these narratives appeared at Haarlem in a
thick 4to.The compilers were Hans de Ries, Jaques Outerman, and
Joost Govertsoon, all eminent Mennonite ministers.Two editions followed
from the press of Zacharias Cornelis at Hoorn in 1617 and 1626, both in
4to., but under different editorship.The last edition was offensive to
the Haarlem editors, who therefore published a fourth at Haarlem in
1631.As its title is brief, I will give it from the copy in my library:

  "Martelaers Spiegel der Werelose Christenen t' zedert A. D.Gedrukt tot Haarlem Bij Hans
  Passchiers van Wesbusch.In't Jaer onses Heeren, 1631."The title-page is from a copperplate,
and is adorned with eight small engravings, representing scenes of
suffering and persecution from scripture.The narratives of martyrs
extends from 1524 to 1624.It is this work which forms the basis of Van
Braght's.He added to it the whole of his first part, and also some
additional narratives in the second.To the best of his ability he
verified the whole.These works are frequently referred to by Ottius in his _Annales
Anabaptistici_ under the titles "Martyrologium Harlemense" and
"Martyrologium Hornanum."From a paper in the _Archivs fuer Kunde oesterreichischer
Geschichtsquellen_, I learn that a MS.exists in the City library of
Hamburgh, with the following title:

  "Chronickel oder Denkbueechel darinnen mit kurtzen Begriffen, Was
  sich vom 1524 Jar, Bis auff gegenwaertige Zeit, in der gemain
  zuegetragen, vnd wie viel trewer Zeugen Jesu Christij die warheit
  Gottes so riterlich mit irem bluet bezeugt.The work appears chiefly confined to a history of the Moravian
Anabaptists: but from passages given by the writer, Herr Gregor Wolny,
it is evident that it contains many of the narratives given by Van
Braght.was written previous to 1592,
when its writer or compiler died.Three continuators carried on the
narrations to 1654.The last date in it is June 7, 1654; when Daniel
Zwicker, in his own handwriting, records his settlement as pastor over a
Baptist church.by Ottius, and by Fischer in
his _Tauben-kobel_, p.33., &c. For any additional particulars
respecting it, I should feel greatly obliged.It does not appear to be known to your correspondent that a translation
of the second part of Van Braght's work has been commenced in this
country, of which the first volume was issued by the Hanserd Knollys
Society last year.A translation of the entire work appeared in 1837, in
Pennsylvania, U. S., for the use of the Mennonite churches, emigrants
from Holland and Germany to whom the language of their native land had
become a strange tongue._Spick and Span New_ (Vol.).--The corresponding _German_
word is _Spann-nagel-neu_, which may be translated as "New from the
stretching needle;" and corroborates the meaning given by you.I may
remark the French have no equivalent phrase.It is evidently a familiar
allusion of the clothmakers of England and Germany.).--There is an old Club in this
town (Birmingham) called the "Bear Club," and established (ut dic.)circa 1738, formerly of some repute.Among other legends of the Club, is
one, that in the centre of the ceiling of their dining-room was once a
carved rose, and that the members always drank as a first toast, to "The
health of the King," [under the rose], meaning the Pretender._Handel's Occasional Oratorio_ (Vol.).--The "Occasional
Oratorio" is a separate composition, containing an overture, 10
recitatives, 21 airs, 1 duet, and 15 choruses.It was produced in the
year 1745.It is reported, I know not on what authority, that the King
having ordered Handel to produce a new oratorio on a given day, and the
artist having answered that it was impossible to do it in the time
(which must have been unreasonably short, to extort such a reply from
the intellect that produced _The Messiah_ in three weeks, and _Israel in
Egypt_ in four), his Majesty deigned no other answer than that done it
must and should be, whether possible or not, and that the result was the
putting forward of the "Occasional Oratorio."The structure of the oratorio, which was evidently a very hurried
composition, gives a strong air of probability to the anecdote.Evidently no libretto was written for it; the words tell no tale, are
totally unconnected, and not even always tolerable English, a fine
chorus (p.Arnold) going to the words "Him or his God we no fear."It is rather a collection of sacred pieces, strung together literally
without rhyme or reason in the oratorio form, than one oratorio.The
examination of it leads one to the conclusion, that the composer took
from his portfolio such pieces as he happened to have at hand, strung
them together as he best could, and made up the necessary quantity by
selections from his other works.Accordingly we find in it the pieces
"The Horse and his Rider," "Thou shalt bring them in," "Who is like unto
Thee?""The Hailstone Chorus," "The Enemy said I will pursue," from
_Israel in Egypt_, written in 1738; the chorus "May God from whom all
Mercies spring," from _Athaliah_ (1733); and the chorus "God save the
King, long live the King," from the _Coronation Anthem_ of 1727.Liberty," which he afterwards (in 1746) employed in
_Judas Maccabaeus_.Possibly some other pieces of this oratorio may be
found also in some of Handel's other works, not sufficiently stamped on
my memory for me to recognise them; but I may remark that the quantity
of _Israel in Egypt_ found in it may perhaps have so connected it in
some minds with that glorious composition as to have led to the practice
referred to of prefixing in performance the overture to the latter work,
to which, although the introductory movement, the fine adagio, and grand
march are fit enough, the light character of the fugue is, it must be
confessed, singularly inappropriate.I am not aware of any other "occasion" than that of the King's will,
which led to the composition of this oratorio.).--They are found in the ancient
churches in Ireland, and some are preserved in the Museum of the Royal
Irish Academy, and in private collections.A beautiful specimen is
engraved in Wakeman's _Handbook of Irish Antiquities_, p.).--The charge for a
"Thanksgiving Book," mentioned by A CHURCHWARDEN, was no doubt for a
Book of Prayers, &c., on some general thanksgiving day, probably after
the battle of Blenheim and the taking of Gibraltar, which would be about
the month of November.A similar charge appears in the Churchwardens'
accounts for the parish of _Eye, Suffolk_, at a much earlier period,
viz.1684, which you may probably deem worthy of insertion in your
pages:

      "_Payments._                                      _l._ _s._ _d._

    J. B. COLMAN._Carved Ceiling in Dorsetshire_ (Vol.).--Philip, King of
Castile (father to Charles V.), was forced by foul weather into Weymouth
Harbour.He was hospitably entertained by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who
invited Mr.King Philip took
such delight in his company that at his departure he recommended him to
King Henry VII.as a person of spirit "fit to stand before princes, and
not before mean men."He died in 1554, and was the ancestor of the
Bedford family.Sir Thomas Trenchard probably had the ceiling.See
Fuller's _Worthies_ (_Dorsetshire_), vol.The house of which your correspondent has heard his tradition is
certainly _Woolverton House_, in the parish of Charminster, near this
town.It was built by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who died 20 Hen.; and
tradition holds, as history tells us, that Phillip, Archduke of Austria,
and King of Castile, with his queen _Juana_, or _Joanna_, were driven by
weather into the port of Weymouth: and that Sir Thomas Trenchard, then
the High Sheriff of the county, invited their majesties to his house,
and afforded them entertainment that was no less gratifying than timely.Woolverton now belongs to James Henning, Esq.There is some fine carving
in the house, though it is not the ceiling that is markworthy; and it is
thought by some to be the work of a foreign hand.At Woolverton House
were founded the high fortunes of the House of Bedford.Sir Thomas
Trenchard, feeling the need of an interpreter with their Spanish
Majesties, happily bethought himself of a John Russell, Esq., of
Berwick, who had lived some years in Spain, and spoke Castilian; and
invited him, as a Spanish-English mouth, to his house: and it is said he
accompanied the king and queen to London, where he was recommended to
the favour of Hen.; and after rising to high office, received from
Hen.See Hutchins's _History of Dorset_._"Felix quem faciunt," &c._ (Vol.).--The passage
cited by C. H. P. as assigned to Plautus, and which he says he cannot
find in that author, occurs in one of the interpolated scenes in the
_Mercator_, which are placed in some of the old editions between the 5th
and 6th Scenes of Act IV.In the edition by Pareus, printed at Neustadt
(Neapolis Nemetum) in 1619, 4to., it stands thus:

  "Verum id dictum est: Feliciter is sapit, qui periculo alieno
  sapit."I was wrong in attributing it to Plautus, and should rather have called
it _Plautine_.By a strange slip of the pen or the press, pericu_lum_ is
put instead of pericu_lo_ in my note.Niebuhr has a very interesting
essay on the interpolated scenes in Plautus, in the first volume of his
_Kleine Historische und Philologische Schriften_, which will show why
these scenes and passages, marked as supposititious in some editions,
are now omitted.It appears that they were made in the fifteenth century
by Hermolaus Barbarus.See a letter from him to the Bishop of Segni, in
_Angeli Politiani Epistolae_, lib.To the parallel thoughts already cited may be added the following:

  "Ii qui sciunt, quid aliis acciderit, facile ex aliorum eventu,
  suis rationibus possunt providere.""I' presi esempio de' lor stati rei,
      Facendomi profitto l' altrui male
      In consolar i casi e dolor miei."Petrarca, _Trionfo della Castita_."Ben' e felice quel, donne mie care,
      Ch' essere accorto all' altrui spese impare."Fur._, canto X.

    S. W. SINGER.G. STEPHENS
states, that Mons.Roquefort's nine columns are decisive of Saint Graal
being derived from Sancta Cratera.I am unacquainted with the word
_cratera_, unless in Ducange, as meaning a basket.But _crater_, a
goblet, is the word meant by Roquefort.How should _graal_ or _greal_ come from _crater_?Surely that ancient writer, nearly, or quite, contemporary
with the publication of the romance, Helinandus Frigidimontanus, may be
trusted for the fact that _graal_ was French for "gradalis or gradale,"
which meant "scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in qua preciosae
dapes cum suo jure divitibus solent apponi."Vincentium Bellovacensem, _Speculum Historiale_, lib.Can
there be a more apparent and palpable etymology of any word, than that
_graal_ is _gradale_?See Ducange in _Gradale_, No.3, and in
_Gradalis_, and the three authorities (of which Helinand is not one)
cited by him._Skeletons at Egyptian Banquet_ (Vol.).--The
_interpretation_ of this is probably from Jer.See,
for the history of the association in his mind, his sermon on the
"Marriage Ring.""It is fit that I should infuse a bunch of myrrh into the festival
  goblet, and, after the Egyptian manner, serve up a dead man's
  bones as a feast.").--Allow me to refer H. C. K. to a passage
in the _Letters on the Suppression of the Monasteries_, published by the
Camden Society, p.71., for an example of the word _sewelles_.It is
there said to be equivalent to _blawnsherres_.The scattered pages of
Duns Scotus were put to this use, after he was banished from Oxford by
the Royal Commissioners.The word is perhaps akin to the low Latin _suellium_, threshing-floor,
or to the Norman French _swele_, threshold: in which case the original
meaning would be _bounds_ or _limits_.).--This word is a Latinised form of the
Irish words Cul-{f}eabu{s} (cul-feabus), _i.e._ "a closet of decency"
or "for the sake of decency."_Poem from the Digby MS._ (Vol.).--Your correspondent H.
A. B. will find the lines in his MS.beginning

      "You worms, my rivals," &c.,

printed, with very slight variations, amongst Beaumont's poems, in
Moxon's edition of the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher, 1840.They are
the concluding lines of "An Elegy on the Lady Markham."W. J. BERNHARD SMITH.).--I find the following passage in
the fourth edition of Blount's _Glossographia_, published as far back as
1674."_Umbrello_ (Ital._Ombrella_), a fashion of round and broad Fans,
  wherewith the _Indians_ (and from them our great ones) preserve
  themselves from the heat of the sun or fire; and hence any little
  shadow, Fan, or other thing, wherewith the women guard their faces
  from the sun."In Kersey's _Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum_, 1708, it is thus noticed--

  "_Umbrella_, or _Umbrello_, a kind of broad Fan or Skreen,
  commonly us'd by women to shelter them from Rain: also a Wooden
  Frame cover'd with cloth to keep off the sun from a window.")_, a small sort of canopy or umbrello, which women
  carry over their heads."And in Phillips's _New World of Words_, 7th ed., 1720--

  "_Umbrella_ or _Umbrello_, a kind of broad Fan or Skreen, which in
  hot countries People hold over their heads to keep off the Heat
  of the Sun; or such as are here commonly us'd by women to shelter
  them from Rain: Also, a wooden Frame cover'd with cloth or stuff,
  to keep off the sun from a window.")_, a small sort of canopy or umbrello, which women
  carry over their Heads, to shelter themselves from Rain," &c.

    T. C. T.).--Your correspondent L.
says, the true explanation of the circumstance of the nine of diamonds
being called the curse of Scotland is to be found in the game of Pope
Joan; but with all due deference to him, I must beg entirely to dissent
from this opinion, and to adhere to the notion of its origin being
traceable to the heraldic bearing of the family of Dalrymple, which are
or, on a saltire azure, _nine lozenges of the field_.There can be no doubt that John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount and 1st Earl of
Stair, justly merited the appellation of the "Curse of Scotland," from
the part which he took in the horrible massacre of Glencoe, and from the
utter detestation in which he was held in consequence, and which
compelled him to resign the secretaryship in 1695.After a deliberate
inquiry by the commissioners had declared _him_ to be guilty of the
massacre, we cannot wonder that the man should be held up to scorn by
the most popular means which presented themselves; and the nine diamonds
in his shield would very naturally, being the insignia of his family, be
the best and most easily understood mode of perpetuating that
detestation in the minds of the people.).--Your
correspondents will find some information on this word in Ledwich's
_Antiquities of Ireland_, 2nd edit.279.; and in Wakeman's _Handbook
of Irish Antiquities_, p.Ledwich seems to derive the word from the
Teutonic _Bawen_, to construct and secure with branches of trees._Catacombs and Bone-houses_ (Vol.GATTY will find a
vivid description of the bone-house at Hythe, in Mr.Borrow's
_Lavengro_, vol.i. I have no reference to the exact page._Bacon and Fagan_ (Vol.).--The letters B and F are
doubtless convertible, as they are both labial letters, and can be
changed as _b_ and _p_ are so frequently.The word "batten" is used by Milton in the same sense as the word
"fatten."The Latin word "flo" is in English "to blow."The word "flush" means much the same as "blush."The Greek word [Greek: bremo] is in the Latin changed to "fremo."The Greek word [Greek: bora] = in English "forage."[Greek: Bilippos] for [Greek: Philippos]; [Greek:
Bryges] for [Greek: Phryges].[Greek: Phalaina] in Greek = "balaena" in Latin = "balene" in French.[Greek: Phero] in Greek = "to bear" in English."Frater" in Latin = "brother" in English.I think that we may fairly imply that the labials _p_, _b_, _f_, _v_,
may be interchanged, in the same way as the dental letters _d_ and _t_
are constantly; and I see no reason left to doubt that the word Bacon is
the same as the word Fagan.).--When A SUBSCRIBER TO YOUR
JOURNAL asks for some account of the origin of the phrase "to learn by
Heart," may he not find it in St."To learn by _memory_" (or by "_rote_") conveys to my own mind a very
different notion from what I conceive to be expressed by the words "To
learn by _heart_."Just as there is an evident difference between a
_gentleman in heart and feeling_, and a _gentleman in manners and
education only_; so there is a like difference (as I conceive) between
learning by heart and learning by rote; namely, the difference between a
_moral_, and a merely _intellectual_, operation of the mind.To learn by
_memory_ is to learn by _rote_, as a parrot: to learn by _heart_ is to
learn _morally--practically_.Thus, we say, we give our hearts to our
pursuits: we "love God with all our hearts," pray to Him "with the
spirit, and with the understanding," and "with the heart believe unto
righteousness:" we "ponder in our hearts," "muse in our hearts," and
"keep things in our hearts," i. e.).--Claudius Minois, in his Commentaries on
the _Emblemata_ of Alciatus, gives the following etymology of
"Auriga:"--

  "Auriga non dicitur ab auro, sed ab aureis: sunt enim aureae lora

correct in stating Robert Barker to be the originator of the Panorama.His first work of the kind was a view of Edinburgh, of which city, I
believe, he was a native.On his death, in 1806, he was succeeded by his son, Mr.Henry Aston
Barker, the Mr.Barker referred to by A. G. This gentleman and his wife
(one of the daughters of the late Admiral Bligh) are both living, and
reside at Bitton, a village lying midway between this city and Bath.Bristol, June 2, 1851.).--ARUN's Query is fully
answered by a reference to Mrs.Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary Art_,

Queries by NEMO: 1.Connop Thirlwall, now Bishop of St.David's, is the author of the essay in question.39.:--_Errare_ mehercule _malo cum Platone... quam cum
istis vera sentire_; (again), Cicero, _ad Attic._, l. viii.7.:--_Malle_, quod dixerim, me _cum Pompeio vinci, quam cum istis
vincere_.The remark is Aristotle's; but the same had been said of
Homer by Plato himself:

  "Aristot.is
  reluctant to criticise Plato's doctrine of _Ideas_, [Greek: dia to
  philous andras eisagagein ta eide]: but, he adds, the truth must
  nevertheless be spoken:--[Greek: amphoin gar ontoin philoin,
  hosion protiman ten aletheian.]"Plato [_de Repub._, X. cap.]:--[Greek: Philia tis me
  kai aidos ek paidos echousa peri Homerou apokolyei legein... all'
  ou gar pro ge tes aletheias timeteos aner.]"_Achilles and the Tortoise_ (Vol.T. Coleridge has
explained this paradox in _The Friend_, vol.1850: a
note is subjoined regarding Aristotle's attempted solution, with a
quotation from Mr.de Quincey, in _Tate's Mag._, Sept.The
passage in _Leibnitz_ which [Greek: Idihotes] requires, is probably
"_Opera_, i. p._Early Rain called "Pride of the Morning"_ (Vol.).--In
connexion with this I would quote an expression in Keble's _Christian
Year_, "On the Rainbow," (25th Sun.):

      "_Pride of the_ dewy _Morning_!The swain's experienced eye
      From thee takes timely warning,
        Nor trusts else the gorgeous sky.").--JARLTZBERG will find one theory
on this subject in Dr.Asahel Grant's book, _The Nestorians; or, the
Lost Tribes_, published by Murray; 12mo."_Noli me Tangere_" (Vol.).--There is an
exquisite criticism upon the treatment of this subject by various
painters, accompanied by an etching from Titian, in that delightful
book, Mrs.Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary Art_, vol.360.;
and to the list of painters who have illustrated this subject, add
_Holbein_, in the Hampton Court Gallery.Jameson's _Handbook
to the Public Galleries_, pp."_The Sicilian Vespers_" (Vol.).--Your correspondent is
referred to _The War of the Sicilian Vespers_, by Amari, translated by
the Earl of Ellesmere, published very lately by Murray._Antiquity of Smoking_ (Vol ii., pp.B. says, alluding to
JARLTZBERG's references, "there is nothing in Solinus;" I read, however,
in Solinus, cap.1518), under the heading,
"Thracum mores, etc.":

  "Uterque sexus epulantes focos ambiunt, herbarum quas habent
  semine ignibus superjecto.Cujus nidore perculsi pro laetitia
  habent imitari ebrietatem sensibus sauciatis."JARLTZBERG's reference to Herod.36. supplies nothing to the point:
Herod.2. mentions the use of bone pipes, [Greek: physeteras
osteinous], by the Scythians, _in milking_; but Herodotus (iv.describes the orgies of the Scythians, who produced intoxicating fumes
by strewing hemp-seed upon red-hot stones, as the leaves and seed of the
Hasisha al fokara, or hemp-plant, are smoked in the East at the present
day.(See De Sacy, _Chrestom.Compare also
Plutarch de Fluviis (_de Hebro_, fr.), who speaks of a plant
resembling Origanum, from which the Thracians procured a stupefying
vapour, by burning the stalks:

  "[Greek: Epititheasi pyri... kai ten anapheromenen anathymiasin
  dechomenoi tais anapnoiais, karountai, kai eis bathyn hypnon
  katapherontai.]_Milton and the Calves-Head Club_ (Vol.Todd, in his
edition of Milton's _Works_, in 1809, p.158., mentions the rumour,
without expressing any opinion of its truth.I think he omits all
mention of it in his subsequent edition in 1826, and therefore hope he
has adopted the prevailing opinion that it is a contemptible libel.In a
note to the former edition is a reference to Kennett's _Register_, p.38., and to _"Private forms of Prayer fitted for the late sad times,"
&c._, 12mo., Lond., 1660, attributed to Dr.An anonymous
author, quoting the verbal assurance of "a certain active Whigg," would
be entitled to little credit in attacking the character of the living,
and ought surely to be scouted when assailing the memory of the dead.In
Lowndes' _Bib.Man._ it is stated that

  "This miserable trash has been attributed to the author of
  Hudibras."_Voltaire's Henriade_ (Vol.).--I have two translations of
this poem in English verse, in addition to that mentioned at p.330.,
viz., one in 4to., Anon., London, 1797; and one by Daniel French, 8vo.,
London, 1807.The former, which, as I collect from the preface, was
written by a lady and a foreigner, alludes to two previous translations,
one in blank verse (probably Lockman's), and the other in rhyme.).--Your correspondent C. H.
appears to give me too much credit for diligence, in having "searched"
after this document; for in truth I did nothing beyond writing to the
rector of the parish, the Rev.All that I can positively
say as to my letter, is, that it was intended to be courteous; that it
stated my reason for the inquiry; that it contained an apology for the
liberty taken in applying to a stranger; and that Mr.Sockett did not
honour me with any answer.I believe, however, that I asked whether the
register still existed; if so, what was its nature, and over what period
it extended; and whether it had been printed or described in any
antiquarian or topographical book.Perhaps some reader may have the means of giving information on these
points; and if he will do so through the medium of your periodical, he
will oblige both C. H. and myself.Or perhaps C. H. may be able to
inquire through some more private channel, in which case I should feel
myself greatly indebted to him if he would have the goodness to let me
know the result.).--The solution of J. H. M. to MR."Alternate layers of sliced pippins
and mutton steaks" might indeed make a pie, but not an apple-pie,
therefore this puzzling phrase must have had some other origin.An
ingenious friend of mine has suggested that it may perhaps be derived
from that expression which we meet with in one of the scenes of
_Hamlet_, "Cap a pied;" where it means perfectly appointed.The
transition from _cap a pied_, or "cap a pie," to _apple-pie_, has rather
a rugged appearance, orthographically, I admit; but the ear soon becomes
accustomed to it in pronunciation.ROBERT SNOW and several other correspondents have also
  suggested that the origin of the phrase "apple-pie order" is to
  be found in the once familiar "cap a pied."]_Durham Sword that killed the Dragon_ (Vol.).--For details
of the tradition, and an engraving of the sword, see Surtees' _History
of Durham_, vol.--Your correspondent F. E. M. will find
the word _Malentour_, or _Malaentour_, given in Edmondson's _Complete
Body of Heraldry_ as the motto of the family of Patten alias Wansfleet
(_sic_) of Newington, Middlesex: it is said to be borne on a scroll over
the crest, which is a Tower in flames.In the "Book of Mottoes" the motto ascribed to the name of Patten is
_Mal au Tour_, and the double meaning is suggested, "Misfortune to the
Tower," and "Unskilled in artifice."The arms that accompany it in Edmondson are nearly the same as those of
William Pattyn alias Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor
temp.VI.--the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford._The Bellman and his History_ (Vol.).--Since my
former communication on this subject I have been referred to the cut of
the Bellman and his _Dog_ in Collier's _Roxburghe Ballads_, p.59.,
taken from the first edition of Dekker's _Belman of London_, printed in
1608."_Geographers on Afric's Downs_" (Vol.).--Is your
correspondent A. S. correct in his quotation?In a poem of Swift's, "On
Poetry, a Rhapsody," are these lines:--

      "So geographers, in Afric maps
      With savage pictures fill their gaps,
      And o'er unhabitable downs
      Place elephants for want of towns."_Swift's Works, with Notes by Dr.Hawksworth_, 1767,
      vol."_Trepidation talk'd_" (Vol.).--The words attributed to
Milton are--

      "That crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
      The trepidation talk'd, and that first moved."Paterson's comment, quoted by your correspondent, is exquisite: he
evidently thinks there were two trepidations, one _talked_, the other
_first moved_.The _trepidation_ (not a tremulous, but a turning or oscillating motion)
is a well-known hypothesis added by the Arab astronomers to Ptolemy, in
explanation of the precession of the equinoxes.This precession they
imagined would continue retrograde for a long period, after which it
would be direct for another long period, then retrograde again, and so
on.They, or their European followers, I forget which, invented the
_crystal_ heaven, an apparatus outside of the _starry_ heaven (these
cast-off phrases of astronomy have entered into the service of poetry,
and the _empyreal_ heaven with them), to cause this slow turning, or
trepidation, in the starry heaven.Some used _two_ crystal heavens, and
I suspect that Paterson, having some confused idea of this, fancied he
found them both in Milton's text.I need not say that your correspondent
is quite right in referring the words _first moved_ to the _primum
mobile_.Again, _balance_ in Milton never _weighs_.Where he says of Satan's army (i.),

          "In even balance down they light
      On the firm brimstone,"

he appears to mean that they were in regular order, with a right wing to
balance the left wing.The direct motion of the crystal heaven,
following and compensating the retrograde one, is the "balance" which
"_was_ the trepidation _called_;" and this I suspect to be the true
reading.The past tense would be quite accurate, for all the Ptolemaists
of Milton's time had abandoned the _trepidation_.As the text stands it
is nonsense; even if Milton did _dictate_ it, we know that he never
_saw_ it; and there are several passages of which the obscurity may be
due to his having had to rely on others._Registry of Dissenting Baptisms in Churches_ (Vol.).--I
forward extracts from the Registers of the parish of Saint Benedict in
this town relating to the baptism of Dissenters.Hussey, mentioned
in several of the entries, was Joseph Hussey, minister of a Dissenting
congregation here from 1691 to 1720.His meeting-house on Hog Hill (now
St.Andrew's Hill) in this town was pillaged by a Jacobite mob, 29th
May, 1716.He died in London in 1726, and was the author of several
works, which are now very scarce.)William the Son of Richard Jardine and
  Elisabeth his Wife was baptiz'd in a Private Congregation by Mr.Hussey in ye name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost."Witnesses, Robert Wilson, Richard Jardine.Henery the Son of John and Sarah Shipp was baptized in a
  Private Congregation by Mr.Elisabeth the
  Daughter of Richard and Elisabeth Jardine was born ye twenty-first
  day of January and baptized the second day of February 1698/99 in
  a Private Congregation.Walter the Son of Richard and Elisabeth Jardine born July
  23 and said to be baptized in a Separate Congregation by Mr.Elisabeth Daughter of Richard Jardine and Elisabeth his
  wife born October 7. and said to be baptized at a Private
  Congregation Novemb.Miram the Son of Thomas Short and Mary his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Separate Congregation.Jane the Daughter
  of Richard Jardine and Elizabeth his Wife said to be baptized at a
  Separate Congregation Dec.John the Son of Alexander Jardine and Elisabeth his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Separate Congregation, Mar.Alexander the Son of Alexander Jardine and... his Wife was
  as 'tis said baptized in a Separate Congregation July 1705.John the Son of Alexander Jardine and Elisabeth his Wife
  said to be baptized at a Private Congregation Dec.Jardine was
  said to be baptized in Separate Congregation.John ye Son of Bryan and Sarah Ellis was said to
  have been baptized in Separate Congregation.ye Son of Alexander and Elisa Jardine was
    said to be baptiz'd in a Separate Congregation."I have no recollection of having met with similar entries in any other
Parish Register.).--I think that upon further
consideration C. J. A. will find his egg to be merely that of a
blackbird.While the eggs of some birds are so constant in their
markings that to see one is to know all, others--at the head of which we
may place the sparrow, the gull tribe, the thrush, and the
blackbird--are as remarkable for the curious variety of their markings,
and even of the shades of their colouring.And every schoolboy's
collection will show that these distinctions will occur in the same
nest.I also believe that there has been some mistake about the nest, for
though, like the thrush, the blackbird coats the interior of its nest
with mud, &c., it does not, like that bird, leave this coating exposed,
but adds another lining of soft dried grass.PH***., asks
"What is Champak?"He will find a full description of the plant in Sir
William Jones's "Botanical Observations on Select Indian Plants," vol.In speaking of it, he says:

  "The strong aromatic scent of the gold-coloured Champac is thought
  offensive to the bees, who are never seen on its blossoms; but
  their elegant appearance on the black hair of the Indian women is
  mentioned by Rumphius; and both facts have supplied the Sanscrit
  poets with elegant allusions."D. C.




MISCELLANEOUS.NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.The first volume issued to the members of the Camden Society in return
for the present year's subscription affords in more than one way
evidence of the utility of that Society.It is an account _of Moneys
received and paid for Secret Services of Charles II.and James II._, and
is edited by Mr.in the possession of William Selby
Lowndes, Esq.Of the value of the book as materials towards illustrating
the history of the period over which the payments extend, namely from
March 1679 to December 1688, there can be as little doubt, as there can
be that but for the Camden Society it never could have been published.As a publishing speculation it could not have tempted any bookseller;
even if its owner would have consented to its being so given to the
world: and yet that in the simple entries of payments to the Duchess of
Portsmouth, to "Mrs.Ellinor Gwynne," to "Titus Oates," to the
Pendrells, &c., will be found much to throw light upon many obscure
passages of this eventful period of our national history, it is probable
that future editions of Mr.Macaulay's brilliant narrative of it will
afford ample proof._The Antiquarian Etching Club_, which was instituted two or three years
since for the purpose of rescuing from oblivion, and preserving by means
of the graver, objects of antiquarian interest, has just issued the
first part of its publications for 1851.This contains twenty-one plates
of various degrees of merit, but all of great interest to the antiquary,
who looks rather for fidelity of representation than for artistic
effect.CATALOGUES RECEIVED.--G.High Holborn), Catalogue, Part

  ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING To Mesmerism.Part I. By the
  REV.S. R. MAITLAND, DD.Sometime Librarian to the
  late Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper of the MSS."One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever
    read."--_Morning Herald._

    "This publication, which promises to be the commencement of a
    larger work, will well repay serious perusal."--_Ir.Journ._

    "A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
    practices of modern Mesmerism."--_Nottingham Journal._

    "Dr.Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
    'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or
    wrong.We thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and
    hope that he will not long delay the remaining portions."--_London
    Medical Gazette._

    "The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say
    important.That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most
    successful we ever read.We cannot enter into particulars in this
    brief notice; but we would strongly recommend the pamphlet even to
    those who care nothing about Mesmerism, or _angry_ (for it has
    come to this at last) with the subject."--_Dublin Evening Post._

    "We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour, by
    one whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the
    genuine character of Mesmerism, which is so much
    disputed."--_Woolmer's Exeter Gazette._

    "Dr.Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention on the subject
    for many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part the
    result of his thoughts and inquiries.There is a good deal in it
    which we should have been glad to quote... but we content
    ourselves with referring our readers to the pamphlet
    itself."--_Brit.Mag._

    his subject as to conduct it successfully through all the
    intricacies of a difficult investigation; and such taste and

    and honest spirit.His attempt to discriminate our architecture

      | Vol I. Index.1849-May 1850]            | PG # 13536  |
      | INDEX TO THE SECOND VOLUME.MAY-DEC., 1850    | PG # 13571  |
      | INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME.But one morning near the close of the second week of their stay, the
usual radiation of resilient youth was conspicuously absent from the
young man's demeanor, and the child's face reflected the gloom that
sat so incongruously on the contour of an optimist.The little girl
fumbled her menu card, but the waitress--the usual aging pedagogic
type of the small residential hotel--stood unnoticed at the young
man's elbow for some minutes before he was sufficiently aroused from
his gloomy meditations to address her.When he turned to her at last,
however, it was with the grin that she had grown to associate with
him,--the grin, the absence of which had kept her waiting behind his
chair with a patience that she was, except in a case where her
affections were involved, entirely incapable of.Jimmie's
protestations of inability to make headway with the ladies were not
entirely sincere."Bring me everything on the menu," he said, with a wave of his hand in
the direction of that painstaking pasteboard."Coffee, tea, fruit,
marmalade, breakfast food, ham and eggs.With another wave of the hand he dismissed her."You can't eat it all, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor protested."I'll make a bet with you," Jimmie declared."I'll bet you a dollar
to a doughnut that if she brings it all, I'll eat it."Uncle Jimmie, you know she won't bring it.You never bet so I can
get the dollar,--you never do.""I never bet so I can get my doughnut, if it comes to that.""I don't know where to buy any doughnuts," Eleanor said; "besides,
Uncle Jimmie, I don't really consider that I owe them.I never really
say that I'm betting, and you tell me I've lost before I've made up my
mind anything about it.""Speaking of doughnuts," Jimmie said, his face still wearing the look
of dejection under a grin worn awry, "can you cook, Eleanor?Can you
roast a steak, and saute baked beans, and stew sausages, and fry out a
breakfast muffin?he suddenly
demanded of the waitress, who was serving him, with an apologetic eye
on the menu, the invariable toast-coffee-and-three-minute-egg
breakfast that he had eaten every morning since his arrival."She looks like a capable one," she
pronounced."I _can_ cook, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor giggled, "but not the way you
said.You don't roast steak, or--or--"

"Don't you?"Jimmie asked with the expression of pained surprise that
never failed to make his ward wriggle with delight.There were links
in the educational scheme that Jimmie forged better than any of the
cooperative guardians.Not even Jimmie realized the value of the
giggle as a developing factor in Eleanor's existence.He took three
swallows of coffee and frowned into his cup."I can make coffee," he
added.Well, we may as well look the facts in the face,
Eleanor.We're moving away from this elegant hostelry
to-morrow."Apologies to Aunt Beulah (mustn't call you Kiddo) and the
reason is, that I'm broke.I haven't got any money at all, Eleanor,
and I don't know where I am going to get any."But you go to work every morning, Uncle Jimmie?"I go looking for work, but so far no nice
juicy job has come rolling down into my lap.I haven't told you this
before because,--well--when Aunt Beulah comes down every day to give
you your lessons I wanted it to look all O. K. I thought if you didn't
know, you couldn't forget sometime and tell her.""I don't tattle tale," Eleanor said.It's only my doggone pride that makes me
want to keep up the bluff, but you're a game kid,--you--know.I tried
to get you switched off to one of the others till I could get on my
feet, but--no, they just thought I had stage fright.It would be pretty humiliating to me to admit that I couldn't
support one-sixth of a child that I'd given my solemn oath to
be-parent.""Be-parent, if it isn't a word, I invent it.It's awfully tough luck
for you, and if you want me to I'll own up to the crowd that I can't
swing you, but if you are willing to stick, why, we'll fix up some
kind of a way to cut down expenses and bluff it out."Jimmie watched her apparent
hesitation with some dismay."Say the word," he declared, "and I'll tell 'em."I don't want you to tell 'em," Eleanor cried.If you could get me a place, you know, I could go out to
work.You don't eat very much for a man, and I might get my meals
thrown in--"

"Don't, Eleanor, don't," Jimmie agonized."I've got a scheme for us
all right.The day will
come when I can provide you with Pol Roge and diamonds.My father is
rich, you know, but he swore to me that I couldn't support myself, and
I swore to him that I could, and if I don't do it, I'm damned.I am
really, and that isn't swearing.""I know it isn't, when you mean it the way they say in the Bible.""I don't want the crowd to know.I don't want Gertrude to know.She
hasn't got much idea of me anyway.I'll get another job, if I can only
hold out.""I can go to work in a store," Eleanor cried."I can be one of those
little girls in black dresses that runs between counters.""Do you want to break your poor Uncle James' heart, Eleanor,--do
you?"I've borrowed a studio, a large barnlike studio on
Washington Square, suitably equipped with pots and pans and kettles.Also, I am going to borrow the wherewithal to keep us going.It isn't
a bad kind of place if anybody likes it.There's one dinky little
bedroom for you and a cot bed for me, choked in bagdad.If you could
kind of engineer the cooking end of it, with me to do the dirty work,
of course, I think we could be quite snug and cozy.""I know we could, Uncle Jimmie," Eleanor said."Will Uncle Peter come
to see us just the same?"It thus befell that on the fourteenth day of the third month of her
residence in New York, Eleanor descended into Bohemia.Having no least
suspicion of the real state of affairs--for Jimmie, like most
apparently expansive people who are given to rattling nonsense, was
actually very reticent about his own business--the other members of
the sextette did not hesitate to show their chagrin and disapproval at
the change in his manner of living."The Winchester was an ideal place for Eleanor," Beulah wailed."It's
deadly respectable and middle class, but it was just the kind of
atmosphere for her to accustom herself to.She was learning to manage
herself so prettily.This morning when I went to the studio--I wanted
to get the lessons over early, and take Eleanor to see that exhibition
of Bavarian dolls at Kuhner's--I found her washing up a trail of
dishes in that closet behind the screen--you've seen it,
Gertrude?--like some poor little scullery maid.She said that Jimmie
had made an omelet for breakfast.If he'd made fifty omelets there
couldn't have been a greater assortment of dirty dishes and kettles.""Jimmie made an omelet for me once for which he used two dozen eggs.He kept breaking them until he found the yolks of a color to suit him.He said pale yolks made poor omelets, so he threw all the pale ones
away.""I suppose that you sat by and let him," Beulah said."You would let
Jimmie do anything.You're as bad as Margaret is about David.""Or as bad as you are about Peter.""There we go, just like any silly, brainless girls, whose chief object
in life is the--the other sex," Beulah cried inconsistently."So do I--in theory--" Gertrude answered, a little dreamily."Where do
Jimmie and Eleanor get the rest of their meals?""I can't seem to find out," Beulah said."I asked Eleanor point-blank
this morning what they had to eat last night and where they had it,
and she said, 'That's a secret, Aunt Beulah.'When I asked her why it
was a secret and who it was a secret with, she only looked worried,
and said she guessed she wouldn't talk about it at all because that
was the only way to be safe about tattling.You know what I think--I
think Jimmie is taking her around to the cafes and all the shady
extravagant restaurants.He thinks it's sport and it keeps him from
getting bored with the child.""Well, that's one way of educating the young," Gertrude said, "but I
think you are wrong, Beulah."CHAPTER VII

ONE DESCENT INTO BOHEMIA


"Aunt Beulah does not think that Uncle Jimmie is bringing me up
right," Eleanor confided to the pages of her diary."She comes down
here and is very uncomforterble.Well he is bringing me up good, in
some ways better than she did.When he swears he always puts out his
hand for me to slap him.He can't get any
work or earn wages.The advertisement business is on the bum this year
becase times are so hard up.The advertisers have to save their money
and advertising agents are failing right and left.So poor Uncle
Jimmie can't get a place to work at."The people in the other studios are very neighborly.Uncle Jimmie
leaves a sine on the door when he goes out.They don't they come right in and borrow things.Uncle Jimmie says not
to have much to do with them, becase they are so queer, but when I am
not at home, the ladies come to call on him, and drink Moxie or
something.Uncle Jimmie says I shall
not have Behemiar thrust upon me by him, and to keep away from these
ladies until I grow up and then see if I like them.Aunt Beulah thinks
that Uncle Jimmie takes me around to other studios and I won't tell
but he does not take me anywhere except to walk and have ice-cream
soda, but I say I don't want it because of saving the ten cents.We
cook on an old gas stove that smells.I can't do very good
housekeeping becase things are not convenient.I haven't any oven to
do a Saturday baking in, and Uncle Jimmie won't let me do the washing.I should feel more as if I earned my keap if I baked beans and made
boiled dinners and layer cake, but in New York they don't eat much but
hearty food and saluds.It isn't stylish to have cake and pie and
pudding all at one meal.He eats pie for
his breakfast, but if I told anybody they would laugh.If I wrote
Albertina what folks eat in New York she would laugh."Uncle Jimmie is teaching me to like salud.He laughs when I cut up
lettice and put sugar on it.He teaches me to like olives and dried
up sausages and sour crought.He says it is important to be edjucated
in eating, and everytime we go to the Delicate Essenn store to buy
something that will edjucate me better.He teaches me to say 'I beg
your pardon,' and 'Polly vous Fransay?'and to courtesy and how to
enter a room the way you do in private theatricals.He says it isn't
knowing these things so much as knowing when you do them that counts,
and then Aunt Beulah complains that I am not being brought up."I have not seen Uncle Peter for a weak.I would not have to tell him how I was being brought up, and
whether I was hitting the white lights as Uncle Jimmie says.--He would
know."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor did not write Albertina during the time when she was living in
the studio.Some curious inversion of pride kept her silent on the
subject of the change in her life.Albertina would have turned up her
nose at the studio, Eleanor knew.Therefore, she would not so much as
address an envelope to that young lady from an interior which she
would have beheld with scorn.She held long conversations with
Gwendolyn, taking the part of Albertina, on the subject of this
snobbishness of attitude.*       *       *       *       *

"Lots of people in New York have to live in little teny, weeny rooms,
Albertina," she would say.This
studio is so big I get tired dusting all the way round it, and even if
it isn't furnished very much, why, think how much furnishing would
cost, and carpets and gold frames for the pictures!The pictures that
are in here already, without any frames, would sell for hundreds of
dollars apiece if the painter could get anybody to buy them.You ought
to be very thankful for such a place, Albertina, instead of feeling so
stuck up that you pick up your skirts from it."*       *       *       *       *

But Albertina's superiority of mind was impregnable.Her spirit sat in
judgment on all the conditions of Eleanor's new environment.She hated the nicked, dun 
dishes they ate from, and the black bottomed pots and pans that all
the energy of Eleanor's energetic little elbow could not restore to
decency again.She hated the cracked, dun  walls, and the
mottled floor that no amount of sweeping and dusting seemed to make an
impression on.She hated the compromise of housekeeping in an
attic,--she who had been bred in an atmosphere of shining
nickle-plated ranges and linoleum, where even the kitchen pump gleamed
brightly under its annual coat of good green paint.She hated the
compromise, that was the burden of her complaint--either in the person
of Albertina or Gwendolyn, whether she lay in the crook of Eleanor's
arm in the lumpy bed where she reposed at the end of the day's labor,
or whether she sat bolt upright on the lumpy cot in the studio, the
broken bisque arm, which Jimmie insisted on her wearing in a sling
whenever he was present, dangling limply at her side in the relaxation
Eleanor preferred for it.The fact of not having adequate opportunity to keep her house in order
troubled the child, for her days were zealously planned by her
enthusiastic guardians.Beulah came at ten o'clock every morning to
give her lessons.As Jimmie's quest for work grew into a more and more
disheartening adventure, she had difficulty in getting him out of bed
in time to prepare and clear away the breakfast for Beulah's arrival.After lunch, to which Jimmie scrupulously came home, she was supposed
to work an hour at her modeling clay.Gertrude, who was doing very
promising work at the art league, came to the studio twice a week to
give her instruction in handling it.Later in the afternoon one of the
aunts or uncles usually appeared with some scheme to divert her.Margaret was telling her the stories of the Shakespeare plays, and
David was trying to make a card player of her, but was not succeeding
as well as if Albertina had not been brought up a hard shell Baptist,
who thought card playing a device of the devil's.Peter alone did not
come, for even when he was in town he was busy in the afternoon.As soon as her guests were gone, Eleanor hurried through such
housewifely tasks as were possible of accomplishment at that hour, but
the strain was telling on her.Jimmie began to realize this and it
added to his own distress.One night to save her the labor of
preparing the meal, he took her to an Italian restaurant in the
neighborhood where the food was honest and palatable, and the service
at least deft and clean.Eleanor enjoyed the experience extremely, until an incident occurred
which robbed her evening of its sweetness and plunged her into the
purgatory of the child who has inadvertently broken one of its own
laws.Among the belongings in the carpetbag, which was no more--having been
supplanted by a smart little suit-case marked with her initials--was a
certificate from the Massachusetts Total Abstinence Society, duly
signed by herself, and witnessed by the grammar-school teacher and the
secretary of the organization.On this certificate (which was
decorated by many presentations in dim black and white of
mid-Victorian domestic life, and surmounted by a collection of
scalloped clouds in which drifted three amateur looking angels amid a
crowd of more professional cherubim) Eleanor had pledged herself to
abstain from the use as a beverage of all intoxicating drinks, and
from the manufacture or traffic in them.She had also subscribed
herself as willing to make direct and persevering efforts to extend
the principles and blessings of total abstinence."Red ink, Andrea," her Uncle Jimmie had demanded, as the black-eyed
waiter bent over him, "and ginger ale for the offspring."It was fun to be with Uncle Jimmie in a restaurant again.He
always called for something new and unexpected when he spoke of her to
the waiter, and he was always what Albertina would consider "very
comical" when he talked to him."But stay," he added holding up an
admonitory finger, "I think we'll give the little one _eau rougie_
this time.Wouldn't you like _eau rougie_, tinted water, Eleanor, the
way the French children drink it?"Unsuspectingly she sipped the mixture of water and ice and sugar, and
"red ink" from the big brown glass bottle that the glowing waiter set
before them.As the meal progressed Jimmie told her that the grated cheese was
sawdust and almost made her believe it.He showed her how to eat
spaghetti without cutting it and pointed out to her various Italian
examples of his object lesson; but she soon realized that in spite of
his efforts to entertain her, he was really very unhappy."I've borrowed all the money I can, Angelface," he confessed finally.If I don't land that job at the
Perkins agency I'll have to give in and tell Peter and David, or wire
Dad.""You could get some other kind of a job," Eleanor said; "plumbing or
clerking or something."On Cape Cod the plumber and the grocer's clerk
lost no caste because of their calling."I _could_ so demean myself, and I will.I'll be a chauffeur, I can
run a car all right; but the fact remains that by to-morrow
something's got to happen, or I've got to own up to the bunch."She tried hard to think of something to comfort
him but she could not.Jimmie mixed her more _eau rougie_ and she
drank it.He poured a full glass, undiluted, for himself, and held it
up to the light."Well, here's to crime, daughter," he said."Long may it wave, and us
with it.""That isn't really red ink, is it?""It's an awfully pretty
color--like grape juice.""It is grape juice, my child, if we don't inquire too closely into the
matter.The Italians are like the French in the guide book, 'fond of
dancing and light wines.'This is one of the light wines they are fond
of.--Hello, do you feel sick, child?As soon as I can get hold of that sacrificed waiter we'll get
out of here."Eleanor's sickness was of the spirit, but at the moment she was
incapable of telling him so, incapable of any sort of speech.A great
wave of faintness encompassed her.She had
lightly encouraged a departure from the blessings and principles of
total abstinence.That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned apology to her
Maker for the sin of intemperance into which she had been so
unwittingly betrayed.She promised Him that she would never drink
anything that came out of a bottle again.She reviewed sorrowfully her
many arguments with Albertina--Albertina in the flesh that is--on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided that again that
virtuous child was right in her condemnation of any drink, however
harmless in appearance or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of a
bottled label.She knew, however, that something more than a prayer for forgiveness
was required of her.She was pledged to protest against the evil that
she had seemingly countenanced.She could not seek the sleep of the
innocent until that reparation was made.Through the crack of her
sagging door she saw the light from Jimmie's reading lamp and knew
that he was still dressed, or clothed at least, with a sufficient
regard for the conventionalities to permit her intrusion.She rose and
rebraided her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it.Then she put on
her stockings and her blue Japanese kimono--real Japanese, as Aunt
Beulah explained, made for a Japanese lady of quality--and made her
way into the studio.Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable studio chair with his
book under the light and his feet on the bamboo tea table as usual.He was flung on the couch with his face
buried in the cushions, and his shoulders were shaking.Eleanor seeing
him thus, forgot her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence, forgot
everything but the pitiful spectacle of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in
grief.She stood looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort."Uncle Jimmie," she said, "Uncle Jimmie."At the sound of her voice he put out his hand to her, gropingly, but
he did not uncover his face or shift his position.She found herself
smoothing his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and more
conviction as he snuggled his boyish head closer."I'm awfully discouraged," he said in a weak muffled voice."I'm sorry
you caught me at it, Baby."Eleanor put her face down close to his as he turned it to her."Everything will be all right," she promised him, "everything will be
all right.You'll soon get a job--tomorrow maybe."Then she gathered him close in her angular, tense little arms and held
him there tightly."Everything will be all right," she repeated
soothingly; "now you just put your head here, and have your cry out."CHAPTER VIII

THE TEN HUTCHINSONS


"My Aunt Margaret has a great many people living in her family,"
Eleanor wrote to Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights."She has a mother and a father, and two (2) grandparents, one
(1) aunt, one (1) brother, one (1) married lady and the boy of the
lady, I think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask any one,
oh--and another brother, who does not live here only on Saturdays and
Sundays.Aunt Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait on the
table.I guess you have read about them in
stories.I am taken right in to be one of the family, and I have a
good time every day now.Aunt Margaret's father is a college teacher,
and Aunt Margaret's grandfather looks like the father of his country.They have a piano here that
plays itself like a sewing machine.They have
after-dinner coffee and gold spoons to it.I guess you would like to
see a gold spoon.They are about the size of the tin spoons we
had in our playhouse.Daniel went back to the garden.I have a lot of fun with that boy too.At first
I thought he was very affected, but that is just the way they teach
him to talk.He is nine and plays tricks on other people.He dares me
to do things that I don't do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar.If
Aunt Margaret's mother was my grandma I might steal sugar or plum
cake.Remember the time we took your mother's hermits?You would think this house was quite a
grand house.It has three (3) flights of stairs and one basement.I
sleep on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt Margaret's only
it isn't a dressing room.Aunt
Margaret is pretty and sings lovely.*       *       *       *       *

In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate facts of her new
existence, such facts as she instinctively guarded from Albertina's
calculating sense.*       *       *       *       *

"Everybody makes fun of me here.I don't care if they do, but I can't
eat so much at the table when every one is laughing at me.They get
me to talking and then they laugh.If I could see anything to laugh
at, I would laugh too.They laugh in a refined way but they laugh.They say to
my face that I am like a merry wilkins story and too good to be true,
and New England projuces lots of real art, and I am art, I can't
remember all the things, but I guess they mean well.Aunt Margaret's
grandfather sits at the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before.He knows the govoner and does not like the way
he parts his hair.I thought all govoners did what they wanted to with
their hairs or anything and people had to like it because (I used to
spell because wrong but I spell better now) they was the govoners, but
it seems not at all.I meant to like
Aunt Beulah the best because she has done the most for me but I am
afrayd I don't.I would not cross my heart and say so.Aunt Margaret
gives me the lessons now.I guess I learn most as much as I learned I
mean was taught of Aunt Beulah.Oh dear sometimes I get descouraged
on account of its being such a funny world and so many diferent people
in it.I was afrayd of the hired
butler, but I am not now."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor had not made a direct change from the Washington Square studio
to the ample house of the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that
a change in Jimmie's fortunes had taken her back to the Winchester and
enabled her to accustom herself again to the amenities of gentler
living.Like all sensitive and impressionable children she took on the
color of a new environment very quickly.The strain of her studio
experience had left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but she
had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful surroundings of
the Winchester and under the influence of Jimmie's restored spirits.The change had come about on Jimmie's "last day of grace."He had
secured the coveted position at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.He had left Eleanor
in the morning determined to face becomingly the disappointment that
was in store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of admitting
his failure to his friends.He had come back in the late afternoon
with his fortunes restored, the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and inspired footing.He had burst into the studio with his news before he understood that
Eleanor was not alone, and inadvertently shared the secret with
Gertrude, who had been waiting for him with the kettle alight and some
wonderful cakes from "Henri's" spread out on the tea table.The three
had celebrated by dining together at a festive down-town hotel and
going back to his studio for coffee.At parting they had solemnly and
severally kissed one another.Eleanor lay awake in the dark for a long
time that night softly rubbing the cheek that had been so caressed,
and rejoicing that the drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and
had pledged their health with so assiduously, had come out of two
glasses instead of a bottle.Her life at the Hutchinsons' was almost like a life on another planet.Margaret was the younger, somewhat delicate daughter of a family of
rather strident academics.Professor Hutchinson was not dependent on
his salary to defray the expenses of his elegant establishment, but
on his father, who had inherited from his father in turn the
substantial fortune on which the family was founded.Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but she was considerably
more fortunate in her choice of a foster family than is usually the
fate of the foundling.The rigorous altitude of intellect in which she
was reared served as a corrective to the oversensitive quality of her
imagination.Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of her life was given to
visitations from the poetic muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines
to her on one of the pink pages of the private diary.They ran as
follows, and even Professor Hutchinson, who occupied the chair of
English in that urban community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated Eleanor's
description of his daughter as one that did not describe."Aunt Margaret is fair and kind,
                  And very good and tender."She moves around the room with grace,
                  Her hands she puts with quickness.Although she wears upon her face
                  The shadow of a sickness."It was this "shadow of a sickness," that served to segregate Margaret
to the extent that was really necessary for her well being.To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities of the family
might have forever dulled that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came
to owe so much in the various stages of her development.Margaret put her arm about the child after the ordeal of the first
dinner at the big table."Father does not bite," she said, "but Grandfather does.If Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your
life.""I don't know where to run to," Eleanor answered seriously, whereupon
Margaret hugged her.Her Aunt Margaret would have been puzzling to
Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication, but for the quick imagination
that unwound her riddles almost as she presented them.For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh Hutchinson senior did
bite, he looked so much like some of the worst of the pictures in
Little Red Riding Hood."While you are here I'm going to pretend you're my very own child,"
Margaret told Eleanor that first evening, "and we'll never, never tell
anybody all the foolish games we play and the things we say to each
other.I can just barely manage to be grown up in the bosom of my
family, and when I am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah, but
up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown up.She opened a funny old chest in the
corner of the spacious, high studded chamber."And here are some of
the dolls that I play with."She produced a manikin dressed primly
after the manner of eighteen-thirty, prim parted hair over a small
head festooned with ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her
fingers."Beulah," she said with a mischievous flash of a grimace at
Eleanor."Gertrude,"--a dashing young brunette in riding clothes."Jimmie,"--a curly haired dandy."David,"--a serious creature with a
monocle."I couldn't find Peter," she said, "but we'll make him some
day out of cotton and water colors."Eleanor cried in delight, "real dolls with
hair and different  eyes?""I can make pretty good ones," Margaret smiled; "manikins like
these,--a Frenchwoman taught me."And do you play that the dolls talk to each other as if
they was--were the persons?"Margaret assembled the four manikins into a smart little
group.The doll Beulah rose,--on her forefinger."I can't help
feeling," mimicked Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah's
earnest contralto, "that we're wasting our lives,--criminally
dissipating our forces."The doll Gertrude put up both hands."I want to laugh," she cried,
"won't everybody please stop talking till I've had my laugh out."Why, that's just like Aunt Gertrude," Eleanor said."Her voice has
that kind of a sound like a bell, only more ripply.""Don't be high-brow," Jimmie's lazy baritone besought with the slight
burring of the "r's" that Eleanor found so irresistible."I'm only a
poor hard-working, business man.""We intend to devote the
rest of our lives," he said, "to the care of our beloved cooperative
orphan."On that he made a rather over mannered exit, Margaret
planting each foot down deliberately until she flung him back in his
box."That's the kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is," she
continued, "but you mustn't ever tell anybody, Eleanor."She clasped
the child again in one of her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor
squeezing her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with her new
existence."But there isn't any doll for _you_, Aunt Margaret," she cried.yes, there is, but I wasn't going to show her to you unless you
asked, because she's so nice.I saved the prettiest one of all to be
myself, not because I believe I'm so beautiful, but--but only because
I'd like to be, Eleanor.""I always pretend I'm a princess," Eleanor admitted.The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful creation, a little more
like Marie Antoinette than her namesake, but bearing a not
inconsiderable resemblance to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night after this.In the
daytime she looked rather battered and ugly to eyes accustomed to the
delicate finish of creatures like the French manikins, but after she
was tucked away in her cot in the passion flower dressing-room--all of
Margaret's belongings and decorations were a faint, pinky
lavender,--her dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated Albertina at
increasingly rare intervals as time advanced, lay in the hollow of her
arm and received her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.*       *       *       *       *

"When my two (2) months are up here I think I should be quite sorry,"
she wrote in the diary, "except that I'm going to Uncle Peter next,
and him I would lay me down and dee for, only I never get time enough
to see him, and know if he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know.Well life is very exciting all the time now.Aunt Margaret
brings me up this way.She tells me that she loves me and that I've
got beautiful eyes and hair and am sweet.She says she wants to love me up enough to last because I never
had love enough before.Albertina never loves any
one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody--not to say so anyway.If a
man is getting married they say he _likes_ that girl he is going to
marry.In New York they act as different as they eat.The Hutchinsons
act different from anybody.They do not know Aunt Margaret has adoptid
me.Nobody knows I am adoptid but me and my aunts and uncles.Miss
Prentis and Aunt Beulah's mother when she came home and all the
bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons think I am a little
visiting girl from the country.It is nobody's business because I am
supported out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me feel queer
sometimes.I feel like

                "'Where did you come from, baby dear,
                Out of the nowhere unto the here?'Also I made this up out of home sweet home."'Pleasures and palaces where e'er I may roam,
            Be it ever so humble I wish I had a home.'"I like having six homes, but I wish everybody knew it.Speaking of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my aunts
and uncles did not marry each other and make it easier for every one.She said they were not going to get married.'Am I the same thing as getting married?'She said no, I
wasn't except that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish and
real.Aunt Beulah doesn't believe in marriage.Aunt Margaret doesn't think she has the health.Aunt Gertrude has
to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has got to marry some one
his mother says to or not at all, and does not like to marry anyway.Uncle Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks you have a beter
time in single blesedness.Uncle Peter did not sign in the book where
they said they would adopt me and not marry.They did not want to ask
him because he had some trouble once.Well I am
going to be married sometime.I want a house to do the housework in
and a husband and a backyard full of babies.Perhaps I would rather
have a hired butler and gold spoons.Of course I
would like to have time to write poetry.I can sculpture too, but I
don't want a career of it because it's so dirty."*       *       *       *       *

Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during this phase of her
existence.The nourishing food and regular living, the sympathy
established between herself and Margaret, the regime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been obliged guiltily to
disregard during the strenuous days of her existence in Washington
Square, all contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being.She played with Margaret's nephew, and ran up and down
stairs on errands for her mother.She listened to the tales related
for her benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the attentions
of the two formidable young men of the family, who entertained her
with the pianola and excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.*       *       *       *       *

"The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday afternoon," she wrote--on a
yellow page this time--"usually at Aunt Beulah's house.I am examined on what I have learned but I don't mind
it much.Physically I am found to be very good by measure and waite.I am very bright on the subject of
poetry.They do not know whether David Copperfield had been a wise
choice for me, but when I told them the story and talked about it they
said I had took it right.I don't tell them about the love part of
Aunt Margaret's bringing up.Aunt Beulah says it would make me self
conscioush to know that I had such pretty eyes and hair.Aunt Gertrude
said 'why not mention my teeth to me, then,' but no one seemed to
think so.Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because the
theory is to strengthen the weak part of the bridge, and make me do
arithmetic.'Drill on the deficiency,' she says.Well I should think
the love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks love is weak
and beneath her and any one.Uncle David told me privately that he
thought I was having the best that could happen to me right now being
with Aunt Margaret.I didn't tell him that the David doll always gets
put away in the box with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have.*       *       *       *       *

Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful scene in which she
had participated.*       *       *       *       *

"I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons.They laughed
at me too much for being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at Aunt Margaret for
adopting me and the tears came in her eyes I could not bare it.I did
not let the cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out.The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to Cape Cod, and I said I
hoped never, and then I said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next.They said 'Uncle David--do you mean
David Bolling?'and I did, so I said 'yes.'Then all the Hutchinsons
pitched into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying, 'Who is this
mysterious child anyway, and how is it that her guardians intrust her
to a crowd of scatter brain youngsters for so long?'and then they
said 'Uncle David Bolling--_what_ does his mother say?'Then Aunt
Margaret got very red in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said 'I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle David is as much my
Uncle David as they all are,' and then I said 'My Aunt Margaret has
got a perfect right to have me intrusted to her at any time, and not
to be laughed at for it,' and I went and stood in front of her and
gave her my handkercheve."Well I am glad somebody has been told that I am properly adoptid, but
I am sorry it is the ten Hutchinsons who know."CHAPTER IX

PETER


Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown up; that was the
wonderful thing about her visit to him,--if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another.From the moment when he ushered
her into his friendly, low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon
tiers of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of equality to the
miraculous order of existence that it was the privilege of her life to
share.The pink silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah's; the implacable British stuffiness at the
Winchester which had had its own stolid charm for the lineal
descendant of the Pilgrim fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the "hired butler" presided distributing after-dinner gold
spoons, these impressions all dwindled and diminished and took their
insignificant place in the background of the romance she was living
and breathing in Peter's jewel box of an apartment on Thirtieth
Street.Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor's the place seemed to be
a realized ideal of charm and homeliness.It was one of the older
fashioned duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic decade for
a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently adapted to the modern
insistence on technical convenience.Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased it and settled it and
suddenly departed for a five years' residence in China with her
husband, who was as she so often described him, "a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker."Peter's domestic affairs were
despatched by a large, motherly Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of
on sight and later came to respect and adore without reservation.Peter's home was a home with a place in it for her--a place that it
was perfectly evident was better with her than without her.She even
slept in the bed that Peter's sister's little girl had occupied, and
there were pictures on the walls that had been selected for her.She had been very glad to make her escape from the Hutchinson
household.Her "quarrel" with them had made no difference in their
relation to her.To her surprise they treated her with an increase of
deference after her outburst, and every member of the family,
excepting possibly Hugh Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully
polite to her.Margaret explained that the family really didn't mind
having their daughter a party to the experiment of cooperative
parenthood.It appealed to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories of the independence
of the individual modified their criticism of Margaret's secrecy in
the matter, which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from the estate of the aunt
for whom she had been named."It is very silly of me to be sensitive about being laughed at,"
Margaret concluded."I've lived all my life surrounded by people
suffering from an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for things that are not
funny to me.""I shouldn't think you would," Eleanor answered devoutly.In Peter's house there was no one to laugh at her but Peter, and when
Peter laughed she considered it a triumph.It meant that there was
something she said that he liked.The welcome she had received as a
guest in his house and the wonderful evening that succeeded it were
among the epoch making hours in Eleanor's life.The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother Hutchinson still clung to the
old-time, stately method of getting about the streets of New York, had
left her at Peter's door at six o'clock of a keen, cool May evening.Margaret had not been well enough to come with her, having been
prostrated by one of the headaches of which she was a frequent
victim.The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved and paneled, with its
mammoth brass knocker, the row of window boxes along the cornice a few
feet above it, the very look of the house was an experience and an
adventure to her.When she rang, the door opened almost instantly
revealing Peter on the threshold with his arms open.He had led her up
two short flights of stairs--ivory white with carved banisters, she
noticed, all as immaculately shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod
interior--to his own gracious drawing-room where Mrs.Finnigan was
bowing and smiling a warmhearted Irish welcome to her.It was like a
wonderful story in a book and her eyes were shining with joy as Uncle
Peter pulled out her chair and she sat down to the first meal in her
honor.The grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave air with
which Peter consulted her tastes and her preferences were all a part
of a beautiful magic that had never quite touched her before.She had been like a little girl in a dream passing dutifully or
delightedly through the required phases of her experience, never quite
believing in its permanence or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own.That was what she felt the moment
she stepped over his threshold.After their coffee before the open fire--she herself had had "cambric"
coffee--Peter smoked his cigar, while she curled up in silence in the
twin to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.The blue
flames skimmed the bed of black coals, and finally settled steadily at
work on them nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was like a
basket full of molten light, glowing and golden as the hot sun when it
sinks into the sea.Except to offer her the ring about his slender Panatela, and to ask
her if she were happy, Peter did not speak until he had deliberately
crushed out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into the fire.The ceremony over, he held out his arms to her and she slipped into
them as if that moment were the one she had been waiting for ever
since the white morning looked into the window of the lavender
dressing-room on Morningside Heights, and found her awake and quite
cold with the excitement of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth."Eleanor," Peter said, when he was sure she was comfortably arranged
with her head on his shoulder, "Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn't any other home,
and you and I belonged to each other.I'm almost too young to be your
father, but--"

"Oh!Eleanor asked fervently, as he paused.

"--But I can come pretty near feeling like a father to you if it's a
father you want.I lost my own father when I was a little older than
you are now, but I had my dear mother and sister left, and so I don't
know what it's like to be all alone in the world, and I can't always
understand exactly how you feel, but you must always remember that I
want to understand and that I will understand if you tell me."Yes, Uncle Peter," she said soberly; then perhaps for the first time
since her babyhood she volunteered a caress that was not purely
maternal in its nature.She put up a shy hand to the cheek so close to
her own and patted it earnestly."Of course I've got my grandfather
and grandmother," she argued, "but they're very old, and not very
affectionate, either.Then I have all these new aunts and uncles
pretending," she was penetrating to the core of the matter, Peter
realized, "that they're just as good as parents.Of course, they're
just as good as they can be and they take so much trouble that it
mortifies me, but it isn't just the same thing, Uncle Peter!""I know," Peter said, "I know, dear, but you must remember we mean
well.""I don't mean you; it isn't you that I think of when I think about my
co--co-woperative parents, and it isn't any of them specially,--it's
just the idea of--of visiting around, and being laughed at, and not
really belonging to anybody.""That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle Peter," she whispered.They had a long talk after this, discussing the past and the future;
the past few months of the experiment from Eleanor's point of view,
and the future in relation to its failures and successes.Beulah was
to begin giving her lessons again and she was to take up music with a
visiting teacher on Peter's piano.(Eleanor had not known it was a
piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand before.Peter did
not know what a triumph it was when she made herself put the question
to him.)"If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much as she does and make it as
interesting as Aunt Margaret does, I think I would make her feel very
proud of me," Eleanor said.John moved to the office."I get so nervous saving energy the way
Aunt Beulah says for me to that I forget all the lesson.Aunt Margaret
tells too many stories, I guess, but I like them.""Your Aunt Margaret is a child of God," Peter said devoutly, "in spite
of her raw-boned, intellectual family.""Uncle David says she's a daughter of the fairies."When Margaret's a year or two older you won't feel
the need of a mother.""I don't now," said Eleanor; "only a father,--that I want you to be,
the way you promised."Then he continued musingly, "You'll find
Gertrude--different.I can't quite imagine her presiding over your
moral welfare but I think she'll be good at it.She's a good deal of a
person, you know.""Aunt Beulah's a good kind of person, too," Eleanor said; "she tries
hard.The only thing is that she keeps trying to make me express
myself, and I don't know what that means.""Let me see if I can tell you," said Peter."Self-expression is a part
of every man's duty.Inside we are all trying to be good and true and
fine--"

"Except the villains," Eleanor interposed."People like Iago aren't
trying.""Well, we'll make an exception of the villains; we're talking of
people like us, pretty good people with the right instincts.Well
then, if all the time we're trying to be good and true and fine, we
carry about a blank face that reflects nothing of what we are feeling
and thinking, the world is a little worse off, a little duller and
heavier place for what is going on inside of us.""Well, how can we make it better off then?""By not thinking too much about it for one thing, except to remember
to smile, by trying to be just as much at home in it as possible, by
letting the kind of person we are trying to be show through on the
outside."By just not being bashful, do you mean?""Well, when Aunt Beulah makes me do those dancing exercises, standing
up in the middle of the floor and telling me to be a flower and
express myself as a flower, does she just mean not to be bashful?""Something like that: she means stop thinking of yourself and go
ahead--"

"But how can I go ahead with her sitting there watching?""I suppose I ought to tell you to imagine that you had the soul of a
flower, but I haven't the nerve.""You've got nerve enough to do anything," Eleanor assured him, but she
meant it admiringly, and seriously."I haven't the nerve to go on with a moral conversation in which you
are getting the better of me at every turn," Peter laughed."I'm sure
it's unintentional, but you make me feel like a good deal of an ass,
Eleanor.""That means a donkey, doesn't it?""It does, and by jove, I believe that you're glad of it.""I do rather like it," said Eleanor; "of course you don't really feel
like a donkey to me.I mean I don't make you feel like one, but it's
funny just pretending that you mean it.""Beulah tried to convey something of
the fact that you always got the better of every one in your modest
unassuming way, but I never quite believed it before.At any rate it's
bedtime, and here comes Mrs.Kiss me good
night, sweetheart."Eleanor flung her arms about his neck, in her first moment of
abandonment to actual emotional self-expression if Peter had only
known it."I will never really get the better of you in my life, Uncle Peter,"
she promised him passionately.CHAPTER X

THE OMNISCIENT FOCUS


One of the traditional prerogatives of an Omnipotent Power is to look
down at the activities of earth at any given moment and ascertain
simultaneously the occupation of any number of people.Thus the Arch
Creator--that Being of the Supreme Artistic Consciousness--is able to
peer into segregated interiors at His own discretion and watch the
plot thicken and the drama develop.Eleanor, who often visualized this
proceeding, always imagined a huge finger projecting into space,
cautiously tilting the roofs of the Houses of Man to allow the sweep
of the Invisible Glance.Granting the hypothesis of the Divine privilege, and assuming for the
purposes of this narrative the Omniscient focus on the characters most
concerned in it, let us for the time being look over the shoulder of
God and inform ourselves of their various occupations and
preoccupations of a Saturday afternoon in late June during the hour
before dinner.Eleanor, in her little white chamber on Thirtieth Street, was engaged
in making a pink and green toothbrush case for a going-away gift for
her Uncle Peter.To be sure she was going away with him when he
started for the Long Island beach hotel from which he proposed to
return every day to his office in the city, but she felt that a slight
token of her affection would be fitting and proper on the eve of their
joint departure.She was hurrying to get it done that she might steal
softly into the dining-room and put it on his plate undetected.Her
eyes were very wide, her brow intent and serious, and her delicate
lips lightly parted.At that moment she bore a striking resemblance to
the Botticelli head in Beulah's drawing-room that she had so greatly
admired.Of all the people concerned in her history, she was the most
tranquilly occupied.Peter in the room beyond was packing his trunk and his suit-case.At
this precise stage of his proceedings he was trying to make two
decisions, equally difficult, but concerned with widely different
departments of his consciousness.He was gravely considering whether
or not to include among his effects the photograph before him on the
dressing-table--that of the girl to whom he had been engaged from the
time he was a Princeton sophomore until her death four years
later--and also whether or not it would be worth his while to order a
new suit of white flannels so late in the season.The fact that he
finally decided against the photograph and in favor of the white
flannels has nothing to do with the relative importance of the two
matters thus engrossing him.The health of the human mind depends
largely on its ability to assemble its irrelevant and incongruous
problems in dignified yet informal proximity.When he went to his desk
it was with the double intention of addressing a letter to his tailor,
and locking the cherished photograph in a drawer; but, the letter
finished, he still held the picture in his hand and gazed down at it
mutely and when the discreet knock on his door that constituted the
announcing of dinner came, he was still sitting motionless with the
photograph propped up before him.Up-town, Beulah, whose dinner hour came late, was rather more
actively, though possibly not more significantly, occupied.She was
doing her best to evade the wild onslaught of a young man in glasses
who had been wanting to marry her for a considerable period, and had
now broken all bounds in a cumulative attempt to inform her of the
fact.Though he was assuredly in no condition to listen to reason, Beulah
was reasoning with him, kindly and philosophically, paying earnest
attention to the style and structure of her remarks as she did so.Her
emotions, as is usual on such occasions, were decidedly mixed.She was
conscious of a very real dismay at her unresponsiveness, a distress
for the acute pain from which the distraught young man seemed to be
suffering, and the thrill, which had she only known it, is the
unfailing accompaniment to the first eligible proposal of marriage.In
the back of her brain there was also, so strangely is the human mind
constituted, a kind of relief at being able to use mature logic once
more, instead of the dilute form of moral dissertation with which she
tried to adapt herself to Eleanor's understanding."I never intend to marry any one," she was explaining gently."I not
only never intend to, but I am pledged in a way that I consider
irrevocably binding never to marry,"--and that was the text from which
all the rest of her discourse developed.Jimmie, equally bound by the oath of celibacy, but not equally
constrained by it apparently, was at the very moment when Beulah was
so successfully repulsing the familiarity of the high cheek-boned
young man in the black and white striped tie, occupied in encouraging
a familiarity of a like nature.That is, he was holding the hand of a
young woman in the darkened corner of a drawing-room which had been
entirely unfamiliar to him ten days before, and was about to impress a
caress on lips that seemed to be ready to meet his with a certain
degree of accustomed responsiveness.That this was not a peculiarly
significant incident in Jimmie's career might have been difficult to
explain, at least to the feminine portion of the group of friends he
cared most for.Margaret, dressed for an academic dinner party, in white net with a
girdle of pale pink and lavender ribbons, had flung herself face
downward on her bed in reckless disregard of her finery; and because
it was hot and she was homesick for green fields and the cool
stretches of dim wooded country, had transported herself in fancy and
still in her recumbent attitude to the floor of a canoe that was
drifting down-stream between lush banks of meadow grass studded with
marsh lilies.After some interval--and shift of position--the way was
arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars came out one by one,
showing faintly between waving branches; and she perceived dimly that
a figure that was vaguely compounded of David and Peter and the
handsomest of all the young kings of Spain, had quietly taken its
place in the bow and had busied itself with the paddles,--whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons and their guests
were awaiting her.David, the only member of the group whose summer vacation had actually
begun, was sitting on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York and looking soberly into
the eyes of a blue ribbon bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his
knees.His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions of the
season's foulards, sleekly corseted and coifed, was sitting less than
a hundred yards away from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David.In the dressing-room above,
just alighted from a limousine de luxe, was a raven-haired,
crafty-eyed ingenue (whose presence David did not suspect or he would
have recollected a sudden pressing engagement out of her vicinity),
preening herself for conquest.David's mind, unlike the minds of the
"other gifted members of the We Are Seven Club," to quote Jimmie's
most frequent way of referring to them, was to all intents and
purposes a total blank.He answered monosyllabically his mother's
questions, patted the dog's beetling forehead and thought of nothing
at all for practically forty-five minutes.Then he rose, and offering
his arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved for him in
the dining-room.Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house in Fifty-sixth Street
where she lived with her parents, was putting the finishing touches on
a faun's head; and a little because she had unconsciously used
Jimmie's head for her model, and a little because of her conscious
realization at this moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody's in the world but Jimmie's, she was thinking of
him seriously.She was thinking also of the dinner on a tray that
would presently be brought up to her, since her mother and father were
out of town, and of her coming two months with Eleanor and her recent
inspiration concerning them.In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner hour and even the
supper hour were long past.In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor's
former home two old people were sitting in calico valanced rockers,
one by either window.The house was a pleasant old colonial structure,
now badly run down but still marked with that distinction that only
the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon a decaying habitation.A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing out unnecessarily,
and let herself in by the back door without knocking.Amos," she said, seating herself in a
straight backed, yellow chair, and swinging her crossed foot
nonchalantly, "I thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.Ma
said that she heard that she was coming home to live again.Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of Eleanor's grandfather.Amos
Chase had ideas of his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.Also Albertina's father
had come from "poor stock."There was a strain of bad blood in her.The women of the Weston families hadn't always "behaved themselves."He therefore answered this representative of the youngest generation
rather shortly."I don't know nothing about it," he said."Why, father," the querulous old voice of Grandmother Chase protested,
"you know she's comin' home somewhere 'bout the end of July, she and
one of her new aunties and a hired girl they're bringing along to do
the work.I don't see why you can't answer the child's question.""I don't know as I'm obligated to answer any questions that anybody
sees fit to put to me."Albertina, pass me my glasses from off the
mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking out from behind the clock
and I'll read what she says."Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr.Amos, who retired coughing
exasperatedly behind a paper that he did not read, allowed herself to
be informed through the medium of a letter from Gertrude and a
postscript from Eleanor of the projected invasion of the Chase
household."I should think you'd rather have Eleanor come home by herself than
bringing a strange woman and a hired girl," Albertina contributed a
trifle tartly.The distinction of a hired girl in the family was one
which she had long craved on her own account."All nonsense, I call it," the old man ejaculated."Well, Eleena, she writes that she can't get away without one of 'em
comin' along with her and I guess we can manage someways.I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen.You can't expect much from
city help.I shall certainly be
dretful pleased to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa--in spite o'
the way he goes on about it."A snort came from the region of the newspaper."I shouldn't think you'd feel as if you had a grandchild now that six
rich people has adopted her," Albertina suggested helpfully."It's a good thing for the child," her grandmother said."I'm so lame
I couldn't do my duty by her.Old folks is old folks, and they can't
do for others like young ones.I'd d'ruther have had her adopted by
one father and mother instead o' this passel o' young folks passing
her around among themselves, but you can't have what you'd d'ruther
have in this world.You got to take what comes and be thankful.""Did she write you about having gold coffee spoons at her last place?""I think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn't know the difference.I guess she has got a lot
of new clothes.Well, I'll have to be getting along.At the precise moment that the door closed behind Albertina, the clock
in Peter Stuyvesant's apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped into her chair at the
dinner table and waited with eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to
make the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.CHAPTER XI

GERTRUDE HAS TROUBLE WITH HER BEHAVIOR


"Dear Uncle Peter," Eleanor wrote from Colhassett when she had been
established there under the new regime for a week or more.I am very awfully sorry, but I could not help it.Don't tell Aunt Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary to the golden rule
that I was.She said
Aunt Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the hired girl was
homely too.Well, I think she is, but I am not going to have Albertina
think so.Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and ink like
hair and lovely teeth and one dimple.Albertina likes hair fuzzed all
over faces and blonds.Then she said she guessed I wasn't your
favorite, and that the gold spoons were most likely tin gilded over.I
don't know what you think about slapping.Will you please write and
say what you think?You know I am anxsuch to do well.But I think I
know as much as Albertina about some things.She uster treat me like a
dog, but it is most a year now since I saw her before."Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.Grandpa did not like
her at first.She looked so much like summer folks, and acted that
way, too.He does not agree with summer folks, but she got him talking
about foreign parts and that Spanish girl that made eyes at him, and
nearly got him away from Grandma, and the time they were wrecked going
around the horn, and showing her dishes and carvings from China.Grandma likes her
too, but not when Grandpa tells her about that girl in Spain."We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely food, only Grandpa does
not like it, but we have him a pie now for breakfast,--his own pie
that he can eat from all the time and he feels better.Aunt Gertrude
is happy seeing him eat it for breakfast and claps her hands when he
does it, only he doesn't see her."She is teaching me more manners, and to swim, and some French.It is
vacation and I don't have regular lessons, the way I did while we
were on Long Island."Didn't we have a good time in that hotel?Do you remember the night I
stayed up till ten o'clock and we sat on the beach and talked?I would miss you more if I believed what Albertina said about my
not being your favorite.Uncle Jimmie is coming and then I
don't know what Albertina will say.Aunt Gertrude's idea of getting me cultivated is
to read to me from the great Masters of literature and funny books
too, like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology.Then I say what I think
of them, and she just lets me develop along those lines, which is
pretty good for summer."The sun and wind are on the sea,
                  The waves are clear and blue,
                This is the place I like to be,
                  If I could just have you."The insects chirrup in the grass,
                  The birds sing in the tree,
                And oh!how quick the time would pass
                  If you were here with me.""What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?"Eleanor asked one
evening when they were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway, and the early moon had
illumined for them."Do you think it's awfully bad to slap any one?""I wouldn't slap you, if that's what you mean, Eleanor.""Would you slap somebody your own size and a little bigger?""I thought perhaps you would," Eleanor sighed with a gasp of relieved
satisfaction."I don't believe in moral suasion entirely, Eleanor," Gertrude tried
to follow Eleanor's leads, until she had in some way satisfied the
child's need for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.It was
not always simple to discover just what Eleanor wanted to know, but
Gertrude had come to believe that there was always some excellent
reason for her wanting to know it."I think there are some quarrels
that have to be settled by physical violence.""I want to bring
myself up good when--when all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don't know.I want to grow up, and be ladylike and a credit, and I'm
getting such good culture that I think I ought to, but--I get worried
about my refinement.City refinement is different from country
refinement.""Refinement isn't a thing that you can worry about," Gertrude began
slowly.She realized perhaps better than any of the others, being a
better balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or Margaret,
that there were serious defects in the scheme of cooperative
parentage.Eleanor, thanks to the overconscientious digging about her
roots, was acquiring a New England self-consciousness about her
processes.A child, Gertrude felt, should be handed a code ready made
and should be guided by it without question until his maturer
experience led him to modify it.The trouble with trying to explain
this to Eleanor was that she had already had too many things
explained to her, and the doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be
inculcated by an exploitation of it."If you are naturally a fine
person your instinct will be to do the fine thing.You must follow it
when you feel the instinct and not think about it between times.""That's Uncle Peter's idea," Eleanor said, "that not thinking.Well,
I'll try--but you and Uncle Peter didn't have six different parents
and a Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing your
refinement in different ways.Don't you ever have any trouble with
your behavior, Aunt Gertrude?"The truth was that she was having considerable
trouble with her behavior since Jimmie's arrival two days before.She
had thought to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod helping
the child to relate her new environment to her old, while she had the
benefit of her native air and the freedom of a rural summer.She also
felt that one of their number ought to have a working knowledge of
Eleanor's early surroundings and habits.She had meant to put herself
and her own concerns entirely aside.If she had a thought for any one
but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two old people whose guest she
had constituted herself.She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two
before her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested that he
spend his own two vacation weeks watching the progress of her
experiment.Before she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him to
do so she had given him permission to come.Jimmie was part of her
trouble.Her craving for isolation and undiscovered country; her
eagerness to escape with her charge to some spot where she would not
be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance, were all a part of
an instinct to segregate herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it.This she realized as soon as
he arrived on the spot.She realized further that she had made
practically no progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude had decided a young
man should be, was rapidly becoming a serious menace to her peace of
mind, and her ideal of a future lived for art alone.She had
definitely begun to realize this on the night when Jimmie, in his
exuberance at securing his new job, had seized her about the waist and
kissed her on the lips.She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
which came dangerously near being her first one.She was too clever,
too cool and aloof, to have had many tentative love-affairs.Later, as
she softened and warmed and gathered grace with the years she was
likely to seem more alluring and approachable to the gregarious male.Now she answered her small interlocutor truthfully."Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble with my behavior.I'm
having trouble with it today, and this evening," she glanced up at the
moon, which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves of effulgence,
"I expect to have more," she confessed.asked Eleanor, "I'm sorry I can't sit up with you then
and help you.You--you don't expect to be--provocated to _slap_
anybody, do you?""No, I don't, but as things are going I almost wish I did," Gertrude
answered, not realizing that before the evening was over there would
be one person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap several times
over.As they turned into the village street from the beach road they met
Jimmie, who had been having his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather
Amos, with whom he had become a prime favorite.With him was
Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing more than
blandly."This virtuous child has been urging me to come after Eleanor and
remind her that it is bedtime," Jimmie said, indicating the pink
gingham clad figure at his side."She argues that Eleanor is some six
months younger than she and ought to be in bed first, and personally
she has got to go in the next fifteen minutes.""It's pretty hot weather to go to bed in," Albertina said."Miss
Sturgis, if I can get my mother to let me stay up half an hour more,
will you let Eleanor stay up?"Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her ample back, Eleanor was
making gestures intended to convey the fact that sitting up any longer
was abhorrent to her."Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think," Gertrude answered,
professionally maternal."I brought Albertina so that our child might go home under convoy,
while you and I were walking on the beach," Jimmie suggested.As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning of their
conversation drifted back to the other two, who stood watching them
for a moment."I thought I'd come over to see if you was willing to say you were
sorry," Albertina began."My face stayed red in one spot for two hours
that day after you slapped me.""I'm not sorry," Eleanor said ungraciously, "but I'll say that I am,
if you've come to make up.""Well, we won't say any more about it then," Albertina conceded."Are
Miss Sturgis and Mr.Sears going together, or are they just friends?""Isn't that Albertina one the limit?"Jimmie inquired, with a piloting
hand under Gertrude's elbow."She told me that she and Eleanor were
mad, but she didn't want to stay mad because there was more going on
over here than there was at her house and she liked to come over.""I'm glad Eleanor slapped her," Gertrude said; "still I'm sorry our
little girl has uncovered the clay feet of her idol.She's through
with Albertina for good.""Do you know, Gertrude," Jimmy said, as they set foot on the
glimmering beach, "you don't seem a bit natural lately.You used to be
so full of the everlasting mischief.Every time you opened your mouth
I dodged for fear of being spiked.Yet here you are just as docile as
other folks.""Don't you like me--as well?"Gertrude tried her best to make her
voice sound as usual."Better," Jimmie swore promptly; then he added a qualifying--"I
guess."But she didn't allow him the opportunity to answer."I'm in a transition period, Jimmie," she said."I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways into which she
has fallen as a result of all her other injudicious training, and,
instead of that, I'm doing nothing but think of myself and my own
hankerings and yearnings and such.I thought I could do so much for
the child.""That's the way we all think till we tackle her and then we find it
quite otherwise and even more so.Tell me about your hankerings and
yearnings.""Tell me about your job, Jimmie."And for a little while they found themselves on safe and familiar
ground again.Jimmie's new position was a very satisfactory one.He
found himself associated with men of solidity and discernment, and for
the first time in his business career he felt himself appreciated and
stimulated by that appreciation to do his not inconsiderable best.Gertrude was the one woman--Eleanor had not yet attained the inches
for that classification--to whom he ever talked business."Now, at last, I feel that I've got my feet on the earth, Gertrude; as
if the stuff that was in me had a chance to show itself, and you don't
know what a good feeling that is after you've been marked trash by
your family and thrown into the dust heap.""I know you are, 'Trude.It isn't
everybody I'd talk to like this.The moonlight beat down upon them in floods of sentient palpitating
glory.Little breathy waves sought the shore and whispered to it.The
pines on the breast of the bank stirred softly and tenderly."Lord, what a night," Jimmie said, and began burying her little white
hand in the beach sand."Now
tell me about your job," he said."I don't think I want to talk about my job tonight."There was no question about her voice sounding as
usual this time.Jimmie brushed the sand slowly away from the buried hand and covered
it with his own.He drew nearer, his face close, and closer to hers.It was coming, it was coming and she was
glad.That silly old vow of celibacy, her silly old thoughts about
art.What was anything with the arms of the man you
loved closing about you.Jimmie drew a sharp breath, and let her go."Gertrude," he said, "I'm incorrigible.I'd
make love to--Eleanor's grandmother if I had her down here on a night
like this.Gertrude got to her feet a little unsteadily, but she managed a
smile."It's only the moon," she said, "and--and young blood.I think
Grandfather Amos would probably affect me the same way."Jimmie's momentary expression of blankness passed and Gertrude did not
press her advantage."It's awfully companionable to realize that you also are human,
'Trude," he hazarded on the doorstep.Gertrude put a still hand into his, which is a way of saying "Good
night," that may be more formal than any other."The Colonel's lady, and July O'Grady," she quoted lightly.Up-stairs in her great chamber under the eaves, Eleanor was composing
a poem which she copied carefully on a light blue page of her private
diary.It read as follows:

                "To love, it is the saddest thing,
                  When friendship proves unfit,
                For lots of sadness it will bring,
                  When e'er you think of it.that friends should prove untrue
                  And disappoint you so.Because you don't know what to do,
                  And hardly where to go."CHAPTER XII

MADAM BOLLING


"Is this the child, David?"Eleanor stared impassively into the lenses of Mrs.Eleanor courtesied as her Uncle Jimmie had taught her, but she did not
take her eyes from Mrs.I hate this American fashion of dressing
children like French dolls, in bright colors and smart lines.An English country child would have
cheeks as red as apples."I should have thought her younger, David.I'll teach her the ropes when the strangeness
begins to wear off.This kind of thing is all new to her, you know."Give her the blue chamber and tell Mademoiselle to
take charge of her.You say you want her to have lessons for so many
hours a day.She writes verses, she models pretty well,
Gertrude says.It's too soon to expect any special aptitude to
develop.""Well, I'm glad to discover your philanthropic tendencies, David.I
never knew you had any before, but this seems to me a very doubtful
undertaking.You take a child like this from very plain surroundings
and give her a year or two of life among cultivated and well-to-do
people, just enough for her to acquire a taste for extravagant living
and associations.You get tired of your
bargain.You marry--and then what
becomes of your protegee?She goes back to the country, a thoroughly
unsatisfied little rustic, quite unfitted to be the wife of the farmer
for whom fate intended her.""I wish you wouldn't, mother," David said, with an uneasy glance at
Eleanor's pale face, set in the stoic lines he remembered so well from
the afternoon of his first impression of her.It never hurts anybody to have a plain understanding of his
position in the world.I don't know what foolishness you romantic
young people may have filled her head with.It's just as well she
should hear common sense from me and I intend that she shall.""I've explained to you, mother, that this child is my legal and moral
responsibility and will be partly at least under my care until she
becomes of age.I want her to be treated as you'd treat a child of
mine if I had one.If you don't, I can't have her visit us again.I
shall take her away with me somewhere.Bringing her home to you this
time is only an experiment.""She'll have a much more healthful and normal experience with us than
she's had with any of the rest of your violent young set, I'll be
bound.She can look out for Zaidee--I
never say that name without irritation--but it's the only name the
little beast will answer to.Eleanor started at the suddenness of the question, but did not reply
to it.Bolling waited and David looked at her expectantly."My mother asked you if you liked dogs, Eleanor; didn't you
understand?"Eleanor opened her lips as if to speak and then shut them again
firmly."Your protegee is slightly deaf, David," his mother assured him."You can tell her 'yes,'" Eleanor said unexpectedly to David."I like
dogs, if they ain't treacherous.""She asked you the question," David said gravely; "this is her house,
you know."Why can't I talk to you about her, the way she does about me?""She can have consideration if she wants it, but she
doesn't think I'm any account.Let her ask you what she wants and I'll
tell you.""Eleanor," David remonstrated, "Eleanor, you never behaved like this
before.I don't know what's got into her, mother."Eleanor fixed her big blue eyes on the lorgnette again."If it's manners to talk the way you do to your own children and
strange little girls, why, then I don't want any," she said."I guess
I'll be going," she added abruptly and turned toward the door.David took her by the shoulders and brought her right about face."Say good-by to mother," he said sternly."Good-by, ma'am--madam," Eleanor said and courtesied primly."Tell Mademoiselle to teach her a few things before the next audience,
David, and come back to me in fifteen minutes.I have something
important to talk over with you."David stood by the open door of the blue chamber half an hour later
and watched Eleanor on her knees, repacking her suit-case.Her face
was set in pale determined lines, and she looked older and a little
sick.Outside it was blowing a September gale, and the trees were
waving desperate branches in the wind.David had thought that the
estate on the Hudson would appeal to the little girl.It had always
appealed to him so much, even though his mother's habits of migration
with the others of her flock at the different seasons had left him so
comparatively few associations with it.He had thought she would like
the broad sweeping lawns and the cherubim fountain, the apple orchard
and the kitchen garden, and the funny old bronze dog at the end of the
box hedge.When he saw how she was occupied, he understood that it was
not her intention to stay and explore these things."Eleanor," he said, stepping into the room suddenly, "what are you
doing with your suit-case?Didn't Mademoiselle unpack it for you?"He
was close enough now to see the signs of tears she had shed.Her eyes fell and she tried desperately to control a quivering lip."Because I am--I want to go back.""I ain't wanted," she said, her head low."I made up my mind to go
back to my own folks.I'm not going to be adopted any more."David led her to the deep window-seat and made her sit facing him.He
was too wise to attempt a caress with this issue between them."Do you think that's altogether fair to me?""I guess it won't make much difference to you."Do you think it will be fair to your other aunts and uncles who have
given so much care and thought to your welfare?""If they do get tired of their bargain it will be because they've
turned out to be very poor sports.I've known every one of them a long
time, and I've never known them to show any signs of poor
sportsmanship yet.If you run away without giving them their chance to
make good, it will be you who are the poor sport.""She said you would marry and get tired of me, and I would have to go
back to the country.If you marry and Uncle Jimmie marries--then Uncle
Peter will marry, and--"

"You'd still have your Aunts Beulah and Margaret and Gertrude," David
could not resist making the suggestion.If one person broke up the vow, I guess they
all would."But even if we did, Eleanor, even if we all married, we'd still
regard you as our own, our child, our charge."The tears came now, and David gathered the
little shaking figure to his breast."I don't want to be the wife of
the farmer for whom fate intended me," she sobbed."I want to marry
somebody refined with extravagant living and associations.""That's one of the things we are bringing you up for, my dear."This
aspect of the case occurred to David for the first time, but he
realized its potency."You mustn't take mother too seriously.Just
jolly her along a little and you'll soon get to be famous friends.She's never had any little girls of her own, only my brother and me,
and she doesn't know quite how to talk to them.""The Hutchinsons had a hired butler and gold spoons, and they didn't
think I was the dust beneath their feet.I don't know what to say to
her.I said ain't, and I wasn't refined, and I'll only just be a
disgrace to you.I'd rather go back to Cape Cod, and go out to work,
and stand Albertina and everything.""If you think it's the square thing to do," David said slowly, "you
may go, Eleanor.I'll take you to New York to-morrow and get one of
the girls to take you to Colhassett.Of course, if you do that it will
put me in rather an awkward position.The others have all had you for
two months and made good on the proposition.I shall have to admit
that I couldn't even keep you with me twenty-four hours.Peter and
Jimmie got along all right, but I couldn't handle you at all.As a
cooperative parent, I'm such a failure that the whole experiment goes
to pieces through me.""Well, it's the same thing,--you couldn't stand the surroundings I
brought you to.You couldn't even be polite to my mother for my
sake.""I--never thought of that, Uncle David.""Think of it now for a few minutes, won't you, Eleanor?"The rain was beginning to lash the windows, and to sweep the lawn in
long slant strokes.The little girl held up her face as if it could
beat through the panes on it."I thought," she said slowly, "that after Albertina I wouldn't _take_
anything from anybody.Uncle Peter says that I'm just as good as
anybody, even if I have been out to work.He said that all I had to do
was just to stand up to people.""There are a good many different ways of standing up to people,
Eleanor.Be sure you've got the right way and then go ahead.""I guess I ought to have been politer," Eleanor said slowly."I ought
to have thought that she was your own mother.You couldn't help the
way she acted, o' course.""The way you acted is the point, Eleanor.""I'll act different if you want me to, Uncle David," she said, "and I
won't go and leave you."I don't think that I altogether cover myself
with glory in an interview with my mother," he added."It isn't the
thing that I'm best at, I admit.""You did pretty good," Eleanor consoled him."I guess she makes you
kind of bashful the way she does me," from which David gathered with
an odd sense of shock that Eleanor felt there was something to
criticize in his conduct, if she had permitted herself to look for
it."I know what I'll do," Eleanor decided dreamily with her nose against
the pane."I'll just pretend that she's Mrs.O'Farrel's aunt, and then
whatever she does, I shan't care.I'll know that I'm the strongest and
could hit her if I had a mind to, and then I shan't want to.""By the time you grow up, Eleanor," he said finally, "you will have
developed all your cooperative parents into fine strong characters.Sandra went to the bathroom.*       *       *       *       *

"The dog got nearly drownded today in the founting," Eleanor wrote."It is a very little dog about the size of Gwendolyn.It was out with
Mademoiselle, and so was I, learning French on a garden seat.It
teetered around on the edge of the big wash basin--the founting looks
like a wash basin, and suddenly it fell in.I waded right in and got
it, but it slipped around so I couldn't get it right away.It looked
almost too dead to come to again, but I gave it first aid to the
drownded the way Uncle Jimmie taught me to practicing on Gwendolyn.When I got it fixed I looked up and saw Uncle David's mother coming.I
took the dog and gave it to her.I said, 'Madam, here's your dog.'Mademoiselle ran around ringing her hands and talking about it.Bolling's room, and we talked.I told her how to make
mustard pickles, and how my mother's grandpa's relation came over in
the Mayflower, and about our single white lilac bush, and she's going
to get one and make the pickles.Then I played double Canfield with
her for a while.I'm glad I didn't go home before I knew her better.O'Farrel's aunt I pretend she is her, and we
don't quarrel.She says does Uncle David go much to see Aunt Beulah,
and I say, not so often as Uncle Jimmie does.Then she says does he go
to see Aunt Margaret, and I say that he goes to see Uncle Peter the
most.Well, if he doesn't he almost does.Madam
Bolling that you won't tattle, because she would think the worst."*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor grew to like Mademoiselle.She was the aging, rather wry
faced Frenchwoman who had been David's young brother's governess and
had made herself so useful to Mrs.Bolling that she was kept always on
the place, half companion and half resident housekeeper.She was glad
to have a child in charge again, and Eleanor soon found that her
crooked features and severe high-shouldered back that had somewhat
intimidated her at first, actually belonged to one of the kindest
hearted creatures in the world.Paris and Colhassett bore very little resemblance to each other, the
two discovered.To be sure there were red geraniums every alternating
year in the gardens of the Louvre, and every year in front of the
Sunshine Library in Colhassett.The residents of both places did a
great deal of driving in fine weather.In Colhassett they drove on the
state highway, recently macadamized to the dismay of the taxpayers who
did not own horses or automobiles.In Paris they drove out to the Bois
by way of the Champs Elysees.In Colhassett they had only one
ice-cream saloon, but in Paris they had a good many of them
out-of-doors in the parks and even on the sidewalk, and there you
could buy all kinds of sirups and 'what you call cordials' and
_aperitifs_; but the two places on the whole were quite different.The people of Colhassett were all
religious and thought it was sinful to play cards on Sundays.Mademoiselle said she always felt wicked when she played them on a
week day."I think of my mother," she said; "she would say 'Juliette, what will
you say to the Lord when he knows that you have been playing cards on
a working day."The Lord that they have in Colhassett is not like that," Eleanor
stated without conscious irreverence."She is a vary fonny child, madam," Mademoiselle answered Mrs."She has taste, but no--experience even of the most
ordinary.She cooks, but she does no embroidery.She knits and knows
no games to play.She has a good brain, but Mon Dieu, no one has
taught her to ask questions with it.""She has had lessons this year from some young Rogers graduates, very
intelligent girls.I should think a year of that kind of training
would have had its effect."Bolling's finger went into every pie
in her vicinity with unfailing direction."Lessons, yes, but no teaching.If she were not vary intelligent I
think she would have suffered for it.The public schools they did
somesing, but so little to elevate--to encourage."Thus in a breath were Beulah's efforts as an educator disposed of."Would you like to undertake the teaching of that child for a year?""I think I'll make the offer to David."Bolling was unsympathetic but she was thorough.Since David and his young friends had undertaken
a venture so absurd, she decided to lend them a helping hand with it.Besides, now that she had no children of her own in the house,
Mademoiselle was practically eating her head off.Also it had
developed that David was fond of the child, so fond of her that to
oppose that affection would have been bad policy, and Mrs.Bolling was
politic when she chose to be.She chose to be politic now, for
sometime during the season she was going to ask a very great favor of
David, and she hoped, that by first being extraordinarily complaisant
and kind and then by bringing considerable pressure to bear upon him,
he would finally do what he was asked.The favor was to provide
himself with a father-in-law, and that father-in-law the
multi-millionaire parent of the raven-haired, crafty-eyed ingenue, who
had begun angling for him that June night at the country club.She made the suggestion to David on the eve of the arrival of all of
Eleanor's guardians for the week-end.Bolling had invited a
house-party comprised of the associated parents as a part of her
policy of kindness before the actual summoning of her forces for the
campaign she was about to inaugurate.David was really touched by his mother's generosity concerning
Eleanor.He had been agreeably surprised at the development of the
situation between the child and his mother.He had been obliged to go
into town the day after Eleanor's first unfortunate encounter with her
hostess, and had hurried home in fear and trembling to try to smooth
out any tangles in the skein of their relationship that might have
resulted from a day in each other's vicinity.After hurrying over the
house and through the grounds in search of her he finally discovered
the child companionably currying a damp and afflicted Pekinese in his
mother's sitting-room, and engaged in a grave discussion of the
relative merits of molasses and sugar as a sweetening for Boston baked
beans.It was while they were having their after-dinner coffee in the
library, for which Eleanor had been allowed to come down, though
nursery supper was the order of the day in the Bolling establishment,
that David told his friends of his mother's offer."Of course, we decided to send her to school when she was twelve
anyway," he said."The idea was to keep her among ourselves for two
years to establish the parental tie, or ties I should say.If she is
quartered here with Mademoiselle we could still keep in touch with her
and she would be having the advantage of a year's steady tuition under
one person, and we'd be relieved--" a warning glance from Margaret,
with an almost imperceptible inclination of her head in the direction
of Beulah, caused him to modify the end of his sentence--"of the
responsibility--for her physical welfare.""Mentally and morally," Gertrude cut in, "the bunch would still
supervise her entirely."Jimmie, who was sitting beside her, ran his arm along the back of her
chair affectionately, and then thought better of it and drew it away.He was, for some unaccountable reason, feeling awkward and not like
himself.There was a girl in New York, with whom he was not in the
least in love, who had recently taken it upon herself to demonstrate
unmistakably that she was not in love with him.There was another girl
who insisted on his writing her every day.Here was Gertrude, who
never had any time for him any more, absolutely without enthusiasm at
his proximity.He thought it would be a good idea to allow Eleanor to
remain where she was and said so."Not that I won't miss the jolly times we had together, Babe," he
said."I was planning some real rackets this year,--to make up for
what I put you through," he added in her ear, as she came and stood
beside him for a minute.Gertrude wanted to go abroad for a year, "and lick her wounds," as she
told herself.She would have come back for her two months with
Eleanor, but she was glad to be relieved of that necessity.Margaret
had the secret feeling that the ordeal of the Hutchinsons was one that
she would like to spare her foster child, and incidentally herself in
relation to the adjustment of conditions necessary to Eleanor's visit.Peter wanted her with him, but he believed the new arrangement would
be better for the child.Beulah alone held out for her rights and her
parental privileges.She stood in the center of the group a little forlornly while they
awaited her word.A wave of her old shyness overtook her and she
blushed hot and crimson."It's all in your own hands, dear," Beulah said briskly."Poor kiddie," Gertrude thought, "it's all wrong somehow.""I don't know what you want me to say," Eleanor said piteously and
sped to the haven of Peter's breast."We'll manage a month together anyway," Peter whispered."Then I guess I'll stay here," she whispered back, "because next I
would have to go to Aunt Beulah's."Peter, turning involuntarily in Beulah's direction, saw the look of
chagrin and disappointment on her face, and realized how much she
minded playing a losing part in the game and yet how well she was
doing it."She's only a straight-laced kid after all," he thought."She's put her whole heart and soul into this thing.There's a look
about the top part of her face when it's softened that's a little like
Ellen's."Ellen was his dead fiancee--the girl in the photograph at
home in his desk."I guess I'll stay here," Eleanor said aloud, "all in one place, and
study with Mademoiselle."It was a decision that, on the whole, she never regretted.CHAPTER XIII

BROOK AND RIVER


                   "Standing with reluctant feet,
                   Where the brook and river meet.""I think it's a good plan to put a quotation like Kipling at the top
of the page whenever I write anything in this diary," Eleanor began in
the smart leather bound book with her initials stamped in black on the
red cover--the new private diary that had been Peter's gift to her on
the occasion of her fifteenth birthday some months before."I think it
is a very expressive thing to do.The quotation above is one that
expresses me, and I think it is beautiful too.Miss Hadley--that's my
English teacher--the girls call her Haddock because she does look
rather like a fish--says that it's undoubtedly one of the most
poignant descriptions of adolescent womanhood ever made.I made a note
to look up adolescent, but didn't.Bertha Stephens has my dictionary,
and won't bring it back because the leaves are all stuck together
with fudge, and she thinks she ought to buy me a new one.It is very
honorable of her to feel that way, but she never will.Good old
Stevie, she's a great borrower."'Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
             For borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.'"Well, I hardly know where to begin.I thought I would make a resume
of some of the events of the last year.I was only fourteen then, but
still I did a great many things that might be of interest to me in my
declining years when I look back into the annals of this book.To
begin with I was only a freshie at Harmon.It is very different to be
a sophomore.I can hardly believe that I was once a shivering looking
little thing like all the freshmen that came in this year.I was very
frightened, but did not think I showed it.wad some power the giftie gie us,
               To see ourselves as others see us.'"Robert Burns had twins and a rather bad character, but after he met
his bonnie Jean he wrote very beautiful poetry.A poet's life is
usually sad anyhow--full of disappointment and pain--but I digress."I had two years with Mademoiselle at the Bollings' instead of one the
way we planned.I haven't written in my Private Diary since the night
of that momentous decision that I was to stay in one place instead of
taking turns visiting my cooperative parents.I went to another school
one year before I came to Harmon, and that brings me to the threshold
of my fourteenth year.If I try to go back any farther, I'll never
catch up.I spent that vacation with Aunt Margaret in a cottage on
Long Island with her sister, and her sister's boy, who has grown up to
be the silly kind that wants to kiss you and pull your hair, and those
things.Aunt Margaret is so lovely I can't think of words to express
it.rare pale Margaret,' as Tennyson says.She wears her hair in
a coronet braid around the top of her head, and all her clothes are
the color of violets or a soft dovey gray or white, though baby blue
looks nice on her especially when she wears a fishyou."I went down to Cape Cod for a week before I came to Harmon, and while
I was there my grandmother died.I can't write about that in this
diary.I loved my grandmother and my grandmother loved me.Uncle Peter
came, and took charge of everything.He has great strength that holds
you up in trouble."The first day I came to Harmon I saw the girl I wanted for my best
friend, and so we roomed together, and have done so ever since.Her
name is Margaret Louise Hodges, but she is called Maggie Lou by every
one.She has dark curly hair, and deep brown eyes, and a very silvery
voice.I have found out that she lies some, but she says it is because
she had such an unhappy childhood, and has promised to overcome it for
my sake."That Christmas vacation the 'We Are Sevens' went up the Hudson to the
Bollings' again, but that was the last time they ever went there.Uncle David and his mother had a terrible fight over them.I was sorry
for Madam Bolling in a way.There was a girl she wanted Uncle David to
marry, a rich girl who looked something like Cleopatra, very dark
complexioned with burning eyes.She had a sweet little Pekinese
something like Zaidee."Uncle David said that gold could never buy him, and to take her away,
but Madam Bolling was very angry, of course.She accused him of
wanting to marry Aunt Margaret, and called her a characterless, faded
blonde.Then it was Uncle David's turn to get angry, and I have never
seen any one get any angrier, and he told about the vow of celibacy,
and how instead of having designs on him the whole crowd would back
him up in his struggle to stay single.I told
Madam Bolling that I would help her to get Uncle David back, and I
did, but she never forgave the other aunts and uncles.I suppose the
feelings of a mother would prompt her to want Uncle David settled down
with a rich and fashionable girl who would soon be the mother of a lot
of lovely children.I can't imagine a Cleopatra looking baby, but she
might have boys that looked like Uncle David."Vacations are really about all there is to school.Freshman year is
mostly grinding and stuffing.Having six parents to send you boxes of
'grub' is better than having only two.Some of the girls are rather
selfish about the eats, and come in and help themselves boldly when
you are out of the room.Maggie Lou puts up signs over the candy box:
'Closed for Repairs,' or 'No Trespassing by Order of the Board of
Health,' but they don't pay much attention.Well, last summer vacation
I spent with Uncle Jimmie.I wouldn't tell this, but I reformed him.I don't know what pledge it was because I
didn't read it, but he said he was addicted to something worse than
anything I could think of, and if somebody didn't pull him up, he
wouldn't answer for the consequences.I asked him why he didn't choose
Aunt Gertrude to do it, and he groaned only.So I said to write out a
pledge, and sign it and I would be the witness.We were at a hotel
with his brother's family.It isn't proper any more for me to go
around with my uncles unless I have a chaperon.Mademoiselle says that
I oughtn't even to go down-town alone with them but, of course, that
is French etiquette, and not American.Well, there were lots of pretty
girls at this hotel, all wearing white and pink dresses, and carrying
big bell shaped parasols of bright colors.They looked sweet, like so
many flowers, but Uncle Jimmie just about hated the sight of them.He
said they were not girls at all, but just pink and white devices of
the devil.On the whole he didn't act much like my merry uncle, but we
had good times together playing tennis and golf, and going on parties
with his brother's family, all mere children but the mother and
father.Uncle Jimmie was afraid to go and get his mail all summer,
although he had a great many letters on blue and lavender note paper
scented with Roger et Gallet's violet, and Hudnut's carnation.We used
to go down to the beach and make bonfires and burn them unread, and
then toast marshmallows in their ashes.He said that they were
communications from the spirits of the dead.I should have thought
that they were from different girls, but he seemed to hate the sight
of girls so much.Once I asked him if he had ever had an unhappy
love-affair, just to see what he would say, but he replied 'no, they
had all been happy ones,' and groaned and groaned."Aunt Beulah has changed too.She has become a suffragette and thinks
only of getting women their rights and their privileges."Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments about the cause.She says that woman's place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and brew like the women of my
grandfather's day, visiting around the way I do?And she says that it
is the principle of the thing that is involved, and I ought to take a
stand for or against.Everybody has so many different arguments that I
don't know what I think yet, but some day I shall make up my mind for
good."Well, that about brings me up to the present.I meant to describe a
few things in detail, but I guess I will not begin on the past in that
way.I don't get so awfully much time to write in this diary because
of the many interruptions of school life, and the way the monitors
snoop in study hours.I don't know who I am going to spend my
Christmas holidays with.I sent Uncle Peter a poem three days ago, but
he has not answered it yet.I'm afraid he thought it was very silly.I
don't hardly know what it means myself.It goes as follows:

                              "A Song

                "The moon is very pale to-night,
                  The summer wind swings high,
                I seek the temple of delight,
                  And feel my love draw nigh."I seem to feel his fragrant breath
                  Upon my glowing cheek.Between us blows the wind of death,--
                  I shall not hear him speak."I don't know why I like to write love poems, but most of the women
poets did.CHAPTER XIV

MERRY CHRISTMAS


Margaret in mauve velvet and violets, and Gertrude in a frock of smart
black and white were in the act of meeting by appointment at Sherry's
one December afternoon, with a comfortable cup of tea in mind.Gertrude emerged from the recess of the revolving door and Margaret,
sitting eagerly by the entrance, almost upset the attendant in her
rush to her friend's side.Gertrude," she cried, "I'm so glad to see you.My family is
trying to cut me up in neat little quarters and send me north, south,
east and west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to stay home and
have Eleanor.How did I ever come to be born into a family of giants,
tell me that, Gertrude?""The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an unfortunately immature
period, I'll admit," Gertrude laughed."My parents are dears, but
they've never forgiven me for being an artist instead of a dubby bud.Shall we have tea right away or shall we sit down and discuss life?""I don't know which is the hungrier--flesh or
spirit."But as they turned toward the dining-room a familiar figure blocked
their progress."I thought that was Gertrude's insatiable hat," David exclaimed
delightedly."I've phoned for you both until your families have given
instructions that I'm not to be indulged any more.I've got a surprise
for you.--Taxi," he said to the man at the door."Not till we've had our tea," Margaret wailed."You couldn't be so
cruel, David.""You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of the happiest surprises
of your life into the bargain," David assured her as he led the way to
the waiting cab."I wouldn't leave this place unfed for anybody but you, David, not if
it were ever so, and then some, as Jimmie says.""What's the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?"David inquired as the taxi
turned down the Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a hopeless
mesh of traffic.Gertrude answered, though she had not been the
one addressed at the moment.she
rattled on without waiting for an answer."I thought it was
good-looking myself, and Madam Paran robbed me for it.""It is good-looking," David allowed."It seems to be a kind of
retrieving hat, that's all.Keeps you in a rather constant state of
looking after the game."It's a lovely cross
between the style affected by the late Emperor Napoleon and my august
grandmother, with some frills added."The chauffeur turned into a cross street and stopped abruptly before
an imposing but apparently unguarded entrance."Why, I thought this was a studio building," Gertrude said."David, if
you're springing a tea party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I'll shoot the way my hat is pointing.""Straight through my left eye-glass," David finished."You wait till
you see the injustice you have done me."But Margaret, who often understood what was happening a few moments
before the revelation of it, clutched at his elbow.David, David," she whispered, "how wonderful!""Wait till you see," David said, and herded them into the elevator.David hurried them around
the bend in the sleekly carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to.It opened almost instantly and
David's man, who was French, stood bowing and smiling on the
threshold.Styvvisont has arrive'," he said; "he waits you.""Welcome to our city," Peter cried, appearing in the doorway of the
room Alphonse was indicating with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way."Jimmie's coming up from the
office and Beulah's due any minute.What do you think of the place,
girls?""It's really
ours, that's what it is.I've broken away from the mater at last," he
added a little sheepishly.I've got an
all-day desk job in my uncle's office and I'm going to dig in and see
what I can make of myself.Also, this is going to be our headquarters,
and Eleanor's permanent home if we're all agreed upon it,--but look
around, ladies.If you think I can interior
decorate, just tell me so frankly."It's like that old conundrum--black and white and red all over,"
Gertrude said."I never saw anything so stunning in all my life."I admire your nerve," Peter cried, "papering this place in
white, and then getting in all this heavy carved black stuff, and the
red in the tapestries and screens and pillows.""I wanted it to look studioish a little," David explained, "I wanted
to get away from Louis Quartorze.""And drawing-rooms like mother used to make," Gertrude suggested.Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian
or Chinese?The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous by its
absence.""I've got two portfolios full of 'em," David said, "and I always have
one or two up in the bedrooms.I change 'em around, you know, the way
the <DW61>s do themselves, a different scene every few days and the rest
decently out of sight till you're ready for 'em.""It's like a fairy story," Margaret said."I thought you'd appreciate what little Arabian Nights I was able to
introduce.I bought that screen," he indicated a sweep of Chinese line
and color, "with my eye on you, and that Aladdin's lamp is yours, of
course.You're to come in here and rub it whenever you like, and your
heart's desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you."Peter suggested, as David led the way through
the corridor and up the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment."This is her room, didn't you say, David?"He paused on the threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk."She once said that she wanted a yellow room," David said, "a
daffy-down-dilly room, and I've tried to get her one.I know last
year that Maggie Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor refused to be
comforted."A wild whoop in the below stairs announced Jimmie; and Beulah arrived
simultaneously with the tea tray.Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him."Headquarters is the one thing we've lacked," he said; "a place of our
own, hully gee!"You haven't been feeling altogether human lately, have you, Jimmie?""I'm a bad
egg," he explained to her darkly, "and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.""Scrambled is just about the way I should have described your behavior
of late,--but that's Gertrude's line," David said."Only she doesn't
seem to be taking an active part in the conversation.Aren't you
Jimmie's keeper any more, Gertrude?""Not since she's come back from abroad," Jimmie muttered without
looking at her."Eleanor's taken the job over now," Peter said."She's made him swear
off red ink and red neckties.""Any color so long's it's red is the color that suits me best," Jimmie
quoted."Lord, isn't this room a pippin?"He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a moment.It had been a
good many weeks since he had seen Gertrude."I want to give a suffrage tea here," Beulah broke in suddenly."It's
so central, but I don't suppose David would hear of it.""Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us--" Peter began."My _mother_ would hear of it," David said, "and then there wouldn't
be any little studio any more.She doesn't believe in votes for
women.""How any woman in this day and age--" Beulah began, and thought better
of it, since she was discussing Mrs."Makes your blood boil, doesn't it--Beulahland?"Gertrude suggested
helpfully, reaching for the tea cakes."Never mind, I'll vote for
women."The Lord helps those that help themselves," Peter said, "that's why
Gertrude is a suffragist.She believes in helping herself, in every
sense, don't you, 'Trude?""Not quite in every sense," Gertrude said gravely."Sometimes I feel
like that girl that Margaret describes as caught in a horrid way
between two generations."I'd rather be that way than early Victorian," Margaret sighed."Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody any objection to
having our child here for the holidays?""My idea is to
have one grand Christmas dinner.I suppose we'll all have to eat one
meal with our respective families, but can't we manage to get together
here for dinner at night?"We can't, but we will," Margaret murmured.I wanted her with me but the family thought otherwise.They've
been trying to send me away for my health, David."You'll stay in New York for your health and come
to my party.""Margaret's health is merely a matter of Margaret's happiness anyhow.Her soul and her body are all one," Gertrude said."Then cursed be he who brings anything but happiness to Margaret,"
Peter said, to which sentiment David added a solemn "Amen.""I wish you wouldn't," Margaret said, shivering a little, "I feel as
if some one were--were--"

"Trampling the violets on your grave," Gertrude finished for her.Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and Eleanor did not leave school
till the Friday before the great day.Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see her before the dinner
party itself.Even David was busy with his mother--installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her home until the opening
of the season at Palm Beach--and had only a few hurried words with
her.Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for the occasion, met her at
the station and helped her to do her modest shopping which consisted
chiefly of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles.She had arranged
these things lovingly at their plates, and fled to dress when they
began to assemble for the celebration.The girls were the first
arrivals."I had a few minutes' talk
with her over the telephone and she seemed to be flourishing.""She's grown several feet since we last saw
her.They've been giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and she's
been playing Juliet, it appears.She has had a fight with another girl
about suffrage--I don't know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me--and the other girl was
so unpleasant about it that she has been visited by just retribution
in the form of the mumps, and had to be sent home and quarantined.""Sounds a bit priggish," Peter suggested."Not really," David said, "she's as sound as a nut.She's only going
through the different stages.""To pass deliberately through one's ages," Beulah quoted, "is to get
the heart out of a liberal education.""Bravo, Beulah," Gertrude cried, "you're quite in your old form
to-night.""Is she just the same little girl, David?"I don't know why
she doesn't come down.No, it's only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie."Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived under the holiday
influence, was staggering under the weight of his parcels.The
Christmas presents had already accumulated to a considerable mound on
the couch.Margaret was brooding over them and trying not to look
greedy.She was still very much of a child herself in relation to
Santa Claus.My eyes--but you're a slick trio, girls.Pale
lavender, pale blue, and pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly
decollete.I don't know quite why
you do, but you do.""Give honor where honor is due, dearie.That's owing to the cleverness
of the decorator," David said."No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the tale," Jimmie remarked
almost dreamily as he squared off.But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.Alphonse
threw open the big entrance door at the farther end of the long room
with a flourish."Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet," he proclaimed with the grand air, and
then retired behind his hand, smiling broadly.Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and curls, softly rounding
bodice, and the long, straight lines of the Renaissance, stood
Juliet--Juliet, immemorial, immortal, young--austerely innocent and
delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet potential of all the beauty
and the wisdom of the world."I've never worn these clothes before anybody but the girls before,"
Eleanor said, "but I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you
might like it--for a surprise.""Great jumping Jehoshaphat," Jimmie exclaimed, "I thought you said she
was the same little girl, David.""She was half an hour ago," David answered, "I never saw such a
metamorphosis.In fact, I don't think I ever saw Juliet before.""She is the thing itself," Gertrude answered, the artist in her
sobered by the vision.But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes and stared at the delicate
figure advancing to him.she's a woman," he said, and drew the hard breath of a man
just awakened from sleep.[Illustration: "I thought"--she looked about her appealingly--"you might
like it--for a surprise"]




CHAPTER XV

GROWING UP


"Dear Uncle Jimmie:

"It was a pleasant surprise to get letters from every one of my uncles
the first week I got back to school.You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and Uncle Peter sixteen.He
is the best correspondent, but perhaps that is because I ask him the
most advice.I shall never forget the
expressions on all the different faces when I came down in my Juliet
suit.I thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I guess they
did."You know how well I liked my presents because you heard my wild
exclamations of delight.It was
sweet of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set, and to know that
every different piece was the loving thought of a different aunt or
uncle.It looks entirely unique, and I
like to have things that are not like anybody else's in the world,
don't you, Uncle Jimmie?They are
'neat,' but not 'gaudy.'You play golf so well I thought a golf stick
was a nice emblem for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer."I am glad you think it is easier to keep your pledge now.I made a
New Year's resolution to go without chocolates, and give the money
they would cost to some good cause, but it's hard to pick out a cause,
or to decide exactly how much money you are saving.I can eat the
chocolates that are sent to me, however!!!!"Uncle David said that he thought you were not like yourself lately,
but you seemed just the same to me Christmas, only more affectionate.I was really only joking about the chocolates.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle David:

"I was glad to get your nice letter.You did not have to write in
response to my bread and butter letter, but I am glad you did.When I
am at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as if I were
living two beautiful lives all at once, the life of a 'cooperative
child' and the life of Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together.Letters make the people you love seem very near to you, don't you
think they do?I sleep with all my letters under my pillow whenever I
feel the least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to breathe
sometimes.Maggie Lou had a wrist watch, too, for
Christmas, but not so pretty as the one you gave me.Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel like it.I don't know
whether that's a compliment or not.I took Kris Kringle for the
subject of a theme the other day, and represented him as caught in an
iceberg in the grim north, and not being able to reach all the poor
little children in the tenements and hovels.The Haddock said it
showed imagination."There was a lecture at school on Emerson the other day.The speaker
was a noted literary lecturer from New York.He had wonderful waving
hair, more like Pader--I can't spell him, but you know who I
mean--than Uncle Jimmie's, but a little like both.He introduced some
very noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly old ideas in
a new way that made you think a lot more of them.I think a tall man
like that with waving hair can do a great deal of good as a lecturer,
because you listen a good deal more respectfully than if they were
plain looking.His voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo's voice did.I had a nice letter from Madam Bolling.I love you,
and I have come to the bottom of the sheet.*       *       *       *       *

"Dear Uncle Peter:

"I have just written to my other uncles, so I won't write you a long
letter this time.They deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays.You always deserve letters, but not
specially now, any more than any other time."Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather.It seems funny to think of
Albertina's aunt taking care of him now that Grandma is gone.I
suppose Albertina is there a lot.She sent me a post card for
Christmas."Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the world.I remember how I
used to take care of her, and put a soapstone in the small of her
back when she was cold.I wish sometimes that I could hold your hand,
Uncle Peter, when I get thinking about it."Well, school is the same old school.Bertha Stephens has a felon on
her finger, and that lets her out of hard work for a while.I will
enclose a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on Emerson.It
isn't very good, but it will help to fill up the envelope."Life

                 "Life is a great, a noble task,
                   When we fulfill our duty.To work, that should be all we ask,
                   And seek the living beauty.We know not whence we come, or where
                   Our dim pathway is leading,
                 Whether we tread on lilies fair,
                   Or trample love-lies-bleeding.But we must onward go and up,
                   Nor stop to question whither.E'en if we drink the bitter cup,
                   And fall at last, to wither."P. S. I haven't got the last verse very good yet, but I think the
second one is pretty.You know 'love-lies-bleeding' is a flower, but
it sounds allegorical the way I have put it in.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor's fifteenth year was on the whole the least eventful year of
her life, though not by any means the least happy.She throve
exceedingly, and gained the freedom and poise of movement and
spontaneity that result from properly balanced periods of work and
play and healthful exercise.From being rather small of her age she
developed into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and erect,
with a small, delicate head set flower-wise on a slim white neck.Gertrude never tired of modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor
herself was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.She preferred
the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted type of beauty, and spent many
unhappy quarters of an hour wishing she were pretty according to the
inexorable ideals of Harmon.She spent her vacation at David's apartment in charge of Mademoiselle,
though the latter part of the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by
herself according to her own desire, and spent a month with her
grandfather, now in charge of Albertina's aunt.She found Albertina
grown into a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness, who
plied her with endless questions concerning life in the gilded circles
of New York society.Eleanor found her disgusting and yet possessed of
that vague fascination that the assumption of prerogative often
carries with it.She found her grandfather very old and shrunken, yet perfectly taken
care of and with every material want supplied.She realized as she had
never done before how the faithful six had assumed the responsibility
of this household from the beginning, and how the old people had been
warmed and comforted by their bounty.She laughed to remember her
simplicity in believing that an actual salary was a perquisite of her
adoption, and understood for the first time how small a part of the
expense of their living this faithful stipend had defrayed.She looked
back incredulously on that period when she had lived with them in a
state of semi-starvation on the corn meal and cereals and very little
else that her dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the "garden
sass," that her grandfather had faithfully hoed and tended in the
straggling patch of plowed field that he would hoe and tend no more.She spent a month practically at his feet, listening to his stories,
helping him to find his pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his final acknowledgment
that she was a good girl and he would as soon have her come again
whenever she felt like it.On her way back to school she spent a week with her friend, Margaret
Louise, in the Connecticut town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family.It was while she was on this visit that the most
significant event of the entire year took place, though it was a
happening that she put out of her mind as soon as possible and never
thought of it again when she could possibly avoid it.Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and one night in the corner of
a moonlit porch, when they happened to be alone for a half hour, he
had asked Eleanor to kiss him."I don't want to kiss you," Eleanor said.Then, not wishing to convey
a sense of any personal dislike to the brother of a friend to whom
she was so sincerely devoted, she added, "I don't know you well
enough."He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and rough tweed clothes that
hung on him loosely."When you know me better, will you let me kiss you?""I don't know," Eleanor said, still endeavoring to preserve the
amenities.He took her hand and played with it softly."You're an awful sweet little girl," he said.He pulled her back to the
chair from which she had half arisen."I don't believe in kissing _you_," she tried to say, but the words
would not come.She could only pray for deliverance through the
arrival of some member of the family.The boy's face was close to
hers.It looked sweet in the moonlight she thought.She wished he
would talk of something else besides kissing."Well, then, there's no more to be said."His breath came heavily, with little irregular catches
in it.She pushed him away and turned into the house."Don't be angry, Eleanor," he pleaded, trying to snatch at her hand."I'm not angry," she said, her voice breaking, "I just wish you
hadn't, that's all."There was no reference to this incident in the private diary, but,
with an instinct which would have formed an indissoluble bond between
herself and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit porches and boys
with mischievous eyes and broad tweed covered shoulders.For her guardians too, this year was comparatively smooth running and
colorless.Beulah's militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to her hand through her
new interest in suffrage.Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing.She had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when their first
delicate desires come to naught.She was very warm-blooded and eager
under her cool veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work and
hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she was too constrained to
get any emotional hold on.Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was
quite over and done with.Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished by the stuff that
dreams are made of, flourished strangely in her attic chamber, and
learned the wisdom of life by some curious method of her own of
apprehending its dangers and delights.The only experiences she had
that year were two proposals of marriage, one from a timid professor
of the romance languages and the other from a young society man,
already losing his waist line, whose sensuous spirit had been stirred
by the ethereal grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little.She was the princess, spinning fine dreams and waiting for the
dawning of the golden day when the prince should come for her.Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to the five-year-old vow
of celibacy, which was to Beulah as real and as binding as it had
seemed on the first day she took it.Peter and David and Jimmie went their own way after the fashion of
men, all of them identified with the quickening romance of New York
business life.David in Wall Street was proving to be something of a
financier to his mother's surprise and amazement; and the pressure
relaxed, he showed some slight initiative in social matters.In fact,
two mothers, who were on Mrs.Bolling's list as suitable
parents-in-law, took heart of grace and began angling for him
adroitly, while their daughters served him tea and made unabashed,
modern-debutante eyes at him.Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the top of his firm,
suffered intermittently from his enthusiastic abuse of the privileges
of liberty and the pursuit of happiness.His mind and soul were in
reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was no woman among those
with whom he habitually foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his
own woman.He was further rendered helpless and miserable by the fact
that he had not the slightest idea of his trouble.He regarded himself
as a congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self shrank at times
with a revulsion of loathing.Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a rather uninspired
earth.He was getting on in the woolen business, which happened to be
the vocation his father had handed down to him.He belonged to an
amusing club, and he still felt himself irrevocably widowed by the
early death of the girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life.It had seemed to him
for a few minutes at the Christmas party that she was no longer the
little girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive creature--a
woman--had come to displace her, but when she had flung her arms
around him he had realized that it was still the heart of a child
beating so fondly against his own.The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves the privileges of
parenthood is that our native instincts are likely to become deflected
by the substitution of the artificial for the natural responsibility.Both Peter and David had the unconscious feeling that their obligation
to their race was met by their communal interest in Eleanor.Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of an intellectual
concept of life was all that was required of her.Only Jimmie groped
blindly and bewilderedly for his own.Gertrude and Margaret both
understood that they were unnaturally alone in a world where lovers
met and mated, but they, too, hugged to their souls the flattering
unction that they were parents of a sort.Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted young men and
women, of marriageable age, with dozens of interests and sympathies in
common, and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued to walk side by
side in a state of inhuman preoccupation, their gaze fixed inward
instead of upon one another; and no Divine Power, happening upon the
curious circumstance, believed the matter one for His intervention nor
stooped to take the respective puppets by the back of their
unconscious necks, and so knock their sluggish heads together.CHAPTER XVI

MARGARET LOUISA'S BIRTHRIGHT


"I am sixteen years and eight months old to-day," Eleanor wrote, "and
I have had the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I never
wanted to be any older.I know life is full of disillusionment and
pain, but I did not know that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything to for four long
years, could turn out to be an absolute traitor and villainess.For nearly a year now I have noticed that
Bertha Stephens avoided me, and presented the appearance of disliking
me.I don't like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried to do
little things for her that would win back her affection, but with no
success.As I was editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes (as
she called them) and do her lots of little favors in a literary way,
which she seemed to appreciate, but personally she avoided me like the
plague."Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since Margaret Louise and I
always talked everything over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way.I remember that she used to try to draw me out about Stevie's
character.I've always thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is
that she would say she was going to do a thing, and then from sheer
laziness not do it.She gummed it
all up with her nasty fudge and then wouldn't give it back to me or
get me another, but the reason she wouldn't give it back to me was
because her feelings were too fine to return a damaged article, and
not fine enough to make her hump herself and get me another.That's
only one kind of a piker and not the worst kind, but it was
_pikerish_."All this I told quite frankly to Maggie--I mean Margaret Louise,
because I had no secrets from her and never thought there was any
reason why I shouldn't.Stevie has a horrid brother, also, who has
been up here to dances.All the girls hate him because he is so
spoony.He isn't as spoony as Margaret Louise's brother, but he's
quite a sloppy little spooner at that.Well, I told Margaret Louise
that I didn't like Stevie's brother, and then I made the damaging
remark that one reason I didn't like him was because he looked so much
like Stevie.I didn't bother to explain to Maggie--I will not call her
Maggie Lou any more, because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,--Margaret Louise--what I meant by this, because I
thought it was perfectly evident.Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a
snow white blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples.Well, her brother is
a snow white blond too, and he has pinky cheeks and dimples and his
name is Carlo!We, of course, at once named him Curlo.It is not a
good idea for a man to look too much like his sister, or to have too
many dimples in his chin and cheeks.I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number exactly.I don't mean
to use slang in my diary, but I can't seem to help it.Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function in the language--in
replenishing it, but Uncle Peter says about slang words, that'many
are called, and few are chosen,' and there is no need to try to
accommodate them all in one's vocabulary."Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things about Curlo, and how
he tried to hold my hand coming from the station one day, when the
girls all went up to meet the boys that came up for the dance,--and I
told her everything else in the world that happened to come into my
head."Then one day I got thinking about leaving Harmon--this is our senior
year, of course--and I thought that I should leave all the girls with
things just about right between us, excepting good old Stevie, who had
this queer sort of grouch against me.So I decided that I'd just go
around and have it out with her, and I did.I went into her room one
day when her roommate was out, and demanded a show down.Well, I found
out that Maggie--Margaret Louise had just repeated to Stevie every
living thing that I ever said about her, just as I said it, only
without the explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable."Stevie told me all these things one after another, without stopping,
and when she was through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.I was obliged to
gaze into Stevie's overflowing eyes and own up to the truth as well as
I could, and explain it.It was the most humiliating hour that I ever
spent, but I told Stevie exactly what I felt about her 'nothing
extenuate, and naught set down in malice,' and what I had said about
her to our mutual friend, who by the way, is not the mutual friend of
either of us any longer.We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other.There were one or two things
that she said she didn't think she would ever forget that I had said
about her, but even those she could forgive.She said that my dislike
of her had rankled in her heart so long that it took away all the
bitterness to know that I wasn't really her enemy.She said that my
coming to her that way, and not lying had showed that I had lots of
character, and she thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did."After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against hope that Margaret
Louise would turn out to have some reason or excuse for what she had
done.I knew she had done it, but when a thing like that happens that
upsets your whole trust in a person you simply can not believe the
evidence of your own senses.When you read of a situation like that
in a book you are all prepared for it by the author, who has taken the
trouble to explain the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you are to expect a
betrayal from him or her; but when it happens in real life out of a
clear sky you have nothing to go upon that makes you even _believe_
what you know."I won't even try to describe the scene that occurred between Margaret
Louise and me.She cried and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a backbiter, and she
argued and argued about all kinds of things but the truth, and when I
tried to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled and sidestepped in
a way that was dreadful.I've seen her do something like it before
about different things, and I ought to have known then what she was
like inside of her soul, but I guess you have to be the object of such
a scene before you realize the full force of it."All I said was, 'Margaret Louise, if that's all you've got to say
about the injury you have done me, then everything is over between us
from this minute;' and it was, too."I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful story or poem on what I
thought was an enduring tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on a slate.I don't
know whether it would seem like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or
not; I don't quite know whether I want to tell him.Sometimes I wish I
had a mother to tell such things to.It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.Disillusion is a very
strange thing--like death, only having people die seems more natural
somehow.When they die you can remember the happy hours that you spent
with them, but when disillusionment comes then you have lost even your
beautiful memories."We had for the subject of our theme this week, 'What Life Means to
Me,' which of course was the object of many facetious remarks from the
girls, but I've been thinking that if I sat down seriously to state in
just so many words what life means to _me_, I hardly know what I would
transcribe.It means disillusionment and death for one thing.Since my
grandfather died last year I have had nobody left of my own in the
world,--no real blood relation.Of course, I am a good deal fonder of
my aunts and uncles than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes you feel shivery to
be without.If I had been Margaret Louise's own flesh and blood, she
would never have acted like that to me.Stevie stuck up for Carlo as
if he was really something to be proud of.Perhaps my uncles and aunts
feel that way about me, I don't know.I don't even know if I feel that
way about them.I certainly criticize them in my soul at times, and
feel tired of being dragged around from pillar to post.I don't feel
that way about Uncle Peter, but there is nobody else that I am
certain, positive sure that I love better than life itself.If there
is only one in the world that you feel that way about, I might not be
Uncle Peter's one.I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her birthright for a mess of
pottage.I wish I had a home that I had a perfect right to go and live
in forevermore.I wish my mother was here to comfort me to-night."CHAPTER XVII

A REAL KISS


At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.She was to have one year
of preparatory school and then it was the desire of Beulah's heart
that she should go to Rogers.The others contended that the higher
education should be optional and not obligatory.The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had considered it in
all its bearings."If she doesn't decide in favor of college," David said, "and she
makes her home with me here, as I hope she will do, of course, I don't
see what society we are going to be able to give her.Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have growing daughters.She ought to meet
eligible young men and that sort of thing."The two were having a cozy cup of tea at
his apartment."You're so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten
me sometimes.""You don't know where I will end, is that the idea?""I don't know where Eleanor will end, if you're already thinking of
eligible young men for her.""Those things have got to be thought of," David answered gravely."I don't want her to be
married.I want to take her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while.Then I want Prince Charming to come along and snatch her
up quickly, and set her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her.If we've all got to get together and connive at marrying her
off there won't be any comfort in having her.""I don't know," David said thoughtfully; "I think that might be fun,
too.A vicarious love-affair that you can manipulate is one of the
most interesting games in the world.""That's not my idea of an interesting game," Margaret said."I like
things very personal, David,--you ought to know that by this time.""I do know that," David said, "but it sometimes occurs to me that
except for a few obvious facts of that nature I really know very
little about you, Margaret.""There isn't much to know--except that I'm a woman.""That's a good deal," David answered slowly; "to a mere man that seems
to be considerable of an adventure.""It is about as much of an adventure sometimes as it would be to be a
field of clover in an insectless world.--This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in it in wudges.No,
don't get any more, I've got to go home.Grandmother still thinks it's
very improper for me to call upon you, in spite of Mademoiselle and
your ancient and honorable housekeeper.""Don't go," David said; "I apologize on my knees for the cream.I'll
send out and have it wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state."About the cream, or the proprieties?"I'm a little bit tired of being
one, that's all, and I want to go home.""She wants to go home when she's being so truly delightful and
cryptic," David said."Have you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my
hearth fire?She rose and stood absently fitting
her gloves to her fingers."I don't know exactly what it was I saw,
but it was something that made me uncomfortable.It gives me the
creeps to talk about being a woman.David, do you know sometimes I
have a kind of queer hunch about Eleanor?I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly.I think that she is a very successful kind of
Frankenstein; but there are moments when I have the feeling that she's
going to be a storm center and bring some queer trouble upon us.I
wouldn't say this to anybody but you, David."As David tucked her in the car--he had arrived at the dignity of
owning one now--and watched her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too,
had his moment of clairvoyance.He felt that he was letting something
very precious slip out of sight, as if some radiant and delicate gift
had been laid lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn again.As if when the door closed on his friend Margaret some stranger, more
silent creature who was dear to him had gone with her.As soon as he
was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on the telephone to know if
she had arrived home safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting her down three flights
of stairs in the midst of her own dinner toilet."I had a kind of hunch, too," he told her, "and I felt as if I wanted
to hear your voice speaking.""If that's the way you feel about your chauffeur," she said, "you
ought to discharge him, but he brought me home beautifully."The difference between a man's moments of prescience and a woman's, is
that the man puts them out of his consciousness as quickly as he can,
while a woman clings to them fearfully and goes her way a little more
carefully for the momentary flash of foresight.David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed to find her in when
he called or telephoned, and the special impulse to seek her alone
again died naturally.One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed him that she
wished to come to New York for the week-end to do some shopping.He went to the train to meet her, and when the slender chic figure in
the most correct of tailor made suits appeared at the gateway, with an
obsequious porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he gave a sudden
gasp of surprise at the picture.He had been aware for some time of
the increase in her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically assuming
the airs and graces of womanhood, as small girl children masquerade in
the trailing skirts of their elders.He was accustomed to the idea
that she was growing up rapidly, but the fact that she was already
grown had never actually dawned on him until this moment."You look as if you were surprised to see me, Uncle David,--are you?"she said, slipping a slim hand, warm through its immaculate glove,
into his."You knew I was coming, and you came to meet me, and yet you
looked as surprised as if you hadn't expected me at all.""Surprised to see you just about expresses it, Eleanor.I was looking for a little girl in hair ribbons with her
skirts to her knees.""And a blue tam-o'-shanter?""And a blue tam-o'-shanter.I had forgotten you had grown up any to
speak of.""You see me every vacation," Eleanor grumbled, as she stepped into the
waiting motor."It isn't because you lack opportunity that you don't
notice what I look like.It's just because you're naturally
unobserving.""Peter and Jimmie have been making a good deal of fuss about your
being a young lady, now I think of it.Peter especially has been
rather a nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious moments of
triviality with the sweetly solemn thought that our little girl has
grown to be a woman now.""Oh, does _he_ think I'm grown up, does he really?"He's all the time wanting me to get you to
New York over the weekend, so that he can see if you are any taller
than you were the last time he saw you.""Are they coming to see me this evening?""Jimmie is going to look in.You
know she's on here from China with her daughter."She must be as grown up as I am," Eleanor said."I used to have her
room, you know, when I stayed with Uncle Peter."Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.He says she looks like
a heathen Chinee but otherwise is passable.I didn't know that you
added jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.""I'm not jealous," Eleanor protested; "or if I am it's only because
she's blood relation,--and I'm not, you know.""It's a good deal more prosaic to be a blood relation, if anybody
should ask you," David smiled."A blood relation is a good deal like
the famous primrose on the river's brim.""'A primrose by the river's brim a yellow primrose was to him,--and
nothing more,'" Eleanor quoted gaily."Why, what more--" she broke off
suddenly and  slightly."What more would anybody want to be than a yellow primrose by the
river's brim?""I don't know, I'm sure.I'm a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for me, as I told your
Aunt Margaret the other day.Now I think of it, though, you don't look
unlike a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.""That's because I've got a yellow ribbon on my hat."It has something to do with
youth and fragrance and the flowers that bloom in the spring.""The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la," Eleanor returned
saucily, "have nothing to do with the case.""She's learning that she has eyes, good Lord," David said to himself,
but aloud he remarked paternally, "I saw all your aunts yesterday.Gertrude gave a tea party and invited a great many famous tea party
types, and ourselves."Beulah was there, like the famous Queenie,
with her hair in a braid."She's gone in for dress reform now, you know, a kind
of middy blouse made out of a striped portiere with a kilted skirt of
the same material and a Scotch cap.Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar phenomenon these days.She's
growing better-looking and behaving worse every day of her life.""She's theory ridden and fad bitten.She'll come to a bad end if
something doesn't stop her.""Do you mean--stop her working for suffrage?I'm a suffragist, Uncle
David.""And quite right to remind me of it before I began slamming the cause.I mean the
way she's going after it.There are healthy ways of insisting on your
rights and unhealthy ways.Beulah's getting further and further off
key, that's all.Your poor old
cooperative father welcomes you to the associated hearthstone.""This front entrance looks more like my front entrance than any other
place does," Eleanor said.she asked the black elevator man, who beamed delightedly
upon her.I didn't know he had one," David chuckled."It takes a
woman--"

Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets and a five pound
box of the chocolates most in favor in the politest circles at the
moment."What's devouring you, papa?""Don't I always place
tributes at the feet of the offspring?""Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes," David said."It's only
the labels that surprised me.""She knows the difference, now," Jimmie answered, "what would you?"The night before her return to school it was decreed that she should
go to bed early.She had spent two busy days of shopping and "seeing
the family."She had her hours discussing her future with Peter, long
visits and talks with Margaret and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at
suffrage headquarters with Beulah, as well as long sessions in the
shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made her home now permanently
with David.She sat before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on the mantel, smoking his
after-dinner cigar, and watching her."I can't seem to make up my mind, Uncle David.""Yes, I'd love it,--if--"

"If what, daughter?""If I thought I could spare the time.""I'm going to earn my own living, you know."I've got to--in order to--to feel right about things.""Don't you like the style of living to which your cooperative parents
have accustomed you?""I love everything you've ever done for me, but I can't go on letting
you do things for me forever."It doesn't seem--right, that's all.""It's your New England conscience, Eleanor; one of the most specious
varieties of consciences in the world.It will always be tempting you
to do good that better may come.I don't know whether I would be better
fitted to earn my living if I went to business college or real
college."I can't think,--I'm stupefied.""Uncle Peter couldn't think, either.""Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to Peter?""He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks I'll change my
mind."Eleanor, we're all
able to afford you--the little we spend on you is nothing divided
among six of us.When did you come to
this extraordinary decision?"Bolling talked to me, I think.There are things she said that I've never forgotten.I told Uncle
Peter to think about it and then help me to decide which to do, and I
want you to think, Uncle David, and tell me truly what you believe
the best preparation for a business life would be.I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and my training there
would be more use to me than four years at college, but I don't
know.""You're an extraordinary young woman," David said, staring at her."I'm glad you broached this subject, if only that I might realize how
extraordinary, but I don't think anything will come of it, my dear.I
don't want you to go to college unless you really want to, but if you
do want to, I hope you will take up the pursuit of learning as a
pursuit and not as a means to an end."Then let's have no more of this nonsense of earning your own
living.""Are you really displeased, Uncle David?""I should be if I thought you were serious,--but it's bedtime.If
you're going to get your beauty sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on
it immediately."Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a little, and her head held
high.David watched the color coming and going in the sweet face and
the tender breast rising and falling with her quickening breath."I thought perhaps you would understand," she said.She had always kissed him "good night" until this visit, and he had
refrained from commenting on the omission before, but now he put out
his hand to her."There is only one way
for a daughter to say good night to her parent."She put up her face, and as she did so he caught the glint of tears in
her eyes."Why, Eleanor, dear," he said, "did you care?"With his arms still about her shoulder he stood looking down at her.A
hot tide of crimson made its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face."That was a real kiss, dear," he said slowly."We mustn't get such
things confused.I won't bother you with talking about it to-night, or
until you are ready.Until then we'll pretend that it didn't happen,
but if the thought of it should ever disturb you the least bit, dear,
you are to remember that the time is coming when I shall have
something to say about it; will you remember?""Yes, Uncle David," Eleanor said uncertainly, "but I--I--"

David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders."Go now," he said, and she obeyed him without further question.CHAPTER XVIII

BEULAH'S PROBLEM


Peter was shaving for the evening.His sister was giving a dinner
party for two of her husband's fellow bankers and their wives.After
that they were going to see the latest Belasco production, and from
there to some one of the new dancing "clubs,"--the smart cabarets that
were forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises to evade
the two o'clock closing law.Peter enjoyed dancing, but he did not as
a usual thing enjoy bankers' wives.He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the theater, on the
plea of having some work to do, and finally decided that his sister's
feelings would be hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so carefully.He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of lather and twisted his
shaving mirror to the most propitious angle from time to time.In the
room across the hall--Eleanor's room, he always called it to
himself--his young niece was singing bits of the Mascagni intermezzo
interspersed with bits of the latest musical comedy, in a rather
uncertain contralto."My last girl came from Vassar, and I don't know where to class her.""My last girl--" and
began at the beginning of the chorus again."My last girl came from
Vassar," which brought him by natural stages to the consideration of
the higher education and of Beulah, and a conversation concerning her
that he had had with Jimmie and David the night before."She's off her nut," Jimmie said succinctly."It's not exactly that
there's nobody home," he rapped his curly pate significantly, "but
there's too much of a crowd there.She's not the same old girl at all.She used to be a good fellow, high-brow propaganda and all.Now she's
got nothing else in her head."It's what hasn't happened to her that's addled her," David explained."It's these highly charged, hypersensitive young women that go to
pieces under the modern pressure.They're the ones that need licking
into shape by all the natural processes.""By which you mean a drunken husband and a howling family?""Feminism isn't the answer to
Beulah's problem.""It is the problem," David said; "she's poisoning herself with it.My cousin Jack
married a girl with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks,
temperament, and everything else, though she wasn't half so nice.She
got going the militant pace and couldn't stop herself.I never met her
at a dinner party that she wasn't tackling somebody on the subject of
man's inhumanity to woman.She ended in a sanitorium; in fact, they're
thinking now of taking her to the--"

"--bug house," Jimmie finished cheerfully."And in the beginning she was a perfectly good girl that needed
nothing in the world but a chance to develop along legitimate lines.""The frustrate matron," David agreed gravely."I wonder you haven't
realized this yourself, Gram.You're keener about such things than I
am.Beulah is more your job than mine.""You're the only one she listens to or looks up to.Go up and tackle
her some day and see what you can do."Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline," Jimmie said."I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of her taking herself
seriously as she always has.I had no idea it was anything to worry
about," Peter persisted."Are you sure she's in bad shape--that she's
got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism of the Species in its
most virulent form?They come out of _that_, you know.""She's batty," Jimmie nodded gravely."Go up and look her over," David persisted; "you'll see what we mean,
then.Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved the right side of his
face, and frowned prodigiously through the lather.He wished that he
had an engagement that evening that he could break in order to get to
see Beulah at once, and discover for himself the harm that had come to
his friend.He had always felt that he saw
a little more clearly than the others the virtue that was in the girl.He admired the pluck with which she made her attack on life and the
energy with which she accomplished her ends.There was to him
something alluring and quaint about her earnestness.The fact that her
soundness could be questioned came to him with something like a shock.As soon as he was dressed he was called to the telephone to talk to
David."Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose has been up to see
Beulah and pronounces it a case of nervous breakdown.He wants her to
try out <DW43>-analysis, and that sort of thing.He seems to feel that
it's serious.Margaret is fearfully upset, poor girl.So'm I, to tell
the truth.""And so am I," Peter acknowledged to himself as he hung up the
receiver.He was so absorbed during the evening that one of the
ladies--the wife of the fat banker--found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.The wife of the
thin banker, who was in his charge at the theater, got the benefit of
his effort to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably, and
found him delightful.By the time the evening was over he had decided
that Beulah should be pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever cost.It was
unthinkable that she should be wasted, or that her youth and splendid
vitality should go for naught.He found her eager to talk to him the next night when he went to see
her."Peter," she said, "I want you to go to my aunt and my mother, and
tell them that I've got to go on with my work,--that I can't be
stopped and interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and nurses.I
never felt better in my life, except for not being able to sleep, and
I think that is due to the way they have worried me.I live in a world
they don't know anything about, that's all.Even if they were right,
if I am wearing myself out soul and body for the sake of the cause,
what business is it of theirs to interfere?I'm working for the souls
and bodies of women for ages to come.What difference does it make if
my soul and body suffer?Peter
observed the unnatural light in them, the apparent dryness of her
lips, the two bright spots burning below her cheek-bones."Because," he answered her slowly, "I don't think it was the original
intention of Him who put us here that we should sacrifice everything
we are to the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.""That isn't the point at all, Peter.No man understands, no man can
understand.It's woman's equality we want emphasized, just literally
that and nothing more.You've pauperized and degraded us long
enough--"

"Thou canst not say I--" Peter began."Yes, you and every other man, every man in the world is a party to
it.""I had to get her going," Peter apologized to himself, "in order to
get a point of departure.Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear," he
added aloud."If you throw your influence with us instead of against us," she
conceded, "you're helping to right the wrong that you have permitted
for so long.""Well, granting your premise, granting all your premises, Beulah--and
I admit that most of them have sound reasoning behind them--your
battle now is all over but the shouting.There's no reason that you
personally should sacrifice your last drop of energy to a campaign
that's practically won already.""If you think the mere franchise is all I have been working for,
Peter,--"

"I don't.I know the thousand and one activities you women are
concerned with.I know how much better church and state always have
been and are bound to be, when the women get behind and push, if they
throw their strength right."Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and talked rationally and
well for some time.Just as Peter was beginning to feel that David and
Jimmie had been guilty of the most unsympathetic exaggeration of her
state of mind--unquestionably she was not as fit physically as
usual--she startled him with an abrupt change into almost hysterical
incoherence."I have a right to live my own life," she concluded, "and
nobody--nobody shall stop me.""We are all living our own lives, aren't we?""No woman lives her own life to-day," Beulah cried, still excitedly."Every woman is living the life of some man, who has the legal right
to treat her as an imbecile."How about the suffrage states, how about the women
who are already in the proud possession of their rights and
privileges?They are not technical imbeciles any longer according to
your theory.Every woman will be a super-woman in
two shakes,--so what's devouring you, as Jimmie says?""It's after all the states have suffrage that the big fight will
really begin," Beulah answered wearily."It's the habit of wearing the
yoke we'll have to fight then.""The anti-feminists," Peter said, "I see.Beulah, can't you give
yourself any rest, or is the nature of the cause actually suicidal?"To his surprise her tense face quivered at this and she tried to
steady a tremulous lower lip."I am tired," she said, a little piteously, "dreadfully tired, but
nobody cares.""They only want to stop me doing something they have no sympathy with.What do Gertrude and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life or
my failure or success?They take a sentimental interest in my health,
that's all.Do you suppose it made any difference to Jeanne d'Arc how
many people took a sympathetic interest in her health if they didn't
believe in what she believed in?""I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an interest in the position
of women, and to care about the things I cared about, but she's not
going to.""Not as fond as she is of Margaret."Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in honesty."She's so lukewarm she might just as well be an anti.They drag us back like
so much dead weight.""I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment to you," Peter mused,
"but she tries pretty hard to be all things to all parents, Beulah.You'll find she won't fail you if you need her.""I shan't need her," Beulah said, prophetically."I hoped she'd stand
beside me in the work, but she's not that kind.She'll marry early and
have a family, and that will be the end of her.""I wonder if she will," Peter said, "I hope so.She still seems such
a child to me.I believe in marriage, Beulah, don't you?"I made a vow once that I would never
marry and I've always believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got to go on.If there
are going to be women to carry on the fight they will have to be born
of the women who are fighting to-day.""It doesn't make any difference why
you believe it, if you do believe it.""It makes all the difference," Beulah said, but her voice softened."What I believe is more to me than anything else in the world,
Peter."I understand your point of view, Beulah.You
carry it a little bit too far, that's all that's wrong with it from my
way of thinking.""Will you help me to go on, Peter?"Tell them that they're all wrong in
their treatment of me.""I think I could undertake to do that"--Peter was convinced that a
less antagonistic attitude on the part of her relatives would be more
successful--"and I will.""You're the only one who comes anywhere near knowing," she said, "or
who ever will, I guess.I try so hard, Peter, and now when I don't
seem to be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much as it's
necessary for me to accomplish if I am to go on respecting myself,
every one enters into a conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all.The only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am thwarted and
opposed at every turn."Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably like _idee fixe_,"
Peter said to himself compassionately.He found her actual condition less dangerous but much more difficult
than he had anticipated.She was living wrong, that was the sum and
substance of her malady.Her life was spent confronting theories and
discounting conditions.She did not realize that it is only the
interest of our investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
the cause of living.Our capital strength and energy must be used for
the struggle for existence itself if we are to have a world of
balanced individuals.There is an arrogance involved in assuming
ourselves more humane than human that reacts insidiously on our health
and morals.Peter, looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt himself becoming
helpless with pity for a mind gone so far askew.He felt curiously
responsible for Beulah's condition."She wouldn't have run herself so far aground," he thought, "if I had
been on the job a little more.I could have helped her to steer
straighter.A word here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right.Now something's got to stop her or she can't be
stopped.She'll preach once too often out of the tail of a cart on the
subject of equal guardianship,--and--"

Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and, sinking back into the
depths of the big cushioned chair on the edge of which she had been
tensely poised during most of the conversation, burst into tears."You're the only one that knows," she sobbed over and over again."I'm so tired, Peter, but I've got to go on and on and on.If they
stop me, I'll kill myself."Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down on her chair-arm."Don't cry, dear," he said, with a hand on her head."You're too tired
to think things out now,--but I'll help you."She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so startlingly like that of
the dead girl he had loved that his senses were confused by the
resemblance."I think I see the way," he said slowly.He slipped to his knees and gathered her close in his arms."I think this will be the way, dear," he said very gently."Does this mean that you want me to marry you?"she whispered, when
she was calmer."If you will, dear," he said."I will,--if I can, if I can make it seem right to after I've thought
it all out.--Oh!"I had no idea of that," he said gravely, "but it's wonderful that
you do.I'll put everything I've got into trying to make you happy,
Beulah."Her arms closed around his neck and
tightened there.He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a tired child, almost
asleep under his soothing hand, and the quiet spell of his
tenderness."I didn't know it could be like this," she whispered.In his heart he was saying, "This is best.It
is the right and normal way for her--and for me."In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new school which she was not
sharing with any one this year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and
yellow wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.Her hair hung
in two golden brown braids over her shoulders and her pure profile was
bent intently over the paper.At the moment when Beulah made her
confession of love and closed her eyes against the breast of the man
who had just asked her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor's lids and splashed down upon her letter.CHAPTER XIX

MOSTLY UNCLE PETER


"Dear Uncle Peter," the letter ran, "I am very, very homesick and
lonely for you to-day.It seems to me that I would gladly give a whole
year of my life just for the privilege of being with you, and talking
instead of writing,--but since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me.I can't bear it alone
any longer, and still I don't know whether it is the kind of thing
that it is honorable to tell or not.So you see I am very much
troubled and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one else in a way
that it is terrible to think of."Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.Not until I have
grown up, and seen something of the world.You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I am a Feminist or a
new woman, or have 'the unnatural belief of an antipathy to man' that
you're always talking about, but just because it will prove to me once
and for all that I belong to myself, and that my _soul_ isn't, and
never has been cooperative.You know what I mean by this, and you are
not hurt by my feeling so.You, I am sure, would not want me to be
married, or to have to think of myself as engaged, especially not to
anybody that we all knew and loved, and who is very close to me and
you in quite another way.Please don't try to imagine what I mean,
Uncle Peter--even if you know, you must tell yourself that you don't
know.Please, please pretend even to yourself that I haven't written
you this letter.I know people do tell things like this, but I don't
know quite how they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything--everything."Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going to be married by and by
when the one who wants it feels that it can be spoken of, and until
that happens, I've got to wait for him to speak, unless I can find
some way to tell him that I do not want it ever to be.I don't know
how to tell him.I don't know how to make him feel that I do not
belong to him.It is only myself I belong to, and I belong to you, but
I don't know how to make that plain to any one who does not know it
already.I can't say it unless perhaps you can help me to.I know every girl always thinks
there is something different about her, but I think there are ways in
which I truly am different.When I want anything I know more clearly
what it is, and why I want it than most other girls do, and not only
that, but I know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything I
think and feel and am,--_sacred_.There is an inner shrine in a
woman's soul that she must keep inviolate."A liberty that you haven't known how, or had the strength to prevent,
is a terrible thing.Uncle Peter, dear, twice in
my life things have happened that drive me almost desperate when I
think of them.If these things should happen again when I know that I
don't want them to, I don't think there would be any way of my bearing
it.Perhaps you can tell me something that will make me find a way out
of this tangle.I don't see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that were not grown up
troubles like this, but seemed very real to me just the same."Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,--you are all I have.I wish you were
here to-night, though you wouldn't be let in, even if you beat on the
gate ever so hard, for it's long after bedtime.I am up in my tower
room all alone.*       *       *       *       *

Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a tear splotched envelope
to Peter.Then she slowly tore letter and envelope into little bits."He would know," she said to herself."I haven't any real right to
tell him.It would be just as bad as any kind of tattling."She began another letter to him but found she could not write without
saying what was in her heart, and so went to bed uncomforted.There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her relation to David.His kiss on her lips had taught her the nature of such kisses: had
made her understand suddenly the ease with which the strange, sweet
spell of sex is cast.She related it to the episode of the unwelcome
caress bestowed upon her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.She
understood now how she should have repelled that unconscionable boy,
but that understanding did not help her with the problem of her Uncle
David.Though the thought of it thrilled through her with a strange
incredible delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon her
lips."It's--it's--like that," she said to herself."I want it to be from
somebody--else.Somebody that would make it
seem right."She felt that she
must get upon her own feet quickly and be under no obligation to any
man.Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning to indicate
the way that she should tread.No man or woman who did not understand
"the value of a dollar," was properly equipped to do battle with the
realities of life.The value of a dollar, and a clear title to
it--these were the principles upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect.Her Puritan fathers had
bestowed this heritage upon her.She had always felt the irregularity
of her economic position; now that the complication of her relation
with David had arisen, it was beginning to make her truly
uncomfortable.David had been very considerate of her, but his consideration
frightened her.He had been so afraid that she might be hurt or
troubled by his attitude toward her that he had explained again, and
almost in so many words that he was only waiting for her to grow
accustomed to the idea before he asked her to become his wife.She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to the Easter vacation
following the establishment of their one-sided understanding, but
David relieved her apprehension by putting up at his club and leaving
her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.There, with
Mademoiselle still treating her as a little girl, and the other five
of her heterogeneous foster family to pet and divert her at intervals,
she soon began to feel her life swing back into a more accustomed and
normal perspective.David's attitude to her was as simple as ever, and
when she was with the devoted sextet she was almost able to forget the
matter that was at issue between them--almost but not quite.She took quite a new kind of delight in her association with the
group.She found herself suddenly on terms of grown up equality with
them.Her consciousness of the fact that David was tacitly waiting
for her to become a woman, had made a woman of her already, and she
looked on her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even though a very
newly fledged and timorous one.She was a trifle self-conscious with the others, but with Jimmie she
was soon on her old familiar footing.*       *       *       *       *

"Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun," she wrote in her diary."He does just the same old things he used to do with me, and a good
many new ones in addition.He brings me flowers, and gets me taxi-cabs
as if I were really a grown up young lady, and he pinches my nose and
teases me as if I were still the little girl that kept house in a
studio for him.I never realized before what a good-looking man he is.I used to think that Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally good-looking.Uncle David has a great deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle
Jimmie is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic looking
into the bargain.The ladies on the Avenue all turn to look at him
when we go walking.He says that the gentlemen all turn to look at
me, and I think perhaps they do when I have my best clothes on, but in
my school clothes I am quite certain that nothing like that happens."I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday
and Friday,--four days of my vacation.We've been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we've dined at Sherry's, and one night we went down
to the little Italian restaurant where I had my first introduction to
_eau rougie_, and was so distressed about it.I shall never forget
that night, and I don't think Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing
me about it.It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much, but I never
seem to see Uncle Peter any more.Alphonse is very careful about
taking messages, I know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter must
have telephoned more times than I know of.It does seem as if he
would, at least, try to see me long enough to have one of our old time
talks again.To see him with all the others about is only a very
