Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.Bridget, with whom I remained, as long as I was in the White
Nunnery.On my tenth birthday, the Bishop came to the Abbess very early in the
morning, and informed her that I was to take the White Veil that day,
and immediately after the ceremony, I would leave for the Grey Nunnery
in Montreal.He desired her to make all the necessary preparation, and
take her leave of me, as she would not see me again.This was sad news
for us both, for I felt that she was my only friend, and I knew that she
felt for me, the most sincere affection.She gave me much good advice in
reference to my future conduct, and with tears exhorted me to be kind,
cheerful, and obedient.I was going to a new place, she said, and if I
was a good girl, and sought to please my superiors, I would find some
one to be kind to me.She advised me to try and appear contented
in whatever situation I might be placed, and above all other
considerations, never disobey the least command."Obedience," she again
repeated, "is the rule in all convents, and it will be better for you to
obey at once, and cheerfully, and willingly comply with every request,
than to incur displeasure and perhaps punishment, by any appearance of
reluctance or hesitation.If there is any one thing that you dislike to
do, be sure that you do not betray your feelings, for if you do, that
will be the very thing they will require of you; and I assure you, if
you once become the object of suspicion or dislike, your condition will
be anything but agreeable.You will be marked and watched, and required
to do many unpleasant things, to say the least.Therefore I hope you
will perform all your duties with a cheerful and willing spirit."Bitterly did I grieve at the thought of being separated from the only
being on earth who seemed to care for me.In the anguish of the moment,
I wished I might die.Bridget reproved me, saying encouragingly
that death was the coward's refuge, sought only by those who had not the
resolution to meet, endure, or overcome the trials of life.She exhorted
me to courage, perseverance and self denial, saying that if I fought
life's battle bravely, I would have my reward.She changed all my clothes, and assisted me to put on a white dress
and cape, and a white cap and veil.She then gave me a card of good
behavior, embraced me for the last time, and led me out to the Bishop,
who was waiting to conduct me to the chapel where the ceremony was to be
performed.I there met ten other little girls, who, like myself, were compelled
to take upon themselves vows they did not understand, and thus, by an
apparently voluntary act, consign themselves to slavery for life.They
were all strangers to me, sent here, as I afterwards learned, from some
nunnery in Ireland, where they had friends who were too solicitous for
their welfare.The priests do not wish the nuns to see friends from the
world, and they will frame almost any plausible excuse to prevent it.But when the friends become too urgent, as they sometimes do, and their
inventive powers are taxed too severely, or if the task of furnishing so
many excuses become too irksome, the poor hapless victims are sent
off to some other nunnery, and the friends are told that they were not
contented, and wished to go to some other place, and that they, generous
creatures that they are, have at length, after much solicitation, kindly
consented to their removal.And this too, when they know that these very
girls are grieving their lives away, for a sight of those dear friends,
who, they are confidently assured, are either dead, or have entirely
forgotten them!Can the world of woe itself furnish deceit of a darker
dye?The Bishop led me up to the altar, and put a lighted candle into my
hand.He then went under the altar, on which a lighted candle was
placed, and soon returned followed by two little boys whom they called
apostles.They held, each, a lighted torch with which they proceeded to
light two more candles.On a table near the altar, stood a coffin, and
soon two priests entered, bearing another coffin, which they placed
beside the other.A white cloth was spread over them, and burning
candles placed at the head and foot.These movements frightened me
exceedingly, for I thought they were going to kill me.Forgetting in my terror that I was not allowed to speak, I asked the
Bishop if he was going to kill me.he exclaimed, "O no;
don't be frightened; I shall not hurt you in the least.But it is our
custom, when a nun takes the veil, to lay her in a coffin to show that
she is dead to the world.I told him
she did not, but I did not dare to tell him that I supposed she felt
so bad when she found I must leave her, that she entirely forgot it.He
then asked very pleasantly, which of the two coffins I liked the best,
saying I could have my choice.This was
true, for although he assured me to the contrary, I still believed he
was about to kill me, and I cared very little about my coffin.They were
both large enough for a grown person, and beautifully finished, with a
large silver plate on the lid.The Bishop took me up in his arms, and
laid me in one of them, and bade me close my eyes.I lay in that coffin a long time, as it seemed to me, without the least
motion.I was so much alarmed, I felt as though I could not even lift
a finger.Meantime the Bishop and priests read alternately from a book,
but in a language I could not understand.Occasionally they would come
and feel my hands and feet, and say to each other, "She is very cold."I believe they were afraid I should die in their hands, of fear.When
at last they took me up, they told me that I would carry that coffin
to Montreal with me--that I would be laid in it when robed for the
grave--and that my bones would moulder to dust in it.I shall never
forget the impression these words made on my mind.There was something
so horrible in the thought of carrying a coffin about with me all my
life, constantly reminding me of the shortness of time, and the sure
approach of death, I could not endure it.Gladly would I have left it,
costly and elegant as it was, choosing rather to run the risk of being
buried without one, but this was not allowed.I could have no choice in
the matter.I was taken to a small room, and a woman
assisted me to change my clothes again, and put on the Grey Nunnery
suit.This consisted of a grey dress and shoes, and a black cap.Each
nunnery has a peculiar dress which every nun is required to wear.Thus,
on meeting one of them, it is very easy to tell what establishment she
belongs to, and a run-away is easily detected.On leaving the chapel, I
was taken to the steamboat, with the other ten girls, accompanied by a
priest.Our coffins were packed in cotton, and placed on the boat with
us.On our arrival at Montreal, we found a priest and two nuns waiting
for us to conduct us to the nunnery.It is four
stories high, besides the basement.It occupies a large space of ground,
I do not know how much, but it is a very extensive building.The roof
is covered with tin, with a railing around it, finished at the top with
sharp points that look like silver, about a foot in length, and
three feet apart.Over the front door there is a porch covered with a
profusion of climbing plants, which give it a beautiful appearance.The building stands in a large yard, surrounded on all sides by a high
fence, so high indeed, that people who pass along the street can see
no part of the nunnery except the silver points on the roof.The top of
this fence is also finished with long iron spikes.Every thing around
the building seems expressly arranged to keep the inmates in, and
intruders out.In fact it would be nearly impossible for any one to gain
a forcible or clandestine admittance to any part of the establishment.There are several gates in the fence, how many I do not know, but the
front gate opens on St.Over each of the gates hangs a bell,
connected with the bells in the rooms of the Superior and Abbesses,
which ring whenever the gate is opened.There is always a guard of two
men at each gate, who walk up and down with guns upon their shoulders.While attempting to give a brief description of this building, I may as
well say that it is constructed with non-conductors between the walls,
so that the ringing of a bell, or the loudest shriek, could not be heard
from one room to the other.The reader will please bear this in mind, as
the reason for the precaution will appear in the course of my narrative.The priest, who met us as we left the boat, conducted us to the front
door and rang the bell.Soon a lady appeared, who drew a slide in the
middle of the door, exposing one pane of glass.Through this she looked,
to see who was there, and when satisfied on this point, opened the
door.Here let me remark, that since I left the nunnery, I have heard of
another class of people who find it convenient to have a slide in their
door; and if I am not very much mistaken, the character of the two
houses, or rather the people who live in them, are very much
alike, whether they are nunneries of private families, Catholics or
Protestants.Honest people have no need of a slide in the door, and
where there is so much precaution, may we not suppose that something
behind the curtain imperatively calls for it?It is an old adage, but
true notwithstanding, that "where there is concealment, there must be
something wrong."In the hall opposite the front door were two other doors, with a
considerable space between them.The right hand door was opened by the
door-tender, and we entered a room furnished in the plainest manner, but
every thing was neat, and in perfect order.Instead of chairs, on two
sides of the room a long bench was fastened to the sides of the house.They were neither painted, nor cushioned, but were very white, as was
also the floor, on which there was no carpet.Beside the door stood
a basin of holy water, and directly opposite, an image of the Saviour
extended on the cross which they call a crucifix.Here we were left a few moments, then the door-keeper came back, and
asked us if we would like to see the Black Cloisters; and if so, to
follow her.She led us back into the hall, and in the space between the
two doors that I mentioned, she unlocked a bar, and pulling it down,
touched a spring, and immediately a little square door slid back into
the ceiling.Across this door, or window or whatever they called it,
were strong bars of iron about one inch apart.Through this aperture
we were allowed to look, and a sad sight met my eyes.As many as fifty
disconsolate looking ladies were sitting there, who were called Black
Nuns, because they were preparing to take the Black Veil.They were all
dressed in black, a black cap on the head, and a white bandage drawn
across the forehead, to which another was attached, that passed under
the chin.These bandages they always wore, and were not allowed to lay
aside.They sat, each one with a book in her hand, motionless as so many
statues.Not a finger did they move, not an eye was raised, but they
sat gazing upon the page before them as intently as though life itself
depended upon it.Our guide informed us that they were studying the
[footnote] Black Book preparatory to taking the Black Veil and entering
the Cloister.It was very large, with a
white cover, and around the edge a black border about an inch wide.[Footnote: "The Black Book, or Praxis Sacra Romance Inquisitionis, is
always the model for that which is to succeed it.This book is a large
manuscript volume, in folio, and is carefully preserved by the head of
the Inquisition.It is called Libro Nero, the Black Book, because it
has a cover of that color; or, as an inquisitor explained to me, Libro
Necro, which, in the Greek language, signifies 'The book of the dead.'"In this book is the criminal code, with all the punishments for every
supposed crime; also the mode of conducting the trial, so as to elicit
the guilt of the accused; and the manner of receiving accusations.I had
this book in my hand on one occasion, and read therein the proceedings
relative to my own case; and I moreover saw in this same volume some
very astounding particulars; for example, in the list of punishments I
read concerning the bit, or as it is called by us THE MORDACCHIA, which
is a very simple contrivance to confine the tongue, and compress it
between two cylinders composed of iron and wood and furnished with
spikes.This horrible instrument not only wounds the tongue and
occasions excessive pain, but also, from the swelling it produces;
frequently places the sufferer in danger of suffocation.This torture is
generally had recourse to in cases considered as blasphemy against
God, the Virgin, the Saints, or the Pope.So that according to the
Inquisition, it is as great a crime to speak disparagingly of a pope,
who may be a very detestable character, as to blaspheme the holy name
of God.Be that as it may, this torture has been in use till the present
period; and, to say nothing of the exhibitions of this nature which were
displayed in Romanga, in the time of Gregory 16th., by the Inquisitor
Ancarani--in Umbria by Stefanelli, Salva, and others, we may admire
the inquisitorial seal of Cardinal Feretti, the cousin of his present
holiness, who condescended more than once to employ these means when he
was bishop of Rieti and Fermo."Dealings with the Inquisition, by the
Rev.Giacinto Achilli D. D., late Prior and Visitor of the Dominican
Order, Head Professor of Theology and Vicar of the master of the Sacred
Apostolic Palace, etc., etc., page 81.]Our curiosity being satisfied as far as possible, we returned to the
side room, where we waited long for the lady Superior.When at length
she came, she turned to me first, as I sat next the door, and asked me
if I had anything to show in proof of my former good character.I gave
her my card; she looked at it, and led me to the other side of the room.The same question was asked of every girl in turn, when it was found
that only four beside myself had cards of good behavior.The other six
presented cards which she said were for bad behavior.They were all
placed together on the other side of the room; and as the Superior was
about to lead them away, one of them came towards us saying that she
did not wish to stay with those girls, she would rather go with us.The Superior drew her back, and replied, "No, child; you cannot go with
those good girls; you would soon learn them some of your naughty ways.If you will do wrong, you must take the consequences."Then, seeing that
the child really felt very bad, she said, in a kinder tone, "When you
learn to do right, you shall be allowed to go with good girls, but not
before."I pitied the poor child, and for a long time I hoped to see her
come to our room; but she never came.They were all led off together,
and that was the last I ever saw of any of them.I was taken, with the other four girls, to a room on the second floor.Here we found five cribs, one for each of us, in which we slept.Our
food was brought to us regularly, consisting of one thin slice of fine
wheat bread for each of us, and a small cup of milk.It was only in
the morning, however, that the milk was allowed us, and for dinner and
supper we had a slice of bread and a cup of water.This was not half
enough to satisfy our hunger; but we could have no more.For myself I
can say that I was hungry all the time, and I know the others were also;
but we could not say so to each other.We were in that room together
five weeks, yet not one word passed between us.We did sometimes smile,
or shake our heads, or make some little sign, though even this was
prohibited, but we never ventured to speak.We were forbidden to do
so, on pain of severe punishment; and I believe we were watched all the
time, and kept there, for a trial of our obedience.We were employed in
peeling a soft kind of wood for beds, and filling the ticks with it.We
were directed to make our own beds, keep our room in the most perfect
order, and all our work in the middle of the floor.The Superior came up
every morning to see that we were thoroughly washed, and every Saturday
she was very particular to have our clothes and bed linen all changed.As every convenience was provided in our rooms or the closets adjoining,
we were not obliged to go out for anything, and for five weeks I did not
go out of that room.My bed was then brought from Quebec, and we were moved to a large square
room, with four beds in it, only two of which were occupied.We were
then sent to the kitchen, where in future, we were to be employed in
cleaning sauce, scouring knives and forks, and such work as we were able
to do.As we grew older, our tasks were increased with our strength.I
had no regular employment, but was called upon to do any of the drudgery
that was to be done about the house.The Superior came to the kitchen
every morning after prayers and told us what to do through the day.Then, in her presence we were allowed five minutes conversation, a
priest also being present.For the rest of the day we kept a profound
silence, not a word being spoken by any of us unless in answer to a
question from some of our superiors.In one part of the building there was a school for young ladies, who
were instructed in the various branches of education usually taught in
Catholic schools.Many of the scholars boarded at the nunnery, and all
the cooking and washing was done in the kitchen.We also did the cooking
for the saloons in Montreal.If this did not keep us employed, there
were corn brooms and brushes to make, and thus every moment was fully
occupied.Not a moment of leisure, no rest, no recreation, but hard
labor, and the still more laborious religious exercises, filled up the
time.It was sometimes very annoying to me to devote so many hours to
mere external forms; for I felt, even when very young, that they were
of little worth.But it was a severe trial to our temper to make so many
pies, cakes, puddings, and all kinds of rich food, which we were never
allowed to taste.The priests, superiors, and the scholars had every
luxury they desired; but the nuns, who prepared all their choice
dainties, were never permitted to taste anything but bread and water.I am well aware that this statement will seem incredible, and that
many will doubt the truth of it; but I repeat it: the nuns in the Grey
Nunnery, or at least those in the kitchen with me, were allowed no food
except bread and water, or, in case of illness, water gruel.The Grey Nunnery is said to be an orphan's home, and no effort is spared
to make visitors believe that this is the real character of the house.I suppose it is true that one part of it is devoted to this purpose; at
least my Superior informed me that many children were kept there; and
to those apartments visitors are freely admitted, but never to that part
occupied by the nuns.We were never allowed to communicate with people
from the world, nor with the children.In fact, during all the time I
was there, I never saw one of them, nor did I ever enter the rooms where
they were.In the ladies' school there were three hundred scholars, and in our
part of the house two hundred and fifty nuns, besides the children who
belonged to the nunnery.Add to these the abbesses, superiors, priests,
and bishop, and one will readily imagine that the work for such a family
was no trifling affair.In this nunnery the Bishop was the highest authority, and everything was
under his direction, unless the Pope's Nuncio, or some other high
church functionary was present.I sometimes saw one whom they called
the Archbishop, who was treated with great deference by the priests, and
even by the Bishop himself.The Holy Mother, or Lady Superior, has power over all who have taken or
are preparing to take the veil.Under her other superiors or abbesses
are appointed over the various departments, whose duty it is to look
after the nuns and novices, and the children in training for nuns.The
most rigid espionage is kept up throughout the whole establishment; and
if any of these superiors or abbesses fail to do the duty assigned
them, they are more severely punished than the nuns.Whenever the Lady
Superior is absent the punishments are assigned by one of the priests.Of these there were a large number in the nunnery; and whenever we
chanced to meet one of them, as we sometimes did when going about the
house, or whenever one of them entered the kitchen, we must immediately
fall upon our knees.No matter what we were doing, however busily
employed, or however inconvenient it might be, every thing must be
left or set aside, that this senseless ceremony might be performed.The
priest must be honored, and woe to the poor nun who failed to move with
sufficient alacrity; no punishment short of death itself was thought too
severe for such criminal neglect.Sometimes it would happen that I would
be engaged in some employment with my back to the door, and not observe
the entrance of a priest until the general movement around me would
arrest my attention; then I would hasten to "make my manners," as the
ceremony was called; but all too late.I had been remiss in duty, and no
excuse would avail, no apology be accepted, no forgiveness granted; the
dreaded punishment must come.While the nuns are thus severely treated, the priests, and the Holy
Mother live a very easy life, and have all the privileges they wish.So far as the things of this world are concerned, they seem to enjoy
themselves very well.But I have sometimes wondered if conscience did
not give them occasionally, an unpleasant twinge; and from some things I
have seen, I believe, that with many of them, this is the fact.They may
try to put far from them all thoughts of a judgment to come, yet I
do believe that their slumbers are sometimes disturbed by fearful
forebodings of a just retribution which may, after all, be in store for
them.But whatever trouble of mind they may have, they do not allow it
to interfere with their worldly pleasures, and expensive luxuries.They
have money enough, go when, and where they please, eat the richest food
and drink the choicest wines.In short, if sensual enjoyment was
the chief end of their existence, I do not know how they could act
otherwise.The Abbesses are sometimes allowed to go out, but not unless
they have a pass from one of the priests, and if, at any time, they have
reason to suspect that some one is discontented, they will not allow any
one to go out of the building without a careful attendant.My Superior here, as in the White Nunnery, was very kind to me.I
sometimes feared she would share the fate of Father Darity, for she had
a kind heart, and was guilty of many benevolent acts, which, if known,
would have subjected her to very serious consequences.I became so much
attached to her, that my fears for her were always alarmed when she
called me her good little girl, or used any such endearing expression.The sequel of my story will show that my fears were not unfounded; but
let me not anticipate.Sorrows will thicken fast enough, if we do not
hasten them.I lived with this Superior one year before I was consecrated, and it
was, comparatively, a happy season.I was never punished unless it was
to save me from less merciful hands; and then I would be shut up in a
closet, or some such simple thing.The other four girls who occupied the
room with me, were consecrated at the same time.The Bishop came to our room early one morning, and took us to the
chapel.At the door we were made to kneel, and then crawl on our hands
and knees to the altar, where sat a man, who we were told, was the
Archbishop.Two little boys came up from under the altar, with the
vesper lamp to burn incense.I suppose they were young Apostles, for
they looked very much like those we had seen at the White Nunnery, and
were dressed in the same manner.The Bishop turned his back, and they
threw incense on his head and shoulders, until he was surrounded by a
cloud of smoke.He bowed his head, smote upon his breast, and repeated
something in latin, or some other language, that we did not understand.We were told to follow his example, and did so, as nearly as possible.This ceremony over, the Bishop told us to go up on to the altar on our
knees, and when this feat was performed to his satisfaction, he placed a
crown of thorns upon each of our heads.These crowns were made of
bands of some firm material, which passed over the head and around the
forehead.On the inside thorns were fastened, with the points downward,
so that a very slight pressure would cause them to pierce the skin.This
I suppose is intended to imitate the crown of thorns which our Saviour
wore upon the cross.But what will it avail them to imitate the
crucifixion and the crown of thorns, while justice and mercy are so
entirely neglected?What will it avail to place a crown of thorns upon
a child's head, or to bid her kneel before the image of the Saviour, or
travel up stairs on her knees, while the way of salvation by Christ is
never explained to her; while of real religion, holiness of heart,
and purity of life she is as ignorant as the most benighted, degraded
heathen?Is it rational to suppose that the mere act of repeating
a prayer can heal the wounded spirit, or give peace to a troubled
conscience?Can the most cruel penance remove the sense of guilt, or
whisper hope to the desponding soul?I have tried it long enough
to speak with absolute certainty.For years I practiced these senseless
mummeries, and if there were any virtue, in them, I should, most
certainly have discovered it.But I know full well, and my reader knows
that they cannot satisfy the restless yearnings of the immortal mind.They may delude the vulgar, but they cannot dispel the darkness of the
tomb, they cannot lead a soul to Christ.On leaving the chapel after the ceremony, I found a new Superior,
waiting for us at the door to conduct us to our rooms.We were all very
much surprised at this, but she informed us that our old Superior died
that morning, that she was already buried, and she had come to take her
place.I could not believe this story, for she came to us as usual that
morning, appeared in usual health, though always very pale, and made no
complaint, or exhibited any signs of illness.She told us in her kind
and pleasant way that we were to be consecrated, gave us a few words of
advice, but said nothing about leaving us, and I do not believe she even
thought of such a thing.Little did I think, when she left us, that I
was never to see her again.In just two hours and a half
from that time, we were told that she was dead and buried, and another
filled her place!I wonder if they thought we
believed it!But whether we did or not, that was all we could ever know
about it.No allusion was ever made to the subject, and nuns are not
allowed to ask questions.However excited we might feel, no information
could we seek as to the manner of her death.Whether she died by
disease, or by the hand of violence; whether her gentle spirit
peacefully winged its way to the bosom of its God, or was hastily driven
forth upon the dagger's point, whether some kind friend closed her eyes
in death, and decently robed her cold limbs for the grave, or whether
torn upon the agonizing rack, whether she is left to moulder away in
some dungeon's gloom, or thrown into the quickly consuming fire, we
could never know.These, and many other questions that might have been
asked, will never be answered until the last great day, when the grave
shall give up its dead, and, the prison disclose its secrets.After the consecration we were separated, and only one of the girls
remained with me.We were put into a large
room, where were three beds, one large and two small ones.In the large
bed the Superior slept, while I occupied one of the small beds and the
other little nun the other.Our new Superior was very strict, and we
were severely punished for the least trifle--such, for instance, as
making a noise, either in our own room or in the kitchen.We might not
even smile, or make motions to each other, or look in each other's face.We must keep our eyes on our work or on the floor, in token of humility.To look a person full in the face was considered an unpardonable act of
boldness.On retiring for the night we were required to lie perfectly
motionless.We might not move a hand or foot, or even a finger.At
twelve the bell rang for prayers, when we must rise, kneel by our beds,
and repeat prayers until the second bell, when we again retired to rest.On cold winter nights these midnight prayers were a most cruel penance.It did seem as though I should freeze to death.But live or die, the
prayers must be said, and the Superior was always there to see that we
were not remiss in duty.If she slept at all I am sure it must have
been with one eye open, for she saw everything.But if I obeyed in this
thing, I found it impossible to lie as still as they required; I would
move when I was asleep without knowing it.This of course could not be
allowed, and for many weeks I was strapped down to my bed every night,
until I could sleep without the movement of a muscle.I was very anxious
to do as nearly right as possible, for I thought if they saw that I
strove with all my might to obey, they would perhaps excuse me if I did
fail to conquer impossibilities.In this, however, I was disappointed;
and I at length became weary of trying to do right, for they would
inflict severe punishments for the most trifling accident.In fact, if
I give anything like a correct account of my convent life, it will be
little else than a history of punishments.Pains, trials, prayers, and
mortifications filled up the time.Penance was the rule, to escape it
the exception.I neglected at the proper time to state what name was given me when I
took the veil; I may therefore as well say in this place that my convent
name was Sister Agnes.CONFESSION AND SORROW OF NO AVAIL.Sandra journeyed to the bedroom.It was a part of my business to wait upon the priests in their rooms,
carry them water, clean towels, wine-glasses, or anything they needed.When entering a priest's room it was customary for a child to knock
twice, an adult four times, and a priest three times.This rule I
was very careful to observe.Whenever a priest opened the door I was
required to courtesy, and fall upon my knees; but if it was opened by
one of the waiters this ceremony was omitted.These waiters were the
boys I have before mentioned, called apostles.It was also a part of my
business to wait upon them, carry them clean frocks, etc.One day I was carrying a pitcher of water to one of the priests, and it
being very heavy, it required both my hands and nearly all my strength
to keep it upright.On reaching the door, however, I attempted to hold
it with one hand (as I dare not set it down), while I rapped with the
other.In so doing I chanced to spill a little water on the floor.Just
at that moment the door was opened by the priest himself, and when he
saw the water he was very angry.He caught me by the arm and asked what
punishment he should inflict upon me for being so careless.I attempted
to explain how it happened, told him it was an accident, that I was very
sorry, and would try to be more careful in future.But I might as well
have said that I was glad, and would do so again, for my confession,
sorrow, and promises of future obedience were entirely thrown away,
and might as well have been kept for some one who could appreciate the
feeling that prompted them.He immediately led me out of his room, it being on the second floor, and
down into the back yard.Here, in the centre of the gravel walk, was
a grate where they put down coal.This grate he raised and bade me
go down.I obeyed, and descending a few steps found myself in a coal
cellar, the floor being covered with it for some feet in depth.On this
we walked some two rods, perhaps, when the priest stopped, and with a
shovel that stood near cleared away the coal and lifted a trap door.Through this we descended four or five steps, and proceeded along
a dark, narrow passage, so low we could not stand erect, and the
atmosphere so cold and damp it produced the most uncomfortable
sensations.By the light of a small lantern which the priest carried in
his hand, I was enabled to observe on each side the passage small doors,
a few feet apart, as far as I could see.Some of them were open, others
shut, and the key upon the outside.In each of these doors there was
a small opening, with iron bars across it, through which the prisoner
received food, if allowed to have any.One of these doors I was directed
to enter, which I did with some difficulty, the place being so low, and
I was trembling with cold and fear.The priest crawled in after me
and tied me to the back part of the cell, leaving me there in midnight
darkness, and locking the door after him.I could hear on all sides, as
it seemed to me, the sobs, groans, and shrieks of other prisoners,
some of whom prayed earnestly for death to release them from their
sufferings.For twenty-four hours I was left to bear as I best could the pains and
terrors of cold, hunger, darkness, and fatigue.I could neither sit or
lie down, and every one knows how very painful it is to stand upon the
feet a long time, even when the position can be slightly changed; how
much more so when no change can be effected, but the same set of muscles
kept continually on the stretch for the space of twenty-four hours!Moreover, I knew not how long I should be kept there.The other
prisoners, whose agonizing cries fell upon my ears, were evidently
suffering all the horrors of starvation.Were those terrible sufferings in reserve for me?And then came the thought so often present with me while in the
convent, "If there is a God in heaven, why does He permit such things?What have I done that I should become the victim of such cruelty?I involuntarily exclaimed, "save me from this terrible death."At the close of twenty-four
hours, the Lady Superior came and released me from my prison, told me to
go to the priest and ask his forgiveness, and then go to my work in the
kitchen.I was very faint and weak from my long fast, and I resolved
never to offend again.I verily thought I could be careful enough to
escape another such punishment.But I had not been in the kitchen one
hour, when I chanced to let a plate fall upon the floor.It was in
no way injured, but I had broken the rules by making a noise, and the
Superior immediately reported me to the priest.He soon appeared with
his bunch of keys and a dark lantern in his hand.He took me by the ear
which he pinched till he brought tears to my eyes, saying, "You don't
try to do well, and I'll make you suffer the consequences."I did not
reply, for I had learned that to answer a priest, or seek to vindicate
myself, or even to explain how things came to be so, was in itself
a crime, to be severely punished.However unjust their treatment,
or whatever my feelings might be, I knew it was better to suffer in
silence.Unlocking a door that opened out of the kitchen, and still keeping hold
of my ear, he led me into a dark, gloomy hall, with black walls, and
opening a door on the right, he bade me enter.This room was lighted
by a candle, and around the sides, large iron hooks with heavy chains
attached to them, were driven into the wall.At the back part of the
room, he opened the door, and bade me enter a small closet.He then put
a large iron ring over my head, and pressed it down upon my shoulders.Heavy weights were placed in my hands, and I was told to stand up
straight, and hold them fifteen minutes.Had my
life depended upon the effort, I could not have stood erect, with those
weights in my hands.The priest, however, did not reprove me.Perhaps he
saw that I exerted all my strength to obey, for he took out his watch,
and slowly counted the minutes as they passed.Ere a third part of the
time expired, he was obliged to release me, for the blood gushed from
my nose and mouth, and I began to feel faint and dizzy.The irons were
removed, and the blood ceased to flow.I was then taken to another room, lighted like the other, but it was
damp and cold, and pervaded by a strong, fetid, and very offensive odor.The floor was of wood, and badly stained with blood.At least, I
thought it was blood, but there was not light enough to enable me to
say positively what it was.In the middle of the room, stood two long
tables, on each of which, lay a corpse, covered with a white cloth.The
priest led me to these tables, removed the cloth and bade me look upon
the face of the dead.They were very much emaciated, and the features,
even in death, bore the impress of terrible suffering.We stood there a
few moments, when he again led me back to his own room.He then asked
me what I thought of what I had seen.Having taken no food for more than
twenty-four hours, I replied, "I am so hungry, I can think of nothing
else.""How would you like to eat those dead bodies?""I would
starve, Sir, before I would do it," I replied.said he,
with a slight sneer."Yes indeed," I exclaimed, striving to suppress my
indignant feelings.Frightened at my own temerity in
speaking so boldly, I involuntarily raised my eye.The peculiar smile
upon his face actually chilled my blood with terror.He did not,
however, seem to notice me, but said, "Do not be too sure; I have seen
others quite as sure as you are, yet they were glad to do it to save
their lives; and remember," he added significantly, "you will do it too
if you are not careful."He then ordered me to return to the kitchen.At ten o'clock in the morning, the nuns had a slice of bread and cup
of water; but, as I had been fasting, they gave me a bowl of gruel,
composed of indian meal and water, with a little salt.A poor dinner
this, for a hungry person, but I could have no more.At eleven, we went
to mass in the chapel as usual.It was our custom to have mass
every day, and I have been told that this is true of all Romish
establishments.Returning to my work in the kitchen, I again resolved
that I would be so careful, that, in future they should have no cause
for complaint For two days I succeeded.Yes, for two whole days, I
escaped punishment.This I notice as somewhat remarkable, because I was
generally punished every day, and sometimes two or three times in a day.On the third morning, I was dusting the furniture in the room occupied
by the priest above mentioned, who treated me so cruelly.The floor
being uncarpeted, in moving the chairs I chanced to make a slight noise,
although I did my best to avoid it.He immediately sprang to his feet,
exclaiming, "You careless dog!Then taking me
by the arms, he gave me a hard shake, saying, "Have I not told you that
you would be punished, if you made a noise?But I see how it is with
you; your mind is on the world, and you think more of that, than you do
of the convent.But I shall punish you until you do your duty better."He concluded this choice speech by telling me to "march down stairs."Of
course, I obeyed, and he followed me, striking me on the head at every
step, with a book he held in his hand.I thought to escape some of the
blows, and hastened along, but all in vain; he kept near me and drove
me before him into the priests sitting-room.He then sent for three more
priests, to decide upon my punishment.A long consultation they held
upon "this serious business," as I sneeringly thought it, but the result
was serious in good earnest, I assure you.For the heinous offence of
making a slight noise I was to have dry peas bound upon my knees, and
then be made to crawl to St.Patrick's church, through an underground
passage, and back again.This church was situated on a hill, a little
more than a quarter of a mile from the convent.Between the two
buildings, an under-ground passage had been constructed, just large
enough to allow a person to crawl through it on the hands and knees.It
was so low, and narrow, that it was impossible either to rise, or turn
around; once within that passage there was no escape, but to go on to
the end.They allowed me five hours to go and return; and to prove that
I had really been there, I was to make a cross, and two straight lines,
with a bit of chalk, upon a black-board that I should find at the end.O, the intolerable agonies I endured on that terrible pathway!Any
description that I can give, will fail to convey the least idea of the
misery of those long five hours.It may, perchance, seem a very simple
mode of punishment, but let any one just try it, and they will be
convinced that it was no trifling thing.At the end, I found myself in
a cellar under the church, where there was light enough to enable me to
find the board and the chalk.I made the mark according to orders, and
then looked around for some means of escape.Strong iron bars firmly secured the only door, and a very slight
examination convinced me that my case was utterly hopeless.I then tried
to remove the peas from my swollen, bleeding limbs, but this, too, I
found impossible.They were evidently fastened by a practised hand; and
I was, at length, compelled to believe that I must return as I came.I
did return; but O, how, many times I gave up in despair, and thought
I could go no further!How many times did I stretch myself on the cold
stones, in such bitter agony, that I could have welcomed death as a
friend and deliverer!What would I not have given for one glass of cold
water, or even for a breath of fresh air!My limbs seemed on fire,
and while great drops of perspiration fell from my face, my throat and
tongue were literally parched with thirst.But the end came at last, and
I found the priest waiting for me at the entrance.He seemed very angry,
and said, "You have been gone over your time.There was no need of it;
you could have returned sooner if you had chosen to do so, and now,
I shall punish you again, for being gone so long."At first, his
reproaches grieved me, for I had done my best to please him, and I did
so long for one word of sympathy, it seemed for a moment, as though my
heart would break.Had he then spoken one kind word to me, or manifested
the least compassion for my sufferings, I could have forgiven the past,
and obeyed him with feelings of love and gratitude for the future.Yes,
I would have done anything for that man, if I could have felt that he
had the least pity for me; but when he said he should punish me again,
my heart turned to stone.Every tender emotion vanished, and a fierce
hatred, a burning indignation, and thirst for revenge, took possession
of my soul.The priest removed the peas from my limbs, and led me to a tomb under
the chapel, where he left me, with the consoling assurance that "THE
DEAD WOULD RISE AND EAT ME!"This tomb was a large rectangular room,
with shelves on three sides of it, on which were the coffins of priests
and Superiors who had died in the nunnery.On the floor under the
shelves, were large piles of human bones, dry and white, and some of
them crumbling into dust.In the center of the room was a large tank of
water, several feet in diameter, called St.It occupied
the whole center of the room leaving a very narrow pathway between that,
and the shelves; so narrow, indeed, that I found it impossible to sit
down, and exceedingly difficult to walk or even stand still.I was
obliged to hold firmly by the shelves, to avoid slipping into the water
which looked dark and deep.The priest said, when he left me, that if I
fell in, I would drown, for no one could take me out.O, how my heart thrilled with superstitious terror when I heard the key
turn in the lock, and realized that I was alone with the dead!And that
was not the worst of it.For a few hours
I stood as though paralyzed with fear.A cold perspiration covered my
trembling limbs, as I watched those coffins with the most painful and
serious apprehension.Every moment I expected the fearful catastrophe,
and even wondered which part they would devour first--whether one would
come alone and thus kill me by inches, or whether they would all rise
at once, and quickly make an end of me.I even imagined I could see the
coffins move--that I heard the dead groan and sigh and even the sound of
my own chattering teeth, I fancied to be a movement among the dry bones
that lay at my feet.In the extremity of terror I shrieked aloud.Or who would care if
they did hear?I was surrounded by walls that no sound could penetrate,
and if it could, it would fall upon ears deaf to the agonizing cry for
mercy,--upon hearts that feel no sympathy for human woe.Some persons may be disposed to smile at this record of absurd and
superstitions fear.Had not the
priest said that the dead would rise and eat me?And did I not firmly
believe that what he said was true?I thought it could not be; yet as hour after hour passed
away, and no harm came to me, I began to exercise my reason a little,
and very soon came to the conclusion that the priests are not the
immaculate, infallible beings I had been taught to believe.Cruel
and hard hearted, I knew them to be, but I did not suspect them of
falsehood.Hitherto I had supposed it was impossible for them to do
wrong, or to err in judgement; all their cruel acts being done for the
benefit of the soul, which in some inexplicable way was to be benefited
by the sufferings of the body.Now, however, I began to question the
truth of many things I had seen and heard, and ere long I lost all faith
in them, or in the terrible system of bigotry, cruelty and fraud, which
they call religion.As the hours passed by and my fears vanished before the calm light of
reason, I gradually gained sufficient courage to enable me to examine
the tomb, thinking that I might perchance discover the body of my old
Superior.For this purpose I accordingly commenced the circuit of the
room, holding on by the shelves, and making my way slowly onward.One
coffin I succeeded in opening, but the sight of the corpse so frightened
me, I did not dare to open another.The room being brilliantly lighted
with two large spermaceti candles at one end, and a gas burner at the
other, I was enabled to see every feature distinctly.One of the nuns informed me that none but priests and Superiors are laid
in that tomb.When these die in full communion with the church, the body
is embalmed, and placed here, but it sometimes happens that a priest or
Superior is found in the convent who does not believe all that is taught
by the church of Rome.They desire to investigate the subject--to seek
for more light--more knowledge of the way of salvation by Christ.This,
with the Romanists is a great sin, and the poor hapless victim is at
once placed under punishment.If they die in this condition, their
bodies are cast out as heretics, but if they confess and receive
absolution, they are placed in the tomb, but not embalmed.The flesh, of
course, decays, and then the bones are thrown under the shelves.Never
shall I forget how frightful those bones appeared to me, or the cold
shudder that thrilled my frame at the sight of the numerous human skulls
that lay scattered around.Twenty-four hours I spent in this abode of the dead, without rest or
sleep.The attempt to obtain either would have been sheer madness, for
the least mis-step, the least unguarded motion, or a slight relaxation
of the firm grasp by which I held on to the shelves, would have plunged
me headlong into the dark water, from which escape would have been
impossible.For thirty hours I had not tasted food, and my limbs,
mangled and badly swollen, were so stiff with long standing, that, when
allowed to leave the tomb, I could hardly step.When the priest came to
let me out, he seemed to think it necessary to say something to cover
his attempt to deceive and frighten me, but he only made a bad matter
worse.He said that after he left me, he thought he would try me once
more, and see if I would not do my duty better; he had, therefore,
WILLED THE DEAD NOT TO EAT ME!AND THEY, OBEDIENT TO HIS WILL, WERE
COMPELLED TO LET ME ALONE!I did not reply to this absurd declaration,
lest I should say something I ought not, and again incur his
displeasure.Indeed, I was not expected to say anything, unless I
returned thanks for his unparalleled kindness, and I was not hypocrite
enough for that.I suppose he thought I believed all he said, but he was
greatly mistaken.If I began to doubt his word while in the tomb, this
ridiculous pretence only served to add contempt to unbelief, and from
that time I regarded him as a deceiver, and a vile, unscrupulous,
hypocritical pretender.It was with the greatest difficulty that I again made my way to the
kitchen.I was never very strong, even when allowed my regular meals,
for the quantity, was altogether insufficient, to satisfy the demands
of nature; and now I had been so long without anything to eat, I was
so weak, and my limbs so stiff and swollen, I could hardly stand.I
managed, however, to reach the kitchen, when I was immediately seated at
the table and presented with a bowl of gruel.O, what a luxury it seemed
to me, and how eagerly did I partake of it!It was soon gone, and I
looked around for a further supply.Another nun, who sat at the table
with me, with a bowl of gruel before her, noticed my disappointment when
I saw that I was to have no more.She was a stranger to me, and so pale
and emaciated she looked more like a corpse than a living person.She
had tasted a little of her gruel, but her stomach was too weak to retain
it, and as soon as the Superior left us she took it up and poured the
whole into my bowl, making at the same time a gesture that gave me to
understand that it was of no use to her, and she wished me to eat it I
did not wait for a second invitation, and she seemed pleased to see me
accept it so readily.We dared not speak, but we had no difficulty in
understanding each other.I had but just finished my gruel when the Superior came back and desired
me to go up stairs and help tie a mad nun.I think she did this simply
for the purpose of giving me a quiet lesson in convent life, and showing
me the consequences of resistance or disobedience.She must have known
that I was altogether incapable of giving the assistance she pretended
to ask.But I followed her as fast as possible, and when she saw how
difficult it was for me to get up stairs, she walked slowly and gave me
all the time I wished for.She led me into a small room and closed the
door.There I beheld a scene that called forth my warmest sympathy,
and at the same time excited feelings of indignation that will never be
subdued while reason retains her throne.In the center of the room sat
a young girl, who could not have been more than sixteen years old; and a
face and form of such perfect symmetry, such surpassing beauty, I never
saw.She was divested of all her clothing except one under-garment, and
her hands and feet securely tied to the chair on which she sat.A priest
stood beside her, and as we entered he bade us assist him in removing
the beds from the bedstead.They then took the nun from her chair and
laid her on the bedcord.They desired me to assist them, but my heart
failed me.I could not do it, for I was sure they were about to kill
her; and as I gazed upon those calm, expressive features, so pale and
sad, yet so perfectly beautiful, I felt that it would be sacrilege for
me to raise my hand against nature's holiest and most exquisite work.I
therefore assured them that I was too weak to render the assistance they
required.At first they attempted to compel me to do it; but, finding
that I was really very weak, and unwilling to use what strength I had,
they at length permitted me to stand aside.When they extended the poor
girl on the cord, she said, very quietly, "I am not mad, and you know
that I am not."To this no answer was given, but they calmly proceeded
with their fiendish work.One of them tied her feet, while the other
fastened a rope across her neck in such a way that if she attempted to
raise her head it would strangle her.The rope was then fastened under
the bedcord, and two or three times over her person.Her arms were
extended, and fastened in the same way.As she lay thus, like a lamb
bound for the sacrifice, she looked up at her tormentors and said, "Will
the Lord permit me to die in this cruel way?"The priest immediately
exclaimed, in an angry tone, "Stop your talk, you mad woman!"and
turning to me, he bade me go back to the kitchen.It is probable he saw
the impression on my mind was not just what they desired, therefore he
hurried me away.All this time the poor doomed nun submitted quietly to her fate.I
suppose she thought it useless, yea, worse than useless, to resist; for
any effort she might make to escape would only provoke them, and they
would torment her the more.I presume she thought her last hour had
come, and the sooner she was out of her misery the better.As for me,
my heart was so filled with terror, anguish, and pity for her, I could
hardly obey the command to leave the room.I attempted to descend the stairs, but was obliged to go very slowly on
account of the stiffness of my limbs, and before I reached the bottom of
the first flight the priest and the Superior came out into the hall.I
heard them whispering together, and I paused to listen.This, I know,
was wrong; but I could not help it, and I was so excited I did not
realize what I was doing.My anxiety for that girl overpowered every
other feeling.At first I could only hear the sound of their voices; but
soon they spoke more distinctly, and I heard the words.In an audible tone of voice, the
other replied, "We had better finish her."I knew well enough that they designed "to finish her," but to hear
the purpose announced so coolly, it was horrible.Was there no way that
I could save her?Must I stand there, and know that a fellow-creature
was being murdered, that a young girl like myself, in all the freshness
of youth and the fullness of health, was to be cut off in the very
prime of life and numbered with the dead; hurried out of existence and
plunged, unwept, unlamented, into darkness and silence?She had friends,
undoubtedly, but they would never be allowed to know her sad fate, never
shed a tear upon her grave!I felt that
if I lingered there another moment I should be in danger of madness
myself; for I could not help her.I could not prevent the consummation
of their cruel purpose; I therefore hastened away, and this was the last
I ever heard of that poor nun.I had never seen her before, and as I did
not see her clothes, I could not even tell whether she belonged to our
nunnery or not.CHAPTER X.

THE SICK NUN.On my return to the kitchen I found the sick nun sitting as we left her.She asked me, by signs, if we were alone.I told her she need not fear
to speak, for the Superior was two flights of stairs above, and no one
else was near.I assured her that
we were quite alone, that she had nothing to fear.She then informed me
that she had been nine days under punishment, that when taken from the
cell she could not stand or speak, and she was still too weak to walk
without assistance.said she, and the big tears rolled over her
cheeks as she said it, "I have not a friend in the world.You do not
know how my heart longs for love, for sympathy and kindness."I asked if
she had not parents, or friends, in the world.She replied, "I was born
in this convent, and know no world but this.You see," she continued,
with a sad smile, "what kind of friends I have here.O, if I HAD A
FRIEND, if I could feel that one human being cares for me, I should get
better.But it is so long since I heard a kind word--" a sob choked her
utterance.I told her I would be a friend to her as far as I could.She
thanked me; said she was well aware of the difficulties that lay in my
way, for every expression of sympathy or kind feeling between the nuns
was strictly forbidden, and if caught in anything of the kind a severe
correction would follow."But," said she "if you will give me a kind
look sometimes, whenever you can do so with safety, it will be worth a
great deal to me.You do not know the value of a kind look to a breaking
heart."She wept so bitterly, I feared it would injure her health, and to divert
her mind, I told her where I was born; spoke of my childhood, and of
my life at the White Nunnery.She wiped away her tears, and replied, "I
know all about it.I have heard the priests talk about you, and they say
that your father is yet living, that your mother was a firm protestant,
and that it will be hard for them to beat Catholicism into you.But I
do not know how you came in that nunnery.I told her
that I was placed there by my father, when only six years old.she exclaimed, and then added passionately, "Curse your
father for it."After a moments silence, she continued, "Yes, child;
you have indeed cause to curse your father, and the day when you first
entered the convent; but you do not suffer as much as you would if you
had been born here, and were entirely dependent on them.They fear
that your friends may sometime look after you; and, in case they are
compelled to grant them an interview, they would wish them to find you
in good health and contented; but if you had no influential friends
outside the convent, you would find yourself much worse off than you are
now."She then said she wished she could get some of the brandy from the
cellar.Her stomach was so weak from long fasting, it would retain
neither food or drink, and she thought the brandy would give it
strength.She asked if I could get it for her.The idea frightened me at
first, for I knew that if caught in doing it, I should be most cruelly
punished, yet my sympathy for her at length overcame my fears, and I
resolved to try, whatever might be the result.I accordingly went up
stairs, ostensibly, to see if the Superior wanted me, but really, to
find out where she was, and whether she would be likely to come down,
before I could have time to carry out my plan.I trembled a little,
for I knew that I was guilty of a great misdemeanor in thus boldly
presenting myself to ask if I was wanted; but I thought it no very great
sin to pretend that I thought she called me, for I was sure my motives
were good, whatever they might think of them.I had been taught that
"the end sanctifies the means," and I thought I should not be too hardly
judged by the great searcher of hearts, if, for once, I applied it in my
own way.I knocked gently at the door I had left but a few moments before.It was
opened by the Superior, but she immediately stepped out, and closed it
again, so that I had no opportunity to see what was passing within.She sternly bade me return to the kitchen, and stay there till she came
down; a command I was quite ready to obey.In the kitchen there was a
small cupboard, called the key cupboard, in which they kept keys of all
sizes belonging to the establishment.They were hung on hooks, each one
being marked with the name of the place to which it belonged.It was
easy for me to find the key to the cellar, and having obtained it, I
opened another cupboard filled with bottles and vials, where I selected
one that held half a pint, placed it in a large pitcher, and hastened
down stairs.I soon found a cask marked "brandy," turned the faucet, and
filled the bottle.But my heart beat violently, and my hand trembled
so that I could not hold it steady, and some of it ran over into the
pitcher.It was well for me that I took this precaution, for if I had
spilt it on the stone floor of the cellar, I should have been detected
at once.I ran up stairs as quickly as possible, and made her drink what
I had in the pitcher, though there was more of it than I should have
given her under other circumstances; but I did not know what to do
with it.If I put it in the fire, or in the sink, I thought they would
certainly smell it, and, there was no other place, for I was not allowed
to go out of doors.I then replaced the key, washed up my pitcher, and
secreted the bottle of brandy in the waist of the nun's dress.This
I could easily do, their dresses being made with a loose waist, and a
large cape worn over them.I then began to devise some way to destroy
the scent in the room.I could smell it very distinctly, and I knew that
the Superior would notice it at once.After trying various expedients to
no purpose, I at length remembered that I had once seen a dry rag set on
fire for a similar purpose.I therefore took one of the cloths from the
sink, and set it on fire, let it burn a moment, and threw it under the
caldron.I was just beginning to congratulate myself on my success, when I saw
that the nun appeared insensible, and about to fall from her chair.I
caught her in my arms, and leaned her back in the chair, but I did not
dare to lay her on the bed, without permission, even if I had strength
to do it.I could only draw her chair to the side of the room, put a
stick of wood under it, and let her head rest against the wall.I was
very much frightened, and for a moment, thought she was dead.She was
pale as a corpse, her eyes closed, and her mouth wide open.I soon found that
she was not dead, for her heart beat regularly, and I began to hope she
would get over it before any one came in.But just as the thought passed
my mind, the door opened and the Superior appeared.Her first words
were, "What have you been burning?I told her there was
a cloth about the sink that I thought unfit for use, and I put it
under the caldron.She then turned towards the nun and asked if she had
fainted.I told her that I did not know, but I thought she was asleep,
and if she wished me to awaken, and assist her to bed, I would do so.To
this she consented, and immediately went up stairs again.Glad as I was
of this permission, I still doubted my ability to do it alone, for I had
little, very little strength; yet I resolved to do my best.It was long,
however, before I could arouse her, or make her comprehend what I said,
so entirely were her senses stupified with the brandy.When at length I
succeeded in getting her upon her feet, she said she was sure she could
not walk; but I encouraged her to help herself as much as possible, told
her that I wished to get her away before any one came in, or we would
be certainly found out and punished.This suggestion awakened her fears,
and I at length succeeded in assisting her to bed.She was soon in a
sound sleep, and I thought my troubles for that time were over.In my fright, I had quite forgotten the brandy in her
dress.Somehow the bottle was cracked, and while she slept, the brandy
ran over her clothes.The Superior saw it, and asked how she obtained
it.Too noble minded to expose me, she said she drew it herself.I
heard the Superior talking to a priest about it, and I thought they were
preparing to punish her.I did not know what she had told them, but I
did not think she would expose me, and I feared, if they punished her
again, she would die in their hands.I therefore went to the Superior and told her the truth about it, for
I thought a candid confession on my part might, perchance, procure
forgiveness for the nun, if not for myself.But no; they punished us
both; the nun for telling the lie, and me for getting the brandy.For
two hours they made me stand with a crown of thorns on my head, while
they alternately employed themselves in burning me with hot irons,
pinching, and piercing me with needles, pulling my hair, and striking
me with sticks.All this I bore very well, for I was hurt just enough to
make me angry.When I returned to the kitchen again, the nun was sitting there alone.She shook her head at me, and by her gestures gave me to understand that
some one was listening.She afterwards informed me that the Superior was
watching us, to see if we would speak to each other when we met.I do
not know how they punished her, but I heard a priest say that she would
die if she suffered much more.Perhaps they thought the loss of that
precious bottle of brandy was punishment enough.But I was glad I got
it for her, for she had one good dose of it, and it did her good;
her stomach was stronger, her appetite better, and in a few weeks she
regained her usual health.One day, while at work as usual, I was called up stairs with the other
nuns to see one die.She lay upon the bed, and looked pale and thin, but
I could see no signs of immediate dissolution.Her voice was strong, and
respiration perfectly natural, the nuns were all assembled in her room
to see her die.Beside her stood a priest, earnestly exhorting her to
confess her sins to him, and threatening her with eternal punishment if
she refused.But she replied, "No, I will not confess to you.If, as
you say, I am really dying, it is with my God I have to do; to him alone
will I confess, for he alone can save.""If you do not confess to me,"
exclaimed the priest, "I will give you up to the devil.""Well," said
she, "I stand in no fear of a worse devil than you are, and I am quite
willing to leave you at any time, and try any other place; even hell
itself cannot be worse.I cannot suffer more there than I have here.""Daughter," exclaimed the priest, with affected sympathy, "must I give
you up?How can I see you go down to perdition?"I have already confessed my sins to God,
and I shall confess to no one else.Her manner of
saying this was solemn but very decided.The priest saw that she would
not yield to his wishes, and raising his voice, he exclaimed, "Then let
the devil take you."Immediately the door opened, and a figure representing the Roman
Catholic idea of his Satanic Majesty entered the room.He was very
black, and covered with long hair, probably the skin of some wild
animal.He had two long white tusks, two horns on his head, a large
cloven foot, and a long tail that he drew after him on the floor.He
looked so frightful, and recalled to my mind so vividly the figure that
I saw at the White Nunnery, that I was very much frightened; still I did
not believe it was really a supernatural being.I suspected that it was
one of the priests dressed up in that way to frighten us, and I now
know that such was the fact.We all feared the priests
quite as much as we should the Evil One himself, even if he should come
to us in bodily shape, as they pretended he had done.Most of the nuns
were very much frightened when they saw that figure walk up to the
bedside, taking good care, however, to avoid the priest, he being so
very holy it was impossible for an evil spirit to go near or even look
at him.The priest then ordered us to return to the kitchen, for said he, "The
devil has come for this nun's soul, and will take it with him," As we
left the room I looked around on my companions and wondered if they
believed this absurd story.I longed to ask them what they thought of
it, but this was not allowed.All interchange of thought or feeling
being strictly forbidden, we never ventured to speak without permission
when so many of us were present, for some one was sure to tell of it if
the least rule was broken.I was somewhat surprised at first that we were all sent to the kitchen,
as but few of us were employed there; but we were soon called back again
to look at the corpse.I was inexpressibly shocked at this summons, for
I had not supposed it possible for her to die so soon.But she was dead;
and that was all we could ever know about it.As we stood around the
bed, the priest said she was an example of those in the world called
heretics; that her soul was in misery, and would remain so forever; no
masses or prayers could avail her then, for she could never be prayed
out of hell.I continued to work in the kitchen as usual for many months after this
occurrence, and for a few weeks the sick nun was there a great part of
the time.Whenever we were alone, and sure that no one was near, we used
to converse together, and a great comfort it was to us both.I felt that
I had found in her one real friend, to sympathize with me in my grievous
trials, and with whom I could sometimes hold communication without fear
of betrayal.I had proved her, and found her faithful, therefore I
did not fear to trust her.No one can imagine, unless they know by
experience, how much pleasure we enjoyed in the few stolen moments that
we spent together.I shall never forget the last conversation I had with her.She came and
sat down where I was assisting another nun to finish a mat.She asked
us if we knew what was going on in the house."As I came from my room,"
said she, "I saw the priests and Superiors running along the halls, and
they appeared so much excited, I thought something must be wrong.As
they passed me, they told me to go to the kitchen, and stay there.Of course we did not know, for we had neither seen or
heard anything unusual."Well," said she, "they are all so much engaged
up stairs, we can talk a little and not be overheard.I want to know
something about the people in the world.Are they really cruel and
cold-hearted, as the priests say they are?When you was in the world
were they unkind to you?""On the contrary," I replied, "I would gladly
return to them again if I could get away from the convent.I should
not be treated any worse, at all events, and I shall embrace the-first
opportunity to go back to the world.""That is what I have always
thought since I was old enough to think at all," said she, "and I have
resolved a great many times to get away if possible.I suppose they tell
us about the cruelty in the world just to frighten us, and prevent us
from trying to escape.I am so weak now I do not suppose I could walk
out of Montreal even if I should leave the convent.But if I ever get
strong enough, I shall certainly try to escape from this horrible place.O, I could tell you things about this convent that would curdle the
blood in your veins."The other nun said that she had been once in the world, and every one
was kind to her."I shall try to get out again, some day," said she,
"but we must keep our resolutions to ourselves, for there is no one
here, that we can trust.Those whom we think our best friends will
betray us, if we give them a chance.I do believe that some of them
delight in getting us punished."The sick nun said, "I have never exposed any one and I never will.I
have the secrets of a great many hid in my breast, that nothing shall
ever extort from me."Here she was interrupted, and soon left the room.Whether she was under punishment, or was so
fortunate as to make her escape, I do not know.As no questions could
be asked, it was very little we could know of each other.If one of our
number escaped, the fact was carefully concealed from the rest, and if
she was caught and brought back, no one ever knew it, except those who
had charge of her.The other nun who worked in the room with me, watched
me very closely.Having heard me declare my intention to leave the first
opportunity, she determined to go with me if possible.At length the long sought opportunity arrived, and with the most extatic
joy we fled from the nunnery.The girl I have before mentioned, who
wished to go with me, and another nun, with whom I had no acquaintance,
were left in the kitchen to assist me, in taking charge of the cooking,
while the rest of the people were at mass in the chapel.A chance
presented for us to get away, and we all fled together, leaving the
cooking to take care of itself.We were assisted to get out of the yard,
but how, or by whom, I can never reveal.Death, in its most terrible
form would be the punishment for such an act of kindness, and knowing
this, it would be the basest ingratitude for me to name the individual
who so kindly assisted us in our perilous undertaking.How well do I remember the emotions that thrilled my soul when I found
myself safely outside the walls of that fearful prison!The joy of
freedom--the hope of ultimate success--the fear of being overtaken,
and dragged back to misery or death, were considerations sufficiently
exciting to agitate our spirits, and lend fleetness to our steps.With
trembling limbs, and throbbing hearts we fled towards the St.Following the tow-path, we hastened on for a few miles, when one
of the nuns became exhausted, and said she could go no further.She
was very weak when we started, and the excitement and fatigue produced
serious illness.We could not take her along
with us, and if we stopped with her, we might all be taken and carried
back.Must we leave her by the way-side?It was a fearful alternative,
but what else could we do?With sad hearts we took her to a shed near
by, and there we left her to her fate, whatever it might be; perchance
to die there alone, or what was still worse, be carried back to the
convent.It was indeed, a sorrowful parting, and we wept bitter tears
together, as we bade her a last farewell.I never saw or heard from her
again.We pursued our way along the tow-path for a short distance, when the
canal boat came along.We asked permission to go upon the boat, and the
captain kindly granted it, but desired us to be very still.He carried
us twelve miles, and then proposed to leave us, as he exposed himself to
a heavy fine by carrying us without a pass, and unattended by a priest
or Superior.We begged him to take us as far as he went with the boat,
and frankly told him our situation.Having no money to offer, we could
only cast ourselves on his mercy, and implore his pity and assistance.He consented to take us as far as the village of Beauharnois, and there
he left us.He did not dare take us further, lest some one might be
watching for us, and find us on his boat.It was five o'clock in the morning when we left the boat, but it was
a Roman Catholic village, and we did not dare to stop.All that day we
pursued our way without food or drink, and at night we were tired and
hungry.Arriving at a small village, we ventured to stop at the most
respectable looking house, and asked the woman if she could keep us over
night.She looked at us very attentively and said she could not.We did
not dare to call again, for we knew that we were surrounded by those who
would think they were doing a good work to deliver us up to the priests.Darkness came over the earth, but still weary and sleepy as we were, we
pursued our lonely way.I will not repeat our bitter reflections upon a
cold hearted world, but the reader will readily imagine what they were.Late in the evening, we came to an old barn.I think it must have
been four or five miles from the village.There was no house, or other
building near it, and as no person was in sight, we ventured to enter.Here, to our great joy, we found a quantity of clean straw, with which
we soon prepared a comfortable bed, where we could enjoy the luxury of
repose.We slept quietly through the night, and at the early dawn awoke,
refreshed and encouraged, but O, so hungry!Gladly would we have eaten
anything in the shape of food, but nothing could we find.The morning star was yet shining brightly above us, as we again started
on our journey.At length our hearts were cheered by the sight of a
village.The first house we came to stood at some distance from the
other buildings, and we saw two women in a yard milking cows.We called
at the door, and asked the lady for some milk."O yes," said she, with
a sweet smile, "come in, and rest awhile, and you shall have all you
want."She thought we were Sisters of Charity, for they often go about
visiting the sick, and praying with the people.It is considered a very
meritorious act to render them assistance, and speed them on their way;
but to help a runaway nun is to commit a crime of sufficient magnitude
to draw down the anathema of the church.Therefore, while we carefully
concealed our real character, we gratefully accepted the aid we so much
needed, but which, we were sure, would have been withheld had she known
to whom it was offered.After waiting till the cows were milked, and
she had finished her own breakfast, she filled a large earthen pan
with bread and milk, gave each of us a spoon, and we ate as much as
we wished.As we arose to depart, she gave each of us a large piece of
bread to carry with us, and asked us to pray with her.We accordingly
knelt in prayer; implored heaven's blessing on her household, and then
took our leave of this kind lady, never more to meet her on earth; but
she will never be forgotten.That day we traveled a long distance, at least, so it seemed to us.When
nearly overcome with fatigue, we saw from the tow-path an island in the
river, and upon it a small house.Near the shore a man stood beside a
canoe.We made signs to him to come to us, and he immediately sprang
into his canoe and came over.We asked him to take us to the island, and
he cheerfully granted our request, but said we must sit very still, or
we would find ourselves in the water.I did not wonder he thought so,
for the canoe was very small, and the weight of three persons sank it
almost even with the surface of the river, while the least motion would
cause it to roll from side to side, so that we really felt that we were
in danger of a very uncomfortable bath if nothing worse.We landed safely, however, and were kindly welcomed by the Indian
family in the house.Six squaws were sitting on the floor, some of them
smoking, others making shoes and baskets.They were very gayly dressed,
their skirts handsomely embroidered with beads and silk of various
colors.One of the girls seemed very intelligent, and conversed fluently
in the English language which she spoke correctly.But she did not
look at all like an Indian, having red hair and a lighter skin than the
others.She was the only one in the family that I could converse with,
as the rest of them spoke only their native dialect; but the nun who was
with me could speak both French and Indian.They treated us with great kindness, gave us food, and invited in to
stay and live with them; said we could be very happy there, and to
induce us to remain, they informed us that the village we saw on the
other side of the river, called St.Regis, was inhabited by Indians, but
they were all Roman Catholics.They had a priest, and a church where
we could go to Mass every Sabbath.Little did they imagine that we were
fleeing for life from the Romish priests; that so far from being an
inducement to remain with them, this information was the very thing to
send us on our way with all possible speed.We did not dare to stay,
for I knew full well that if any one who had seen us went to confession,
they would be obliged to give information of our movements; and if one
priest heard of us, he would immediately telegraph to all the priests
in the United States and Canada, and we should be watched on every side.Escape would then be nearly impossible, therefore we gently, but firmly
refused to accept the hospitality of these good people, and hastened to
bid them farewell.I asked the girl how far it was to the United States.She said it was
two miles to Hogansburg, and that was in the States.We then asked the
man to take us in his canoe to the village of St.Regis on the other
side of the river.He consented, but, I thought, with some reluctance,
and before he allowed us to land, he conversed some minutes with the
Indians who met him on the shore.We could not hear what they said, but
my fears were at once awakened.I thought they suspected us, and if so,
we were lost.But the man came back at length, and, assisted us from the
boat.If he had any suspicions he kept them to himself.Soon after we reached the shore I met a man, of whom I enquired when
a boat would start for Hogansburg.He gazed at us a moment, and then
pointed to five boats out in the river, and said those were the last
to go that day.They were then ready to start, and waited only for the
tow-boat to take them along.But they were so far away we could not get
to them, even if we dared risk ourselves among so many passengers.To stay there over night, was not to be thought of for a
moment.We were sure to be taken, and carried back, if we ventured to
try it.Yet there was but one alternative; either remain there till the
next day, or try to get a passage on the tow-boat.It did not take me a
long time to decide for myself, and I told the nun that I should go on,
if the captain would take me!she exclaimed,
"There are no ladies on that boat, and I do not like to go with so
many men.""I am not afraid of the men," I replied, "if they are not
Romanists, and I am resolved to go.""Do not leave me," she cried, with
streaming tears."I am sure we can get along better if we keep together,
but I dare not go on the boat.""And I dare not stay here," said I,
and so we parted.I to pursue my solitary way, she to go, I know not
whither.I gave her the parting hand, and have never heard from her
since, but I hope she succeeded better than I did, in her efforts to
escape.I went directly to the captain of the boat and asked him if he could
carry me to the States.He said he should go as far as Ogdensburg, and
would carry me there, if I wished; or he could set me off at some place
where he stopped for wood and water.When I told him I had no money to
pay him, he smiled, and asked if I was a run-a-way.I frankly confessed
that I was, for I thought it was better for me to tell the truth than
to try to deceive."Well," said the captain, "I will not betray you; but
you had better go to my state-room and stay there."I thanked him, but
said I would rather stay where I was.He then gave me the key to his
room, and advised me to go in and lock the door, "for," said he, "we are
not accustomed to have ladies in this boat, and the men may annoy you.You will find it more pleasant and comfortable to stay there alone."Truly grateful for his kindness, and happy to escape from the gaze of
the men, I followed his direction; nor did I leave the room again until
I left the boat.The captain brought me my meals, but did not attempt to
enter the room.There was a small window with a spring on the inside; he
would come and tap on the window, and ask me to raise it, when he would
hand me a waiter on which he had placed a variety of refreshments, and
immediately retire.STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.That night and the next day I suffered all the horrors of sea-sickness;
and those who have known by experience how completely it prostrates the
energies of mind and body, can imagine how I felt on leaving the boat at
night.The kind-hearted captain set me on shore at a place where he left
coal and lumber, a short distance from the village of Ogdensburg.He
gave me twelve and half cents, and expressed regret that he could do no
more for me.He said he could not direct me to a lodging for the night,
being a stranger in the place, and this the first time he had been on
that route.Should this narrative chance to meet his eye, let him know
that his kind and delicate attentions to a stranger in distress, are and
ever will be remembered with the gratitude they so richly merit.It
was with evident reluctance that he left me to make my way onward as I
could.And now, reader, imagine, if you can, my situation.A stranger in a
strange land, and comparatively a stranger to the whole world--alone in
the darkness of night, not knowing where to seek a shelter or a place
to lay my head; exhausted with sea-sickness until I felt more dead than
alive, it did seem as though it would be a luxury to lie down and die.My stockings and shoes were all worn out with so much walking, my feet
sore, swollen, and bleeding, and my limbs so stiff and lame that it was
only by the greatest effort that I could step at all.So extreme were my
sufferings, that I stopped more than once before I reached the village,
cast myself upon the cold ground, and thought I could go no further.Not even the idea of being run over in the darkness by some passing
traveller, had power to keep me on my feet.Then I would rest awhile,
and resolve to try again; and so I hobbled onward.It seemed an age of
misery before I came to any house; but at length my spirits revived
at the sight of brilliant lights through the windows, and the sound of
cheerful voices that fell upon my ear.And now I thought my troubles over for that night at least.But no, when
I asked permission to stay over night, it was coldly refused.Again
and again I called at houses where the people seemed to enjoy all the
comforts and even the luxuries of life; but their comforts were for
themselves and not for a toil-worn traveller like me.This I was made to
understand in no gentle manner; and some of those I called upon were not
very particular in the choice of language.By this time my feet were dreadfully swollen, and O!so sore and stiff,
that every step produced the most intense agony.Is it strange that I
felt as though life was hardly worth preserving?I resolved to call at
one house more, and if again refused, to lie down by the wayside and
die.I accordingly entered the village hotel and asked for the landlady.The bar-tender gave me a suspicious glance that made me tremble, and
asked my business.Daniel travelled to the kitchen.I told him my business was with the landlady and no
other person.He left the room a moment, and then conducted me to her
chamber.As I entered a lady came forward to meet me, and the pleasant expression
of her countenance at once won my confidence.She gave me a cordial
welcome, saying, with a smile, as she led me to a seat, "I guess, my
dear, you are a run-a-way, are you not?"I confessed that it was even
so; that I had fled from priestly cruelty, had travelled as far as I
could, and now, weary, sick, and faint from long fasting, I had ventured
to cast myself upon her mercy.I asked, "and are
you a Roman Catholic?""No," she replied, "I am not a Roman Catholic,
and I will protect you.You seem to have suffered much, and are quite
exhausted.I will not betray you, for
I dislike the priests and the convents as much as you do."She then called her little girl, and ordered a fire kindled in another
chamber, saying she did not wish her servants to see me.The child
soon returned, when the lady herself conducted me to a large, pleasant
bed-room, handsomely furnished with every convenience, and a fire in
the grate.She gave me a seat in a large easy-chair before the fire, and
went out, locking the door after her.In a short time she returned with
warm water for a bath, and with her own hands gave me all the assistance
needed.As I related the incidents of the day, she expressed much
sympathy for my sufferings, and said she was glad I had come to her.She gave, me a cordial, and then brought me a cup of tea and other
refreshments, of which I made a hearty supper.She would not allow me to
eat all I wished; but when I had taken as much as was good for me,
she bathed my feet with a healing wash, and assisted me to bed.O, the
luxury of that soft and comfortable bed!No one can realize with what a
keen sense of enjoyment I laid my head upon those downy pillows, unless
they have suffered as I did, and known by experience the sweetness of
repose after excessive toil.All that night this good lady sat beside my bed, and kept my feet wet in
order to reduce the swelling.I was little inclined to sleep, and at her
request related some of the events of my convent life.While doing this,
I hardly knew what to make of this curious woman.Sometimes she would
weep, and then she would swear like any pirate.I was surprised and
somewhat afraid of her, she seemed so strange and used such peculiar
language.She understood my feelings at once, and immediately said, "You
need not be afraid of me, for I have a kind heart, if I do use wicked
words.I cannot help swearing when I think about the priests, monsters
of iniquity that they are; what fearful crimes they do commit under the
cloak of religion!O, if the people of this land could but see their
real character, they would rise en masse and drive them from the
country, whose liberties they will, if possible, destroy.For myself I
have good cause to hate them.Shall I tell you my story, dear?"I begged
her to do so, which she did, as follows:

"I once had a sister, young, talented, beautiful, amiable and
affectionate.She was the pride of all our family, the idol of our
souls.She wished for an education, and we gladly granted her request.In our zeal to serve her, we resolved to give her the very best
advantages, and so we sent her to a Romish school.It was a seminary for
young ladies taught by nuns, and was the most popular one in that
part of the country.My father, like many other parents who knew such
establishments only by report, had not the least idea of its true
character.But deluded by the supposed sanctity of the place, he was
happy in the thought that he had left his darling where it was said that
'science and religion go hand in hand.'She wrote to us that she was pleased with the school, and wished to
remain.We thought her hand writing wonderfully improved, and eagerly
looked forward to the time when she would return to us a finished
scholar, as well as an accomplished lady.But those pleasant prospects
were soon overcast.Too soon, our happy, bounding hearts were hushed by
unspeakable grief, and our brilliant anticipations were dissipated in
the chamber of death.In their place came those solemn realities, the
shroud, the coffin, the hearse and the tomb.""Yes," replied the lady, as she wiped away the
fast flowing tears; "Yes, she died.I believe she was poisoned, but we
could do nothing; we had no proof."She had been long at school before we
suspected the deception that was practised upon us.But at length I went
with my other sister to see her, and the Superior informed us that she
was ill, and could not see us.We proposed going to her room, but to our
great surprise were assured that such a thing could not be allowed.We left with sad hearts, and soon called again.I cannot describe my
feelings when we were coldly informed that she did not wish to see us.Surely something must be wrong; and we left with
terrible presentiments of coming evil.Yes, too soon were our
worst fears realized.I called one day resolved to see her before I left
the house.Conceive, if you can, my surprise and horror, when they told
me that my beautiful, idolized sister had resolved to become a nun.That she had already renounced the world, and would hold no further
communication with her relatives."You know it now," was the cold reply.I did not believe a
word of it, and when I told my father what they said, he went to them,
and resolutely demanded his child.At first they refused to give her up,
but when they saw that his high spirit was aroused--that he would not be
flattered or deceived, they reluctantly yielded to his demand."LANDLADY'S STORY CONTINUED.The poor girl was overjoyed to meet her friends again, but how great was
our astonishment and indignation when she informed us that she had never
received a single line from home after she entered the school, nor did
she ever know that we had called to see her until we informed her of
the fact.Whenever she expressed surprise that she did not hear from us,
they told her that we had probably forgotten her, and strove to awaken
in her mind feelings of indignation, suspicion and animosity.Not
succeeding in this, however, they informed her that her father had
called, and expressed a wish that she should become a nun; that he did
not think it best for her to return home again, nor did he even ask for
a parting interview.Confounded and utterly heart-broken, she would have given herself up to
uncontrollable grief had she been allowed to indulge her feelings.But
even the luxury of tears was forbidden, and she was compelled to assume
an appearance of cheerfulness, and to smile when her heart-strings were
breaking.We brought forward the letters we had received from time to
time which we believed she had written.She had never seen them, before,
"and this," said she, "is not my hand-writing."Of this fact she soon
convinced us, but she said she had written letter after letter hoping
for an answer, but no answer came.She said she knew that the Superior
examined all the letters written by the young ladies, but supposed they
were always sent, after being read.But it was now plain to be seen that
those letters were destroyed, and others substituted in their place.[Footnote: Raffaele Ciocci, formerly a Benedictine Monk, in his
"Narrative," published by the American and Foreign Christian Union,
relates a similar experience of his own, when in the Papal College of
San Bernardo.Being urged to sign "a deed of humility," in which he was to renounce
all his property and give it to the college, he says, "I knew not what
to think of this "deed of humility."A thousand misgivings filled my
mind, and hoping to receive from the notary an explanation that would
assist me in fully comprehending its intention, I anxiously said, "I
must request, sir, that you will inform me what is expected from me.Tell me what is this deed--whether it be really a mere form, as has been
represented to me, or if"--Here the master arose, and in an imperious
tone interrupted me, saying,--"Do not be obstinate and rebellions, but
obey.I have already told you that when you assume the habit of the
Order, the chapter 'de humititate' shall be explained to you.In this
paper you have only to make a renunciation of all you possess on earth."And if I renounce all, who, when I leave the college,
will provide for me?""That," said he, "is
the point to which I wish to call your attention, in advising you to
make some reservation.If you neglect to do so, you may find yourself in
difficulties, losing, as you irrevocably will, every right of your own."At these words, so palpable, so glaring, the bandage fell from my eyes,
and I saw the abyss these monsters were opening under my feet."This is
a deception, a horrible deception," I exclaimed."I now understand
the 'deed of humility,' but I protest I will not sign it, I will have
nothing more to do with it."* * * After spending two or three hours in
bitterness and woe, I resolved to have recourse to my family.For this
purpose I wrote a long letter to my mother, in which I exposed all the
miseries of my heart, related what had taken place with regard to the
"deed of humility," and begged of her consolation and advice.I gave
the letter into the hands of a servant, and on the following morning
received a reply, in which I was told, in gentle, terms, to
be tranquil,--not to resist the wishes of my directors,--sign
unhesitatingly any paper that might be required, for, when my studies
were completed, and I quitted the college, the validity of these forms
would cease.This letter set all my doubts at rest, and restored peace
to my mind.It was written by my mother, and she, I felt assured, would
never deceive me.How could I for one moment imagine that this epistle
was an invention of my enemies, who imitated the hand-writing and
affectionate style of my mother?Some persons will say, you might have
suspected it.* * * I reply, that in the uprightness of my heart,
I could not conceive such atrocious wickedness; it appeared utterly
irreconcilable with the sanctity of the place, and with the venerable
hoariness of persons dedicated to God.After perusing the letter, I hastened to the master, declaring my
readiness to sign the "deed of humility."He smiled approvingly on
finding how well his plan had succeeded.The notary and witnesses were
again summoned, and my condemnation written.The good notary, however,
pitying my situation, inserted an exceptional clause to the total
relinquishment of my rights.* * * No sooner was this business
concluded, than the master commanded me to write to my parents, to
inform them that I had signed the deed of renunciation, and was willing,
for the benefit of my soul, to assume the monkish habit.He was present
when I wrote this letter; I was, therefore, obliged to adopt the
phrases suggested by him,--phrases, breathing zeal and devotion; full of
indifference to the world, and tranquil satisfaction at the choice I
had made.My parents, thought I, will be astonished when they read this
epistle, but they must perceive that the language is not mine, so little
is it in accordance with my former style of writing.Reader, in the course of thirteen months, only one, of from fifty to
sixty letters which I addressed to my mother, was ever received by her,
and that one was this very letter.The monks, instead of forwarding
mine, had forged letters imitating the hand-writing, and adopting a
style suited to their purpose; and instead of consigning to me the
genuine replies, they artfully substituted answers of their own
fabrication.My family, therefore, were not surprised at the tenor of
this epistle, but rejoiced over it, and reputed me already a Saint.They
probably pictured me to themselves, on some future day, with a mitre on
my head--with the red cap--nay, perhaps, even wearing the triple crown.You knew not that your son,
in anguish and despair, was clashing his chains, and devouring his tears
in secret; that a triple bandage was placed before his eyes, and that
he was being dragged, an unwilling victim, to the sacrifice."Returning
home soon after, Ciocci rushed to his mother, and asked if she had
his letters.They, were produced; when he found that only one had been
written by him."It follows then," said my father, "that these letters are forgeries,
and the excuses they have so often made are base falsehoods.A teacher
of the religion of Jesus Christ guilty of lying and forgery!'O, my soul
come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly mine honor be thou
not united.'""But we have our darling home again," said I, "and now we shall keep her
with us."Never shall I forget the sweet, sad smile that came over her
pale face as I uttered these words.Perchance, even then she realized
that she was soon to leave us, never more to return.However this may
be, she gradually declined.Slowly, but surely she went down to the
grave.Every remedy was tried--every measure resorted to, that seemed
to promise relief, but all in vain.We had the best physicians, but they
frankly confessed that they did not understand her disease.In a very
few months after her return, we laid our lovely and beloved sister
beneath the clods of the valley.Our good old physician wept as he gazed
upon her cold remains.I believe he thought she was poisoned, but as he
could not prove it, he would only have injured himself by saying so.As
for myself, I always thought that she knew too many of their secrets to
be allowed to live after leaving them."And now, dear," she continued,
"do you think it strange that I hate the Romanists?Do you wonder if I
feel like swearing when I think of priests and convents?"Truly, I did not wonder that she hated them, though I could not
understand what benefit it could be to swear about it; but I did not
doubt the truth of her story.How often, in the convent from which I
fled, had I heard them exult over the success of some deep laid scheme
to entrap the ignorant, the innocent and the unwary!If a girl was rich
or handsome, as sure as she entered their school, so sure was she to
become a nun, unless she had influential friends to look after her and
resolutely prevent it.To effect this, no means were left untried.The
grossest hypocricy, and the meanest deception were practised to prevent
a girl from holding communication with any one out of the convent No
matter how lonely, or how homesick she might feel, she was not allowed
to see her friends, or even to be informed of their kind attentions.So
far from this, she was made to believe, if possible, that her relatives
had quite forsaken her, while these very relatives were boldly informed
that she did not wish to see them.If they wrote to their friends, as
they sometimes did, their letters were always destroyed, while those
received at home were invariably written by the priest or Superior.These remarks, however, refer only to those who are rich, or beautiful
in person.Many a girl can say with truth that she has attended
the convent school, and no effort was ever made--no inducement ever
presented to persuade her to become a nun.Consequently, she says that
stories like the above are mere falsehoods, reported to injure the
school.This may be true so far as she is concerned, but you may be sure
she has neither riches nor beauty, or if possessed of these, there was
some other strong reason why she should be an exception to the general
rule.Could she know the private history of some of her school-mates,
she would tell a different story.I remember that while in the convent, I was one day sent up stairs to
assist a Superior in a chamber remote from the kitchen, and in a part of
the house where I had never been before.Returning alone to the kitchen,
I passed a door that was partly open, and hearing a slight groan within,
I pushed open the door and looked in, before I thought what I was doing.A young girl lay upon a bed, who looked more like a corpse than a living
person.She saw me, and motioned to have me come to her.As I drew near the bed, she burst into tears, and whispered, "Can't you
get me a drink of cold water?"I told her I did not know, but I would
try.I hastened to the kitchen, and as no one was present but a nun whom
I did not fear, I procured a pitcher of water, and went back with it
without meeting any one on the way.I was well aware that if seen, I
should be punished, but I did not care.I was doing as I would wish
others to do to me, and truly, I had my reward.Never shall I forget how
grateful that poor sufferer was for a draught of cold water.She could
not tell how many days she had been fasting, for some of the time she
had been insensible; but it must have been several days, and she did not
know how long she was to remain in that condition.I asked, in a whisper; "and what have you done to
induce them to punish you so?""O," said she, with a burst of tears, and
grasping my hand with her pale, cold fingers, "I was in the school, and
I thought it would be so nice to be a nun!Then my father died and left
me all his property, and they persuaded me to stay here, and give it all
to the church.I was so sad then I did not care for money, and I had no
idea what a place it is.I really thought that the nuns were pure and
holy--that their lives were devoted to heaven, their efforts consecrated
to the cause of truth and righteousness.I thought that this was indeed
the 'house of God,' the very 'gate of heaven.'But as soon as they were
sure of me, they let me know--but you understand me; you know what I
mean?"I nodded assent, and once more asked, "What did you do?""O,
I was in the school," said she, "and I knew that a friend of mine was
coming here just as I did; and I could not bear to see her, in all her
loveliness and unsuspecting innocence, become a victim to these vile
priests.I found an opportunity to let her know what a hell she
was coming to.'Twas an unpardonable sin, you see.I had robbed the
church--committed sacrilege, they said--and they have almost killed me
for it.I wish they would QUITE, for I am sure death has no terrors for
me now.God will never punish me for what I have done.But go; don't
stay any longer; they'll kill you if they catch you here."I knew that
she had spoken truly--they WOULD kill me, almost, if not quite, if
they found me there; but I must know a little more.I asked, "or did you both have to suffer, to pay for your
generous act?"She did not come,
and she promised not to tell of me.I don't think she did; but they
managed to find it out, I don't know how; and now--O God, let me die!"I was obliged to go, and I left her, with a promise to carry her some
bread if I could.But I could not, and I never saw her again.Yet what
a history her few words unfolded!It was so much like the landlady's
story, I could not forbear relating it to her.She seemed much
interested in all my convent adventures; and in this way we spent the
night.Next morning the lady informed me that I could not remain with her in
safety, but she had a sister, who lived about half a mile distant, with
whom I could stop until my feet were sufficiently healed to enable me to
resume my journey.She then sent for her sister, who very kindly, as
I then thought, acceded to her request, and said I was welcome to stay
with her as long as I wished.Arrangements were therefore made at once
for my removal.My kind hostess brought two large buffalo robes into my
chamber, which she wrapped around my person in such a way as to shield
me from the observation of the servants.She then called one whom she
could trust, and bade him take up the bundle and carry it down to
a large covered wagon that stood at the door.I have often wondered
whether the man knew what was in that bundle or not.I do not think
he did, for he threw me across his shoulder as he would any bale of
merchandise, and laid me on the bottom of the carriage.The two ladies
then entered, laughing heartily at the success of their ruse, and joking
me about my novel mode of conveyance.In this manner we were driven
to the sister's residence, and I was carried into the house by the
servants, in the same way.The landlady stopped for a few moments, and
when she left she gave me cloth for a new dress, a few other articles of
clothing, and three dollars in money.She bade me stay there and make my
dress, and on no account venture out again in my nun dress.She wished
me success in my efforts to escape, commended me to the care of our
heavenly Father, and bade me farewell.She returned in the wagon alone,
and left me to make the acquaintance of my new hostess.This lady was a very different woman from her sister, and I soon had
reason to regret that I was in her power.It has been suggested to me
that the two ladies acted in concert; that I was removed for the sole
purpose of being betrayed into the hands of my enemies.But I am not
willing to believe this.Dark as human nature appears to me--accustomed
as I am to regard almost every one with suspicion--still I cannot for
one moment cherish a thought so injurious to one who was so kind to me.Is it possible that she could be such a hypocrite?Treat me with so much
tenderness, and I might say affection, and then give me up to what was
worse than death?No; whatever the reader may think about it, I can
never believe her guilty of such perfidy.I regret exceedingly my
inability to give the name of this lady in connection with the history
of her good deeds, but I did not learn the name of either sister.The
one to whom I was now indebted for a shelter seemed altogether careless
of my interests.I had been with her but a few hours when she asked me
to do some washing for her.Of course I was glad to do it; but when she
requested me to go into the yard and hang the clothes upon the line, I
became somewhat alarmed.I did not like to do it, and told her so; but
she laughed at my fears, overruled all my objections, said no one in
that place would seek to harm or to betray me, and assured me there
was not the least danger.I at last consented to go, though my reason,
judgment, and inclination, had I followed their dictates, would have
kept me in the house.But I did not like to appear ungrateful, or
unwilling to repay the kindness I received, as far as I was able; still
I could not help feeling that it was an ungenerous demand.She might at
least have offered me a bonnet or a shawl, as a partial disguise; but
she did nothing of the kind.When I saw that I could not avoid the exposure I resolved to make
the best of it and get through as quickly, as possible; but my dress
attracted a good deal of attention, and I saw more than one suspicious
glance directed towards me before my task was finished.When it was
over I thought no more about it, but gave myself up to the bright
anticipations of future happiness, which now began to take possession of
my mind.That night I retired to a comfortable bed, and was soon lost to all
earthly cares in the glorious land of dreams.What unalloyed happiness I
enjoyed that night!Truly, the vision
was bright, but a sad awaking followed.Some time in the night I was
aroused by the flashing of a bright light from a dark lantern suddenly
opened.I attempted to rise, but before I could realize where I was,
a strong hand seized me and a gag was thrust into my mouth.The man
attempted to take me in his arms, but with my hands and feet I
defended myself to the best of my ability.Another man now came to his
assistance, and with strong cords confined my hands and feet, so that I
was entirely at their mercy.Perfectly helpless, I could neither resist
nor call for help.They then took me up and carried me down stairs, with
no clothing but my night-dress, not even a shawl to shield me from the
cold night air.At the gate stood a long covered wagon, in form like a butchers cart,
drawn by two horses, and beside it a long box with several men standing
around it.I had only time to observe this, when they thrust me into the
box, closed the lid, placed it in the wagon, and drove rapidly away.I could not doubt for a moment into whose hands I had fallen, and when
they put me into the box, I wished I might suffocate, and thus end my
misery at once.But they had taken good care to prevent this by boring
holes in the box, which admitted air enough to keep up respiration.And this was the result of all my efforts for freedom!After all I had
suffered in making my escape, it was a terrible disappointment to be
thus cruelly betrayed, gagged, bound, and boxed up like an article of
merchandise, carried back to certain torture, and perchance to death.O, blame me not, gentle reader, if in my haste, and the bitter
disappointment and anguish of my spirit, I questioned the justice of the
power that rules the world.Nor let your virtuous indignation wax hot
against me if I confess to you, that I even doubted the existence of
that power.How often had I cried to God for help!Why were my prayers
and tears disregarded?What had I done to deserve such a fife of misery?These, and similar thoughts occupied my mind during that lonely midnight
ride.Regis before the first Mass in the morning.The box
was then taken into the chapel, where they took me out and carried me
into the church.I was seated at the foot of the altar, with my hands
and feet fast bound, the gag still in my mouth, and no clothing on, but
my night-dress.Two men stood beside me, and I remained here until the
priest had said mass and the people retired from the church.He then
came down from the altar, and said to the men beside me, "Well, you have
got her.""Yes Sir," they replied, "what shall we do with her?""Put her
on the five o'clock boat," said he, "and let the other men go with her
to Montreal.I want you to stay here, and be ready to go the other way
tonight" This priest was an Indian, but he spoke the English language
correctly and fluently.He seemed to feel some pity for my forlorn
condition, and as they were about to carry me away he brought a large
shawl, and wrapped it around me, for which I was truly grateful.At the appointed time, I was taken on board the boat, watched very
closely by the two men who had me in charge.There was need enough of
this, for I would very gladly have thrown myself into the water, had I
not been prevented.Once and again I attempted it, but the men held me
back.For this, I am now thankful, but at that time my life appeared of
so little importance, and the punishments I knew were in reserve for me
seemed so fearful, I voluntarily chose "strangling and death rather than
life."The captain and sailors were all Romanists, and seemed to vie
with each other in making me as unhappy as possible They made sport of
my "new fashioned clothing," and asked if I "did not wish to run away
again?"When they found I did not notice them they used the most abusive
and scurrilous language, mingled with vulgar and profane expressions,
which may not be repeated.The men who had charge of me, and who should
have protected me from such abuse, so far from doing it, joined in the
laugh, and appeared to think it a pleasant amusement to ridicule and vex
a poor helpless fugitive.May God forgive them for their cruelty, and
in the hour of their greatest need, may they meet with the kindness they
refused to me.At Lachine we changed boats and took another to Montreal.When we
arrived there, three priests were waiting for us.Their names I
perfectly remember, but I am not sure that I can spell them correctly.Having never learned while in the nunnery, to read, or spell anything
except a simple prayer, it is not strange if I do make mistakes, when
attempting to give names from memory.I can only give them as they were
pronounced.They were called Father Kelly, Dow, and Conroy.All the
priests were called father, of whatever age they might be.As we proceeded from the boat to the Nunnery, one of the priests went
before us while the others walked beside me, leading me between them.People gazed at us as we passed, but they did not dare to insult, or
laugh at me, while in such respectable company.Yet, methinks it
must have been a ludicrous sight to witness so much parade for a poor
run-a-way nun.On our arrival at the Nunnery, I was left alone for half an hour.Then
the Bishop came in with the Lady Superior, and the Abbess who had charge
of the kitchen when I left.The Bishop read to me three punishments of
which he said, I could take my choice.First.--To fast five days in the
fasting room.Second.--To suffer punishment in the lime room.Third.--To
fast four days, in the cell.As I knew nothing of these places except
the cell, a priest was directed to take me to them, that I might see for
myself, and then take my choice.At first, I thought I did not care, and
I said I had no choice about it; but when I came to see the rooms, I was
thankful that I was not allowed to abide by that decision.Certainly, I
had no idea what was before me.I was blindfolded, and taken to the lime room first.I think it must
have been situated at a great distance from the room we left, for he led
me down several flights of stairs, and through long, low passages, where
it was impossible to stand erect.At length we entered a room where the
atmosphere seemed laden with hot vapor.My blinder was removed, and I
found myself in a pleasant room some fifteen feet square.There was no
furniture of any kind, but a wide bench, fastened to the wall, extended
round three sides of the room.The floor looked like one solid block of
dark  marble; not a crack or seam to be seen in it, but it was
clouded, highly polished, and very beautiful.Around the sides of the
room, a great number of hooks and chains were fastened to the wall, and
a large hook hung in the center overhead.Near the door stood two men,
with long iron bars, some two inches square, on their shoulders.The priest directed me to stand upon the bench, and turning to the men,
he bade them raise the door.They put down their bars, and I suppose
touched a concealed spring, for the whole floor at once flew up, and
fastened to the large hook over head.Surprised and terrified, I stood
wondering what was to come next.At my feet yawned a deep pit, from
which, arose a suffocating vapor, so hot, it almost scorched my face and
nearly stopped my breath.The priest pointed to the heaving, tumbling
billows of smoke that were rolling below, and; asked, "How would you
like to be thrown into the lime?""Not at all," I gasped, in a voice
scarcely audible, "it would burn me to death."I suppose he thought I
was sufficiently frightened, for he bade his men close the door.This
they did by slowly letting down the floor, and I could see that it was
in some way supported by the chains attached to the walls but in what
manner I do not know.I was nearly suffocated by the lime smoke that filled the room, and
though I knew not what was in reserve for me, I was glad when my blinder
was put on, and I was led away.I think we returned the same way we
came, and entered another room where the scent was so very offensive,
that I begged to be taken out immediately.Even before my eyes were
uncovered, and I knew nothing of the loathsome objects by which we were
surrounded, I felt that I could not endure to breathe an atmosphere so
deadly.But the sight that met my eyes when my blinder was removed, I
cannot describe, nor the sensations with which I gazed upon it.I can
only give the reader some faint idea of the place, which, they said, was
called the fasting room, and here incorrigible offenders fasted until
they starved to death.Their dead bodies were not even
allowed a decent burial, but were suffered to remain in the place where
they died, until the work of death was complete and dust returned to
dust.Thus the atmosphere became a deadly poison to the next poor victim
who was left to breathe the noxious effluvia of corruption and decay.I
am well aware that my reader will hardly credit my statements, but I do
solemnly affirm that I relate nothing but the truth.In this room were
placed several large iron kettles, so deep that a person could sit in
them, and many of them contained the remains of human beings.In one the
corpse looked as though it had been dead but a short time.Others still
sat erect in the kettle, but the flesh was dropping from the bones.Every stage of decay was here represented, from the commencement, till
nothing but a pile of bones was left of the poor sufferer.Conceive, if you can, with what feelings I gazed upon these disgusting
relics of the dead.Even now, my blood chills in my veins, as memory
recalls the fearful sight, or as, in sleep, I live over again the
dread realities of that hour.I might,
perchance, escape it for that time, but what assurance had I that I was
not ultimately destined to such an end?These thoughts filled my mind,
as I followed the priest from the room; and for a long time I continued
to speculate upon what I had seen.They called it the fasting room; but
if fasting were the only object, why were they placed in those kettles,
instead of being allowed to sit on chairs or benches, or even on the
floor?And why placed in IRON kettles?It would have answered the purpose quite as well, if fasting
or starvation were the only objects in view.Then came the fearful
suggestion, were these kettles ever heated?And was that floor made
of stone or iron?The thought was too shocking to be cherished for a
moment; but I could not drive it from my mind.I was again blindfolded, and taken to a place they called a cell.But it
was quite different from the one I was in before.We descended several
steps as we entered it, and instead of the darkness I anticipated, I
found myself in a large room with sufficient light to enable me to see
every object distinctly.One end of a long chain was fastened around my
waist, and the other firmly secured to an iron ring in the floor; but
the chain, though large and heavy, was long enough to allow me to go all
over the room.I could not see how it was lighted, but it must have been
in some artificial manner, for it was quite as light at night, as in the
day.Here were instruments of various kinds, the use of which, I did
not understand; some of them lying on the floor, others attached to the
sides of the room.One of them was made in the form of a large fish,
but of what material I do not know.It was of a bright flesh color, and
fastened to a board on the floor.If I pressed my foot upon the board,
it would put in motion some machinery within, which caused it to spring
forward with a harsh, jarring sound like the rumbling of the cars.At
the same time its eyes would roll round, and its mouth open, displaying
a set of teeth so large and long that I was glad to keep at a safe
distance.I wished to know whether it would really bite me or not, but
it looked so frightful I did not dare to hazard the experiment.Another so nearly resembled a large serpent, I almost thought it was
one; but I found it moved only when touched in a certain manner.Then
it would roll over, open its mouth, and run out its tongue.There was
another that I cannot describe, for I never saw anything that looked
like it.It was some kind of a machine, and the turning of a crank made
it draw together in such a way, that if a person were once within its
embrace, the pressure would soon arrest the vital current, and stop
the breath of life.Around the walls of the room were chains, rings and
hooks, almost innumerable; but I did not know their use, and feared
to touch them.I believed them all to be instruments of torture, and I
thought they gave me a long chain in the hope and expectation that
my curiosity would lead me into some of the numerous traps the room
contained.Every morning the figure I had seen beside the dying nun, which they
called the devil, came to my cell, and unlocking the door himself,
entered, and walked around me, laughing heartily, and seeming much
pleased to find me there.He would blow white froth from his mouth, but
he never spoke to me, and when he went out, he locked the door after him
and took away the key.He was, in fact, very thoughtful and prudent, but
it will be long before I believe that he came as they pretended, from
the spirit world.So far from being frightened, the incident was rather
a source of amusement.Such questions as the following would force
themselves upon my mind.If that image is really the devil, where did he
get that key?Does the devil hold the keys
of this nunnery, so that he can come and go as he pleases?Or, are the
priests on such friendly terms with his satanic majesty that they lend
him their keys?Gentlemen of the Grey
Nunnery, please tell us how it is about those keys.One day a woman came into my cell, dressed in white, a white cap on
her head, and so very pale she looked more like a corpse than a living
person.She came up to me with her mouth wide open, and stood gazing
at me for a moment in perfect silence.She then asked, "Where have you
been?""Very
well," said I. She paused a moment, and then asked, "Did you find your
friends?""No, ma'am," said I, "I did not."Another pause, and then she
said, "Perhaps you will if you go again.""No," I replied, "I shall not
try again.""You had better try it once more," she added, and I thought
there was a slight sneer in her tone; "Perhaps you may succeed better
another time.""No," I replied, "I shall not try to run away from the
nunnery again.I should most assuredly be caught and brought back, and
then they would make me suffer so much, I assure you I shall never do it
again."She looked at me a moment as though she would read my very soul,
and said, "And so you did not find your friends, after all, did you?"I
again told her that I did not, and she seemed satisfied with the result
of her questioning.When she came in, I was pleased to see her, and
thought I would ask her for something to eat, or at least for a little
cold water.But she seemed so cold-hearted, so entirely destitute of
sympathy or kind feeling, I had no courage to speak to her, for I felt
that it would do no good.I knew from her looks
that she must have been a great sufferer; but I have heard it said that
extreme suffering sometimes hardens instead of softening the heart,
and I believe it.It seemed to me that this woman had suffered so much
herself, that every kind feeling was crushed out of her soul.I was glad
when she left me, locking the door after her.Four days they kept me in this cell, and for five days and nights I had
not tasted food or drink.I endured the most intolerable agonies from
hunger and thirst.The suffering produced by hunger, when it becomes
actual starvation, is far beyond anything that I can imagine.There
is no other sensation that can be compared to it, and no language can
describe it.One must feel it in order to realize what it is.The
first two days I amused myself by walking round my room and trying to
conjecture the use to which the various instruments were applied.Then
I became so weak I could only think of eating and drinking.I sometimes
fell asleep, but only to dream of loaded tables and luxurious feasts.Yet I could never taste the luxuries thus presented.Whenever I
attempted to do so, they would be snatched away, or I would wake to
find it all a dream.Driven to a perfect frenzy by the intensity of my
sufferings, I would gladly have eaten my own flesh.Well was it for me
that no sharp instrument was at hand, for as a last resort I more than
once attempted to tear open my veins with my teeth.This severe paroxysm passed away, and I sank into a state of partial
unconsciousness, in which I remained until I was taken out of the cell.I do not believe I should have lived many hours longer, nor should I
ever have been conscious of much more suffering.With me the "bitterness
of death had passed," and I felt disappointed and almost angry to be
recalled to a life of misery.It was
the only boon I craved.But this would have been too merciful; moreover,
they did not care to lose my services in the kitchen.I was a good
drudge for them, and they wished to restore me on the same principle
that a farmer would preserve the life of a valuable horse.The first thing I realized they were
placing me in a chair in the kitchen, and allowed me to lean my head
upon the table.They gave me some gruel, and I soon revived so that I
could sit up in my chair and speak in a whisper.But it was some hours
before I could stand on my feet or speak loud.An Abbess was in the
kitchen preparing bread and wine for the priests (they partake of
these refreshments every day at ten in the morning and three in the
afternoon).She brought a pailful of wine and placed it on the table
near me, and left a glass standing beside it.When she turned away, I
took the glass, dipped up a little of the wine, and drank it.She saw
me do it, but said not a word, and I think she left it there for that
purpose.The wine was very strong, and my stomach so weak, I soon began
to feel sick, and asked permission to go to bed.They took me up in
their arms and carried me to my old room and laid me on the bed.Here
they left me, but the Abbess soon returned with some gruel made very
palatable with milk and sugar.I was weak, and my hand trembled so that
I could not feed myself; but the Abbess kindly sat beside me and fed me
until I was satisfied.I had nothing more to eat until the next day at
eleven o'clock, when the Abbess again brought me some bread and gruel,
and a cup of strong tea.She requested me to drink the tea as quick as
possible, and then she concealed the mug in which she brought it.I was now able to feed myself, and you may be sure I had an excellent
appetite, and was not half so particular about my food as some persons
I have since known.I lay in bed till near night, when I rose, dressed
myself without assistance, and went down to the kitchen.I was so weak
and trembled so that I could hardly manage to get down stairs; but
I succeeded at last, for a strong will is a wonderful incentive to
efficient action.She saw how weak I was, and as
she assisted me to a chair, she said, "I should not have supposed that
you could get down here alone.Have you had anything to eat to-day?"I
was about to say yes, but one of the nuns shook her head at me, and I
replied "No."She then brought some bread and wine, requesting me to eat
it quick, for fear some of the priests might come in and detect us.Thus
I saw that she feared the priests as well as the rest of us.Truly,
it was a terrible crime she had committed!No wonder she was afraid
of being caught!Giving a poor starved nun a piece of bread, and then
obliged to conceal it as she would have done a larceny or a murder!Think of it, reader, and conceive, if you can, the state of that
community where humanity is a crime--where mercy is considered a
weakness of which one should be ashamed!If a pirate or a highwayman had
been guilty of treating a captive as cruelly as I was treated by those
priests, he would have been looked upon as an inhuman monster, and at
once given up to the strong grasp of the law.But when it is done by a
priest, under the cloak of Religion, and within the sacred precincts of
a nunnery, people cry out, when the tale is told, "Impossible!""What
motive could they have had?"But whether
the statement is believed or otherwise, it is a fact that in the Grey
Nunnery at Montreal the least exhibition of a humane spirit was
punished as a crime.The nun who was found guilty of showing mercy to a
fellow-sufferer was sure to find none herself.From this time I gained very fast, for the Abbess saw how hungry I was,
and she would either put food in my way, or give me privately what I
wished to eat.In two weeks I was able to go to work in the kitchen
again.But those I had formerly seen there were gone.I never knew what
became of the sick nun, nor could I learn anything about the one who ran
away with me.I thought that the men who brought me to St.Regis, were
kept there to go after her, but I do not know whether they found her
or not.For myself, I promised so solemnly, and with such apparent
sincerity, that I would never leave the nunnery again, I was believed
and trusted.Had I been kindly treated, had my life been even tolerable,
my conscience would have reproached me for deceiving them, but as it
was, I felt that I was more "sinned against, than sinning."I could not
think it wrong to get away, if the opportunity presented, and for this I
was constantly on the watch.Every night I lay awake long after all
the rest were buried in slumber, trying to devise some plan, by which
I could once more regain my liberty.Having
just tasted the sweets of freedom, how could I be content to remain in
servitude all my life?Many a time have I left my bed at night, resolved
to try to escape once more, but the fear of detection would deter me
from the attempt.In the discharge of my daily duties, I strove to the utmost of my
ability to please my employers.I so far succeeded, that for five weeks
after my return I escaped punishment.Then, I made a slight mistake
about my work, though I verily thought I was doing it according to the
direction.For this, I was told that I must go without two meals, and
spend three days in the torture room.I supposed it was the same room I
was in before, but I was mistaken.I was taken into the kitchen cellar,
and down a flight of stairs to another room directly under it.From
thence, a door opened into another subterranean apartment which they
called the torture room.These doors were so constructed, that a casual
observer would not be likely to notice them.I had been in that cellar
many times, but never saw that door until I was taken through it.A
person might live in the nunnery a life-time, and never see or hear
anything of such a place.I presume those visitors who call at the
school-rooms, go over a part of the house, and leave with the impression
that the convent is a nice place, will never believe my statements about
this room.It is exceedingly
difficult for pure minds to conceive how any human being can be so
fearfully depraved.Knowing the purity of their own intentions, and
judging others by themselves, it is not strange that they regard such
tales of guilt and terror as mere fabrications, put forth to gratify the
curiosity of the wonder-loving crowd.I remember hearing a gentleman at the depot remark that the very
enormity of the crimes committed by the Romanists, is their best
protection."For," said he, "some of their practices are so shockingly
infamous they may not even be alluded to in the presence of the refined
and the virtuous.And if the story of their guilt were told, who would
believe the tale?Far easier would it be to call the whole a slanderous
fabrication, than to believe that man can be so vile."This consideration led me to doubt the propriety of attempting a
description of what I saw in that room.But I have engaged to give a
faithful narrative of what transpired in the nunnery; and shall I leave
out a part because it is so strange and monstrous, that people will not
believe it?I will tell, without the least exaggeration what I saw,
heard, and experienced.People may not credit the story now, but a day
will surely come when they will know that I speak the truth.As I entered the room I was exceedingly shocked at the horrid spectacle
that met my eye.I knew that fearful scenes were enacted in the
subterranean cells, but I never imagined anything half so terrible as
this.In various parts of the room I saw machines, and instruments of
torture, and on some of them persons were confined who seemed to be
suffering the most excruciating agony.I paused, utterly overcome with
terror, and for a moment imagined that I was a witness to the torments,
which, the priests say, are endured by the lost, in the world of woe.Was I to undergo such tortures, and which of those infernal engines
would be applied to me?The priest took hold of
me and put me into a machine that held me fast, while my feet rested
on a piece of iron which was gradually heated until both feet were
blistered.I think I must have been there fifteen minutes, but perhaps
the time seemed longer than it was.He then took me out, put some
ointment on my feet and left me.I was now at liberty to examine more minutely the strange objects around
me.There were some persons in the place whose punishment, like my own,
was light compared with others.But near me lay one old lady extended
on a rack.Her joints were all dislocated, and she was emaciated to the
last degree.I do not suppose I can describe this rack, for I never saw
anything like it.It looked like a gridiron but was long enough for the
tallest man to lie upon.There were large rollers at each end, to which
belts were attached, with a large lever to drive them back and forth.Upon this rack the poor woman was fastened in such a way, that when the
levers were turned and the rollers made to revolve, every bone in her
body was displaced.Then the violent strain would be relaxed, a little,
and she was so very poor, her skin would sink into the joints and remain
there till it mortified and corrupted.It was enough to melt the hardest heart to witness her agony; but
she bore it with a degree of fortitude and patience, I could not have
supposed possible, had I not been compelled to behold it.When I entered
the room she looked up and said, "Have you come to release me, or only
to suffer with me?"I did not dare to reply, for the priest was there,
but when he left us she exclaimed, "My child, let nothing induce you
to believe this cursed religion.It will be the death of you, and that
death, will be the death of a dog."I suppose she meant that they would
kill me as they would a dog.She then asked, "Who put you here?""He must have been a brute," said she, "or he never
could have done it."At one time I happened to mention the name of
God, when she fiercely exclaimed with gestures of contempt, "A God!You
believe there is one, do you?Don't you suffer yourself to believe any
such thing.Think you that a wise, merciful, and all powerful being
would allow such a hell as this to exist?Would he suffer me to be torn
from friends and home, from my poor children and all that my soul holds
dear, to be confined in this den of iniquity, and tortured to death in
this cruel manner?He would at once destroy these monsters
in human form; he would not suffer them, for one moment, to breathe the
pure air of heaven."At another time she exclaimed, "O, my children!Thus, at one moment, she would say there was no God, and the next,
pray to him for help.This did not surprise me, for she was in such
intolerable misery she did not realize what she did say.Every few hours
the priest came in, and gave the rollers a turn, when her joints would
crack and--but I cannot describe it.The sight made me sick and faint at
the time, as the recollection of it, does now.It seemed as though that
man must have had a heart of adamant, or he could not have done it.She would shriek, and groan, and weep, but it did not affect him in the
least.He was as calm, and deliberate as though he had a block of wood
in his hands, instead of a human being.When I saw him coming, I once
shook my head at her, to have her stop speaking; but when he was gone,
she said, "Don't shake your head at me; I do not fear him.He can but
kill me, and the quicker he does it the better.I would be glad if he
would put an end to my misery at once, but that would be too merciful.He is determined to kill me by inches, and it makes no difference what I
say to him."She had no food, or drink, during the three days I was there, and the
priest never spoke to her.He brought me my bread and water regularly,
and I would gladly have given it to that poor woman if she would have
taken it.It would only prolong
her sufferings, and she wished to die.I do not suppose she could have
lived, had she been taken out when I first saw her.In another part of the room, a monk was under punishment.He was
standing in some kind of a machine, with heavy weights attached to his
feet, and a belt passed across his breast under his arms.He appeared to
be in great distress, and no refreshment was furnished him while I was
there.On one side of the room, I observed a closet with a "slide door," as the
nuns called them.There were several doors of this description in the
building, so constructed as to slide back into the ceiling out of
sight.Through this opening I could see an image resembling a monk; and
whenever any one was put in there, they would shriek, and groan, and beg
to be taken out, but I could not ascertain the cause of their suffering.One day a nun was brought in to be punished.The priest led her up to
the side of the room, and bade her put her fingers into some holes in
the wall just large enough to admit them.She obeyed but immediately
drew them back with a loud shriek.I looked to see what was the matter
with her, and lo!every nail was torn from her fingers, which were
bleeding profusely.How it was done, I do not know.Certainly, there was
no visible cause for such a surprising effect.In all probability the
fingers came in contact with the spring of some machine on the other
side, or within the wall to which some sharp instrument was attached.I
would give much to know just how it was constructed, and what the
girl had done to subject herself to such a terrible and unheard-of
punishment.But this, like many other things in that establishment, was
wrapped in impenetrable mystery.God only knows when the veil will be
removed, or whether it ever will be until the day when all secret things
will be brought to light.When the three days expired, I was taken out of this room, but did not
go to work again till my feet were healed.I was then obliged to assist
in milking the cows, and taking care of the milk.They had a large
number of cows, I believe thirty-five, and dairy rooms, with every thing
convenient for making butter and cheese.When first directed to go
out and milk, I was pleased with the idea, for I hoped to find and
opportunity to escape; but I was again disappointed.In the cow yard, as
elsewhere, every precaution was taken to prevent it.Passing out of the main yard of the convent through a small door, I
found myself in a small, neat yard, surrounded by a high fence, so that
nothing could be seen but the sky overhead.The cows were driven in,
and the door immediately locked, so that escape from that place seemed
impossible.At harvest time, in company with twenty other nuns, I was taken out
into the country to the residence of the monks.The ride out there was
a great treat, and very much enjoyed by us all.I believe it was about
five miles, through a part of the city of Montreal; the north part
I think, but I am not sure.We stopped before a large white stone
building, situated in the midst of a large yard like the one at the
nunnery.A beautiful walk paved with stone, led from the gate to the
front door, and from thence, around the house.Within the yard, there
was also a delightful garden, with neat, well kept walks laid out in
various directions.Before the front door there stood a large cross.I think I never saw a more charming place; it appeared to me a perfect
paradise.I heard one of the priests say that the farm consisted of four
hundred acres, and belonged to the nunnery.The house was kept by two
widow ladies who were married before they embraced the Romish faith.They were the only women on the place previous to our arrival, and I
think they must have found it very laborious work to wait upon so many
monks.I do not know their number, but there was a great many of them,
besides a large family of boys, who, I suppose, were being educated for
priests or monks.Immediately on our arrival a part of our number were set to work in the
fields, while the rest were kept in the house to assist the women.I
hoped that I might be one of these last, but disappointment was again
my lot.I was sent to the field with the others, and set to reaping; a
priest being stationed near, to guard us and oversee our work.We were
watched very closely, one priest having charge of two nuns, for whose
safe keeping he was responsible.Here we labored until the harvest was
all gathered in.I dug potatoes, cut up corn and husked it, gathered
apples, and did all kinds of work that is usually done by men in the
fall of the year.Yet I was never allowed to wear a bonnet on my head,
or anything to shield me from the piercing rays of the sun.Some
days the heat was almost intolerable, and my cap was not the least
protection, but they allowed me no other covering.In consequence of this exposure, my head soon became the seat of severe
neuralgic pain, which caused me at times to linger over my work.My movements were immediately quickened, for the
work must be done notwithstanding the severe pain.Every command must be
obeyed whatever the result.At night a part of our number were taken to the nunnery, and the rest
of us locked up in our rooms in the house.We were not permitted to
take our meals with the two housekeepers, but a table was set for us in
another room.One would think that when gathering the fruit we would
be allowed to partake of it, or at least to taste it.But this was not
allowed; and as a priest's eye was ever upon us, we dare not disobey,
however much we might wish to do so.I used to wonder if the two women
who kept the house were as severely dealt with as we were, but had no
means whereby to satisfy my curiosity.They were not allowed to converse
with us, and we might not speak to them, or even look them in the face.Here, as at the nunnery, we were obliged to walk with the head bent
forward a little, the eyes fixed on the floor, one hand, if disengaged,
under the cape, the other down by the side, and on no occasion might we
look a person in the face.The two women seemed to be governed by the
same rules that we were, and subject to the same masters.I used to
think a great deal about them, and longed to know their history.They
wore blue dresses, with white caps, and white handkerchiefs on their
necks.Their life, I think, was a hard one.While we remained at this place I was not punished in any of the usual
methods.Perhaps they thought the exposure to a burning sun, and a
severe headache, sufficient to keep me in subjection without any other
infliction.But immediately on my return to the nunnery I was again
subjected to the same cruel, capricious, and unreasonable punishment.On the first day after my return one of the priests came into the
kitchen where I was at work, and I hastened to give him the usual
respectful salutation, which I have before described.But he took hold
of my arm and said, "What do you look so cross for?"And without giving
me time to reply, even if I had dared to do so, he added, "I'll teach
you not to look cross at me."He left the room, with an expression of
countenance that frightened me.I was not aware of looking cross at him,
though I must confess I had suffered so much at his hands already, I did
not feel very happy in his presence; yet I always endeavored to treat
him with all due respect.Certainly his accusation against me in this
instance was as false as it was cruel.I was only
a nun, and who would care if I was punished unjustly?The priest soon
returned with a band of leather, or something of the kind, into which
thorns were fastened in such numbers that the inside was completely
covered with them.This he fastened around my head with the points of
the thorns pressing into the skin, and drew it so tight that the blood
ran in streams over my neck and shoulders.I wore this band, or "crown
of thorns;" as they called it, for six hours, and all the time continued
my work as usual.Then I thought of the "crown of thorns" our Saviour
wore when he gave his life a ransom for the sins of the world.I thought
I could realize something of his personal agony, and the prayer of my
soul went up to heaven for grace to follow his example and forgive my
tormentors.From this time I was punished every day while I remained there, and
for the most simple things.It was evident they wished to break down my
spirit, but it only confirmed me in my resolution to get away from them
as soon as possible.One day I chanced to close the door a little too hard.It was mere
accident, but for doing it they burned me with red hot tongs.They kept
them in the fire till they were red hot, then plunged them into cold
water, drew them out as quickly as possible, and immediately applied
them to my arms or feet.The skin would, of course adhere to the iron,
and it would sometime burn down to the bone before they condescended to
remove it.At another time I was cruelly burned on my arms and shoulders
for not standing erect.The flesh was deep in some places, and the agony
I suffered was intolerable.I thought of the stories the Abbess used to
tell me years before about the martyrs who were burned at the stake.But
I had not a martyr's faith, and I could not imitate their patience and
resignation.The sores made on these occasions were long in healing,
and to this day I bear upon my person the scars caused by these frequent
burnings.I was often punished because I forgot to walk on my toes.For this
trivial offence I have often been made to fast two days.We all wore
cloth shoes, and it was the rule of the house that we should all walk on
tip-toe.Sometimes we would forget, and take a step or two in the usual
way; and then it did seem as though they rejoiced in the opportunity to
inflict punishment.It was the only amusement they had, and there was so
little variety in their daily life, I believe they were glad of anything
to break in upon the monotony of convent life, and give them a little
excitement.It was very hard for me to learn to walk on my toes, and
as I often failed to do it, I was of course punished for the atrocious
crime.But I did learn at last, for what can we not accomplish by
resolute perseverance?Several years of practice so confirmed the habit
that I found it as difficult to leave off as it was to begin.Even now I
often find myself tripping along on tip-toe before I am aware of it.We had a very cruel abbess in the kitchen, and this was one reason of
our being punished so often.She was young and inexperienced, and had
just been promoted to office, with which she seemed much pleased and
elated.She embraced every opportunity to exercise her authority, and
often have I fasted two whole days for accidentally spilling a little
water on the kitchen floor.Whenever she wished to call my attention to
her, she did not content herself with simply speaking, but would box my
ears, pull my hair, pinch my arms, and in many ways so annoy and provoke
me that I often wished her dead.One day when I was cleaning knives and
forks she came up to me and gave me such a severe pinch on my arm that
I carried the marks for many days.I did not wait to think what I was
doing, but turned and struck her with all my might.It could not have
been a light blow, for I was very angry.She turned away, saying she
should report me to the Lady Superior.I did not answer her, but as she
passed through the door I threw a knife which I hoped would hit her, but
it struck the door as she closed it.I expected something dreadful would
be done to me after this wilful violation of a well known law.But I
could bear it, I thought, and I was glad I hit her so hard.She soon returned with a young priest, who had been there but a short
time, and his heart had not yet become so hard as is necessary to be
a good Romish priest.He came to me and asked, "What is the matter?"I told him the Abbess punished me every day, that in fact I was under
punishment most of the time; that I did not deserve it, and I was
resolved to bear it no longer.I struck her because she pinched me for
no good reason; and I should in future try to defend myself from her
cruelty."Do you know," said he, "what will be done to you for this?""No, sir,"
said I, "I do not know," and I was about to add, "I do not care," but
I restrained myself.He went out, and for a long time I expected to be
called to account, but I heard no more of it.The Abbess, however, went
on in the old way, tormenting me on every occasion.One day the priests had a quarrel among themselves, and if I had said a
DRUNKEN QUARREL, I do not think it would have been a very great mistake.In the fray they stabbed one of their number in the side, drew him out
of his room, and left him on the floor in the hall of the main building,
but one flight of stairs above the kitchen.Two nuns, who did the
chamber work, came down stairs, and, seeing him lie there helpless and
forsaken, they took him by the hair of the head and drew him down to the
kitchen.Here they began to torment him in the most cruel manner.They
burned sticks in the fire until the end was a live coal, put them into
his hands and closed them, pressing the burning wood into the flesh, and
thus producing the most exquisite pain.At least this would have
been the result if he had realized their cruelty.But I think he was
insensible before they touched him, or if not, must have died very soon
after, for I am sure he was dead when I first saw him.I went to them and remonstrated against such inhuman conduct.But one of
the nuns replied, "That man has tormented me more than I can him, if I
do my best, and I wish him to know how good it is.""But," said I, "some
one will come in, and you will be caught in the act.""I'll risk that,"
said she, "they are quarreling all over the house, and will have enough
to do to look after each other for a while, I assure you.""But the man
is dead," said I."How can you treat a senseless corpse in that way?""I'm afraid he is dead," she replied, he don't move at all, and I can't
feel his heart beat; but I did hope to make him realize how good the
fire feels."Meanwhile, the blood was flowing from the wound in his side, and ran
over the floor.The sight of this alarmed them, and they drew him into
another dark hall, and left him beside the door of a room used for
punishment.They then came back, locked the hall door, and washed up the
blood.They expected to be punished for moving the dead body, but the
floor was dry before any of the priests came in, and I do not think it
was ever known.Perhaps they did not remember events as distinctly as
they might under other circumstances, and it is very possible, that,
when they found the corpse they might not have been able to say whether
it was where they left it, or not.We all rejoiced over the death of
that priest.He was a very cruel man; had punished me times without
number, but, though I was glad he was dead, I could not have touched him
when he lay helpless and insensible.A few weeks after the events just related, another trifling occurrence
brought me into collision with the Abbess.And here let me remark that
I have no way, by which to ascertain at what particular time certain
events transpired.The reader will understand that I write this
narrative from memory, and our life at the nunnery was so monotonous,
the days and weeks passed by with such dull, and irksome uniformity,
that sometimes our frequent punishments were the only memorable events
to break in upon the tiresome sameness of our unvarying life.Of course
the most simple thing was regarded by us as a great event, something
worthy of special notice, because, for the time, it diverted our minds
from the peculiar restraints of our disagreeable situation.To illustrate this remark let me relate an incident that transpired
about this time.I was one day sent to a part of the house where I was
not in the habit of going.I was passing along a dark hall, when a ray
of light from an open door fell upon my path.I looked up, and as the
door at that moment swung wide open, I saw, before a glass, in a richly
furnished room, the most beautiful woman I ever beheld.From the purity
of her complexion, and the bright color of her cheeks and lips, I could
have taken her for a piece of wax work, but for the fact that she was
carelessly arranging her hair.She was tall, and elegant in person,
with a countenance of such rare and surpassing beauty, I involuntarily
exclaimed, "What a beautiful woman!"She turned towards me with a
smile of angelic sweetness, while an expression of sympathetic emotion
overspread her exquisitely moulded features, which seemed to say as
plainly as though she had spoken in words, "Poor child, I pity you."I now became conscious that I was breaking the rules of the house, and
hastened away.But O, how many days my soul fed on that smile!I never
saw the lady again, her name I could never know, but that look of
tenderness will never be forgotten.It was something to think of through
many dreary hours, something to look back to, and be grateful for, all
the days of my life.The priests had a large quantity of sap
gathered from the maple trees, and brought to the nunnery to be boiled
into sugar.Another nun and myself were left to watch it, keep the
kettle filled up, and prevent it from burning.It was boiled in the
large caldron of which I have before spoken, and covered with a large,
thin, wooden cover.The sap had boiled some time, and become very thick.I was employed in filling up the kettle when the Abbess came into the
room, and after a few inquiries, directed me to stand upon the cover of
the caldron, and fix a large hook directly over it.I objected, for I
know full well that it would not bear a fourth part of my weight.She
then took hold of me, and tried to force me to step upon it, but I knew
I should be burned to death, for the cover, on account of its enormous
size was made as thin as possible, that we might be able to lift it.When I saw that she was determined to make me yield, in self defence,
I threw her upon the floor.Would that I had been content to stop
here.When I saw her in my power, and remembered how much I
had suffered from her, my angry passions rose, and I thought only of
revenge.I commenced beating her with all my might, and when I stopped from mere
exhaustion, the other nun caught her by the hair and began to draw
her round the room.She struggled and shrieked, but she could not help
herself.Her screams, however, alarmed the house, and hearing one of the
priests coming, the nun gave her a kick and left her.The priest
asked what we were doing, and the Abbess related with all possible
exaggeration, the story of our cruelty.asked the priest "You gave them some provocation, or they never would
treat you so."She was then obliged to tell what had passed between us,
and he said she deserved to suffer for giving such an order."Why," said
he, "that cover would not have held her a moment, and she would most
assuredly have burned to death."He punished us all; the Abbess for
giving the order, and us for abusing her.I should not have done this
thing, had I not come off so well, when I once before attempted to
defend myself; but my success at that time gave me courage to try it
again.My punishment was just, and I bore it very well, consoled by the
thought that justice was awarded to the Abbess, as well as myself.SICKNESS AND DEATH OF A SUPERIOR.The next excitement in our little community was caused by the sickness
and death of our Superior.I do not know what her disease was, but she
was sick two weeks, and one of the nuns from the kitchen was sent to
take care of her.One night she was so much worse, the nun thought she
would die, and she began to torment her in the most inhuman manner.She
had been severely punished a short time before at the instigation of
this woman, and she then swore revenge if she ever found an opportunity.She was in her power, too weak to resist or call
for assistance, and she resolved to let her know by experience how
bitterly she had made others suffer in days gone by.It was a fiendish
spirit, undoubtedly, that prompted her to seek revenge upon the dying,
but what else could we expect?She only followed the example of her
elders, and if she went somewhat beyond their teachings, she had, as we
shall see, her reasons for so doing.With hot irons she burned her on
various parts of her person, cut great gashes in the flesh upon her
face, sides, and arms, and then rubbed salt and pepper into the wounds.The wretched woman died before morning, and the nun went to the priest
and told him that the Superior was dead, and that she had killed her.The priests were immediately all called together, and the Bishop called
upon for counsel.He sentenced her to be hung that morning in the chapel
before the assembled household.The Abbess came and informed us what had
taken place, and directed us to get ready and go to the chapel.When we
entered, the doomed girl sat upon a chair on the altar.She was clad
in a white robe, with a white cap on her head, and appeared calm,
self-possessed, and even joyful.The Bishop asked her if she had
anything to say for herself.She immediately rose and said, "I have
killed the Superior, for which I am to be hung.I know that I deserve
to die, but I have suffered more than death many times over, from
punishments inflicted by her order.For many years my life has been one
of continual suffering; and for what?For just nothing at all, or for
the most simple things.Is it right, is it just to starve a person two
whole days for shutting the door a little too hard?or to burn one with
hot irons because a little water was accidentally spilt on the floor?Yet for these and similar things I have again and again been tortured
within an inch of my life.Now that I am to be hung, I am glad of
it, for I shall die quick, and be out of my misery, instead of being
tortured to death by inches.I did this thing for this very purpose,
for I do not fear death nor anything that comes after it.And the story of
heaven and hell, purgatory, and the Virgin Mary; why, it's all a humbug,
like the rest of the vile stuff you call religion.You wont catch us nuns believing it, and more than all that, you don't
believe it yourselves, not one of you."She sat down, and they put a cap over her head and face, drew it tight
around her neck, adjusted the rope, and she was launched into eternity.Sandra went to the bathroom.To me it seemed a horrid thing, and I could not look upon her dying
struggles.I did not justify the girl in what she had done, yet I knew
that the woman would have died if she had let her alone; and I also knew
that worse things than that were done in the nunnery almost every day,
and that too by the very men who had taken her life.I left the chapel
with a firm resolve to make one more effort to escape from a thraldom
that everyday became more irksome.At the door the Abbess met me, and led me to a room I had never seen
before, where, to my great surprise, I found my bed.She said it was
removed by her order, and in future I was to sleep in that room.I exclaimed, quite forgetting, in the agitation of
the moment, the rule of silent obedience.But she did not condescend
to notice either my question or the unpleasant feelings which must have
been visible in my features.I had never
slept in a room alone a night in my life.Another nun always occupied
the room with me, and when she was absent, as she often was when under
punishment, the Abbess slept there, so that I was never alone.I did
not often meet the girl with whom I slept, as she did not work in the
kitchen, but whenever I did, I felt as pleased as though she had been my
sister.Yet I never spoke to her, nor did she ever attempt to converse
with me.Yes, strange as it may seem, incredible as my reader may think
it, it is a fact, that during all the years we slept together, not one
word ever passed between us.We did not even dare to communicate our
thoughts by signs, lest the Abbess should detect us.That night I spent in my new room; but I could not sleep.I had heard
strange hints about some room where no one could sleep, and where no one
liked to go, though for what reason I could never learn.When I first
entered, I discovered that the floor was badly stained, and, while
speculating on the cause of those stains, I came to the conclusion that
this was the room to which so much mystery was attached.It was
very dark, with no window in it, situated in the midst of the house,
surrounded by other rooms, and no means of ventilation except the door.I did not close my eyes during the whole night.I imagined that the door
opened and shut, that persons were walking in the room, and I am
certain that I heard noises near my bed for which I could not account.Altogether, it was the most uncomfortable night I ever spent, and
I believe that few persons would have felt entirely at ease in my
situation.To such a degree did these superstitious fears assail me, I felt as
though I would endure any amount of physical suffering rather than stay
there another night.Resolved to brave everything, I went to a priest
and asked permission to speak to him.It was an unusual thing, and I
think his curiosity was excited, for it was only in extreme cases that
a nun ventures to appeal to a priest When I told him my story, he seemed
much surprised, and asked by whose order my bed was moved to that room.I informed him of all the particulars, when he ordered me to move my bed
back again."No one," said he, "has slept in that room for years, and we
do not wish any one to sleep there."I accordingly moved the bed back,
and as I had permission from the priest, the Abbess dared not find fault
with me.STUDENTS AT THE ACADEMY.Through the winter I continued to work as usual, leading the same dull,
dreary, and monotonous life, varied only by pains, and privations.In
the spring a slight change was made in the household arrangements, and
for a short time I assisted some of the other nuns to do the chamber
work for the students at the academy.There was an under-ground passage
from the convent to the cellar of the academy through which we passed.Before we entered, the doors and windows were securely fastened, and the
students ordered to leave their rooms, and not return again till we had
left.They were also forbidden to speak to us, but whenever the teachers
were away, they were sure to come back to their rooms, and ask us all
manner of questions.They wished to know, they said, how long we were
going to stay in the convent, if we really enjoyed the life we had
chosen, and were happy in our retirement; if we had not rather return
to the world, go into company, get married, etc.I suppose they really
thought that we could leave at any time if we chose.But we did not dare
to answer their questions, or let them know the truth.One day, when we went to do the work, we found in one of the rooms, some
men who were engaged in painting.We did not dare to reply, lest they should betray us.They then began to
make remarks about us, some of which I well remember.One of them said,
"I don't believe they are used very well; they look as though they were
half starved."Another replied, "I know they do; there is certainly
something wrong about these convents, or the nuns would not all look so
pale and thin."I suspect the man little thought how much truth there
was in his remarks.Soon after the painters left we were all taken suddenly ill.Some were
worse than others, but all were unwell except one nun.As all exhibited
the same symptoms, we were supposed to have taken poison, and suspicion
fastened on that nun.She was put upon the rack, and when she saw that
her guilt could not be concealed, she confessed that she poisoned the
water in the well, but she would not tell what she put into it, nor
where she got it.She said she did not do it to injure the nuns, for she
thought they were allowed so little drink with their food, they would
not be affected by it, while those who drank more, she hoped to kill.She disliked all the priests, and the Superior, and would gladly have
murdered them all.But for one priest in particular, she felt all the
hatred that a naturally malignant spirit, excited by repeated acts
of cruelty, is capable of.He had punished her repeatedly, and as she
thought, unjustly, and she resolved to avenge herself and destroy her
enemy, even though the innocent should suffer with the guilty.This was
all wrong, fearfully wrong we must admit.But while we look with
horror at the enormity of her crime let us remember that she had great
provocation.I hope there are few who could have sought revenge in the
way she did; yet I cannot believe that any one would endure from another
what she was compelled to suffer from that man, without some feelings of
resentment.Let us not judge too harshly this erring sister, for if
her crime was great, her wrongs were neither small nor few, and her
punishment was terrible.They tortured her a long time to make her tell what kind of poison she
put in the well, and where she obtained it.They supposed she must have
got it from the painters, but she would never tell where she procured
it.This fact proves that she had some generous feelings left.Under any
other circumstances such magnanimity would have been highly applauded,
and in my secret soul I could not but admire the firmness with which
she bore her sufferings.She was kept upon the rack until all her joints
were dislocated, and the flesh around them mortified.They then carried
her to her room, removed the bed, and laid her upon the bedcord.The
nuns were all assembled to look at her, and take warning by her sad
fate.Such a picture of misery I never saw before.She seemed to have
suffered even more than the old lady I saw in the cellar.It was but a
moment, however, that we were allowed to gaze upon her shrunken ghastly
features, and then she was hid from our sight forever.The nuns,
except two or three, were sent from the room, and thus the murder was
consummated.There was one young student at the academy whose name was Smalley.He
was from New England, and his father lived at St.Albans, Vt., where he
had wealth and influence.This young man had a little sister who used to
visit at the convent, whom they called Sissy Smalley.She was young, but
handsome, witty and intelligent.For one of her age, she was very much
refined in her manners.They allowed her to go anywhere in the building
except the private apartments where those deeds of darkness were
performed which would not bear the pure light of heaven.I presume that
no argument could convince little Sissy Smalley that such rooms were
actually in the nunnery.She had been all over it, she would tell
you, and she never saw any torture rooms, never heard of any one being
punished, or anything of the kind.Such reports would appear to her as
mere slanders, yet God knows they are true.I well remember how I used
to shudder to hear that child praise the nunnery, tell what a nice,
quiet place it was, and how she would like it for a permanent home.I
hope her brother will find out the truth about it in season to prevent
his beautiful sister from ever becoming a nun.SECOND ESCAPE FROM THE NUNNERY.It was early in the spring, when I again succeeded in making my escape.It was on a Saturday evening, when the priests and nearly all the nuns
were In the chapel.I was assisted out of the yard in the same way I was
before, and by the same person.There was still snow upon the ground and
that they might not be able to track me, I entered the market and walked
the whole length of it without attracting observation.From thence I
crossed the street, when I saw a police officer coming directly towards
me.I turned down a dark alley and ran for my life, I knew not whither.It is the duty of every police officer in Montreal to accompany any of
the sisters whom they chance to meet in the street, and I knew if he saw
me he would offer to attend me wherever I wished to go.Such an offer
might not be refused, and, certainly, his company, just at that time,
was neither desirable nor agreeable.At the end of the alley, I found myself near a large church, and two
priests were coming directly towards me.It is said "the drowning catch
at straws."Whether this be true or not, the plan which I adopted in
this emergency seemed as hopeless for my preservation, as a straw for
the support of the drowning.Yet it was the only course I could pursue,
for to escape unseen was impossible.I therefore resolved to go boldly
past them, and try to make them think I was a Superior going to church.Trying to appear as indifferent as possible, I approached, and saluted
them in the usual way.This is done by throwing forward the open hand,
and passing it down by the side with a slight inclination of the head.The priest returns the salutation by standing with uncovered head till
you have passed.In the present instance, the priest said, as he removed
his hat, "Church is in, Sister."With
trembling limbs I ascended the Church steps, and stood there till the
priests were out of sight.It was but a moment, yet it seemed a long
time.I knew the house was filled with priests and students, some of
whom would be sure to recognize me at once.The thought of it nearly took away my breath.The cold perspiration
started from my brow, and I felt as though I should faint.But my fears
were not realized, and as soon as the priests were out of sight, I went
on again.Soon I came to a cross street, leading to the river, where a
large hotel stood on the corner.I followed the river, and travelled all
night.The next day, fearing to be seen by people going to church, I hid
in a cellar hole, covered over with old boards and timbers.At night I went on again, and on Sunday evening about ten o'clock I came
to a small village where I resolved to seek food and lodging.Tired,
hungry and cold, feeling as though I could not take another step, I
called at one of the houses, and asked permission to stay over night.The lady gave me some milk, and I retired to
rest.Next morning, I rose early and left before any of the family were
up.I knew they were all Romanists, and I feared to trust them.Oars, a town, named, as I have been
informed, for the man who owns a great part of it.I stopped at a public
house, which, they called, "Lady St.Oars," where they were eating
dinner.The landlady invited me to dine with them, and asked if I
belonged to the convent in that place.I told her that I did, for I knew
if I told the truth they would suspect me at once.I
replied in the affirmative, and she gave me a slice of bread and butter,
a piece of cheese and a silver cup full of milk.I ate it all, and would
gladly have eaten more, for I was very hungry.As I was about to leave,
the lady remarked, "There was grease in that cheese, was it a sin for me
to give it to you?"I assured her it was not, for I was allowed to eat
milk, and the cheese being made of milk, there could be no sin in my
eating it I told her that, so far from committing a sin, the blessed
Virgin was pleased with her benevolent spirit, and would, in some way,
reward her for her kindness.Oars, I went on to the next town where I arrived at
seven in the evening.I called at the house of a Frenchman, and asked if
I could stay over night, or at least, be allowed to rest awhile.The man
said I was welcome to come in, but he had no place where I could sleep.They were just sitting down to supper, which consisted of pea soup;
but the lady said there was meat in it, and she would not invite me
to partake of it; but she gave me a good supper of bread and milk.She
thought I was a Sister of Charity, and I did not tell her that I was
not.After supper, she saw that my skirt was stiff with mud, and kindly
offered to wash it out for me, saying, I could rest till it was dry.I joyfully accepted her offer, and reclining in a corner, enjoyed a
refreshing slumber.It was near twelve o'clock before I was ready to go on again, and when
I asked how far it was to the next town, they manifested a great anxiety
for my welfare.The man said it was seven miles to Mt.Bly, but he hoped
I did not intend to walk.I told him I did not know whether I should or
not, perhaps I might ride."But are you not afraid to go on alone?"Dennis is a bad place for a lady to be out alone at night,
and you must pass a grave-yard in the south part of the town; dare you
go by it, in the dark?"I assured him that I had no fear whatever, that
would prevent me from going past the grave-yard.I had never committed
a crime, never injured any one, and I did not think the departed would
come back to harm me.The lady said she would think of me with some
anxiety, for she should not dare to go past that grave-yard alone in the
dark.I again assured her that I had no cause to fear, had no crime on
my conscience, had been guilty of no neglect of duty, and if the living
would let me alone, I did not fear the dead.They thought I referred to
the low characters about town, and the lady replied, "I shall tell my
beads for you and the holy Virgin will protect you from all harm.But
remember," she continued, "whenever you pass this way, you will always
find a cordial welcome with us."I thanked her, and with a warm grasp of
the hand we parted.I
traveled all night, and late in the morning came to a respectable
looking farmhouse which I thought might be occupied by Protestants.I
always noticed that their houses were neater, and more comfortable than
those of the Romanists in the same condition in life.In the present
instance I was not disappointed in my expectations.The lady received me
kindly, gave me some breakfast, and directed me to the next village.I
walked all day, and near night arrived at St.Mary's, where I called at
a house, and asked permission to sit and rest awhile.They gave me an
invitation to enter, but did not offer refreshments.I did not like
to ask for charity if I could avoid it, and I thought it possible they
might ask me to stay over night.But they did not, and after a half
hour's rest I rose to depart, and thanking them for their kindness
inquired how far it was to the next house.They said it was seven miles
to the first house, and nine to the next village.With a sad heart, I once more pursued my lonely way.Soon it began to
rain, and the night came on, dark and dismal, cold and stormy, with
a high wind that drove the rain against my face with pitiless fury.I entered a thick wood where no ray of light could penetrate, and at
almost every step, I sank over shoes in the mud.Thus I wandered on,
reflecting bitterly on my wretched fate.All the superstitious fears,
which a convent life is so well calculated to produce, again assailed
me, and I was frightened at my own wild imaginings.I thought of the
nuns who had been murdered so cruelly, and I listened to the voice of
the storm, as to the despairing wail of a lost soul.The wind swept
fiercely through the leafless branches, now roaring like a tornado,
again rising to a shrill shriek, or a prolonged whistle, then sinking to
a hollow murmer, and dying away in a low sob which sounded to my excited
fancy like the last convulsive sigh of a breaking heart.Once and again
I paused, faint and dizzy with hunger and fatigue, feeling as though
I could go no further.And go on I did, though, as I now look back upon that night's
experience, I wonder how I managed to do so.But a kind providence,
undoubtedly, watched over me, and good angels guided me on my way.Some
time in the night, I think it must have been past twelve o'clock, I
became so very weary I felt that I must rest awhile at all events.It
was so dark I could not see a step before me, but I groped my way to a
fence, seated myself on a stone with my head resting against the rails,
and in that position I fell asleep.How long I slept, I do not know.When I awoke, my clothes were drenched with rain, and I was so stiff and
lame, I could hardly move.But go I must, so I resolved to make the
best of it, and hobble along as well as I could.At last I reached the
village, but it was not yet morning, and I dared not stop.I kept on
till daylight, and as soon as I thought people were up, I went up to
a house and rapped.A woman came to the door, and I asked if she would
allow me to go in, and dry my clothes, and I would have added, get some
breakfast, but her looks restrained me.They were getting breakfast, but
did not invite me to partake of it, and I dared not ask for anything to
eat.When my clothes were dry, I thanked them for the use of their fire,
and inquired how far it was to the next village.They said the next town
was Highgate, but they did not know the distance.My tears flowed freely when I again found myself in the street, cold,
hungry, almost sick, and entirely friendless.One thought alone gave courage to my desponding
heart, buoyed up my sinking spirits, and restored strength to my weary
limbs.I was striving for liberty, that priceless boon, so dear to every
human heart.Nerved to renewed effort by thoughts like these, I toiled onward.All
that day I walked without a particle of nourishment.When I reached
Highgate, it was eleven o'clock at night, but in one house I saw a
light, and I ventured to rap at the door.It was opened by a pale, but
pleasant looking woman."Kind lady," said I, "will you please tell me
how far it is to the States?"she exclaimed, and in a
moment she seemed to understand both my character and situation."You
are now in Vermont State," said she, "but come in child, you look sad
and weary."I at once accepted her offer, and when she asked how far I
was traveling, and how I came to be out so late, I did not hesitate
to reveal to her my secret, for I was sure she could be trusted.She invited me to spend the remainder of the night, and gave me some
refreshment.She was nursing a sick woman, which accounted for her being
up so late, but did not prevent her from attending to all my wants, and
making me as comfortable as possible.When she saw that my feet were
wounded, badly swollen, and covered with blood and dirt, she procured
warm water, and with her own hands bathed, and made them clean, with the
best toilet soap.She expressed great sympathy for the sad condition my
feet were in, and asked if I had no shoes?I told her that my shoes were
made of cloth, and soon wore out; that what was left of them, I lost in
the mud, when traveling through the woods in the dark.She then procured
a pair of nice woollen stockings, and a pair of new shoes, some under
clothes, and a good flannel skirt, which she begged me to wear for her
sake.I accepted them gratefully, but the shoes I could not wear, my
feet were so sore.She said I could take them with me, and she gave me
a pair of Indian moccasins to wear till my feet were healed.Angel of
mercy that she was; may God's blessing rest upon her for her kindness to
the friendless wanderer.The next morning the good lady urged me to stay with her, at least, for
a time, and said I should be welcome to a home there for the rest of my
life.Grateful as I was for her offer, I was forced to decline it, for
I knew that I could not remain so near Montreal in safety.She said the
"select men" of the town would protect me, if they were made acquainted
with my peculiar situation.she little knew the character
of a Romish priest!Her guileless heart did not suspect the cunning
artifice by which they accomplish whatever they undertake.And those
worthy "select men," I imagine, were not much better informed than
herself.Sure I am, that any protection they could offer me, would
not, in the least degree, shield me from the secret intrigue, the
affectionate, maternal embrace of holy Mother Church.When she found that, notwithstanding all her offers, I was resolved to
go, she put into a basket, a change of clothing, the shoes she had given
me, and a good supply of food which she gave me for future use.But the
most acceptable part of her present was a sun-bonnet; for thus far I had
nothing on my head but the cap I wore in the convent.She gave me some
money, and bade me go to Swanton, and there, she said, I could take the
cars.I accordingly bade her farewell, and, basket in hand, directed my
steps toward the depot some seven miles distant, as I was informed; but
I thought it a long seven miles, as I passed over it with my sore feet,
the blood starting at every step.On my arrival at the depot, a man came to me, and asked where I wished
to go.I told him I wished to go as far into the State as my money would
carry me.He procured me a ticket, and said it would take me to St.He asked me where I came from, but I begged to be excused from
answering questions.He then conducted me to the ladies room, and left
me, saying the cars would be along in about an hour.In this room, several ladies were waiting to take the cars.As I walked
across the room, one of them said, in a tone that grated harshly on my
feelings, "Your skirt is below your dress."I did not feel very good
natured, and instead of saying "thank you," as I should have done, I
replied in the most impudent manner, "Well, it is clean, if it is in
sight."The lady said no more, and I sat down upon a sofa and fell
asleep.As I awoke, one of the ladies said, "I wonder who that poor girl
is!"I was bewildered, and, for the moment, could not think where I was,
but I thought I must make some reply, and rousing myself I turned to
her, and said, "I am a nun, if you wish to know, and I have just escaped
from a convent."She gave me a searching look, and said, "Well, I must
confess you do look like one.I often visit in Montreal where I see a
great many of them, and they always look poor and pale.Will you allow
me to ask you a few questions?"By this time, I was wide awake,
and realized perfectly where I was, and the folly of making such an
imprudent disclosure.I would have given much to recall those few words,
for I had a kind of presentiment that they would bring me trouble.I
begged to be excused from answering any questions, as I was almost crazy
with thinking of the past and did not wish to speak of it.The lady said no more for some time, but she kept her eye upon me, in
a way that I did not like; and I began to consider whether I had better
wait for the cars, or start on foot.I was sorry for my imprudence, but
it could not be helped now, and I must do the best I could to avoid the
unpleasant consequences which might result from it.I had just made up
my mind to go on, when I heard in the far distance, the shrill whistle
of the approaching train; that train which I fondly hoped would bear me
far away from danger, and onward to the goal of my desires.At this moment, the lady crossed the room, and seating herself by my
side, asked, "Would you not like to go and live with me?I have one
waiting maid now, but I wish for another, and if you will go, I will
take you and give you good wages.Your work will not be hard; will you
go?""Then I
shall not go with you," said I."No money could induce me to return
there again."said she, with a peculiar smile, "I see how it is,
but you need not fear to trust me.I will protect you, and never
suffer you to be taken back to the convent."I saw that I had made
unconsciously another imprudent revelation, and resolved to say no more.I was about to leave her, but she drew me back saying, "I will give you
some of my clothes, and I can make them fit you so well that no one will
ever recognize you.I shall have plenty of time to alter them if they
require it, for the train that I go in, will not be along for about
three hours; you can help me, and in that time we will get you nicely
fixed."I could hardly repress a smile when I saw how earnest she was, and I
thought it a great pity that a plan so nicely laid out should be so
suddenly deranged, but I could not listen to her flatteries.I suspected
that she was herself in the employ of the priests, and merely wished to
get me back that she might betray me.She had the appearance of being
very wealthy, was richly clad, wore a gold watch, chain, bracelets,
breastpin, ear rings, and many finger rings, all of the finest gold.But
with all her wealth and kind offers, I dare not trust her.I thought she
looked annoyed when I refused to go with her, but when I rose to go
to the cars, a look of angry impatience stole over, her fine features,
which convinced me that I had escaped a snare.The cars came at length, and I was soon on my way to St.I was
very sick, and asked a gentleman near me to raise the windows.He did
so, and inquired how far I was going.I informed him, when he remarked
that he was somewhat acquainted in St.Albans, and asked with whom I
designed to stop.I told him I had no friends or acquaintance in the
place, but I hoped to get employment in some protestant family.He said
he could direct me to some gentlemen who would, he thought, assist me.One in particular, he mentioned as being a very wealthy man, and kept a
number of servants; perhaps he would employ me.This gentleman's name was Branard, and my informant spoke so highly of
the family, I immediately sought them out on leaving the cars, and was
at once employed by Mrs.Here I found a quiet,
happy home.Branard was a kind sympathizing woman, and to her, I
confided the history of my convent life.She would not allow me to work
hard, for she saw that my nerves were easily excited.She made me sit
with her in her own room a great part of the time, and did not wish me
to go out alone.They had several boarders in the family, and one
of them was a brother-in-law [Footnote: This gentleman was Mr.Z. K.
Pangborn, late editor of the Worcester Daily Transcript.Pangborn give their testimony of the truth of this statement.]His name I have forgotten; it was not a common name, but
he married Mrs.Branard's sister, and with his wife resided there all
the time that I was with them.Branard was away from home most of
the time, so that I saw but little of him.They had an Irish girl in the
kitchen, named Betsy.She was a kind, pleasant girl, and she thought me
a strict Romanist because I said my prayers so often, and wore the Holy
Scapulary round my neck.This Scapulary is a band with a cross on one
side, and on the other, the letters "J. H.which signify, "Jesus The
Savior of Man."At this place I professed great regard for the Church of Rome, and no
one but Mrs.Branard was acquainted with my real character and history.When they asked my name, I told them they could call me Margaret, but it
was an assumed name.My own, for reasons known only by myself, I did
not choose to reveal.I supposed, of course, they would regard me with
suspicion for a while, but I saw nothing of the kind.They treated me
with great respect, and no questions were ever asked.Perhaps I did
wrong in changing my name, but I felt that I was justified in using any
means to preserve my liberty.Four happy weeks I enjoyed unalloyed satisfaction in the bosom of this
charming family.It was a new thing for me to feel at home, contented,
and undisturbed; to have every one around me treat me with kindness and
even affection.I sometimes feared it was too good to last.Branard
in particular, I shall ever remember with grateful and affectionate
regard.She was more like a mother to me, than a mistress, and I shall
ever look back to the time I spent with her, as a bright spot in the
otherwise barren desert of my life.Better, far better would it have
been for me had I never left her.But I became alarmed, and thought the
convent people were after me.It was no idle whim, no imaginary terror.I had good cause to fear, for I had several times seen a priest go
past, and gaze attentively at the house.I knew him at the first glance,
having often seen him in Montreal.Then my heart told me that they had traced me to this place, and
were now watching a chance to get hold of me.Imagine, if you can, my
feelings.Would they be allowed to take
me back to those fearful cells, where no ray of mercy could ever reach
me?Frightened, and almost beside
myself, I resolved to make an effort to find a more secure place.I
therefore left those kind friends in the darkness of night, without one
word of farewell, and without their knowledge.I knew they would not
allow me to go, if they were apprised of my design.In all probability,
they would have ridiculed my fears, and bade me rest in peace.How could
I expect them to comprehend my danger, when they knew so little of the
machination of my foes?I intended to go further into the state, but
did not wish to have any one know which way I had gone.It was a sad
mistake, but how often in this world do we plunge into danger when we
seek to avoid it!How often fancy ourselves in security when we stand
upon the very brink of ruin!Branard's in the evening, and called upon a family in the
neighborhood whose acquaintance I had made, and whom I wished to see
once more, though I dared not say farewell.I left them between the
hours of nine and ten, and set forward on my perilous journey.I had
gone but a short distance when I heard the sound of wheels and the heavy
tread of horses' feet behind me.My heart beat with such violence it
almost stopped my breath, for I felt that they were after me.But there
was no escape--no forest or shelter near where I could seek protection.On came the furious beasts, driven by no gentle hand.They came up with
me, and I almost began to hope that my fears were groundless, when the
horses suddenly stopped, a strong hand grasped me, a gag was thrust into
my mouth, and again the well-known box was taken from the wagon.Another
moment and I was securely caged, and on my way back to Montreal.Two men
were in the wagon and two rode on horseback beside it.Bly, where they stopped to change horses, and the two
men on horseback remained there, while the other two mounted the wagon
and drove to Sorel.Here the box was taken out and carried on board a
boat, where two priests were waiting for me.When the boat started, they
took me out for the first time after I was put into it at St.Three days we had been on the way, and I had tasted neither food nor
drink.How little did I think when I took my tea at Mr.Branard's the
night I left that it was the last refreshment I would have for SEVEN
DAYS; yet such was the fact.And how little did they think, as they lay
in their quiet beds that night, that the poor fugitive they had taken to
their home was fleeing for life, or for that which, to her, was better
than life.Bitterly did I reproach myself for leaving
those kind friends as I did, for I thought perhaps if I had remained
there, they would not have dared to touch me.Such were my feelings
then; but as I now look back, I can see that it would have made little
difference whether I left or remained.They were bound to get me, at all
events, and if I had stopped there until they despaired of catching me
secretly, they would undoubtedly have come with an officer, and accused
me of some crime, as a pretext for taking me away.Then, had any one
been so far interested for me as to insist on my having a fair trial,
how easy for them to produce witnesses enough to condemn me!Those
priests have many ways to accomplish their designs.The American people
don't know them yet; God grant they never may.On my arrival at the nunnery I was taken down the coal grate, and
fastened to an iron ring in the back part of a cell.The Archbishop then
came down and read my punishment.Notwithstanding the bitter grief that
oppressed my spirit, I could not repress a smile of contempt as the
great man entered my cell.I remembered that before I ran away, my
punishments were assigned by a priest, but the first time I fled from
them a Bishop condescended to read my sentence, and now his honor the
Archbishop graciously deigned to illume my dismal cell with the light of
his countenance, and his own august lips pronounced the words of doom.Was I rising in their esteem, or did they think to frighten me into
obedience by the grandeur of his majestic mien?Such were my thoughts as this illustrious personage proceeded slowly,
and with suitable dignity, to unroll the document that would decide my
fate.It might be for aught I knew, or cared
to know.I had by this time become perfectly reckless, and the whole
proceeding seemed so ridiculous, I found it exceedingly difficult to
maintain a demeanor sufficiently solemn for the occasion.But when
the fixed decree came forth, when the sentence fell upon my ear that
condemned me to SEVEN DAYS' STARVATION, it sobered me at once.Yet even
then the feeling of indignation was so strong within me, I could not
hold my peace.I would speak to that man, if he killed me for it.Looking him full in the face (which, by the way, I knew was considered
by him a great crime), I asked, "Do you ever expect to die?"I did not,
of course, expect an answer, but he replied, with a smile, "Yes; but
you will die first."He then asked how long I had fasted, and I replied,
"Three days."He said, "You will fast four days more, and you will be
punished every day until next December, when you will take the black
veil."As he was leaving the room, he remarked, "We do not usually have
the nuns take the black veil until they are twenty-one; but you have
such good luck in getting away, we mean to put you where you can't do
it."And with this consoling thought he left me--left me in darkness and
despair, to combat, as best I could, the horrors of starvation.This
was in the early part of winter, and only about a year would transpire
before I entered that retreat from which none ever returned.And then to
be punished every day for a year!The priest came every
morning, with his dark lantern, to look at me; but he never spoke.On
the second day after my return, I told him if he would bring me a little
piece of bread, I would never attempt to run away again, but would serve
him faithfully the rest of my life.Had he given it to me, I would have
faithfully kept my word; but he did not notice me, and closing the door,
he left me once more to pass through all the agonies of starvation.Whether I remained in the cell the
other two days, or was taken out before the time expired, I do not know.This much, however, I do know, as a general rule a nun's punishment is
never remitted.If she lives, it is well; if she dies, no matter; there
are enough more, and no one will ever call them to an account for the
murder.But methinks I hear the reader ask, "Did they not fear the judgment of
God and a future retribution?"In reply I can only state what I believe
to be the fact.It is my firm belief that not more than one priest in
ten thousand really believes in the truth of Christianity, or even in
the existence of a God.They are all Infidels or Atheists; and how can
they be otherwise?It is the legitimate fruit of that system of deceit
which they call religion.Of course I only give this as my opinion,
founded on what I have seen and heard.You can take it, reader, for what
it is worth; believe it or not, just us you please; but I assure you I
have often heard the nuns say that they did not believe in any religion.The professions of holiness of heart and parity of life so often made
by the priests they KNOW to be nothing but a hypocritical pretence, and
their ceremonies they regard as a ridiculous farce.For some time after I was taken from the cell I lay in a state of
partial unconsciousness, but how long, I do not know.I have no
recollection of being taken up stairs, but I found myself on my bed, in
my old room, and on the stand beside me were several cups, vials, etc.The Abbess who sat beside me, occasionally gave me a tea-spoonful
of wine or brandy, and tried to make me eat.Ere long, my appetite
returned, but it was several weeks before my stomach was strong enough
to enable me to satisfy in any degree, the cravings of hunger.When I
could eat, I gained very fast, and the Abbess left me in the care of
a nun, who came in occasionally to see if I wanted anything.This nun
often stopped to talk with me, when she thought no one was near, and
expressed great curiosity to know what I saw in the world; if people
were kind to me, and if I did not mean to get away again, if possible, I
told her I should not; but she replied, "I don't believe that.You will
try again, and you will succeed yet, if you keep up good courage.You
are so good to work, they do not wish to part with you, and that is one
reason why they try so hard to get you back again.But never mind,
they won't get you next time."I assured her I should not try to escape
again, for they were sure to catch me, and as they had almost killed me
this time, they would quite the next.I did not dare to trust her, for I
supposed the Superior had given her orders to question me.I was still weak, so weak that I could hardly walk when they obliged me
to go into the kitchen to clean vegetables and do other light work, and
as soon as I had sufficient strength, to milk the cows, and take the
care of the milk.They punished me every day, in accordance with the
Bishop's order, and sometimes, I thought, more than he intended.I wore
thorns on my head, and peas in my shoes, was whipped and pinched, burnt
with hot irons, and made to crawl through the underground passage I
have before described.In short, I was tortured and punished in every
possible way, until I was weary of my life.Still they were careful not
to go so far as to disable me from work.They did not care how much I
suffered, if I only performed my daily task.There was an underground passage leading from the nunnery to a place
which they called, "Providence," in the south part of the city.I do not
know whether it is a school, or a convent, or what it is, but I think it
must be some distance, from what I heard said about it.The priest often
spoke of sending me there, but for some reason, he did not make me
go.Still the frequent reference to what I so much dreaded, kept me
in constant apprehension and alarm.I have heard the priest say that
underground passages extended from the convent in every direction, for
a distance of five miles; and I have reason to believe the statement is
true.But these reasons I may not attempt to give.There are things that
may not even be alluded to, and if it were possible to speak of them,
who would believe the story?As summer approached, I expected to be sent to the farm again, but for
some reason I was still employed in the kitchen.Yet I could not keep
my mind upon my work.The one great object of my life; the subject that
continually pressed upon my mind was the momentous question, how shall
I escape?To some it
would bring a joyous festival, but to me, the black veil and a life long
imprisonment.Once within those dreary walls, and I might as well hope
to escape from the grave.Such are the arrangements, there is no chance
for a nun to escape unless she is promoted to the office of Abbess or
Superior.Of course, but few of them can hope for this, especially,
if they are not contented; and certainly, in my case there was not the
least reason to expect anything of the kind.Knowing these facts, with
the horrors of the Secret Cloister ever before me, I felt some days as
though on the verge of madness.Before the nuns take the black veil, and
enter this tomb for the living, they are put into a room by themselves,
called the forbidden closet, where they spend six months in studying the
Black Book.Perchance, the reader will remember that when I first
came to this nunnery, I was taken by the door-tender to this forbidden
closet, and permitted to look in upon the wretched inmates.From that
time I always had the greatest horror of that room.I was never allowed
to enter it, and in fact never wished to do so, but I have heard the
most agonizing groans from those within, and sometimes I have heard them
laugh.Not a natural, hearty laugh, however, such as we hear from the
gay and happy, but a strange, terrible, sound which I cannot describe,
and which sent a thrill of terror through my frame, and seemed to chill
the very blood in my veins.I have heard the priests say, when conversing with each other, while I
was tidying their room, that many of these nuns lose their reason while
studying the Black Book.I can well believe this, for never in my
life did I ever witness an expression of such unspeakable, unmitigated
anguish, such helpless and utter despair as I saw upon the faces of
those nuns.Kept under lock and key, their
windows barred, and no air admitted to the room except what comes
through the iron grate of their windows from other apartments; compelled
to study, I know not what; with no hope of the least mitigation of their
sufferings, or relaxation of the stringent rules that bind them; no
prospect before them but a life-long imprisonment; what have they to
hope for?Surely, death and the grave are the only things to which they
can look forward with the least degree of satisfaction.Those nuns selected for this Secret Cloister are generally the fairest,
the most beautiful of the whole number.I used to see them in the
chapel, and some of them were very handsome.They dressed like the other
nuns, and always looked sad and broken hearted, but were not pale
and thin like the rest of us.I am sure they were not kept upon short
allowance as the others were, and starvation was not one of their
punishments, whatever else they might endure.The plain looking girls
were always selected to work in the kitchen, and do the drudgery about
the house.How often have I thanked God for my plain face!But for that,
I might not have been kept in the kitchen so long, and thus found means
to escape which I certainly could not have found elsewhere.With all my watching, and planning I did not find an opportunity to get
away till June.I then, succeeded in getting outside the convent yard
one evening between eight and nine o'clock.How I got there, is a secret
I shall never reveal.A few yards from the gate I was stopped by one of
the guard at the Barrack, who asked where I was going."To visit a sick
woman," I promptly replied, and he let me pass.Soon after this, before
my heart ceased to flutter, I thought I heard some one running after
me.I would never be caught and carried
back alive.My fate was at last, I thought, in my own hands.Better die
at once than to be chained like a guilty criminal, and suffer as I had
done before.Blame me not gentle reader, when I tell you that I stood
upon the bank of the river with exultant joy; and, as I pursued my
way along the tow-path, ready to spring into the water on the first
indication of danger, I rejoiced over the disappointment of my pursuers
in losing a servant who had done them so good service.At a little
distance I saw a ferry boat, but when I asked the captain to carry me
over the river, he refused.He was, probably, afraid of the police and
a fine, for no one can assist a run-away nun with impunity, if caught in
the act.He directed me, however, to the owner of the boat, who said I
could go if the captain was willing to carry me.I knew very well that
he would not, and I took my place in the boat as though I had a perfect
right to it.We were almost across the river, when the captain saw me, and gave
orders to turn back the boat, and leave me on the shore from whence we
started.From his appearance I thought we were pursued, and I was not
mistaken.Five priests were following us in another boat, and they too,
turned back, and reached the shore almost as soon as we did.I left the
boat and ran for my life.I was now sure that I was pursued; there could
be no doubt of that, for the sound of footsteps behind me came distinct
to my ear.At a little distance stood a small, white house.The thought gave me courage,
and I renewed my efforts.Nearer came the footsteps, but I reached the
house, and without knocking, or asking permission, I sprang through the
door.The people were in bed, in another room, but a man looked out, and
asked what I wanted."I've run away from the Grey
Nunnery, and they're after me.Hide me, O hide me, and God will bless
you!"As I spoke he put out his hand and opened the cellar door."Here,"
said he, "run down cellar, I'll be with you in a moment."I obeyed, and
he struck a light and followed.Pointing to a place where he kept ashes,
he said hastily, "Crawl in there."There was not a moment to lose, for
before he had covered up my hiding place, a loud knock was heard upon
the front door.Having extinguished his light, he ran up stairs, and
opened the door with the appearance of having just left his bed.he asked, "and what do you want this time of night?"One of
them replied, "We are in search of a nun, and are very sure she came in
here?""Well gentlemen," said he, "walk in, and see for yourselves.If she is here, you are at liberty to find her."Lighting a candle, he
proceeded to guide them over the house, which they searched until they
were satisfied.They then came down cellar, and I gave up all hope of
escape.Still, I resolved never to be taken alive.I could strangle
myself, and I would do it, rather than suffer as I did before.At that
moment I could truly say with the inspired penman, with whose language
I have since become familiar, "my soul chooseth strangling and death
rather than life."They looked all around me, and even into the place where I lay
concealed, but they did not find me.At length I heard them depart,
and so great was my joy, I could hardly restrain my feelings within the
bounds of decorum.I felt as though I must dance and sing, shout
aloud or leap for joy at my great deliverance.I am sure I should have
committed some extravagant act had not the gentleman at that moment
called me up, and told me that my danger was by no means past.This
information so dashed my cup of bliss that I was able to drink it
quietly.He gave me some refreshment, and as soon as safety would permit, saddled
his horse, and taking me on behind him, carried me six miles to another
boat, put me on board, and paid the captain three dollars to carry me
to Laprairie.On leaving me, he gave me twenty-five cents, and said,
"you'll be caught if you go with the other passengers."The captain said
he could hide me and no one know that I was on board, but himself.He
led me to the end of the boat, and put me upon a board over the horses.He fixed a strong cord for me to hold on by, and said, "you must be
careful and not fall down, for the horses would certainly kill you
before you could be taken out."The captain was very kind to me and when
I left him, gave me twenty-five cents, and some good advice.He said
I must hurry along as fast as possible, for it was Jubilee, and the
priests would all be in church at four o'clock.He also advised me not
to stop in any place where a Romish priest resided, "for," said he,
"the convent people have, undoubtedly, telegraphed all over the country
giving a minute description of your person, and the priests will all be
looking for you."Two days I travelled as fast as my strength would allow, when I came
to Sorel, which was on the other side of the river.Here I saw several
priests on the road coming directly towards me.That they were after me,
I had not a doubt.To escape by running, was out
of the question, but just at that moment my eye fell upon a boat near
the shore.I ran to the captain, and asked him to take me across the
river.He consented, and, as I expected, the priests took another boat
and followed us.Once more I gave myself up for lost, and prepared
to spring into the water, if they were likely to overtake me.The man
understood my feelings, and exerted all his strength to urge forward
the boat.At last it reached the shore, and as he helped me out he
whispered, "Now run."I did run, but though my own liberty was at
stake I could not help thinking about the consequences to that man if
I escaped, for I knew they would make him pay a heavy fine for his
benevolent act.A large house stood in my way, and throwing open the
door I exclaimed, "Are there any protestants here?""O, yes," replied
a man who sat there, "come with me."He led me to the kitchen, where a
large company of Irish men were rolling little balls on a table.I saw
the men were Irish and my first thought was, "I am betrayed."But my fears were soon relieved, for the man exclaimed, "Here is a
nun, inquiring for protestants.""Well," replied one who seemed to be
a leader, "this is the right place to find them.And then they all began to shout, "Down with the Catholics!I was frightened at their
violence, but their leader came to me, and with the kindness of a
brother, said, "Do not fear us.If you are a run-away, we will protect
you."He bade the men be still and asked if any one was after me.I told
him about the priests, and he replied, "you have come to the right place
for protection, for they dare not show themselves here.I am the leader
of a band of Anti-Catholics, and this is their lodge.You have heard of
us, I presume; we are called Orange men.Our object is, to overthrow the
Roman Catholic religion, and we are bound by the most fearful oaths to
stand by each other, and protect all who seek our aid.The priests dread
our influence, for we have many members, and I hope ere long, the power
of the Pope in this country will be at an end.I am sure people must see
what a cruel, hypocritical set they are."Before he had done speaking, a man came to the door and said, "The
carriage is ready."Another of the men, on hearing this, said, "Come
with me, and I'll take you out of the reach of the priests."He
conducted me to a carriage, which was covered and the curtains all
fastened down.He helped me into it, directing me to sit upon the back
seat, where I could not be seen by any one unless they took particular
pains.Oars that night, and, if I remember right,
he said the distance was twelve miles.When, he left me he gave me
twenty-five cents.I travelled all night, and about midnight passed
through St.Dennis, But I did not stop until the next morning, when I
called at a house and asked for something to eat.The lady gave me some
bread and milk, and I again pursued my way.Once more I had the good fortune to obtain a passage across the river in
a ferry-boat, and was soon pressing onward upon the other side.John's, I followed the
railroad to a village which I was informed was called Stotsville,
[Footnote: I beg leave once more to remind the reader that it is by
no means certain that I give these names correctly.Hearing them
pronounced, with no idea of ever referring to them again, it is not
strange that mistakes of this kind should occur.]a great part of the
property being owned by a Mr.Stots, to whom I was at once directed.Here I stopped, and was kindly received by the gentleman and his wife.They offered me refreshments, gave me some articles of clothing, and
then he carried me twelve miles, and left me at Rouse's Point, to take
the cars for Albany.He gave me six dollars to pay my expenses, and a
letter of introduction to a gentleman by the name of Williams, in which
he stated all the facts he knew concerning me, and commended me to his
care for protection.Williams lived on North
Pearl street, but I may be mistaken in this and also in some other
particulars.As I had no thought of relating these facts at the time of
their occurrence, I did not fix them in my mind as I otherwise should
have done.Stots said that if I could not find the gentleman to whom the letter
was directed, I was to take it to the city authorities, and they would
protect me.As he assisted me from the carriage he said, "You will stop
here until the cars come along, and you must get your own ticket.I
shall not notice you again, and I do not wish you to speak to me."I
entered the depot intending to follow his directions; but when I found
the cars would not come along for three hours, I did not dare to stay.There was quite a large collection of people there, and I feared that
some one would suspect and stop me.I therefore resolved to follow the
railroad, and walk on to the next station.On my way I passed over a
railroad bridge, which I should think was two miles long.The wind blew
very hard at the time, and I found it exceedingly difficult to walk
upon the narrow timbers.More than once I came near losing my precarious
footing, and I was in constant fear that the train would overtake me
before I got over.In that case I had resolved to step outside the track
where I thought I could stand upon the edge of the bridge and hold on
by the telegraph poles, and thus let them pass without doing me injury.Happily, however, I was not compelled to resort to this perilous
expedient, but passed the bridge in safety.At the end I found another
nearly as long, connected with it by a drawbridge.When I drew near it
was up for a boat to pass; but a man called to me, and asked if I
wish to go over.I told him I did, and he let down the bridge.As I
approached him he asked, "Are you mad?I told
him I had walked from the depot at Rouse's Point.He appeared greatly
surprised, and said, "You are the first person who ever walked over
that bridge.Will you come to my house and rest awhile?You must be very
weary, and my wife will be glad to see you.She is rather lonely
here, and is pleased to see any one.'Tis only a short
distance, just down under the bridge."I
thanked him, but firmly refused to go one step out of my way.I thought
that he wished to deceive me, perhaps take me to some out-of-the-way
place, and give me up to my pursuers.At all events, it was wise not to
trust him, for I was sure there was no house near the bridge, certainly
not under it.I have since learned that such is the fact.As I turned to
leave him, he again urged me to stop, and said, "The cars will soon be
along, and they will run over you.How do you expect to get out of their
way?"I told him I would risk it, and left him.I passed on in safety,
and soon came to the depot, where I took the evening train for Albany.At eight the same evening I left the cars, and walked on towards Troy,
which I think was four miles distant.Here I met a lad, of whom I
inquired the way to Albany."You cannot get there to-night," said he,
"and I advise you not to try."When he saw that I was determined to go
on, he said I would pass a tavern called the half-way house, and if I
was tired I could stop there.It was about eleven o'clock when I passed
this house, There were several persons on the piazza, laughing, talking,
and singing, who called me as I passed, shouted after me, and bade me
stop.Exceedingly frightened, I ran with all possible speed, but they
continued to call after me till I was out of hearing.Seeing a light
at a house near by, I ventured to rap on the door.It was opened by a
woman, who asked me to walk in.She
informed me, but said, "You can't go there to-night."I told her I must,
"Well," said she, "if you will go, the watch will take care of you when
you get there."She then asked, "Were those men calling after you?"I
told her I supposed they were, when she replied, with a peculiar smile,
"I guess you can't be a very nice kind of girl, or you wouldn't be on
the street this time of night."My feelings were so deeply wounded I
could hardly restrain my tears at this cruel insinuation; but pride came
to my aid, and, choking down the rising emotion, I replied as carelessly
as possible, "I must do as I can, and not as I would."It was about one o'clock at night when I entered the principal street in
Albany, and, as the lady predicted, a watchman came to me and asked why
I was out that time of night.He stood
beside a lamp-post and read it, when he seemed satisfied, and said, "I
know the man; come with me and I'll take you to his house."I followed
him a long way, till at last he stopped before a large house, and rang
the bell.Williams came to the door, and asked what was wanted.He read it, and invited me to stop.His
wife got up, received me very kindly, and gave me some supper, for
which I was truly grateful.Nor was I less thankful for the delicate
consideration with which they avoided any allusion to my convent life,
or my subsequent flight and suffering.Williams saw that I was sad
and weary, and as she conducted me to a comfortable bed, she remarked,
"You are safe at last, and I am glad of it.You can now retire without
the apprehension of danger, and sleep in perfect security.You are with
friends who will protect you as long as you choose to remain with us."Notwithstanding the good lady's assurance of safety, I found it
impossible to close my eyes.I was among strangers, in a strange place,
and, having been so often deceived, might I not be again?Perhaps, after
all their pretended kindness, they were plotting to betray me.A few
days, however, convinced me that I had at last found real friends, who
would protect me in the hour of danger to the utmost of their ability.I remained here some four weeks, and should have remained longer, but an
incident transpired that awakened all my fears, and again sent me forth
into the wide world, a fugitive, and a wanderer.I went to my chamber
one night, when I heard a sound like the full, heavy respiration of a
man in deep sleep.The sound appeared to come from under the bed, but
stopped as I entered the room.I was very much alarmed, but I controlled
my feelings, and instead of running shrieking from the room, I
deliberately closed the blinds, shut the windows, adjusted the curtain,
all the time carelessly humming a tune, and taking up my lamp I
slowly left the room.Once outside the door, I ran in all haste to Mr.Williams, and told him what I had heard.He laughed at me, said it was
all imagination, but, to quiet my fears, he went to my room resolved
to convince me that no one was there.I followed, and stood at the door
while he lifted the bed valance, when a large, tall man sprang forth,
and caught him with one hand while with the other he drew a pistol
from beneath his coat saying, "Let me go, and I'll depart in peace; but
attempt to detain me, and I'll blow your brains out."Williams came in great terror and consternation, to see what was
the matter.But she could render no assistance, and Mr.Williams, being
unarmed, was obliged to let him go.The watch were immediately called,
and they sought for the intruder in every direction.No effort was
spared to find him, that we might, at least, learn the object of
this untimely visit.No trace of his
whereabouts could be discovered.Williams said he did not believe it was me he sought.He thought the
object was robbery, and perhaps arson and murder, but he would not
think that I was in the least danger."The man," he said, "in hastily
concealing himself had taken the first hiding place he could find."Indeed, so sure was I that he was an agent of the
priests, sent forth for the express purpose of arresting me, no earthly
consideration would have induced me to remain there another day.The
rest of that night I spent in a state of anxiety I cannot describe.I dared not even undress and go to bed, but I
sat in my chair, or walked the room every moment expecting the return
of the mysterious visitor.I shuddered at every sound, whether real or
imaginary.Once in particular, I remember, the distant roll of carriage
wheels fell upon my ear.I listened; it came near, and still nearer,
till at last it stopped, as I thought, at the gate.For a moment I stood
literally stupified with terror, and then I hastily prepared to use the
means for self destruction I had already provided in anticipation of
such an emergency.I was still resolved never to be taken alive."Give
me liberty or give me death," was now the language of my soul.If I
could not enjoy the one, I would cordially embrace the other.But it was
a sad alternative after all I had suffered that I might be free, after
all my buoyant hopes, all my ardent aspirations for a better life.O, it
was a bitter thing, thus to stand in the darkness of night, and with my
own hand carefully adjust the cord that was to cut me off from the land
of the living, and in a moment launch my trembling soul into the vast,
unknown, untried, and fearful future, that men call eternity!Was this
to be the only use I was to make of liberty?Was it for this I had so
long struggled, toiled, wept and prayed?"God of mercy," I cried, "save,
O save me from this last great sin!From the sad and dire necessity
which thus urges me to cut short a life which thou alone canst give!"My prayer was heard; but how slowly passed the hours of that weary night
while I waited for the day that I might "hasten my escape from the windy
storm and tempest."Truly, at that time I could say with one of old,
"Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed
me.My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are
fallen upon me.Oh that I had the wings of a dove, for then would I flee
away, and be at rest."I had not the wings of a dove, and whither should I flee from
the furious grasp of my relentless persecutors?Again I must go forth
into the "busy haunts of men," I must mingle with the multitude, and
what chance had I for ultimate escape?If I left these kind friends, and
leave them I must, who would take me in?Who
would have the power to rescue me in my hour of need?In God alone could
I trust, yet why is he so far from helping me?And why does he thus allow the wicked to triumph; to
lay snares for the feet of the innocent, and wrongfully persecute those
whom their wanton cruelty hath caused to sit in darkness and in the
shadow of death?Why does he not at once "break the bands of iron, and
let the oppressed go free?"Williams in the
morning, I told him I could no longer remain with him, for I was sure
if I did, I should be suddenly arrested in some unguarded moment, and
carried back to Montreal.He urged me to stay, assured me he would never
allow them to take me, said that he thought some of going south, and I
could go with him, and thus be removed far from all whom I feared.Williams, also, strove to persuade me to stay.But, though sorry to
appear ungrateful, I dared not remain another night where I felt that my
danger was so great.When they found that I was determined to go, Mr.Williams said I
had better go to Worcester, Mass., and try to get employment in some
farmer's family, a little out of the city.He gave me money to bear my
expenses, until I found a place where I could earn my living.It was
with a sad heart that I left this hospitable roof, and as I turned away
I said in my heart, "Shall I always be hunted through the world in this
manner, obliged to flee like a guilty thing, and shall I never find
a home of happiness and peace?Must sorrow and despair forever be the
portion of my cup?"But no words of mine can describe what I felt at
that moment.I longed for the power to sound a warning through the
length and breadth of the land, to cry in the ears of all the people,
"Beware of Romanism!"Like the patient man of Uz, with whose history
I have since become familiar, I was ready to exclaim, "O that my words
were now written!Graven with an
iron pen," that the whole world might know what a fearful and bitter
thing it is to be a nun!To be subject to the control of those ruthless
tyrants, the Romish Priests.Once more I entered the depot, and mingled with the crowd around the
ticket office.But no pen can describe my terror when I found myself the
object of particular attention.I heard people remark about my strange
and unnatural appearance, and I feared I might be taken up for a crazy
person, if not for a nun.Thinking that I saw an enemy in every face,
and a pursuer in every one who came near me, I hastened to take refuge
in the cars.There I waited with the greatest impatience for the
starting of the train.Slowly the cars were filled; very leisurely the
passengers sought their seats, while I sat trembling in every limb, and
the cold perspiration starting from every pore.how eagerly I watched for some indication of the priest or
the spy!So intense was my anxiety, those few moments seemed to me an
age of agony.At length the shrill whistle announced that all was ready,
and like sweetest music the sound fell upon my ears.The train dashed
off at lightning speed, but to me it seemed like the movement of a
snail.Once under way, I ventured to breathe freely, and hope again revived.But even as the thought passed my mind, a
man entered the cars and seated himself directly, before me.I thought
he regarded me with too much interest, and thinking to shun him, I
quietly left my seat and retired to the other end of the car.He soon
followed, and again my fears revived.He at first tried to converse with
me, but finding I would not reply, he began to question me in the most
direct and impertinent manner.Again I changed my seat, and again he
followed.I then sought the conductor, and revealed to him enough of my
history to enlist his sympathy and ensure his protection.To his honor
be it spoken, I did not appeal to him in vain.He severely reproved the
man for his impertinence; and for the rest of the journey I was shielded
from insult or injury.Nothing further of interest transpired until I reached Worcester, when
the first face that met my eye as I was about to leave the cars was that
of a Romish priest.I could not be mistaken, for I had often seen him
at Montreal.He might not have been looking for me, but he watched every
passenger as they left the cars in a way that convinced me he had some
special reason for doing it.As I, too, had special reasons for avoiding
him just at that time, I stepped back out of sight until the passengers
were all out of the cars and the priest had turned away.I then sprang
out upon the opposite side, and, turning my back upon the depot,
hastened away amid the wilderness of houses, not knowing whither I went.For a long time I wandered around, until at length, being faint and
weary, I began to look for some place where I could obtain refreshment.But when I found a restaurant I did not dare to enter.A number of
Irishmen were standing around who were in all probability Catholics.I
would not venture among them; but as I turned aside I remembered that
Mr.Williams had directed me to seek employment a little out of the
city.I then inquired the way to Main street, and having found it, I
turned to the north and walked on till I found myself out of the thickly
settled part of the city.Then I began to seek for employment, and after
several fruitless applications I chanced to call upon a man whose name
was Handy.He received me in the kindest manner, and when I asked for
work, he said his wife did not need to hire me, but I was welcome to
stop with them and work for my board until I found employment elsewhere.This offer I joyfully accepted; and, as I became acquainted in the
place, many kind hands were extended to aid me in my efforts to obtain
an honest living.In this neighborhood I still reside, truly thankful
for past deliverance, grateful for present mercies, and confidently
trusting God for the future.Here closes the history of Sarah J. Richardson, as related by herself.The remaining particulars have been obtained from her employers in
Worcester.She arrived in this city August, 1854, and, as she has already stated,
at once commenced seeking for employment.She called at many houses
before she found any one who wished for help; and her first question
at each place was, "Are you a Catholic?"If the answer was in the
affirmative, she passed on, but if the family were Protestants, she
inquired for some kind of employment.She did not care what it was; she
would cook, wash, sew, or do chamber-work--anything to earn her bread.Handy was the first person who took her in, and gave her a home.In his family she worked for her board a few weeks, going out to wash
occasionally as she had opportunity.She then went to Holden Mass., but
for some reason remained only one week, and again returned to Worcester.Ezra Goddard then took her into his own family, and found her
capable, industrious, and trustworthy.Had anything been wanting to
prove her truthfulness and sincerity, the deep gratitude of her fervent
"I thank you," when told that she had found a permanent home, would
have done it effectually.But though her whole appearance indicated
contentment and earnestness of purpose, though her various duties
were faithfully and zealously performed, yet the deep sadness of her
countenance, and the evident anxiety of her mind at first awakened a
suspicion of mental derangement.She seemed restless, suspicious,
and morbidly apprehensive of approaching danger.The appearance of a
stranger, or a sudden ringing of the bell, would cause her to start,
tremble, and exhibit the greatest perturbation of spirit.In fact, she
seemed so constantly on the qui vive, the lady of the house one day said
to her, "Sarah, what is the matter with you?"The
Roman Catholic priests," she replied.I ran away
from the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, and twice I have been caught, carried
back, and punished in the most cruel manner.O, if you knew what I have
suffered, you would not wonder that I live in constant fear lest they
again seek out my retreat; and I will die before I go back again."Further questioning drew from her the foregoing narrative, which she
repeated once and again to various persons, and at different times,
without the least alteration or contradiction.Goddard some weeks, when she was taken into the employ of Mr.This gentleman informs us that he found her a faithful, industrious,
honest servant, and he has not the least doubt of the truthfulness of
her statements respecting her former life in the Convent.A few weeks after this, she was married to Frederick S. Richardson
with whom she became acquainted soon after her arrival in the city of
Worcester.The marriage ceremony was performed by Charles Chaffin, Esq.,
of Holden, Mass.After their marriage, her husband hired a room in the
house occupied by Mr.After a
few weeks, however, they removed to a place called the Drury farm.It is
owned by the heirs, but left in the care of Mr.Richardson had often been advised
to allow her history to be placed before the public.But she always
replied, "For my life I would not do it.Not because I do not wish the
world to know it, for I would gladly proclaim it wherever a Romanist is
known, but it would be impossible for me to escape their hands should
I make myself so public.After
her marriage, however, her principal objection was removed.She thought
they would not wish to take her back into the nunnery, and her husband
would protect her from violence.She therefore related the story of her
life while in the convent, which, in accordance with her own request,
was written down from her lips as she related it.Lucy Ann Hood, wife of Edward P. Hood, and daughter of Ezra Goddard.It
is now given to the public without addition or alteration, and with
but a slight abridgment.A strange and startling story it certainly
is.Perhaps the reader will cast it aside at once as a worthless
fiction,--the idle vagary of an excited brain.Sandra moved to the garden.The compiler, of course,
cannot vouch for its truth, but would respectfully invite the attention
of the reader to the following testimonials presented by those who have
known the narrator.The first is from Edward P. Hood, with whom Mrs.Richardson resided when her narrative was written.(TESTIMONY OF EDWARD P.I hereby certify that I was personally
acquainted with Sarah J. Richards, now Sarah J. Richardson, at the time
she resided in Worcester, Mass.I first saw her at the house of Mr.Ezra
Goddard, where she came seeking employment.She appeared anxious to get
some kind of work, was willing to do anything to earn an honest living.She had the appearance of a person who had seen much suffering and
hardship.Goddard a short time, when she obtained
another place.She then left, but called very often; and during her stay
in Worcester, she worked there several times.So far as I was able to
judge of her character, I do not hesitate to say that she was a woman
of truth and honesty.I heard her relate the account of her life and
sufferings in the Grey Nunnery, and her final escape.I knew when the
story was written, and can testify to its being done according to her
own dictation.I have examined the manuscript, and can say that it a
written out truly and faithfully as related by the nun herself.Worcester, May 5, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EZRA GODDARD.)I first became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson in August 1854.She
came to my house to work for my wife.She was at my house a great many
times after that until March 1855, when she left Worcester.At one time
she was there four or five weeks in succession.She was industrious,
willing to do anything to get an honest living.She was kind in her
disposition, and honest in her dealings.I have no hesitation in saying
that I think her statements can be relied upon.(TESTIMONY OF LUCY GODDARD.)I am acquainted with the above named Sarah J. Richardson, and can fully
testify to the truth of the above statements as to her kindness and
industrious habits, honesty and truthfulness.(TESTIMONY OF JOSIAH GODDARD.)To whom it may concern: This is to testify that I am acquainted with
Sarah J. Richardson, formerly Sarah J. Richards.I became acquainted
with her in the fall of 1854.She worked at my father's at the time.I
heard her tell her story, and from what I saw of her while she was in
Worcester, I have no hesitation in saying that she was a woman of truth
and honesty.Worcester, March 1, 1856.(TESTIMONY OF EBEN JEWETT.)I became acquainted with Sarah J. Richardson last winter, at the house
of Mr.Ezra Goddard; saw her a number of times after that, at the place
where I boarded.She did some work for my wife, and I heard her speak
of being at the Grey Nunnery.I have no doubt of her being honest and truthful, and I believe
she is so considered by all who became acquainted with her.(TESTIMONY OF CHARLES CHAFFIN.)Worcester, ss.--Holden, Nov.This certifies that I this day united in marriage, Frederick S.
Richardson and Sarah J. Richards, both of Worcester.CHARLES CHAFFIN, Justice of the Peace.I, Sarah J. Richardson, wife of Frederick S. Richardson, of the city
of Worcester, County of Worcester, and Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
formerly Sarah J. Richards before marriage, do solemnly swear, declare
and say, that the foregoing pages contain a true and faithful history of
my life before my marriage to the said Frederick S. Richardson, and
that every statement made herein by me is true.In witness whereof, I do
hereunto set my hand and seal, this 13th day of March, A.D.SARAH J. RICHARDSON (X her mark.)Sworn to before me, the 13th day of March, AD.(TESTIMONY OF Z. K.When it was known that the Narrative of Sarah J. Richardson was about to
be published, Mr.Z. K. Pangborn, at that time editor of the Worcester
Daily Transcript, voluntarily offered the following testimony which we
copy from one of his editorials."We have no doubt that the nun here spoken of as one who escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, is the same person who spent some weeks in
our family in the fall of 1853, after her first escape from the Nunnery.She came in search of employment to our house in St.Albans, Vt.,
stating that she had traveled on foot from Montreal, and her appearance
indicated that she was poor, and had seen hardship.She obtained work
at sewing, her health not being sufficient for more arduous task.She
appeared to be suffering under some severe mental trial, and though
industrious and lady-like in her deportment, still appeared absent
minded, and occasionally singular in her manner.After awhile she
revealed the fact to the lady of the house, that she had escaped from
the Grey Nunnery at Montreal, but begged her not to inform any one
of the fact, as she feared, if it should be known, that she would be
retaken, and carried back.A few days after making this disclosure,
she suddenly disappeared.Having gone out one evening, and failing to
return, much inquiry was made, but no trace of her was obtained for some
months.called on us to
make inquiries in regard to this same person and gave us the following
account of her as given by herself.She states that on the evening when
she so mysteriously disappeared from our house, she called upon an Irish
family whose acquaintance she had formed, and when she was coming away,
was suddenly seized, gagged, and thrust into a close carriage, or box,
as she thought, and on the evening of the next day found herself once
more consigned to the tender mercies of the Grey Nunnery in Montreal.Her capture was effected by a priest who tracked her to St.Albans,
and watched his opportunity to seize her.She was subjected to the most
rigorous and cruel treatment, to punish her for running away, and kept
in close confinement till she feigned penitence and submission, when she
was treated less cruelly, and allowed more liberty."But the difficulties in the way of an escape, only stimulated her the
more to make the attempt, and she finally succeeded a second time in
getting out of that place which she described as a den of cruelty and
misery.She was successful also in eluding her pursuers, and in reaching
this city, (Worcester,) where she remained some time, seeking to avoid
notoriety, as she feared she might be again betrayed and captured.She
is now, however, in a position where she does not fear the priests, and
proposes to give to the world a history of her life in the Nunnery.The
disclosures she makes are of the most startling character, but of her
veracity and good character we have the most satisfactory evidence."Pangborn, a sister of the late Mrs
Branard, the lady with whom Sarah J. Richardson stopped in St.Albans,
and by whom she was employed as a seamstress.Being an inmate of the
family at the time, Mrs Pangborn states that she had every opportunity
to become acquainted with the girl and learn her true character.The
family, she says, were all interested in her, although they knew nothing
of her secret, until a few days before she left.She speaks of her as
being "quiet and thoughtful, diligent, faithful and anxious to please,
but manifesting an eager desire for learning, that she might be able to
acquaint herself more perfectly with the Holy Scriptures.She could,
at that time, read a little, and her mind was well stored with select
passages from the sacred volume, which she seemed to take great delight
in repeating.She was able to converse intelligently upon almost
any subject, and never seemed at a loss for language to express her
thoughts.No one could doubt that nature had given her a mind capable of
a high degree of religious and intellectual culture, and that, with
the opportunity for improvement, she would become a useful member of
society.Of book knowledge she was certainly quite ignorant, but she had
evidently studied human nature to some good purpose."Mrs Pangborn also
corroborates many of the statements in her narrative.She often visited
the Grey Nunnery, and says that the description given of the building,
the Academy, the Orphan's Home, and young ladies school, are all
correct.The young Smalley mentioned in the narrative was well known to
her, and also his sister "little Sissy Smalley," as they used to call
her.Inquiries have been made of those acquainted with the route along
which the fugitive passed in her hasty flight, and we are told that the
description is in general correct; that even the mistakes serve to prove
the truthfulness of the narrator, being such as a person would be likely
to make when describing from memory scenes and places they had seen but
once; whereas, if they were getting up a fiction which they designed to
represent as truth, such mistakes would be carefully avoided.APPENDIX I.

ABSURDITIES OF ROMANISTS.It may perchance be thought by some persons that the foregoing narrative
contains many things too absurd and childish for belief."What rational
man," it may be said, "would ever think of dressing up a figure to
represent the devil, for the purpose of frightening young girls into
obedience?Surely no sane man, and certainly
no Christian teacher, would ever stoop to such senseless mummery!"Incredible it may seem--foolish, false, inconsistent with reason, or the
plain dictates of common sense, it certainly is--but we have before us
well-authenticated accounts of transactions in which the Romish priests
claimed powers quite as extraordinary, and palmed off upon a credulous,
superstitious people stories quite as silly and ridiculous as anything
recorded in these pages.Indeed, so barefaced and shameless were their
pretensions in some instances, that even their better-informed brethren
were ashamed of their folly, and their own archbishop publicly rebuked
their dishonesty, cupidity and chicanery.In proof of this we place
before our readers the following facts which we find in a letter from
Professor Similien, of the college of Angers, addressed to the Union de
l'Ouest:

"Some years ago a pretended miracle was reported as having occurred upon
a mountain called La Salette, in the southeastern part of France,
where the Virgin Mary appeared in a very miraculous manner to two young
shepherds.The story, however, was soon proved to be a despicable trick
of the priest, and as such was publicly exposed.But the Bishop of
Lucon, within whose diocese the sacred mountain stands, appears to have
been unwilling to relinquish the advantage which he expected to result
from a wide-spread belief in this infamous fable.Accordingly, in
July, 1852, it was again reported that no less than three miracles were
wrought there by the Holy Virgin.The details were as follows:

"A young pupil at the religious establishment of the visitation of
Valence, who had been for three months completely blind from an attack
of gutta-serena, arrived at La Salette on the first of July, in company
with some sisters of the community.The extreme fatigue which she had
undergone in order to reach the summit of the mountain, at the place of
the apparition, caused some anxiety to be felt that she could not remain
fasting until the conclusion of the mass, which had not yet commenced,
and the Abbe Sibilla, one of the missionaries of La Salette, was
requested to administer the sacrament to her before the service began.She had scarcely received the sacred wafer, when, impelled by a sudden
inspiration, she raised her head and exclaimed,'ma bonne mere, je vous
vois.'She had, in fact, her eyes fixed on the statue of the Virgin,
which she saw as clearly as any one present For more than an hour she
remained plunged in an ecstasy of gratitude and love, and afterward
retired from the place without requiring the assistance of those who
accompanied her.At the same moment a woman from Gap, nearly sixty years
of age, who for the last nineteen years had not had the use of her right
arm, in consequence of a dislocation, suddenly felt it restored to
its original state, and swinging round the once paralyzed limb, she
exclaimed, in a transport of joy and gratitude, 'And I also am cured!'A third cure, although not instantaneous, is not the less striking.Another woman, known in the country for years as being paralytic, could
not ascend the mountain but with the greatest difficulty, and with the
aid of crutches.On the first day of the neuvane, that of her arrival,
she felt a sensation as if life was coming into her legs, which had been
for so long time dead.This feeling went on increasing, and the last day
of the neuvane, after having received the communion, she went, without
any assistance, to the cross of the assumption, where she hung up her
crutches."Bishop Lucon must have known that this was mere imposition; yet, so far
from exposing a fraud so base, he not only permits his people to believe
it, but he lends his whole influence to support and circulate the
falsehood.a church was to be erected; and it was necessary
to get up a little enthusiasm among the people in order to induce them
to fill his exhausted coffers, and build the church.In proof of this,
we have only to quote a few extracts from the 'Pastoral' which he issued
on this occasion."'And now," he says, "Mary has deigned to appear on the summit of a
lofty mountain to two young shepherds, revealing to them the secrets
of heaven.But who attests the truth of the narrative of these Alpine
pastors?No other than the men themselves, and they are believed.They
declare what they have seen, they repeat what they have heard, they
retain what they have received commandment to keep secret."A few words of the incomparable Mother of God have transformed them
into new men.Incapable of concerting aught between themselves, or of
imagining anything similar to what they relate, each is the witness to a
vision which has not found him unbelieving; each is its historian.These
two shepherds, dull as they were, have at once understood and received
the lesson which was vouchsafed to them, and it is ineffaceably engraven
on their hearts.They add nothing to it, they take nothing from it, they
modify it in nowise, they deliver the oracle of Heaven just as they have
received it."An admirable constancy enabled them to guard the secret, a singular
sagacity made them discern all the snares laid for them, a rare prudence
suggested to them a thousand responses, not one of which betrayed their
secret; and when at length the time came when it was their duty to make
it known to the common Father of the Faithful, they wrote correctly, as
if reading a book placed under their eyes.Their recital drew to this
blessed mountain thousands of pilgrims."They proclaimed that 'on Saturday, the 19th of September, 1846, Mary
manifested herself to them; and the anniversary of this glorious day is
henceforth and forever dear to Christian piety.Will not every pilgrim
who repairs to this holy mountain add his testimony to the truthfulness
of these young shepherds?Mary halted near a fountain; she communicated
to it a celestial virtue, a divine efficacy.From being intermittent,
this spring, today so celebrated, became perennial."'Every where is recounted the prodigies which she works.When the
afflicted are in despair, the infirm without remedy, they resort to the
waters of La Salette, and cures are wrought by this remedy, whose power
makes itself felt against every evil.Our diocess, so devoted to Mary,
has been no stranger to the bounty of this tender Mother.We are
about to celebrate shortly the sixth anniversary of this miraculous
apparition.NOW THAT A SANCTUARY IS TO BE RAISED on this holy mountain
to the glory of God, we have thought it right to inform you thereof."'We cannot doubt that many of you have been heard by our Lady of
La Salette; you desire to witness your gratitude to this mother of
compassion; you would gladly BRING YOUR STONE to the beautiful edifice
that is to be constructed.WE DESIRE TO FURTHER YOUR FILIAL TENDERNESS
WITH THE MEANS OF TRANSMITTING THE ALMS OF FAITH AND PIETY.For these
reasons, invoking the holy name of God, we have ordained and do ordain
as follows, viz.:

"'First, we permit the appearance of our Lady of La Salette to be
preached throughout our diocess; secondly, on Sunday, the 19th of
September next ensuing, the litanies of the Holy Virgin shall be chanted
in all the chapels and churches of the diocess, and be followed by the
benediction of the Holy Sacrament.Thirdly, THE FAITHFUL WHO MAY DESIRE
TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ERECTION OF THE NEW SANCTUARY, MAY DEPOSIT THEIR
OFFERINGS IN THE HANDS OF THE CURE, WHO WILL TRANSMIT THEM TO US FOR THE
BISHOP OF GRENOBLE."'Our present pastoral letter shall be read and published after mass in
every parish on the Sunday after its reception."'Given at Lucon, in our Episcopal palace, under our sign-manual and the
seal of our arms, and the official counter-signature of our secretary,
the 30th of June, of the year of Grace, 1852."'X Jac-Mar Jos, "'Bishop of Lucon.'""It is not a little remarkable," says the editor of the American
Christian Union, "that whilst the Bishop of Lucon was engaged in
extolling the miracles of La Salette, the Cardinal Archbishop of Lyons,
Dr.Bonald, 'Primate of all the Gauls,' addressed a circular to all the
priests in his diocese, in which he cautions them against apocryphal
miracles!There is indubitable evidence that his grace refers to the
scandalous delusions of La Salette.He attributes the miracles in question to pecuniary speculation, which
now-a-days, he says, mingles with everything, seizes upon imaginary
facts, and profits by it at the expense of the credulous!He charges the
authors of these things with being GREEDY MEN, who aim at procuring for
themselves DISHONEST GAINS by this traffic in superstitious objects!And
he forbids the publishing from the pulpit, without leave, of any account
of a miracle, even though its authenticity should be attested by another
Bishop!His grace deserves credit for setting his face
against this miserable business, of palming off false miracles upon the
people."[Footnote: Since the above was written, we have met with the following
explanation of this modern miracle:

"A few years ago there was a great stir among 'the simple faithful' in
France, occasioned by a well-credited apparition of the Holy Virgin at
La Salette.She required the erection of a chapel in her honor at that
place, and made such promises of special indulgences to all who paid
their devotions there, that it became 'all the rage' as a place of
pilgrimage.The consequence was, that other shops for the same sort of
wares in that region lost most of their customers, and the good priests
who tended the tills were sorely impoverished.In self-defence, they,
WELL KNOWING HOW SUCH THINGS WERE GOT UP, exposed the trick.A prelate
publicly denounced the imposture, and an Abbe Deleon, priest in the
diocess of Grenoble, printed a work called 'La Salette a Valley of
Lies.'In this publication it was maintained, with proofs, that the hoax
was gotten up by a Mademoiselle de Lamerliere, a sort of half-crazy nun,
who impersonated the character of the Virgin.For the injury done to her
character by this book she sued the priest for damages to the tone of
twenty thousand francs, demanding also the infliction of the utmost
penalty of the law.The court, after a long and careful investigation,
for two days, as we learn by the Catholic Herald, disposed of the case
by declaring the miracle-working damsel non-suited, and condemning her
to pay the expenses of the prosecution."Another of Rome's marvellous stories we copy from the New York Daily
Times of July 3d, 1854.It is from the pen of a correspondent at Rome,
who, after giving an account of the ceremony performed in the church
of St.Peters at the canonization of a NEW SAINT, under the name of
Germana, relates the following particulars of her history.He says, "I
take the facts as they are related in a pamphlet account of her 'life,
virtues, and miracles,' published by authority at Rome:

"Germana Consin was born near the village of Pibrac, in the diocess
of Toulouse, in France.Maimed in one hand, and of a scrofulous
constitution, she excited the hatred of her step-mother, in whose power
her father's second marriage placed her while yet a child.This cruel
woman gave the little Germana no other bed than some vine twigs, lying
under a flight of stairs, which galled her limbs, wearied with the day's
labor.She also persuaded her husband to send the little girl to tend
sheep in the plains, exposed to all extremes of weather.Injuries and
abuse were her only welcome when she returned from her day's task to
her home.To these injuries she submitted with Christian meekness and
patience, and she derived her happiness and consolation from religious
faith.She went every day to church to hear mass, disregarding the
distance, the difficulty of the journey, and the danger in which she
left her flock.The neighboring forest was full of wolves, who devoured
great numbers from other flocks, but never touched a sheep in that of
Germana.To go to the church she was obliged to cross a little river,
which was often flooded, but she passed with dry feet; the waters
flowing away from her on either side: howbeit no one else dared to
attempt the passage.Whenever the signal sounded for the Ave Marie,
wherever she might be in conducting her sheep, even if in a ditch, or in
mud or mire, she kneeled down and offered her devotions to the Queen of
Heaven, nor were her garments wet or soiled.The little children whom
she met in the fields she instructed in the truths of religion.For the
poor she felt the tenderest charity, and robbed herself of her scanty
pittance of bread to feed them.One day her step-mother, suspecting
that she was carrying away from the house morsels of bread to be thus
distributed, incited her husband to look in her apron; he did so, BUT
FOUND IT FULL OF FLOWERS, BEAUTIFUL BUT OUT OF SEASON, INSTEAD OF BREAD.This miraculous conversion of bread into flowers formed the subject
of one of the paintings exhibited in St.Industrious, charitable, patient and forgiving, Germana lived a
memorable example of piety till she passed from earth in the twenty
second year of her age.The night of her death two holy monks were
passing, on a journey, in the neighborhood of her house.Late at night
they saw two celestial virgins robed in white on the road that led to
her habitation; a few minutes afterwards they returned leading between
them another virgin clad in pure white, and with a crown of flowers on
her head."Wonders did not cease with her death.Forty years after this event her
body was uncovered, in digging a grave for another person, and found
entirely uncorrupted--nay, the blood flowed from a wound accidentally
made in her face.Great crowds assembled to see the body so miraculously
preserved, and it was carefully re-interred within the church.There it
lay in place until the French Revolution, when it was pulled up and cast
into a ditch and covered with quick lime and water.But even this
failed to injure the body of the blessed saint.It was found two years
afterward entirely unhurt, and even the grave clothes which surrounded
it were entire, as on the day of sepulture, two hundred years before."And now in the middle of the nineteenth century, these facts are
published for the edification of believers, and his Holiness has set his
seal to their authenticity.Four miracles performed by this saint after
her death are attested by the bull of beatification, and also by Latin
inscriptions in great letters displayed at St.Peter's on the day
of this great celebration.The monks of the monastery at Bourges, in
France, prayed her to intercede on one occasion, that their store of
bread might be multiplied; on another their store of meal; on both
occasions THEIR PRAYER WAS GRANTED.The other two miracles were cures
of desperate maladies, the diseased persons having been brought to pray
over her tomb."On the splendid scarlet hangings, bearing the arms of Pius IX.and
suspended at the corners of the nave and transept, were two Latin
inscriptions, of similar purport, of one of which I give a translation:
'O Germana, raised to-day to celestial honors by Pius IX.Pontifex
Maximus, since thou knowest that Pius has wept over thy nation wandering
from God, and has exultingly rejoiced at its reconciling itself with God
little by little, he prays thee intimately united with God, do thou, for
thou canst do it, make known his wishes to God, and strengthen them, for
thou art able, with the virtue of thy prayers.'"I have been thus minute in my account of this Beatification, deeming
the facts I state of no little importance and interest, as casting light
upon the character of the Catholicism of the present day, and showing
with what matters the Spiritual and Temporal ruler of Rome is busying
himself in this year of our Lord eighteen hundred and fifty-four."Many other examples similar to the above might be given from the history
of Catholicism as it exists at the present time in the old world.But
let us turn to our own country.We need not look to France or Rome for
examples of priestly intrigue of the basest kind; and absurdities that
almost surpass belief.The following account which we copy from The
American and Foreign Christian Union of August, 1852, will serve to show
that the priests in these United States are quite as willing to impose
upon the ignorant and credulous as, their brethren in other countries.The article is from the pen of an Irish Missionary in the employ of The
American and Foreign Christian Union and is entitled,

   "A LYING WONDER.""It would seem almost incredible," says the editor of this valuable
Magazine, "that any men could be found in this country who are capable
of practising such wretched deceptions.But the account given in the
subjoined statement is too well authenticated to permit us to reject the
story as untrue, however improbable it may, at first sight, seem to be.Editor,--I give you, herein, some information respecting a lying
wonder wrought in Troy, New York, last winter, and respecting the female
who was the 'MEDIUM' of it.I have come to the conclusion that this
