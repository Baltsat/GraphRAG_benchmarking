The erect figure and outstretched arm
arrested Cameron.A haunting sense of familiarity floated across his
memory."Let's go nearer," he said, "and quietly."With extreme caution they made about two-thirds of the distance when a
howl from an Indian dog revealed their presence.At once the speaker
who had been standing in the firelight sank crouching to the ground.Instantly Cameron ran forward a few swift steps and, like a hound upon
a deer, leapt across the fire and fair upon the crouching Indian, crying
"Call the Police, Martin!"Martin sprang into the
middle of an excited group of Indians.Two of them threw themselves
upon him, but with a hard right and left he laid them low and, seizing
a stick of wood, sprang toward two others who were seeking to batter the
life out of Cameron as he lay gripping his enemy by the throat with one
hand and with the other by the wrist to check a knife thrust.Swinging
his stick around his head and repeating his cry for help, Martin made
Cameron's assailants give back a space and before they could renew the
attack Sergeant Crisp burst open the door of the Barracks, and, followed
by a Slim young constable and the Superintendent, came rushing with
shouts upon the scene.Immediately upon the approach of the Police the
Indians ceased the fight and all that could faded out of the light into
the black night around them, while the Indian who continued to struggle
with incredible fury to free himself from Cameron's grip suddenly became
limp and motionless."Why, it's you, doctor,
and where--?The incidents leading up to the present
situation were briefly described by the doctor."I can't get this fellow free," said the Sergeant, who was working hard
to release the Indian's throat from the gripping fingers.He turned
Cameron over on his back.Blood was pouring
from his mouth and nose, but his fingers like steel clamps were gripping
the wrist and throat of his foe."No," said Martin, with his hand upon Cameron's heart.You can't loosen his fingers till he revives.The blow that knocked him
senseless set those fingers as they are and they will stay set thus till
released by returning consciousness."shouted the Superintendent to the slim
young constable.Gradually as the water was splashed upon his face Cameron came back to
life and, relaxing his fingers, stretched himself with a sigh as of vast
relief and lay still.cried the Sergeant, dashing the rest of
the water into the face of the Indian lying rigid and motionless on the
ground.A long shudder ran through the Indian's limbs.Clutching at
his throat with both hands, he raised himself to a sitting posture, his
breath coming in raucous gasps, glared wildly upon the group, then sank
back upon the ground, rolled over upon his side and lay twitching and
breathing heavily, unheeded by the doctor and Police who were working
hard over Cameron."No bones broken, I think," said the doctor, feeling the battered head."Here's where the blow fell that knocked him out," pointing to a ridge
that ran along the side of Cameron's head."A little lower, a little
more to the front and he would never have moved.Cameron opened his eyes, struggled to speak and sank back again.Could you
get a little brandy, Sergeant?"Again the slim young constable rushed toward the Barracks and in a few
moments returned with the spirits.After taking a sip of the brandy
Cameron again opened his eyes and managed to say "Don't--"

"All right, old chap," said the doctor.But as once more Cameron opened his eyes the agony of the
appeal in them aroused the doctor's attention.The appealing eyes closed, then, opening again, turned toward the
Superintendent.Once more with painful effort Cameron managed to utter the word
"Copperhead."ejaculated the Superintendent in a low tense voice,
springing to his feet and turning toward the unconscious Indian.he
shouted, "Call out the whole Force!Surround this camp and hold every
Indian.Search every teepee for this fellow who was lying here.Leaving Cameron to the doctor, who in a few minutes became
satisfied that no serious injury had been sustained, he joined in the
search with fierce energy.The teepees were searched, the squaws and
papooses were ruthlessly bundled out from their slumbers and with the
Indians were huddled into the Barracks.But of the Sioux Chief there was
no sign.Within a quarter of an hour half
a dozen mounted constables were riding off in different directions to
cover the main trails leading to the Indian reserves and to sweep a wide
circle about the town."They will surely get him," said Dr."Not much chance of it," growled Cameron, to whom with returning
consciousness had come the bitter knowledge of the escape of the man
he had come to regard as his mortal enemy."I had him fast enough," he
groaned, "in spite of the best he could do, and I would have choked his
life out had it not been for these other devils.""They certainly jumped in savagely," said Martin."In fact I cannot
understand how they got at the thing so quickly.""Yes, I heard that call, and it mighty near did the trick for you.Thank
Heaven your thick Hielan' skull saved you."Because he was too swift for us," said the Superintendent, who had
come in, "and we too slow.I thought it was an ordinary Indian row,
you see, but I might have known that you would not have gone in in that
style without good reason.Who would think that this old devil should
have the impudence to camp right here under our nose?Where did he come
from anyway, do you suppose?""Been to the Blackfoot Reserve like enough and was on his way to the
Sarcees when he fell in with this little camp of theirs.""That's about it," replied the Superintendent gloomily."And to think
you had him fast and we let him go!"The thought brought small comfort to any of them, least of all to
Cameron.In that vast foothill country with all the hidings of the hills
and hollows there was little chance that the Police would round up the
fugitive, and upon Cameron still lay the task of capturing this cunning
and resourceful foe.But I'll get him some time or he'll get me,"
replied Cameron as his face settled into grim lines.Sore a bit in the head, but can navigate.""I can't tell you how disappointed and chagrined I feel.It isn't often
that my wits are so slow but--" The Superintendent's jaws here cut off
his speech with a snap.The one crime reckoned unpardonable in the men
under his own command was that of failure and his failure to capture old
Copperhead thus delivered into his hands galled him terribly."Well, good-night, Cameron," said the Superintendent, looking out into
the black night."We shall let you know to-morrow the result of our
scouting, though I don't expect much from it.He is much too clever to
be caught in the open in this country.""Perhaps he'll skidoo," said Dr."No, he's not that kind," replied the Superintendent.You have got to catch him or kill him.""I think you are right, sir," said Cameron."He will stay till his work
is done or till he is made to quit.""That is true, Cameron--till he is made to quit--and that's your job,"
said the Superintendent solemnly."Yes, that is my job, sir," replied Cameron simply and with equal
solemnity."We have every confidence in you, Cameron," replied the Superintendent."Good-night," he said again, shutting the door."Say, old man, this is too gruesome," said Martin with fierce
impatience."I can't see why it's up to you more than any other.""The Sun Dance Trail is the trail he must take to do his work.That was
my patrol last year--I know it best.God knows I don't want this--"
his breath came quick--"I am not afraid--but--but there's--We have been
together for such a little while, you know."He could get no farther for
a moment or two, then added quietly, "But somehow I know--yes and she
knows--bless her brave heart--it is my job.CHAPTER VIII

THE GIRL ON NO.By the time they had reached the hotel Cameron was glad enough to go to
his bed."You need not tell your wife, I suppose," said the doctor.Don't you fear, she is up to it."And so she was, and, though her face grew white as she listened to the
tale, never for a moment did her courage falter.Tell me," she said, her big blue eyes
holding his in a steady gaze."Right enough, but he must have a long sleep.You must not let him stir
at five.""Then," said Mandy, "I shall go to meet the train, Allan.""No, but I shall find her out."Martin in a deprecating tone, "I know Miss
Cameron, but--"

"Of course you do," cried Mandy.You will go
and Allan need not be disturbed.Not a word, now,
Allan.We will look after this, the doctor and I, eh, Doctor?""Why--eh--yes--yes certainly, of course.Under the influence of a powder left by Dr.Martin, Cameron, after an hour's tossing, fell into a heavy sleep."I am so glad you are here," said Mandy to the doctor, as he looked in
upon her."I am so thankful," said Mandy, heaving a deep sigh of relief, "and I am
so glad that you are here.And it is so nice that you know Moira.""No, no, there is no need, and I don't like to leave him."N-o-o, no, not at all--certainly not," said the doctor with growing
confidence."Oh," cried Mandy, "I shall meet you when you come.So glad you are here," she added with a tremulous smile."By Jove, she's a brick!""She has about all she
can stand just now.It's up to me now to do the Wild West welcome act, and
I'm scared--plain scared to death.I've got two hours yet to work up my ginger.I'll have a pipe to
start with."He passed into the bar, where, finding himself alone, he curled up in
a big leather chair and gave himself up to his pipe and his dreams.The
dingy bar-room gave place to a little sunny glen in the Highlands of
Scotland, in which nestled a little cluster of stone-built cottages,
moss-grown and rose-covered.Far down in the bottom of the Glen a tiny
loch gleamed like a jewel.Up on the hillside above the valley an avenue
of ragged pines led to a large manor house, old, quaint, but dignified,
and in the doorway a maiden stood, grave of face and wonderfully sweet,
in whose brown eyes and over whose brown curls all the glory of the
little Glen of the Cup of Gold seemed to gather.Through many pipes he
pursued his dreams, but always they led him to that old doorway and
the maiden with the grave sweet face and the hair and eyes full of the
golden sunlight of the Glen Cuagh Oir.he grumbled to himself at last, knocking the ashes from
his pipe.He lit a fresh pipe and began anew to dream of that wonderful day, that
day which was the one unfading point of light in all his Old Country
stay.Not even the day when he stood to receive his parchment and the
special commendation of the Senatus and of his own professor for his
excellent work lived with him like that day in the Glen.Every detail of
the picture he could recall and ever in the foreground the maiden.With
deliberate purpose he settled himself in his chair and set himself to
fill in those fine and delicate touches that were necessary to make
perfect the foreground of his picture, the pale olive face with its
bewildering frame of golden waves and curls, the clear brown eyes, now
soft and tender, now flashing with wrath, and the voice with its soft
Highland cadence."By Jove, I'm dotty!I'll make an ass of myself, sure
thing, when I see her to-day."He sprang from his chair and shook
himself together."Besides, she has forgotten all about me."The chill morning air struck him sharply in the face.He
turned quickly, snatched his overcoat from a nail in the hall and put it
on.At this point Billy, who combined in his own person the offices of
ostler, porter and clerk, appeared, his lantern shining with a dim
yellow glare in the gray light of the dawn.1 is about due, Doc," he said.I say, Billy," said the Doctor, "want to do something for
me?"He pushed a dollar at Billy over the counter."Name it, Doc, without further insult," replied Billy, shoving the
dollar back with a lordly scorn."All right, Billy, you're a white little soul.I want your
ladies' parlor aired."I have a lady coming--I
have--that is--Sergeant Cameron's sister is coming--"

"Say no more," said Billy with a wink.But what about
the open window, Doc?"Open it up and put on a fire.Those Old Country people are mad about
fresh air.""All right, Doc," replied Billy with another knowing wink."The best is
none too good for her, eh?""Look here, now, Billy--" the doctor's tone grew severe--"let's have no
nonsense.He is knocked out, unable
to meet her.If you
have any think juice in that block of yours turn it on."Billy twisted one ear as if turning a cock, and tapped his forehead with
his knuckles."Doc," he said solemnly, "she's workin' like a watch, full jewel, patent
lever."Sitting-room aired, good fire going,
windows open and a cup of coffee.""You know well enough, Billy, you haven't got any but that infernal
green stuff fit to tan the stomach of a brass monkey.""All right, Billy, I trust you.They are death on tea in the Old
Country.You keep her out a-viewin' the scenery for half an hour.""And Billy, a big pitcher of hot water.They can't live without hot
water in the morning, those Old Country people."At this point a long drawn whistle sounded through the still morning
air.Say, Doc--"

But his words fell upon empty space."Say, he's a sprinter," said Billy to himself."He ain't takin' no
chances on bein' late.Shouldn't be surprised if the Doc got there all
right."He darted upstairs and looked around the ladies' parlor.The air was
heavy with mingled odors of the bar and the kitchen.A spittoon occupied
a prominent place in the center of the room.The tables were dusty, the
furniture in confusion.The ladies' parlor was perfectly familiar to
Billy, but this morning he viewed it with new eyes.He's too swift in his movements," he muttered
to himself as he proceeded to fling things into their places.He raised
the windows, opened the stove door and looked in.The ashes of many
fires half filling the box met his eyes with silent reproach."Say, the
Doc ain't fair," he muttered again."Them ashes ought to have been out
of there long ago."This fact none knew better than himself, inasmuch as
there was no other from whom this duty might properly be expected.Yet
it brought some small relief to vent his disgust upon this offending
accumulation of many days' neglect.He
was due in ten minutes to meet the possible guests for the Royal at the
train.He seized a pail left in the hall by the none too tidy housemaid
and with his hands scooped into it the ashes from the stove, and,
leaving a cloud of dust to settle everywhere upon tables and chairs, ran
down with his pail and back again with kindling and firewood and had
a fire going in an extraordinarily short time.He then caught up an
ancient antimacassar, used it as a duster upon chairs and tables, flung
it back again in its place over the rickety sofa and rushed for the
station to find that the train had already pulled in, had come to a
standstill and was disgorging its passengers upon the platform.All the comforts and
conveniences!That's all right, leave 'em to me.He saw the doctor wandering distractedly up and down the platform.Say, Doc," he added in a lower voice, coming near to the
doctor, "what's that behind you?"The doctor turned sharply and saw a young lady whose long clinging black
dress made her seem taller than she was.She wore a little black hat
with a single feather on one side, which gave it a sort of tam o'
shanter effect.Martin," she said in a voice that indicated immense
relief.Well do I remember you--and that day in the Cuagh Oir--but
you have forgotten all about that day."A little flush appeared on her
pale cheek."But you didn't know me," she added with a slight severity in her tone.She paused in a
sudden confusion, and with a little haughty lift of her head said,
"Where is Allan, my brother?"He was gazing at her in stupid
amazement."I was looking for a little girl," he said, "in a blue serge dress and
tangled hair, brown, and all curls, with brown eyes and--"

"And you found a grown up woman with all the silly curls in their proper
place--much older--very much older.It is a habit we have in Scotland of
growing older.""Yes, older, and more sober and sensible--and plainer."The doctor's mind was evidently not working with its usual
ease and swiftness, partly from amazement at the transformation that had
resulted in this tall slender young lady standing before him with
her stately air, and partly from rage at himself and his unutterable
stupidity."But you have not answered me," said the girl, obviously taken aback at
the doctor's manner.This is
Cal--gar--ry, is it not?""It's Calgary all right," cried the doctor, glad to find in this fact a
solid resting place for his mind.The alarm in her voice brought
him to himself.With an imperious air the young
lady lifted her head and impaled the doctor with her flashing brown
eyes."Well," said the doctor in halting confusion, "you see, he met with an
accident.""You are hiding something from me, Mr.My brother is ill, or--"

"No, no, not he.An Indian hit him on the head," said the doctor,
rendered desperate by her face.Her cry, her white face, the quick clutch of her hands at
her heart, roused the doctor's professional instincts and banished his
confusion."He is perfectly all right, I assure you, Miss Cameron.Only it was
better that he should have his sleep out.He was most anxious to meet
you, but as his medical adviser I urged him to remain quiet and offered
to come in his place.A day's rest, believe me,
will make him quite fit."The doctor's manner was briskly professional
and helped to quiet the girl's alarm."Most certainly, in a few hours when he wakes and when you are rested.Here, Billy, take Miss Cameron's checks."Say, Doc," said Billy in an undertone, "about that tea and toast--"

"What the deuce--?""Keep her a-viewin' the scenery, Doc, a bit," continued Billy under his
breath."Oh, get a move on, Billy!He was anxious to escape from a position that had
become intolerable to him.For months he had been looking forward to
this meeting and now he had bungled it.In the first place he had begun
by not knowing the girl who for three years and more had been in his
dreams day and night, then he had carried himself like a schoolboy
in her presence, and lastly had frightened her almost to death by his
clumsy announcement of her brother's accident.The young lady at his
side, with the quick intuition of her Celtic nature, felt his mood, and,
not knowing the cause, became politely distant.Martin pointed out the wonderful pearly
gray light stealing across the plain and beginning to brighten on the
tops of the rampart hills that surrounded the town."You will see the Rockies in an hour, Miss Cameron, in the far west
there," he said.But her tone, too, was
lifeless.Desperately the doctor strove to make conversation during their short
walk and with infinite relief did he welcome the appearance of Mandy at
her bedroom door waiting their approach."Your brother's wife, Miss Cameron," said he.For a single moment they stood searching each other's souls.Then by
some secret intuition known only to the female mind they reached a
conclusion, an entirely satisfactory conclusion, too, for at once they
were in each other's arms."Yes," said the girl in an eager, tremulous voice."No, no," cried Moira, "don't wake him.inquired Mandy, looking indignantly at
the doctor, who stood back, a picture of self condemnation.I bungled the whole
thing this morning and frightened Miss Cameron nearly into a fit, for
no other reason than that I am all ass.he added abruptly, lifted his hat and was
gone.said Mandy, looking at her sister-in-law."I do not know, I am sure," replied Moira indifferently.But come, my dear, take off your things.As the doctor says, a sleep for a couple of hours will do you good.You are looking very weary, dear, and no
wonder, no wonder," said Mandy, "with all that journey and--and all you
have gone through.""My, I
could just pick you up like a babe!"The caressing touch was too much for the girl."Och, oh," she cried, lapsing into her Highland speech, "it iss
ashamed of myself I am, but no one has done that to me for many a day
since--since--my father--"

"There, there, you poor darling," said Mandy, comforting her as if she
were a child, "you will not want for love here in this country.Cry
away, it will do you good."There was a sound of feet on the stairs."Hush, hush, Billy is coming."She swept the girl into her bedroom as
Billy appeared."Oh, I am just silly," said Moira impatiently, as she wiped her eyes."But you are so good, and I will never be forgetting your kindness to me
this day.""Hot water," said Billy, tapping at the door.Do you want hot water,
Moira?""Yes, the very thing I do want to get the dust out of my eyes and the
grime off my face.""And the tea is in the ladies' parlor," added Billy.cried Mandy, "the very thing!"Said they were all stuck on tea in the Old Country."I shall lie down, I think, for a little.""All right, dear, we will see you at breakfast.Again she kissed the girl and left her to sleep.She found Billy
standing in the ladies' parlor with a perplexed and disappointed look on
his face."The Doc said she'd sure want some tea," he said.The Doc--"

"Well, Billy, I'd just love a cup of tea if you don't mind wasting it on
me."The Doc won't mind, bein' as she turned it down."He needs a cup of tea; he's been up
all night."Judgin' by his langwidge I should surmise yes," said Billy judicially."Would you get him, Billy, and bring him here?"But as to bringin' him here, I'd prefer wild
cats myself.The last I seen of him he was hikin' for the Rockies with a
blue haze round his hair.""But what in the world is wrong with him, Billy?""The Doc's a pretty level headed cuss.There's
somethin' workin' on him, if you ask me.""Billy, you get him and tell him we want to see him at breakfast, will
you?""Tell him, Billy, I want him to see my husband then."And it did catch him, for, after breakfast was over, clean-shaven, calm
and controlled, and in his very best professional style, Dr.Martin made
his morning call on his patient.Rigidly he eliminated from his manner
anything beyond a severe professional interest.Mandy, who for two years
had served with him as nurse, and who thought she knew his every mood,
was much perplexed.Do what she could, she was unable to break through
the barrier of his professional reserve.He was kindly courteous and
perfectly correct."I would suggest a quiet day for him, Mrs.Cameron," was his verdict
after examining the patient."He will be quite able to get up in the
afternoon and go about, but not to set off on a hundred and fifty mile
drive.A quiet day, sleep, cheerful company, such as you can furnish
here, will fix him up.""Doctor, we will secure the quiet day if you will furnish the cheerful
company," said Mandy, beaming on him."I have a very busy day before me, and as for cheerful company, with you
two ladies he will have all the company that is good for him.""CHEERFUL company, you said, Doctor.If you desert us how can we be
cheerful?""Exactly for that reason," replied the doctor."Say, Martin," interposed Cameron, "take them out for a drive this
afternoon and leave me in peace."cried Mandy, "with one hundred and fifty miles behind me and
another hundred and fifty miles before me!""Moira, you used to be fond of riding.""And am still," cried the girl, with sparkling eyes."My habit is in one of my boxes," replied Moira."I can get a habit," said the doctor, "and two of them.""That's settled, then," cried Mandy.We shall do
some shopping, Allan, you and I this afternoon and you two can go off
to the hills.th--ink of that, Moira, for a highlander!"She
glanced at Moira's face and read refusal there.A whole week in an awful stuffy train."Yes, the very thing, Moira," cried her brother."We will have a long
talk this morning then in the afternoon we will do some business here,
Mandy and I, and you can go up the Bow."Nothing like it even in Scotland, and
that's saying a good deal," said her brother with emphasis.This arrangement appeared to give complete satisfaction to all parties
except those most immediately interested, but there seemed to be no very
sufficient reason with either to decline, hence they agreed.CHAPTER IX

THE RIDE UP THE BOW


Having once agreed to the proposal of a ride up the Bow, the doctor
lost no time in making the necessary preparations.Half an hour later he
found himself in the stable consulting with Billy.His mood was gloomy
and his language reflected his mood.Gladly would he have escaped what
to him, he felt, would be a trying and prolonged ordeal.But he could
not do this without exciting the surprise of his friends and possibly
wounding the sensitive girl whom he would gladly give his life to serve.He resolved that at all costs he would go through with the thing."I'll give her a good time, by Jingo!if I bust something," he muttered
as he walked up and down the stable picking out his mounts."But for a
compound, double-opposed, self-adjusting jackass, I'm your choice.Threw it clean away and queered myself with her first
shot.I say, Billy," he called, "come here.""Kick me, Billy," said the doctor solemnly."Well now, Doc, I--"

"Kick me, Billy, good and swift.""Don't believe I could give no satisfaction, Doc.But there's that Hiram
mule, he's a high class artist."No use being kicked, Billy, by something that wouldn't appreciate it,"
said Martin.He's an ornery cuss, he'd appreciate it all
right, that old mule.But Doc, what's eatin' you?""Oh, nothing, Billy, except that I'm an ass, an infernal ass."Then I guess I couldn't give you no satisfaction."Well, Billy, the horses at two," said the doctor briskly, "the broncho
and that dandy little pinto."Brace up, Doc, it's
comin' to you."Billy's wink conveyed infinitely more than his words."Look here, Billy, you cut that all out," said the doctor."All right, Doc, if that's the way you feel.You'll see no monkey-work
on me.I'll make a preacher look like a sideshow."And truly Billy's manner was irreproachable as he stood with the ponies
at the hotel door and helped their riders to mount.There was an almost
sad gravity in his demeanor that suggested a mind preoccupied with
solemn and unworldly thoughts with which the doctor and his affairs had
not even the remotest association.As Cameron who, with his wife, watched their departure from the balcony
above, waved them farewell, he cried, "Keep your eyes skinned for an
Indian, Martin."I've got no gun on me," replied the doctor, "and if I get sight of him,
you hear me, I'll make for the timber quick."What is all this about the Indian, Dr.inquired the girl at
his side as they cantered down the street."Well, I've done enough to you with that Indian already to-day.""Didn't I like a fool frighten you nearly to death with him?"But an Indian to an Old
Country person familiar with Fenimore Cooper, well--"

"Oh, I was a proper idiot all round this morning," grumbled the doctor."I didn't know what I was doing.""You see," continued the doctor desperately, "I'd looked forward to
meeting you for so long.""And then to think
that I actually didn't know you.""You didn't look at me," cried Moira."No, I was looking for the girl I saw that day, almost three years ago,
in the Glen."No, nor I," replied the girl softly.It was
a terrible day to us all in the Glen, my brother going to leave us and
under that dreadful cloud, and you came with the letter that cleared it
all away.Oh, it was like the coming of an angel from heaven, and I have
often thought, Mr.Martin you are now, of course--that I
never thanked you as I ought that day."Get at it," cried the doctor with great emphasis, "I need it.The truth is, I was
completely knocked out, flabbergasted.""I thought--" A faint
color tinged her pale cheek and she paused a moment.He
thinks me just a little girl not to be trusted with things.""He doesn't know you, then," said the doctor."I know you better than that, at least.""I know you are to be trusted with that or with anything else that calls
for nerve.Besides, sooner or later you must know about this Indian.Wait till we cross the bridge and reach the top of the hill yonder, it
will be better going."The hillside gave them a stiff scramble, for the trail went straight up.But the sure-footed ponies, scrambling over stones and gravel, reached
the top safely, with no worse result than an obvious disarrangement of
the girl's hair, so that around the Scotch bonnet which she had pinned
on her head the little brown curls were peeping in a way that quite
shook the heart of Dr."Now you look a little more like yourself," he cried, his eyes fastened
upon the curls with unmistakable admiration, "more like the girl I
remember.""Oh," she said, "it is my bonnet.I put on this old thing for the ride.""No," said the doctor, "you wore no bonnet that day.It is your face,
your hair, you are not quite--so--so proper.""Oh, my silly curls, I
suppose.("My joy," the doctor nearly had said.)"It is not a pleasant thing to greet a guest with," he said, "but you
must know it and I may as well give it to you.And, mind you, this is
altogether a new thing with us."For the next half hour as they rode westward toward the big hills,
steadily climbing as they went, the story of the disturbance in the
north country, of the unrest among the Indians, of the part played in
it by the Indian Copperhead, and of the appeal by the Superintendent to
Cameron for assistance, furnished the topic for conversation.The girl
listened with serious face, but there was no fear in the brown eyes, nor
tremor in the quiet voice, as they talked it over."Now let us forget it for a while," cried the doctor."The Police have
rarely, if ever, failed to get their man.And they
will get this chap, too.And as for the row on the Saskatchewan, I don't
take much stock in that.Now we're coming to a view in a few minutes,
one of the finest I have seen anywhere."For half a mile farther they loped along the trail that led them to the
top of a hill that stood a little higher than the others round about."What do you think of that for a view?"Before them stretched the wide valley of the Bow for many miles,
sweeping up toward the mountains, with rounded hills on either side, and
far beyond the hills the majestic masses of the Rockies some fifty miles
away, snow-capped, some of them, and here and there upon their faces
the great glaciers that looked like patches of snow.Through this wide
valley wound the swift flowing Bow, and up from it on either side the
hills, rough with rocks and ragged masses of pine, climbed till they
seemed to reach the very bases of the mountains beyond.Over all the
blue arch of sky spanned the wide valley and seemed to rest upon the
great ranges on either side, like the dome of a vast cathedral.Silent, with lips parted and eyes alight with wonder, Moira sat and
gazed upon the glory of that splendid scene."What do you think--" began the doctor.She put out her hand and touched his arm."Please don't speak," she breathed, "this is not for words, but for
worship."Long she continued to gaze in rapt silence upon the picture spread out
before her.It was, indeed, a place for worship.She pointed to a hill
some distance in front of them."Yes, I have been all through this country.From the top
of that hill we get a magnificent sweep toward the south."Down the hillside they scrambled, across a little valley and up the
farther side, following the trail that wound along the hill but declined
to make the top.As they rounded the shoulder of the little mountain
Moira cried:

"It would be a great view from the top there beyond the trees.For answer she flung herself from her pinto and, gathering up her habit,
began eagerly to climb.By the time the doctor had tethered the ponies
she was half way to the top.Putting forth all his energy he raced after
her, and together they parted a screen of brushwood and stepped out on
a clear rock that overhung the deep canyon that broadened into a great
valley sweeping toward the south.cried the doctor, as they stepped out together.She laid her hand upon his arm and drew him back into the bushes.Surprised into silence, he stood gazing at her.Her face was white and her eyes gleaming."An Indian down there," she
whispered.She led him by a little detour and on their hands and knees they crept
through the brushwood.They reached the open rock and peered down
through a screen of bushes into the canyon below.Across the little stream that flowed at the bottom of the canyon, and
not more than a hundred yards away, stood an Indian, tall, straight and
rigidly attent, obviously listening and gazing steadily at the point
where they had first stood.For many minutes he stood thus rigid while
they watched him.He sat down upon the rocky
ledge that sloped up from the stream toward a great overhanging crag
behind him, laid his rifle beside him and, calmly filling his pipe,
began to smoke."I do believe it is our Indian," whispered the doctor."Oh, if we could only get him!"Her face was pale but firm set with
resolve.Quickly he revolved in his mind the possibilities."If I only had a gun," he said to himself, "I'd risk it."The Indian was breaking off some dead twigs from the standing pines
about him."He's going to light a fire," replied the doctor, "perhaps camp for the
night.""Then," cried the girl in an excited whisper, "we could get him."The Indian soon had his fire going and,
unrolling his blanket pack, he took thence what looked like a lump of
meat, cut some strips from it and hung them from pointed sticks over the
fire.He proceeded to gather some poles from the dead wood lying about.The Indian proceeded to place the poles in order against the rock,
keeping his eye on the toasting meat the while and now and again turning
it before the fire.Then he began to cut branches of spruce and balsam.cried the doctor, greatly excited, "I declare
he's going to camp.""Then," cried the girl, "we can get him."He'd double me up like
a jack-knife."No, no," she cried quickly, "you stay here to watch him."I say," cried the doctor, "you are a wonder.He thought rapidly, then said, "No, it won't do.I can't allow
you to risk it."A year ago the doctor would not have hesitated a moment to allow her
to go, but now he thought of the roving bands of Indians and the
possibility of the girl falling into their hands."No, Miss Cameron, it will not do.""But think," she cried, "we might get him and save Allan all the trouble
and perhaps his life."Wait," he said, "let me think."I am used to riding alone among
the hills at home.""Ah, yes, at home," said the doctor gloomily."But there is no danger," she persisted.She stood up among the bushes looking down at him with
a face so fiercely resolved that he was constrained to say, "By Jove!"You would not do that," she cried, stamping her foot, "if I forbade
you.It is your duty to stay here and watch that Indian.It is mine to
go and get the Police."No," she said, "I forbid you to come.She glided through the bushes from his sight and was gone."She is taking a
chance, but after all it is worth while."It was now the middle of the afternoon and it would take Moira an hour
and a half over that rocky winding trail to make the ten miles that
lay before her.Ten minutes more would see the Police started on their
return.The doctor settled himself down to his three hours' wait,
keeping his eye fixed upon the Indian.The latter was now busy with his
meal, which he ate ravenously."The beggar has me tied up tight," muttered the doctor ruefully."My
grub is on my saddle, and I guess I dare not smoke till he lights up
himself."Thought it was the whole Blackfoot tribe.""You will be the better for something to eat," she said simply, handing
him the lunch basket."Say, she's a regular--" He paused and thought for a moment."She's an
angel, that's what--and a mighty sight better than most of them.She's
a--" He turned back to his watch, leaving his thought unspoken.In the
presence of the greater passions words are woefully inadequate.The Indian was still eating as ravenously as ever.He ought to be full soon at that rate.Wish
he'd get his pipe agoing."In due time the Indian finished eating, rolled up the fragments
carefully in a rag, and then proceeded to construct with the poles and
brush which he had cut, a penthouse against the rock.At one end his
little shelter thus constructed ran into a spruce tree whose thick
branches reached right to the ground.When he had completed this shelter
to his satisfaction he sat down again on the rock beside his smoldering
fire and pulled out his pipe."Go on, old boy, hit
her up."A pipe and then another the Indian smoked, then, taking his gun, blanket
and pack, he crawled into his brush wigwam out of sight."You are
safe for an hour or two, thank goodness.You had no sleep last night and
you've got to make up for it now.The doctor hugged himself with supreme satisfaction and continued
to smoke with his eye fixed upon the hole into which the Indian had
disappeared.Through the long hours he sat and smoked while he formulated the plan
of attack which he proposed to develop when his reinforcements should
arrive."We will work up behind him from away down the valley, a couple of us
will cover him from the front and the others go right in."He continued with great care to make and revise his plans, and while
in the midst of his final revision a movement in the bushes behind
him startled him to his feet.The bushes parted and the face of Moira
appeared with that of her brother over her shoulder.Never moved," said the doctor exultantly, and
proceeded to explain his plan of attack.He
stepped back through the bushes and brought forward Crisp and the
constable."Now, then, here's our plan," he said."You, Crisp, will go
down the canyon, cross the stream and work up on the other side right to
that rock.When you arrive at the rock the constable and I will go in."Fine, except that I propose to go in myself
with you."There's really no use, you know, Doctor.The constable and I can handle
him."Moira stood looking eagerly from one to the other."All right," said the doctor, "'nuff said.If you
want to come along, suit yourself.""Oh, do be careful," said Moira, clasping her hands.Not much fear
in you, I guess.""Moira, you stay here and keep your eye
on him.She pressed her lips tight together till they made a thin red line in
her white face."Oh, she can shoot--rabbits, at least," said her brother with a smile."I shall bring you one, Moira, but remember, handle it carefully."With a gun across her knees Moira sat and watched the development of the
attack.For many minutes there was no sign or sound, till she began to
wonder if a change had been made in the plan.At length some distance
down the canyon and on the other side Sergeant Crisp was seen working
his way with painful care step by step toward the rock of rendezvous.There was no sign of her brother or Dr.It was for them she
watched with an intensity of anxiety which she could not explain to
herself.At length Sergeant Crisp reached the crag against whose base
the penthouse leaned in which the sleeping Indian lay.Immediately she
saw her brother, quickly followed by Dr.Martin, leap the little stream,
run lightly up the sloping rock and join Crisp at the crag.Still there
was no sign from the Indian.She saw her brother motion the Sergeant
round to the farther corner of the penthouse where it ran into the
spruce tree, while he himself, with a revolver in each hand, dropped on
one knee and peered under the leaning poles.With a loud exclamation he
sprang to his feet.Like a hound on a scent
he ran to the back of the spruce tree and on his knees examined the
earth there.Sandra travelled to the bedroom.He struck the
trail and followed it round the rock and through the woods till he
came to the hard beaten track.Then he came back, pale with rage and
disappointment."I swear he never came out of that hole!""I kept my
eye on it every minute of the last three hours.""There's another hole," said Crisp, "under the tree here."Together they
retraced their steps across the little stream.On the farther bank they
found Moira, who had raced down to meet them."Gone for this time--but--some day--some
day," he added below his breath.But many things were to happen before that day came.CHAPTER X

RAVEN TO THE RESCUE


Overhead the stars were still twinkling far in the western sky.The crescent moon still shone serene, marshaling her attendant
constellations.Eastward the prairie still lay in deep shadow, its long
rolls outlined by the deeper shadows lying in the hollows between.Over
the Bow and the Elbow mists hung like white veils swathing the faces
of the rampart hills north and south.In the little town a stillness
reigned as of death, for at length Calgary was asleep, and sound asleep
would remain for hours to come.Through the dead stillness of the waning night
the liquid note of the adventurous meadow lark fell like the dropping
of a silver stream into the pool below.Brave little heart, roused from
slumber perchance by domestic care, perchance by the first burdening
presage of the long fall flight waiting her sturdy careless brood,
perchance stirred by the first thrill of the Event approaching from
the east.For already in the east the long round tops of the prairie
undulations are shining gray above the dark hollows and faint bars of
light are shooting to the zenith, fearless forerunners of the dawn,
menacing the retreating stars still bravely shining their pale defiance
to the oncoming of their ancient foe.Far toward the west dark masses
still lie invincible upon the horizon, but high above in the clear
heavens white shapes, indefinite and unattached, show where stand the
snow-capped mountain peaks.Thus the swift and silent moments mark the
fortunes of this age-long conflict.But sudden all heaven and all earth
thrill tremulous in eager expectancy of the daily miracle when, all
unaware, the gray light in the eastern horizon over the roll of the
prairie has grown to silver, and through the silver a streamer of palest
rose has flashed up into the sky, the gay and gallant 'avant courier' of
an advancing host, then another and another, then by tens and hundreds,
till, radiating from a center yet unseen, ten thousand times ten
thousand flaming flaunting banners flash into orderly array and possess
the utmost limits of the heavens, sweeping before them the ever paling
stars, that indomitable rearguard of the flying night, proclaiming
to all heaven and all earth the King is come, the Monarch of the Day.Flushed in the new radiance of the morning, the long flowing waves of
the prairie, the tumbling hills, the mighty rocky peaks stand surprised,
as if caught all unprepared by the swift advance, trembling and blushing
in the presence of the triumphant King, waiting the royal proclamation
that it is time to wake and work, for the day is come.All oblivious of this wondrous miracle stands Billy, his powers of mind
and body concentrated upon a single task, that namely of holding down
to earth the game little bronchos, Mustard and Pepper, till the party
should appear.Nearby another broncho, saddled and with the knotted
reins hanging down from his bridle, stood viewing with all too obvious
contempt the youthful frolics of the colts.Well he knew that life would
cure them of all this foolish waste of spirit and of energy.Meantime
on his part he was content to wait till his master--Dr.Martin, to
wit--should give the order to move.His master meantime was busily
engaged with clever sinewy fingers packing in the last parcels that
represented the shopping activities of Cameron and his wife during the
past two days.There was a whole living and sleeping outfit for the
family to gather together.Already a heavily laden wagon had gone on
before them.The building material for the new house was to follow,
for it was near the end of September and a tent dwelling, while quite
endurable, does not lend itself to comfort through a late fall in the
foothill country.Besides, there was upon Cameron, and still more upon
his wife, the ever deepening sense of a duty to be done that could not
wait, and for the doing of that duty due preparation must be made.Hence
the new house must be built and its simple appointments and furnishings
set in order without delay, and hence the laden wagon gone before and
the numerous packages in the democrat, covered with a new tent and roped
securely into place.This packing and roping the doctor made his peculiar care, for he was
a true Canadian, born and bred in the atmosphere of pioneer days in
old Ontario, and the packing and roping could be trusted to no amateur
hands, for there were hills to go up and hills to go down, sleughs to
cross and rivers to ford with all their perilous contingencies before
they should arrive at the place where they would be.said Cameron, coming out from the hotel with hand
bags and valises."They'll stay, I think," replied the doctor, "unless those bronchos of
yours get away from you."cried Moira, coming out at the moment and
dancing over to the bronchos' heads."Well, miss," said Billy with judicial care, "I don't know about that.They're ornery little cusses and mean-actin.'They'll go straight enough
if everything is all right, but let anythin' go wrong, a trace or a
line, and they'll put it to you good and hard.""I do not think I would be afraid of them," replied the girl, reaching
out her hand to stroke Pepper's nose, a movement which surprised that
broncho so completely that he flew back violently upon the whiffle-tree,
carrying Billy with him.said Billy, giving him a fierce yank."Oh, he ain't no lady's maid, miss.You would, eh, you young
devil,"--this to Pepper, whose intention to walk over Billy was only
too obvious--"Get back there, will you!Now then, take that, and stand
still!"Billy evidently did not rely solely upon the law of love in
handling his broncho.Moira abandoned him and climbed to her place in the democrat between
Cameron and his wife.Martin had learned that
a patient of his at Big River was in urgent need of a call, so, to the
open delight of the others and to the subdued delight of the doctor, he
was to ride with them thus far on their journey."Good-by, Billy," cried both ladies, to which Billy replied with a wave
of his Stetson.Away plunged the bronchos on a dead gallop, as if determined to end the
journey during the next half hour at most, and away with them went the
doctor upon his steady broncho, the latter much annoyed at being thus
ignominiously outdistanced by these silly colts and so induced to strike
a somewhat more rapid pace than he considered wise at the beginning of
an all-day journey.Away down the street between the silent shacks and
stores and out among the straggling residences that lined the trail.Away past the Indian encampment and the Police Barracks.Away across the
echoing bridge, whose planks resounded like the rattle of rifles
under the flying hoofs.Away up the long stony hill, scrambling and
scrabbling, but never ceasing till they reached the level prairie at the
top.Away upon the smooth resilient trail winding like a black ribbon
over the green bed of the prairie.Away down long, long <DW72>s to low,
wide valleys, and up long, long <DW72>s to the next higher prairie level.Away across the plain skirting sleughs where ducks of various kinds, and
in hundreds, quacked and plunged and fought joyously and all unheeding.Away with the morning air, rare and wondrously exhilarating, rushing
at them and past them and filling their hearts with the keen zest of
living.Away beyond sight and sound of the great world, past little
shacks, the brave vanguard of civilization, whose solitary loneliness
only served to emphasize their remoteness from the civilization which
they heralded.Away from the haunts of men and through the haunts
of wild things where the shy coyote, his head thrown back over his
shoulder, loped laughing at them and their futile noisy speed.Away
through the wide rich pasture lands where feeding herds of cattle
and bands of horses made up the wealth of the solitary rancher, whose
low-built wandering ranch house proclaimed at once his faith and his
courage.Away and ever away, the shining morning hours and the fleeting
miles racing with them, till by noon-day, all wet but still unweary, the
bronchos drew up at the Big River Stopping Place, forty miles from the
point of their departure.Martin, the steady pace of his wise
old broncho making up upon the dashing but somewhat erratic gait of the
colts.While the ladies passed into the primitive Stopping Place, the men
unhitched the ponies, stripped off their harness and proceeded to rub
them down from head to heel, wash out their mouths and remove from them
as far as they could by these attentions the travel marks of the last
six hours.Big River could hardly be called even by the generous estimate of the
optimistic westerner a town.It consisted of a blacksmith's shop, with
which was combined the Post Office, a little school, which did for
church--the farthest outpost of civilization--and a manse, simple, neat
and tiny, but with a wondrous air of comfort about it, and very like the
little Nova Scotian woman inside, who made it a very vestibule of heaven
for many a cowboy and rancher in the district, and last, the Stopping
Place run by a man who had won the distinction of being well known to
the Mounted Police and who bore the suggestive name of Hell Gleeson,
which appeared, however, in the old English Registry as Hellmuth Raymond
Gleeson.The Mounted Police thought it worth while often to run in upon
Hell at unexpected times, and more than once they had found it necessary
to invite him to contribute to Her Majesty's revenue as compensation for
Hell's objectionable habit of having in possession and of retailing to
his friends bad whisky without attending to the little formality of a
permit.The Stopping Place was a rambling shack, or rather a series of shacks,
loosely joined together, whose ramifications were found by Hell and his
friends to be useful in an emergency.The largest room in the building
was the bar, as it was called.Behind the counter, however, instead of
the array of bottles and glasses usually found in rooms bearing this
name, the shelf was filled with patent medicines, chiefly various
brands of pain-killer.Off the bar was the dining-room, and behind the
dining-room another and smaller room, while the room most retired in the
collection of shacks constituting the Stopping Place was known in
the neighborhood as the "snake room," a room devoted to those unhappy
wretches who, under the influence of prolonged indulgence in Hell's bad
whisky, were reduced to such a mental and nervous condition that the
landscape of their dreams became alive with snakes of various sizes,
shapes and hues.To Mandy familiarity had hardened her sensibilities to endurance of all
the grimy uncleanness of the place, but to Moira the appearance of
the house and especially of the dining-room filled her with loathing
unspeakable."Oh, Mandy," she groaned, "can we not eat outside somewhere?"No," she cried, "but we will do better."Oh, that would not do," said Moira, her Scotch shy independence
shrinking from such an intrusion."She doesn't know me--and there are four of us.""Oh, nonsense, you don't know this country.You don't know what our
visit will mean to the little woman, what a joy it will be to her to see
a new face, and I declare when she hears you are new out from Scotland
she will simply revel in you.We are about to confer a great favor upon
Mrs.If Moira had any lingering doubts as to the soundness of her
sister-in-law's opinion they vanished before the welcome she had from
the minister's wife.she cried, with both hands extended, "and just
out from Scotland?And our folk came
from near Inverness.Mhail Gaelic heaibh?"And on they went for some minutes in what Mrs.Macintyre called "the
dear old speech," till Mrs.Macintyre, remembering herself, said to
Mandy:

"But you do not understand the Gaelic?And to think that in this far land I should find a young lady like this
to speak it to me!Do you know, I am forgetting it out here."All the
while she was speaking she was laying the cloth and setting the table."And you have come all the way from Calgary this morning?Would you lie down upon the
bed for an hour?Then come away in to the bedroom and fresh yourselves
up a bit."We are a big party," said Mandy, "for your wee house.We have a friend
with us--Dr.Indeed I know him well, and a fine man he is and that kind
and clever."Let me go for them," said Mandy."But are you quite sure," asked Mandy, "you can--you have everything
handy?Macintyre, I know just how hard it is to keep a
stock of everything on hand.""Well, we have bread and molasses--our butter is run out, it is hard to
get--and some bacon and potatoes and tea.And we have some things with us, if you don't
mind."The clean linen, the shining dishes,
the silver--for Mrs.Macintyre brought out her wedding presents--gave
the table a brilliantly festive appearance in the eyes of those who had
lived for some years in the western country."You don't appreciate the true significance of a table napkin, I venture
to say, Miss Cameron," said the doctor, "until you have lived a year in
this country at least, or how much an unspotted table cloth means, or
shining cutlery and crockery.""Well, I have been two days at the Royal Hotel, whatever," replied
Moira."Our most palatial
Western hostelry--all the comforts and conveniences of civilization!""Anyway, I like this better," said Moira."You have paid me a very fine tribute."The hour lengthened into two, for when a departure was suggested the
doctor grew eloquent in urging delay.The horses would be all the better
for the rest.They could easily
make the Black Dog Ford before dark.After that the trail was good for
twenty miles, where they would camp.But like all happy hours these
hours fled past, and all too swiftly, and soon the travelers were ready
to depart.Before the Stopping Place door Hell was holding down the bronchos, while
Cameron was packing in the valises and making all secure again.Near the
wagon stood the doctor waiting their departure."You are going back from here, Dr."Yes," said the doctor, "I am going back.""It has been good to see you," she said."I hope next time you will know
me.""Ah, now, Miss Cameron, don't rub it in.My picture of the girl I had
seen in the Highlands that day never changed and never will change."The
doctor's keen gray eyes burned into hers for a moment.A slight flush
came to her cheek and she found herself embarrassed for want of words.Her embarrassment was relieved by the sound of hoofs pounding down the
trail.said the doctor, as they stood watching the
horseman approaching at a rapid pace and accompanied by a cloud of dust.Nearer and nearer he came, still on the gallop till within a few yards
of the group."Whoever he is he will run us down!"and she sprang
into her place in the democrat.Without slackening rein the rider came up to the Stopping Place door
at a full gallop, then at a single word his horse planted his four feet
solidly on the trail, and, plowing up the dirt, came to a standstill;
then, throwing up his magnificent head, he gave a loud snort and stood,
a perfect picture of equine beauty."I do not," said the doctor, conscious of a feeling of hostility to
the stranger, and all the more because he was forced to acknowledge to
himself that the rider and his horse made a very striking picture.The
man was tall and sinewy, with dark, clean-cut face, thin lips, firm chin
and deep-set, brown-gray eyes that glittered like steel, and with that
unmistakable something in his bearing that suggested the breeding of a
gentleman.His coal black
skin shone like silk, his flat legs, sloping hips, well-ribbed barrel,
small head, large, flashing eyes, all proclaimed his high breeding.breathed Moira again to the doctor.As if in answer to her praise the stranger, raising his Stetson, swept
her an elaborate bow, and, touching his horse, moved nearer to the door
of the Stopping Place and swung himself to the ground."Ah, Cameron, it's you, sure enough.But he made no motion to offer his hand nor did he introduce him
to the company.Martin started and swept
his keen eyes over the stranger's face.inquired the stranger whom Cameron had saluted as Raven."Fit
as ever," a hard smile curling his lips as he noted Cameron's omission.he continued, his eyes falling upon that individual, who
was struggling with the restive ponies, "how goes it with your noble
self?"Hastily Hell, leaving the bronchos for the moment, responded, "Hello,
Mr.Meantime the bronchos, freed from Hell's supervision, and apparently
interested in the strange horse who was viewing them with lordly
disdain, turned their heads and took the liberty of sniffing at the
newcomer.Instantly, with mouth wide open and ears flat on his head, the
black horse rushed at the bronchos.With a single bound they were off,
the lines trailing in the dust.Together Hell, Cameron and the doctor
sprang for the wagon, but before they could touch it it was whisked from
underneath their fingers as the bronchos dashed in a mad gallop down the
trail, Moira meantime clinging desperately to the seat of the pitching
wagon.After them darted Cameron and for some moments it seemed as if
he could overtake the flying ponies, but gradually they drew away and he
gave up the chase.After him followed the whole company, his wife, the
doctor, Hell, all in a blind horror of helplessness.cried Cameron, his breath coming in sobbing gasps.Sandra went to the hallway.Hardly were the words out of his mouth when Raven came up at an easy
canter."Don't worry," he said quietly to Mandy, who was wringing her hands in
despair, "I'll get them."Like a swallow for swiftness and for grace, the black stallion sped
away, flattening his body to the trail as he gathered speed.The
bronchos had a hundred yards of a start, but they had not run another
hundred until the agonized group of watchers could see that the stallion
was gaining rapidly upon them."He'll get 'em," cried Hell, "he'll get 'em, by gum!""But can he turn them from the bank?""If anything in horse-flesh or man-flesh can do it," said Hell, "it'll
be done."But a tail-race is a long race and a hundred yards' start is a serious
handicap in a quarter of a mile.Down the sloping trail the bronchos
were running savagely, their noses close to earth, their feet on the
hard ground like the roar of a kettledrum, their harness and trappings
fluttering over their backs, the wagon pitching like a ship in a gale,
the girl clinging to its high seat as a sailor to a swaying mast.Behind, and swiftly drawing level with the flying bronchos, sped the
black horse, still with that smooth grace of a skimming swallow and
with such ease of motion as made it seem as if he could readily have
increased his speed had he so chosen.Martin, his
stark face and staring eyes proclaiming his agony.The agonized watchers saw the rider lean far over the bronchos and seize
one line, then gradually begin to turn the flying ponies away from the
cut bank and steer them in a wide circle across the prairie.cried the doctor brokenly, wiping
the sweat from his face."Let us go to head them off," said Cameron, setting off at a run,
leaving the doctor and his wife to follow.As they watched with staring eyes the racing horses they saw Raven bring
back the line to the girl clinging to the wagon seat, then the black
stallion, shooting in front of the ponies, began to slow down upon them,
hampering their running till they were brought to an easy canter, and,
under the more active discipline of teeth and hoofs, were forced to a
trot and finally brought to a standstill, and so held till Cameron and
the doctor came up to them."Raven," gasped Cameron, fighting for his breath and coming forward with
hand outstretched, "you have--done--a great thing--to-day--for me."Tut tut, Cameron, simple thing.I fancy you are still a few points
ahead," said Raven, taking his hand in a strong grip."After all, it was
Night Hawk did it.""You saved--my sister's life," continued Cameron, still struggling for
breath."Perhaps, perhaps, but I don't forget," and here Raven leaned over his
saddle and spoke in a lower voice, "I don't forget the day you saved
mine, my boy.""Come," said Cameron, "let me present you to my sister."he commanded, and the horse stood like a soldier on
guard."Moira," said Cameron, still panting hard, "this is--my friend--Mr.Raven stood bowing before her with his hat in his hand, but the girl
leaned far down from her seat with both hands outstretched.Raven," she said in a quiet voice, but her brown eyes
were shining like stars in her white face."I could not have done it, Miss Cameron," said Raven, a wonderfully
sweet smile lighting up his hard face, "I could not have done it had you
ever lost your nerve.""I had no fear after I saw your face," said the girl simply."Ah, and how did you know that?"His gray-brown eyes searched her face
more keenly.Martin," said Cameron as the doctor
came up."I--too--want to thank you--Mr.Raven," said the doctor, seizing him
with both hands."I never can--we never can forget it--or repay you.""Oh," said Raven, with a careless laugh, "what else could I do?After
all it was Night Hawk did the trick."He lifted his hat again to Moira,
bowed with a beautiful grace, threw himself on his horse and stood till
the two men, after carefully examining the harness and securing the
reins, had climbed to their places on the wagon seat.Then he trotted on before toward the Stopping Place, where the
minister's wife and indeed the whole company of villagers awaited them.cried Moira, with her eyes upon the rider in
front of them."Yes--he is--he is a chap I met when I was on the Force.""No, no," replied her brother hastily.Ah--yes, yes, he is a rancher I fancy.That is--I have seen little of him--in fact--only a couple of times--or
so.""He seems to know you, Allan," said his sister a little reproachfully."Anyway," she continued with a deep breath, "he is just splendid."Martin glanced at her face glowing with enthusiasm and was shamefully
conscious of a jealous pang at his heart."He is just splendid,"
continued Moira, with growing enthusiasm, "and I mean to know more of
him."said her brother sharply, as if waking from a dream.You do not know what you are talking about."Oh, never mind just now, Moira.In this country we don't take up with
strangers."echoed the girl, pain mingling with her surprise."Yes, thank God, he saved your life," cried her brother, "and we shall
never cease to be grateful to him, but--but--oh, drop it just now
please, Moira.You don't know and--here we are.To this neither made reply, but there came a day when both doubted such
a possibility.CHAPTER XI

SMITH'S WORK


The short September day was nearly gone.The sun still rode above the
great peaks that outlined the western horizon.Already the shadows were
beginning to creep up the eastern <DW72> of the hills that clambered till
they reached the bases of the great mountains.A purple haze hung over
mountain, hill and rolling plain, softening the sharp outlines that
ordinarily defined the features of the foothill landscape.With the approach of evening the fierce sun heat had ceased and a
fresh cooling western breeze from the mountain passes brought welcome
refreshment alike to the travelers and their beasts, wearied with their
three days' drive."That is the last hill, Moira," cried her sister-in-law, pointing to a
long <DW72> before them.From the top
we can see our home.There is no home
there, only a black spot on the prairie."Her husband grunted savagely and cut sharply at the bronchos."But the tent will be fine, Mandy.I just long for the experience," said
Moira."Yes, but just think of all my pretty things, and some of Allan's too,
all gone."No--no--you remember, Allan, young--what's his
name?--that young Highlander at the Fort wanted them.""Sure enough--Macgregor," said her husband in a tone of immense relief."My, but that is fine, Allan," said his sister."I should have grieved
if we could not hear the pipes again among these hills.Oh, it is all so
bonny; just look at the big Bens yonder."It was, as she said, all bonny.Far toward their left the low hills
rolled in soft swelling waves toward the level prairie, and far away to
the right the hills climbed by sharper ascents, flecked here and
there with dark patches of fir, and broken with jutting ledges of gray
limestone, climbed till they reached the great Rockies, majestic in
their massive serried ranges that pierced the western sky.And all that
lay between, the hills, the hollows, the rolling prairie, was bathed
in a multitudinous riot of color that made a scene of loveliness beyond
power of speech to describe."Oh, Allan, Allan," cried his sister, "I never thought to see anything
as lovely as the Cuagh Oir, but this is up to it I do believe.""It must indeed be lovely, then," said her brother with a smile, "if
you can say that."Here we are, just at the top," cried Mandy."In a minute beyond the
shoulder there we shall see the Big Horn Valley and the place where our
home used to be.Exclamations of amazement burst from Cameron
and his wife."It is the trail all right," said her husband in a low voice, "but what
in thunder does this mean?""It is a house, Allan, a new house.""It looks like it--but--"

"And there are people all about!"For some breathless moments they gazed upon the scene.A wide valley,
flanked by hills and threaded by a gleaming river, lay before them and
in a bend of the river against the gold and yellow of a poplar bluff
stood a log house of comfortable size gleaming in all its newness fresh
from the ax and saw.The bronchos seemed to catch her excitement, their weariness
disappeared, and, pulling hard on the bit, they tore down the winding
trail as if at the beginning rather than at the end of their hundred and
fifty mile drive.Where in the world can they have come from?""There's the Inspector, anyway," said Cameron."He is at the bottom of
this, I'll bet you."Dent, and, oh, there's my friend Smith!You
remember he helped me put out the fire."Soon they were at the gate of the corral where a group of men and women
stood awaiting them.Inspector Dickson was first:

"Hello, Cameron!Cameron," he said as
he helped her to alight.Smith stood at the bronchos' heads."Now, Inspector," said Cameron, holding him by hand and collar, "now
what does this business mean?"After all had been presented to his sister Cameron pursued his question.Cochrane, tell me," cried Mandy, "who began this?""Don't rightly know how the thing started.First thing I knowed they was
all at it.""See here, Thatcher, you might as well own up.Where did the logs come from, for instance?"Guess Bracken knows," replied Cochrane, turning to a tall, lanky
rancher who was standing at a little distance."Bracken," cried Cameron, striding to him with hand outstretched, "what
about the logs for the house?Smith was sayin' somethin' about a bee and gettin' green
logs."cried Cameron, glancing at that individual now busy unhitching
the bronchos."And of course," continued Bracken, "green logs ain't any use for a real
good house, so--and then--well, I happened to have a bunch of logs up
the Big Horn.Cameron, and inspect your house," cried a stout,
red-faced matron."I said they ought to await your coming to get your
plans, but Mr.Smith said he knew a little about building and that they
might as well go on with it.It was getting late in the season, and so
they went at it.Come away, we're having a great time over it.Indeed, I
think we've enjoyed it more than ever you will.""But you haven't told us yet who started it," cried Mandy."Well, the lumber," replied Cochrane, "came from the Fort, I guess."We had no immediate use for it, and Smith
told us just how much it would take."But Smith was already
leading the bronchos away to the stable."Yes," continued the Inspector, "and Smith was wondering how a notice
could be sent up to the Spruce Creek boys and to Loon Lake, so I sent a
man with the word and they brought down the lumber without any trouble.But," continued the Inspector, "come along, Cameron, let us follow the
ladies.""But this is growing more and more mysterious," protested Cameron."Can
no one tell me how the thing originated?The sash and doors now, where
did they come from?""Oh, that's easy," said Cochrane."I was at the Post Office, and,
hearin' Smith talkin' 'bout this raisin' bee and how they were stuck for
sash and door, so seein' I wasn't goin' to build this fall I told him he
might as well have the use of these.My team was laid up and Smith got
Jim Bracken to haul 'em down.""Well, this gets me," said Cameron."It appears no one started this
thing.Now the shingles, I suppose they just
tumbled up into their place there."Didn't know there
were any in the country.""Oh, they just got up into place there of themselves I have no doubt,"
said Cameron.Funny thing, don't-che-naow,"
chimed in a young fellow attired in rather emphasized cow-boy style,
"funny thing!A Johnnie--quite a strangah to me, don't-che-naow, was
riding pawst my place lawst week and mentioned about this--ah--raisin'
bee he called it I think, and in fact abaout the blawsted Indian, and
the fire, don't-che-naow, and all the rest of it, and how the chaps were
all chipping in as he said, logs and lumbah and so fowth.And then, bay
Jove, he happened to mention that they were rathah stumped for shingles,
don't-che-naow, and, funny thing, there chawnced to be behind my
stable a few bunches, and I was awfully glad to tu'n them ovah, and
this--eh--pehson--most extraordinary chap I assuah you--got 'em down
somehow.""Don't naow him in the least.But it's the chap that seems to be bossing
the job.""Oh, that's Smith," said Cochrane.He
was good enough to help my wife to beat back the fire.I don't believe I
even spoke to him."Yes, but--"

"Come away, Mr.Cochrane from the door of the new
house."Come away in and look at the result of our bee.""This beats me," said Cameron, obeying the invitation, "but, say,
Dickson, it is mighty good of all these men.I have no claim--"

"Claim?"We must stand
together in this country, and especially these days, eh, Inspector?Cochrane," he added in a low voice, "it is
very necessary that as little as possible should be said about these
things just now."All right, Inspector, I understand, but--"

"What do you think of your new house, Mr.Now what do you think of this for three days' work?""Oh, Allan, I have been all through it and it's perfectly wonderful,"
said his wife.Cameron," said Cochrane, "but it will
do for a while.""Perfectly wonderful in its whole plan, and beautifully complete,"
insisted Mandy."See, a living-room, a lovely large one, two bedrooms
off it, and, look here, cupboards and closets, and a pantry, and--" here
she opened the door in the corner--"a perfectly lovely up-stairs!Not to
speak of the cook-house out at the back.""Wonderful is the word," said Cameron, "for why in all the world should
these people--?""And look, Allan, at Moira!She's just lost in rapture over that
fireplace.""And I don't wonder," said her husband.he continued, moving toward Moira's side, who was standing
before a large fireplace of beautiful masonry set in between the two
doors that led to the bedrooms at the far end of the living-room."It was Andy Hepburn from Loon Lake that built it," said Mr."I wish I could thank him," said Moira fervently."Well, there he is outside the window, Miss Moira," said a young fellow
who was supposed to be busy putting up a molding round the wainscoting,
but who was in reality devoting himself to the young lady at the present
moment with open admiration."Here, Andy," he cried through the window,
"you're wanted.A hairy little man, with a face dour and unmistakably Scotch, came in.he asked, with a deliberate sort of gruffness."It's yourself, Andy, me boy," said young Dent, who, though Canadian
born, needed no announcement of his Irish ancestry."It is yourself,
Andy, and this young lady, Miss Moira Cameron--Mr.Hepburn--" Andy made
reluctant acknowledgment of her smile and bow--"wants to thank you for
this fireplace."Hepburn, and very thankful I am to you
for building it.""Aw, it's no that bad," admitted Andy."Aye did I. But no o' ma ain wull.A fireplace is a feckless thing in
this country an' I think little o't."He juist keepit dingin' awa' till A promised
if he got the lime--A kent o' nane in the country--A wud build the
thing.""And he got the lime, eh, Andy?""Aye, he got it," said Andy sourly."But I am sure you did it beautifully, Mr.Hepburn," said Moira, moving
closer to him, "and it will be making me think of home."Her soft
Highland accent and the quaint Highland phrasing seemed to reach a soft
spot in the little Scot.he inquired, manifesting a grudging interest.Where but in the best of all lands, in Scotland," said Moira."Aye, an' did ye say, lassie!"said Andy, with a faint accession of
interest."It's a bonny country ye've left behind, and far enough frae
here.""Far indeed," said Moira, letting her shining brown eyes rest upon his
face.But when the fire burns yonder,"
she added, pointing to the fireplace, "I will be seeing the hills and
the glens and the moors.""'Deed, then, lassie," said Andy in a low hurried voice, moving toward
the door, "A'm gled that Smith buddie gar't me build it."Hepburn," said Moira, shyly holding out her hand, "don't you
think that Scotties in this far land should be friends?""An' prood I'd be, Miss Cameron," replied Andy, and, seizing her hand,
he gave it a violent shake, flung it from him and fled through the door."He's a cure, now, isn't he!""I think he is fine," said Moira with enthusiasm."It takes a Scot to
understand a Scot, you see, and I am glad I know him.Do you know, he
is a little like the fireplace himself," she said, "rugged, a wee bit
rough, but fine."Meanwhile the work of inspecting the new house was going on.Everywhere
appeared fresh cause for delighted wonder, but still the origin of the
raising bee remained a mystery.Balked by the men, Cameron turned in his search to the women and
proceeded to the tent where preparations were being made for the supper.Cochrane, her broad good-natured face
beaming with health and good humor, "what difference does it make?Your neighbors are only too glad of a chance to show their goodwill for
yourself, and more for your wife.""I am sure you are right there," said Cameron."And it is the way of the country.It's your turn to-day, it may be ours to-morrow and that's all there
is to it.So clear out of this tent and make yourself busy.By the way,
where's the pipes?The folk will soon be asking for a tune.""Where's the pipes, I'm saying.John," she cried, lifting her voice, to
her husband, who was standing at the other side of the house.They're not burned, I hope," she continued, turning to
Cameron."The whole settlement would feel that a loss."Young Macgregor at the Fort has them."John, find out from the Inspector
yonder where the pipes are.To her husband's inquiry the Inspector replied that if Macgregor ever
had the pipes it was a moral certainty that he had carried them with him
to the raising, "for it is my firm belief," he added, "that he sleeps
with them.""Do go and see now, like a dear man," said Mrs.From group to group of the workers Cameron went, exchanging greetings,
but persistently seeking to discover the originator of the raising
bee.But all in vain, and in despair he came back to his wife with the
question "Who is this Smith, anyway?"Smith," she said with deliberate emphasis, "is my friend, my
particular friend.I found him a friend when I needed one badly."inquired Moira, who, with Mr.Dent in attendance,
had sauntered up."No, not from Adam's mule.A
subtle note of disappointment sounded in her voice.There is no such thing as servant west of the Great Lakes in this
country.A man may help me with my work for a consideration, but he is
no servant of mine as you understand the term, for he considers himself
just as good as I am and he may be considerably better.""Oh, Allan," protested his sister with flushing face, "I know.I know
all that, but you know what I mean.""Yes, I know perfectly," said her brother, "for I had the same notion.For instance, for six months I was a'servant' in Mandy's home, eh,
Mandy?""You were our hired man and just
like the rest of us.""Do you get that distinction, Moira?There is no such thing as servant
in this country," continued Cameron."We are all the same socially and
stand to help each other."Yes, fine," cried Moira, "but--" and she paused, her face still
flushed."Well, then,
Miss Cameron, between you and me we don't ask that question in this
country.Smith is Smith and Jones is Jones and that's the first and last
of it.But now the last row of shingles was in place, the last door hung, the
last door-knob set.The whole house stood complete, inside and out, top
and bottom, when a tattoo beat upon a dish pan gave the summons to the
supper table.The table was spread in all its luxurious variety and
abundance beneath the poplar trees.There the people gathered all upon
the basis of pure democratic equality, "Duke's son and cook's son," each
estimated at such worth as could be demonstrated was in him.Fictitious
standards of values were ignored.Every man was given his fair
opportunity to show his stuff and according to his showing was his place
in the community.A generous good fellowship and friendly good-will
toward the new-comer pervaded the company, but with all this a kind of
reserve marked the intercourse of these men with each other.Men were
taken on trial at face value and no questions asked.This evening, however, the dominant note was one of generous and
enthusiastic sympathy with the young rancher and his wife, who had come
so lately among them and who had been made the unfortunate victim of
a sinister and threatening foe, hitherto, it is true, regarded with
indifference or with friendly pity but lately assuming an ominous
importance.There was underneath the gay hilarity of the gathering an
undertone of apprehension until the Inspector made his speech.It was
short and went straight at the mark.It would be idle to ignore that there were ugly rumors flying.There was
need for watchfulness, but there was no need for alarm.The Police Force
was charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives and property
of the people.They assumed to the full this responsibility, though they
were very short-handed at present, but if they ever felt they needed
assistance they knew they could rely upon the steady courage of the men
of the district such as he saw before him.There was need of no further words and the Inspector's speech passed
with no response.It was not after the manner of these men to make
demonstration either of their loyalty or of their courage.Cameron's speech at the last came haltingly.On the one hand his
Highland pride made it difficult for him to accept gifts from any source
whatever.On the other hand his Highland courtesy forbade his giving
offense to those who were at once his hosts and his guests, but none
suspected the reason for the halting in his speech.As Western men they
rather approved than otherwise the hesitation and reserve that marked
his words.Before they rose from the supper table, however, there were calls for
Mrs.Cameron, calls so insistent and clamorous that, overcoming her
embarrassment, she made reply."We have not yet found out who was
responsible for the originating of this great kindness.We forgive him, for otherwise my husband and I would never have come to
know how rich we are in true friends and kind neighbors, and now that
you have built this house let me say that henceforth by day or by night
you are welcome to it, for it is yours."After the storm of applause had died down, a voice was heard gruffly and
somewhat anxiously protesting, "But not all at one time."asked Mandy of young Dent as the supper party broke up."That's Smith," said Dent, "and he's a queer one."But there was a universal and insistent demand for "the pipes.""You look him up, Mandy," cried her husband as he departed in response
to the call."I shall find him, and all about him," said Mandy with determination.The next two hours were spent in dancing to Cameron's reels, in which
all, with more or less grace, took part till the piper declared he was
clean done."Let Macgregor have the pipes, Cameron," cried the Inspector."He is
longing for a chance, I am sure, and you give us the Highland Fling.""Come Moira," cried Cameron gaily, handing the pipes to Macgregor and,
taking his sister by the hand, he led her out into the intricacies of
the Highland Reel, while the sides of the living-room, the doors and
the windows, were thronged with admiring onlookers.Even Andy Hepburn's
rugged face lost something of its dourness; and as the brother and
sister together did that most famous of all the ancient dances of
Scotland, the Highland Fling, his face relaxed into a broad smile."There's Smith," said young Dent to Mandy in a low voice as the reel was
drawing to a close.Even in the dim light of the lanterns and candles hung here and there
upon the walls and stuck on the window sills, Smith's face, pale, stern,
sad, shone like a specter out of the darkness behind.Suddenly the reel came to an end and Cameron, taking the pipes from
young Macgregor, cried, "Now, Moira, we will give them our way of it,"
and, tuning the pipes anew, he played over once and again their own Glen
March, known only to the piper of the Cuagh Oir.Then with cunning
skill making atmosphere, he dropped into a wild and weird lament, Moira
standing the while like one seeing a vision.With a swift change the
pipes shrilled into the true Highland version of the ancient reel,
enriched with grace notes and variations all his own.For a few moments
the girl stood as if unwilling to yield herself to the invitation of the
pipes.Suddenly, as if moved by another spirit than her own, she stepped
into the circle and whirled away into the mazes of the ancient style of
the Highland Fling, such as is mastered by comparatively few even of the
Highland folk.With wonderful grace and supple strength she passed from
figure to figure and from step to step, responding to the wild mad music
as to a master spirit.In the midst of the dance Mandy made her way out of the house and round
to the window where Smith stood gazing in upon the dancer.She quietly
approached him from behind and for a few moments stood at his side.He
was breathing heavily like a man in pain.she said, touching him gently on the shoulder.He sprang from her touch as from a stab and darted back from the crowd
about the window.He stood a moment or two gazing at her with staring eyes and parted
lips, pain, grief and even rage distorting his pale face."It is wicked," at length he panted."It is just terrible wicked--a
young girl like that.""That--that girl--dancing like that.""I was brought
up a Methodist myself," she continued, "but that kind of dancing--why, I
love it."I am a Methodist--a preacher--but I could not
preach, so I quit.But that is of the world, the flesh, and the devil
and--and I have not the courage to denounce it.She is--God help
me--so--so wonderful--so wonderful."Smith," said Mandy, laying her hand upon his arm, and seeking
to sooth his passion, "surely this dancing is--"

Loud cheers and clapping of hands from the house interrupted her.The
man put his hands over his eyes as if to shut out a horrid vision,
shuddered violently, and with a weird sound broke from her touch and
fled into the bluff behind the house just as the party came streaming
from the house preparatory to departing.It seemed to Mandy as if she
had caught a glimpse of the inner chambers of a soul and had seen things
too sacred to be uttered.Among the last to leave were young Dent and the Inspector."We have found out the culprit," cried Dent, as he was saying
good-night."The fellow who has engineered this whole business.""Who got the logs from Bracken?Who
got the Inspector to send men through the settlement?Who got the
lumber out of the same Inspector?And the sash and doors out of
Cochrane?And wiggled the shingles out of Newsome?And euchred
old Scotty Hepburn into building the fireplace?And planned and bossed
the whole job?We have not thanked him,"
said Cameron."He is gone, I think," said Mandy.But I am sure we owe a great deal to you, Inspector
Dickson, to you, Mr.Dent, and indeed to all our friends," she added, as
she bade them good-night.For some moments they lingered in the moonlight."To think that this is Smith's work!"said Cameron, waving his hand
toward the house.One thing I have learned, never to
judge a man by his legs again.""He is a fine fellow," said Mandy indignantly, "and with a fine soul in
spite of--"

"His wobbly legs," said her husband smiling.What difference does it make what kind of legs a
man has?""Very true," replied her husband smiling, "and if you knew your Bible
better, Mandy, you would have found excellent authority for your
position in the words of the psalmist, 'The Lord taketh no pleasure in
the legs of a man.'But, say, it is a joke," he added, "to think of this
being Smith's work."CHAPTER XII

IN THE SUN DANCE CANYON


But they were not yet done with Smith, for as they turned to pass into
the house a series of shrill cries from the bluff behind pierced the
stillness of the night.Shaking off the clutching hands of his wife and sister, Cameron darted
into the bluff and found two figures frantically struggling upon the
ground.The moonlight trickling through the branches revealed the man
on top to be an Indian with a knife in his hand, but he was held in such
close embrace that he could not strike.cried Cameron, seizing the Indian by the wrist.The under man released his grip, allowed the Indian to rise and got
himself to his feet.said Cameron sharply, leading the Indian
out of the bluff, followed by the other, still panting."Now, then, what the deuce is all this row?"Well, this beats me," said her
husband.For some moments Cameron stood surveying the group, the Indian
silent and immobile as one of the poplar trees beside him, the ladies
with faces white, Smith disheveled in garb, pale and panting and
evidently under great excitement.Smith's pale face flushed a swift red, visible even in the moonlight,
then grew pale again, his excited panting ceased as he became quiet."I found this Indian in the bush here and I seized him.I thought--he
might--do something.""Yes--some mischief--to some of you."You found this Indian in the bluff here and you just jumped on
him?You might better have jumped on a wild cat.Are you used to this
sort of thing?And he would have in two
minutes more.""He might have killed--some of you," said Smith."Now what were you doing in the bluff?"he said sharply, turning to the
Indian."Chief Trotting Wolf," said the Indian in the low undertone common to
his people, "Chief Trotting Wolf want you' squaw--boy seeck bad--leg
beeg beeg.He turned to Mandy and repeated
"Come--queeek--queeek.""Too much mans--no
like--Indian wait all go 'way--dis man much beeg fight--no good.Come
queeek--boy go die.""Let us hurry, Allan," she said."You can't go to-night," he replied.She turned into the house, followed by her
husband, and began to rummage in her bag."Lucky thing I got these
supplies in town," she said, hastily putting together her nurse's
equipment and some simple remedies.Doctor want cut off leg--dis," his action was sufficiently
suggestive."Talk much--all day--all night.""He is evidently in a high fever," said Mandy to her husband.Now, my dear, you hurry and get the horses.""But what shall we do with Moira?""Why," cried Moira, "let me go with you.But this did not meet with Cameron's approval."I can stay here," suggested Smith hesitatingly, "or Miss Cameron can go
over with me to the Thatchers'.""We can drop her at the
Thatchers' as we pass."In half an hour Cameron returned with the horses and the party proceeded
on their way.At the Piegan Reserve they were met by Chief Trotting Wolf himself and,
without more than a single word of greeting, were led to the tent in
which the sick boy lay.Beside him sat the old squaw in a corner of the
tent, crooning a weird song as she swayed to and fro.The sick boy lay
on a couch of skins, his eyes shining with fever, his foot festering
and in a state of indescribable filth and his whole condition one of
unspeakable wretchedness.Cameron found his gorge rise at the sight of
the gangrenous ankle."This is a horrid business, Mandy," he exclaimed.But his wife, from the moment of her first sight of the wounded foot,
forgot all but her mission of help."We must have a clean tent, Allan," she said, "and plenty of hot water.Cameron turned to the Chief and said, "Hot water, quick!""Huh--good," replied the Chief, and in a few moments returned with a
small pail of luke-warm water."Oh," cried Mandy, "it must be hot and we must have lots of it.""Huh," grunted the Chief a second time with growing intelligence, and
in an incredibly short space returned with water sufficiently hot and in
sufficient quantity.All unconscious of the admiring eyes that followed the swift and skilled
movements of her capable hands, Mandy worked over the festering and
fevered wound till, cleansed, soothed, wrapped in a cooling lotion, the
limb rested easily upon a sling of birch bark and skins suggested and
prepared by the Chief.Then for the first time the boy made a sound."Huh," he grunted feebly.Me two
foot--live--one foot--" he held up one finger--"die."His eyes were
shining with something other than the fever that drove the blood racing
through his veins.As a dog's eyes follow every movement of his master
so the lad's eyes, eloquent with adoring gratitude, followed his nurse
as she moved about the wigwam."Now we must get that clean tent, Allan.""It will be no easy job, but we shall do
our best.Here, Chief," he cried, "get some of your young men to pitch
another tent in a clean place."The Chief, eager though he was to assist, hesitated.And so while the squaws were pitching a tent in a spot somewhat removed
from the encampment, Cameron poked about among the tents and wigwams of
which the Indian encampment consisted, but found for the most part
only squaws and children and old men.He came back to his wife greatly
disturbed."The young bucks are gone, Mandy.You ask for a messenger to be sent
to the fort for the doctor and medicine.I shall enclose a note to the
Inspector.We want the doctor here as soon as possible and we want Jerry
here at the earliest possible moment."With a great show of urgency a messenger was requisitioned and
dispatched, carrying a note from Cameron to the Commissioner requesting
the presence of the doctor with his medicine bag, but also requesting
that Jerry, the redoubtable half-breed interpreter and scout, with
a couple of constables, should accompany the doctor, the constables,
however, to wait outside the camp until summoned.During the hours that must elapse before any answer could be had from
the fort, Cameron prepared a couch in a corner of the sick boy's tent
for his wife, and, rolling himself in his blanket, he laid himself
down at the door outside where, wearied with the long day and its many
exciting events, he slept without turning, till shortly after daybreak
he was awakened by a chorus of yelping curs which heralded the arrival
of the doctor from the fort with the interpreter Jerry in attendance.After breakfast, prepared by Jerry with dispatch and skill, the product
of long experience, there was a thorough examination of the sick boy's
condition through the interpreter, upon the conclusion of which a long
consultation followed between the doctor, Cameron and Mandy.It was
finally decided that the doctor should remain with Mandy in the Indian
camp until a change should become apparent in the condition of the boy,
and that Cameron with the interpreter should pick up the two constables
and follow in the trail of the young Piegan braves.In order to allay
suspicion Cameron and his companion left the camp by the trail which led
toward the fort.For four miles or so they rode smartly until the trail
passed into a thick timber of spruce mixed with poplar.Here Cameron
paused, and, making a slight sign in the direction from which they had
come, he said:

"Drop back, Jerry, and see if any Indian is following.""Go slow one mile," and, slipping from his
pony, he handed the reins to Cameron and faded like a shadow into the
brushwood.For a mile Cameron rode, pausing now and then to listen for the sound of
anyone following, then drew rein and waited for his companion.After a
few minutes of eager listening he suddenly sat back in his saddle and
felt for his pipe."All right, Jerry," he said softly, "come out."Grinning somewhat shamefacedly Jerry parted a bunch of spruce boughs and
stood at Cameron's side."Good ears," he said, glancing up into Cameron's face."No, Jerry," replied Cameron, "I saw the blue-jay.""Huh," grunted Jerry, "dat fool bird tell everyt'ing.""Two Indian run tree mile--find notting--go back."Any news at the fort last two or three days?"Louis Riel
mak beeg spik--beeg noise--blood!Jerry's tone indicated the completeness of his contempt for the whole
proceedings at St."Well, there's something doing here," continued Cameron."Trotting
Wolf's young men have left the reserve and Trotting Wolf is very
anxious that we should not know it.I want you to go back, find out what
direction they have taken, how far ahead they are, how many.We camp
to-night at the Big Rock at the entrance to the Sun Dance Canyon."There's something doing, Jerry, or I am much mistaken."Me--here--t'ree day," tapping his rolled blanket
at the back of his saddle."Odder fellers--grub--Jakes--t'ree men--t'ree
day.Come Beeg Rock to-night--mebbe to-morrow."So saying, Jerry climbed
on to his pony and took the back trail, while Cameron went forward to
meet his men at the Swampy Creek Coulee.Making a somewhat wide detour to avoid the approaches to the Indian
encampment, Cameron and his two men rode for the Big Rock at the
entrance to the Sun Dance Canyon.They gave themselves no concern about
Trotting Wolf's band of young men.They knew well that what Jerry could
not discover would not be worth finding out.A year's close association
with Jerry had taught Cameron something of the marvelous powers of
observation, of the tenacity and courage possessed by the little
half-breed that made him the keenest scout in the North West Mounted
Police.At the Big Rock they arrived late in the afternoon and there waited
for Jerry's appearing; but night had fallen and had broken into morning
before the scout came into camp with a single word of report:

"Notting.""Eat something, Jerry, then we will talk," said Cameron.Jerry had already broken his fast, but was ready for more.After the
meal was finished he made his report.On leaving Cameron in the morning he had taken the most likely direction
to discover traces of the Piegan band, namely that suggested by Cameron,
and, fetching a wide circle, had ridden toward the mountains, but he
had come upon no sign.Then he had penetrated into the canyon and ridden
down toward the entrance, but still had found no trace.He had then
ridden backward toward the Piegan Reserve and, picking up a trail of one
or two ponies, had followed it till he found it broaden into that of a
considerable band making eastward.Then he knew he had found the trail
he wanted.The half-breed held up both hands three times."Blood Reserve t'ink--dunno.""There is no sense in them going to the Blood Reserve, Jerry," said
Cameron impatiently."The Bloods are a pack of thieves, we know, but our
people are keeping a close watch on them.""There is no big Indian camping ground on the Blood Reserve.You
wouldn't get the Blackfeet to go to any pow-wow there.""How far did you follow their trail, Jerry?"It seemed
unlikely that if the Piegan band were going to a rendezvous of Indians
they should select a district so closely under the inspection of the
Police.Furthermore there was no great prestige attaching to the Bloods
to make their reserve a place of meeting."Jerry," said Cameron at length, "I believe they are up this Sun Dance
Canyon somewhere.""I believe, Jerry, they doubled back and came in from the north end
after you had left.I feel sure they are up there now and we will go and
find them."Finally he took his pipe from
his mouth, pressed the tobacco hard down with his horny middle finger
and stuck it in his pocket."Mebbe so," he said slowly, a slight grin distorting his wizened little
face, "mebbe so, but t'ink not--me.""Well, Jerry, where could they have gone?They might ride straight
to Crowfoot's Reserve, but I think that is extremely unlikely.They
certainly would not go to the Bloods, therefore they must be up this
canyon.We will go up, Jerry, for ten miles or so and see what we can
see.""Good," said Jerry with a grunt, his tone conveying his conviction that
where the chief scout of the North West Mounted Police had said it was
useless to search, any other man searching would have nothing but his
folly for his pains.We need not start for a couple of hours."Jerry grunted his usual reply, rolled himself in his blanket and, lying
down at the back of a rock, was asleep in a minute's time.In two hours to the minute he stood beside his pony waiting for Cameron,
who had been explaining his plan to the two constables and giving them
his final orders.They were to wait where they were
till noon.If any of the band of Piegans appeared one of the men was
to ride up the canyon with the information, the other was to follow
the band till they camped and then ride back till he should meet his
comrades.They divided up the grub into two parts and Cameron and the
interpreter took their way up the canyon.The canyon consisted of a deep cleft across a series of ranges of hills
or low mountains.Through it ran a rough breakneck trail once used by
the Indians and trappers but now abandoned since the building of the
Canadian Pacific Railway through the Kicking Horse Pass and the opening
of the Government trail through the Crow's Nest.From this which had
once been the main trail other trails led westward into the Kootenays
and eastward into the Foothill country.At times the canyon widened into
a valley, rich in grazing and in streams of water, again it narrowed
into a gorge, deep and black, with rugged sides above which only the
blue sky was visible, and from which led cavernous passages that wound
into the heart of the mountains, some of them large enough to hold a
hundred men or more without crowding.These caverns had been and
still were found to be most convenient and useful for the purpose of
whisky-runners and of cattle-rustlers, affording safe hiding-places for
themselves and their spoil.With this trail and all its ramifications
Jerry was thoroughly familiar.The only other man in the Force who
knew it better than Jerry was Cameron himself.For many months he had
patroled the main trail and all its cross leaders, lived in its caves
and explored its caverns in pursuit of those interesting gentlemen whose
activities more than anything else had rendered necessary the existence
of the North West Mounted Police.In ancient times the caves along the
Sun Dance Trail had been used by the Indian Medicine-Men for their pagan
rites, and hence in the eyes of the Indians to these caves attached a
dreadful reverence that made them places to be avoided in recent years
by the various tribes now gathered on the reserves.But during these
last months of unrest it was suspected by the Police that the ancient
uses of these caves had been revived and that the rites long since
fallen into desuetude were once more being practised.For the first few miles of the canyon the trail offered good footing
and easy going, but as the gorge deepened and narrowed the difficulties
increased until riding became impossible, and only by the most strenuous
efforts on the part of both men and beasts could any advance be made.And so through the day and into the late evening they toiled on, ever
alert for sight or sound of the Piegan band."We must camp, Jerry," he said."We are making no time and we may spoil
things.I know a good camp-ground near by.""Me too," grunted Jerry, who was as tired as his wiry frame ever allowed
him to become.They took a trail leading eastward, which to all eyes but those familiar
with it would have been invisible, for a hundred yards or so and came
to the bed of a dry stream which issued from between two great rocks.Behind one of these rocks there opened out a grassy plot a few yards
square, and beyond the grass a little lifted platform of rock against a
sheer cliff.Here they camped, picketing their horses on the grass and
cooking their supper upon the platform of rock over a tiny fire of dry
twigs, for the wind was blowing down the canyon and they knew that they
could cook their meal and have their smoke without fear of detection.For some time after supper they sat smoking in that absolute silence
which is the characteristic of the true man of the woods.The gentle
breeze blowing down the canyon brought to their ears the rustling of
the dry poplar-leaves and the faint murmur of the stream which, tumbling
down the canyon, accompanied the main trail a hundred yards away.Suddenly Cameron's hand fell upon the knee of the half-breed with a
swift grip.With mouths slightly open and with hands to their ears they both sat
motionless, breathless, every nerve on strain.Gradually the dead
silence seemed to resolve itself into rhythmic waves of motion rather
than of sound--"TUM-ta-ta-TUM.TUM-ta-ta-TUM.TUM-ta-ta-TUM."It was
the throb of the Indian medicine-drum, which once heard can never be
forgotten or mistaken.Without a word to each other they rose, doused
their fire, cached their saddles, blankets and grub, and, taking only
their revolvers, set off up the canyon.Before they had gone many yards
Cameron halted."I take it they have come in the
back way over the old Porcupine Trail.""Then we can go in from the canyon.It is hard going, but there is less
fear of detection.They are sure to be in the Big Wigwam."Jerry shook his head, with a puzzled look on his face."That is where they are," said Cameron.Steadily the throb of the medicine-drum grew more distinct as they moved
slowly up the canyon, rising and falling upon the breeze that came down
through the darkness to meet them.The trail, which was bad enough in
the light, became exceedingly dangerous and difficult in the blackness
of the night.On they struggled painfully, now clinging to the sides of
the gorge, now mounting up over a hill and again descending to the level
of the foaming stream."Will they have sentries out, I wonder?"whispered Cameron in Jerry's
ear."No--beeg medicine going on--no sentry.""All right, then, we will walk straight in on them.""We will see what they are doing and send them about their business,"
said Cameron shortly."S'pose Indian mak beeg medicine--bes' leave
him go till morning.""Well, Jerry, we will take a look at them at any rate," said Cameron."But if they are fooling around with any rebellion nonsense I am going
to step in and stop it.""No," said Jerry again very gravely."Beeg medicine mak' Indian man
crazy--fool--dance--sing--mak' brave--then keel--queeck!""Come along, then, Jerry," said Cameron impatiently.The throb of the drum grew clearer until it seemed that the next turn in
the trail should reveal the camp, while with the drum throb they began
to catch, at first faintly and then more clearly, the monotonous chant
"Hai-yai-kai-yai, Hai-yai-kai-yai," that ever accompanies the Indian
dance.Suddenly the drums ceased altogether and with it the chanting,
and then there arose upon the night silence a low moaning cry that
gradually rose into a long-drawn penetrating wail, almost a scream, made
by a single voice.Jerry's hand caught Cameron's arm with a convulsive grip."Sioux Indian--he mak' dat when he go keel."Once more the long weird wailing scream pierced the night and, echoing
down the canyon, was repeated a hundred times by the black rocky sides.Cameron could feel Jerry's hand still quivering on his arm."Me hear dat when A'm small boy--me."Then Cameron remembered that it was Sioux blood that  the
life-stream in Jerry's veins.But he was
more shaken than he cared to acknowledge by that weird unearthly cry
and by its all too obvious effect upon the iron nerves of that little
half-breed at his side."Dey mak' dat cry when dey go meet Custer long 'go," said Jerry, making
no motion to go forward."Come along, unless
you want to go back."His words stung the half-breed into action.Cameron could feel him in
the dark jerk his hand away and hear him grit his teeth."That is better," said Cameron cheerfully."Now we will look in upon
these fire-eaters."Sharp to the right they turned behind a cliff, and then back almost upon
their trail, still to the right, through a screen of spruce and poplar,
and found themselves in a hole of a rock that lengthened into a tunnel
blacker than the night outside.Pursuing this tunnel some little
distance they became aware of a light that grew as they moved toward
it into a fire set in the middle of a wide cavern.The cavern was of
irregular shape, with high-vaulted roof, open to the sky at the apex and
hung with glistening stalactites.The floor of this cavern lay slightly
below them, and from their position they could command a full view of
its interior.The sides of the cavern round about were crowded with tawny faces of
Indians arranged rank upon rank, the first row seated upon the ground,
those behind crouching upon their haunches, those still farther back
standing.In the center of the cavern and with his face lit by the fire
stood the Sioux Chief, Onawata."He mak' beeg spik," he said."He say Indian long tam' 'go have all country when his fadder small boy.Dem day good hunting--plenty beaver, mink, moose, buffalo like leaf on
tree, plenty hit (eat), warm wigwam, Indian no seeck, notting wrong.Dem
day Indian lak' deer go every place.Dem day Indian man lak' bear 'fraid
notting.Good tam', happy, hunt deer, keel buffalo, hit all day.The half-breed's voice faded in two long gasps.The Sioux's chanting voice rose and fell through the vaulted cavern like
a mighty instrument of music.His audience of crowding Indians gazed
in solemn rapt awe upon him.The whole circle
swayed in unison with his swaying form as he chanted the departed
glories of those happy days when the red man roamed free those plains
and woods, lord of his destiny and subject only to his own will.The
mystic magic power of that rich resonant voice, its rhythmic cadence
emphasized by the soft throbbing of the drum, the uplifted face glowing
as with prophetic fire, the tall swaying form instinct with exalted
emotion, swept the souls of his hearers with surging tides of passion.Cameron, though he caught but little of its meaning, felt himself
irresistibly borne along upon the torrent of the flowing words.He
glanced at Jerry beside him and was startled by the intense emotion
showing upon his little wizened face.Suddenly there was a swift change of motif, and with it a change of
tone and movement and color.The marching, vibrant, triumphant chant
of freedom and of conquest subsided again into the long-drawn wail of
defeat, gloom and despair.He knew the
singer was telling the pathetic story of the passing of the day of the
Indian's glory and the advent of the day of his humiliation.With sharp
rising inflections, with staccato phrasing and with fierce passionate
intonation, the Sioux wrung the hearts of his hearers.Again Cameron
glanced at the half-breed at his side and again he was startled to note
the transformation in his face.Where there had been glowing pride there
was now bitter savage hate.For that hour at least the half-breed was
all Sioux.His father's blood was the water in his veins, the red was
only his Indian mother's.With face drawn tense and lips bared into
a snarl, with eyes gleaming, he gazed fascinated upon the face of the
singer.In imagination, in instinct, in the deepest emotions of his soul
Jerry was harking back again to the savage in him, and the savage in him
thirsting for revenge upon the white man who had wrought this ruin upon
him and his Indian race.With a fine dramatic instinct the Sioux reached
his climax and abruptly ceased.A low moaning murmur ran round the
circle and swelled into a sobbing cry, then ceased as suddenly as there
stepped into the circle a stranger, evidently a half-breed, who began to
speak.He was a French Cree, he announced, and delivered his message in
the speech, half Cree, half French, affected by his race.He had come fresh from the North country, from the disturbed district,
and bore, as it appeared, news of the very first importance from those
who were the leaders of his people in the unrest.At his very first
word Jerry drew a long deep breath and by his face appeared to drop from
heaven to earth.As the half-breed proceeded with his tale his speech
increased in rapidity.said Cameron after they had listened for
some minutes.said Jerry, whose vocabulary had been learned
mostly by association with freighters and the Police."He tell 'bout
beeg meeting, beeg man Louis Riel mak' beeg noise.The whole scene had lost for Jerry its mystic impressiveness and had
become contemptibly commonplace.This was the
part that held meaning for him.So he pulled up the half-breed with a
quick, sharp command."Listen close," he said, "and let me know what he says."And as Jerry interpreted in his broken English the half-breed's speech
it appeared that there was something worth learning.At this big
meeting held in Batoche it seemed a petition of rights, to the Dominion
Parliament no less, had been drawn up, and besides this many plans had
been formed and many promises made of reward for all those who dared to
stand for their rights under the leadership of the great Riel, while
for the Indians very special arrangements had been made and the most
alluring prospects held out.For they were assured that, when in the far
North country the new Government was set up, the old free independent
life of which they had been hearing was to be restored, all hampering
restrictions imposed by the white man were to be removed, and the
good old days were to be brought back.The effect upon the Indians was
plainly evident.With solemn faces they listened, nodding now and
then grave approval, and Cameron felt that the whole situation held
possibilities of horror unspeakable in the revival of that ancient
savage spirit which had been so very materially softened and tamed
by years of kindly, patient and firm control on the part of those
who represented among them British law and civilization.His original
intention had been to stride in among these Indians, to put a stop to
their savage nonsense and order them back to their reserves with never a
thought of anything but obedience on their part.But as he glanced about
upon the circle of faces he hesitated.This was no petty outbreak of
ill temper on the part of a number of Indians dissatisfied with their
rations or chafing under some new Police regulation.As his eye traveled
round the circle he noted that for the most part they were young men.A few of the councilors of the various tribes represented were present.Many of them he knew, but many others he could not distinguish in the
dim light of the fire.And as Jerry ran over the names he began to realize how widely
representative of the various tribes in the western country the
gathering was.Practically every reserve in the West was represented:
Bloods, Piegans and Blackfeet from the foothill country, Plain Crees and
Wood Crees from the North.Even a few of the Stonies, who were supposed
to have done with all pagan rites and to have become largely civilized,
were present.They were the
picked braves of the tribes, and with them a large number of the younger
chiefs.At length the half-breed Cree finished his tale, and in a few brief
fierce sentences he called the Indians of the West to join their
half-breed and Indian brothers of the North in one great effort to
regain their lost rights and to establish themselves for all time in
independence and freedom.Then followed grave discussion carried on with deliberation and courtesy
by those sitting about the fire, and though gravity and courtesy marked
every utterance there thrilled through every speech an ever deepening
intensity of feeling.The fiery spirit of the red man, long subdued by
those powers that represented the civilization of the white man, was
burning fiercely within them.The insatiable lust for glory formerly won
in war or in the chase, but now no longer possible to them, burned in
their hearts like a consuming fire.The life of monotonous struggle for
a mere existence to which they were condemned had from the first been
intolerable to them.The prowess of their fathers, whether in the
slaughter of foes or in the excitement of the chase, was the theme of
song and story round every Indian camp-fire and at every sun dance.For the young braves, life, once vivid with color and thrilling with
tingling emotions, had faded into the somber-hued monotony of a dull and
spiritless existence, eked out by the charity of the race who had robbed
them of their hunting-grounds and deprived them of their rights as free
men.The lust for revenge, the fury of hate, the yearning for the return
of the days of the red man's independence raged through their speeches
like fire in an open forest; and, ever fanning yet ever controlling the
flame, old Copperhead presided till the moment should be ripe for such
action as he desired.Should they there and then pledge themselves to their Northern brothers
and commit themselves to this great approaching adventure?Quietly and with an air of judicial deliberation the Sioux put the
question to them.There was something to be lost and something to be
gained.And the gain, how
immeasurable!A few scattered settlers with no arms nor ammunition, with
no means of communication, what could they effect?A Government nearly
three thousand miles away, with the nearest base of military operations
a thousand miles distant, what could they do?The only real difficulty
was the North West Mounted Police.But even as the Sioux uttered the
words a chill silence fell upon the excited throng.The North West
Mounted Police, who for a dozen years had guarded them and cared for
them and ruled them without favor and without fear!Five hundred red
coats of the Great White Mother across the sea, men who had never been
known to turn their backs upon a foe, who laughed at noisy threats and
whose simple word their greatest chief was accustomed unhesitatingly to
obey!Small wonder that the mere mention of the name of those gallant
"Riders of the Plains" should fall like a chill upon their fevered
imaginations.The Sioux was conscious of that chill and set himself to
counteract it.he cried with unspeakable scorn, "the Police!They will
flee before the Indian braves like leaves before the autumn wind."Without a moment's hesitation Cameron sprang to his feet and, standing
in the dim light at the entrance to the cave, with arm outstretched and
finger pointed at the speaker, he cried:

"Listen!"With a sudden start every face was turned in his direction.Never have the Indians seen a Policeman's back turned in
flight."His unexpected appearance, his voice ringing like the blare of a trumpet
through the cavern, his tall figure with the outstretched accusing arm
and finger, the sharp challenge of the Sioux's lie with what they all
knew to be the truth, produced an effect utterly indescribable.For
some brief seconds they gazed upon him stricken into silence as with a
physical blow, then with a fierce exclamation the Sioux snatched a rifle
from the cave side and quicker than words can tell fired straight at
the upright accusing figure.But quicker yet was Jerry's panther-spring.With a backhand he knocked Cameron flat, out of range.Cameron dropped
to the floor as if dead."What the deuce do you mean, Jerry?""You nearly knocked the
wind out of me!"grunted Jerry fiercely, dragging him back into the
tunnel out of the light.cried Cameron in a rage, struggling to free himself
from the grip of the wiry half-breed.hissed Jerry, laying his hand over Cameron's mouth."Indian mad--crazy--tak' scalp sure queeck.""Let me go, Jerry, you little fool!""I'll kill you if you
don't!I want that Sioux, and, by the eternal God, I am going to have
him!"He shook himself free of the half-breed's grasp and sprang to his
feet.cried Jerry again, flinging himself upon him and winding his
arms about him.Indian mad crazy--keel quick--no
talk--now."Up and down the tunnel Cameron dragged him about as a mastiff might
a terrier, striving to free himself from those gripping arms.Even as
Jerry spoke, through the dim light the figure of an Indian could be seen
passing and repassing the entrance to the cave."We get him soon," said Jerry in an imploring whisper."Come back
now--queeck--beeg hole close by."With a great effort Cameron regained his self-control."By Jove, you are right, Jerry," he said quietly."We certainly can't
take him now.This
passage opens on to the canyon about fifty yards farther down.Follow,
and keep your eye on the Sioux.Without an instant's hesitation Jerry obeyed, well aware that his master
had come to himself and again was in command.Cameron meantime groped to the mouth of the tunnel by which he had
entered and peered out into the dim light.Close to his hand stood an
Indian in the cavern.Beyond him there was a confused mingling of forms
as if in bewilderment.The Council was evidently broken up for the time.The Indians were greatly shaken by the vision that had broken in upon
them.That it was no form of flesh and blood was very obvious to them,
for the Sioux's bullet had passed through it and spattered against the
wall leaving no trail of blood behind it.There was no holding them
together, and almost before he was aware of it Cameron saw the cavern
empty of every living soul.Quickly but warily he followed, searching
each nook as he went, but the dim light of the dying fire showed him
nothing but the black walls and gloomy recesses of the great cave.At
the farther entrance he found Jerry awaiting him."Beeg camp close by," replied Jerry.Some
talk-talk, then go sleep.Chief Onawata he mak' more talk--talk all
night--then go sleep.Now you get back quick for the men
and come to me here in the morning.We must not spoil the chance of
capturing this old devil.He will have these Indians worked up into
rebellion before we know where we are."So saying, Cameron set forward that he might with his own eyes look upon
the camp and might the better plan his further course.First, that he should break up this council
which held such possibilities of danger to the peace of the country.And
secondly, and chiefly, he must lay hold of this Sioux plotter, not only
because of the possibilities of mischief that lay in him, but because of
the injury he had done him and his.Forward, then, he went and soon came upon the camp, and after observing
the lay of it, noting especially the tent in which the Sioux Chief had
disposed himself, he groped back to his cave, in a nook of which--for
he was nearly done out with weariness, and because much yet lay before
him--he laid himself down and slept soundly till the morning.CHAPTER XIII

IN THE BIG WIGWAM


Long before the return of the half-breed and his men Cameron was astir
and to some purpose.A scouting expedition around the Indian camp
rewarded him with a significant and useful discovery.In a bluff some
distance away he found the skins and heads of four steers, and by
examination of the brands upon the skins discovered two of them to be
from his own herd."All right, my braves," he muttered."There will be a reckoning for this
some day not so far away.Meantime this will help this day's work."A night's sleep and an hour's quiet consideration had shown him the
folly of a straight frontal attack upon the Indians gathered for
conspiracy.They were too deeply stirred for anything like the usual
brusque manner of the Police to be effective.A slight indiscretion,
indeed, might kindle such a conflagration as would sweep the whole
country with the devastating horror of an Indian war.He recalled the
very grave manner of Inspector Dickson and resolved upon an entirely
new plan of action.At all costs he must allay suspicion that the Police
were at all anxious about the situation in the North.Further, he must
break the influence of the Sioux Chief over these Indians.Lastly, he
was determined that this arch-plotter should not escape him again.The sun was just visible over the lowest of the broken foothills when
Jerry and the two constables made their appearance, bringing, with them
Cameron's horse.After explaining to them fully his plan and emphasizing
the gravity of the situation and the importance of a quiet, cool and
resolute demeanor, they set off toward the Indian encampment."I have no intention of stirring these chaps up," laid Cameron, "but I
am determined to arrest old Copperhead, and at the right moment we must
act boldly and promptly.He is too dangerous and much too clever to be
allowed his freedom among these Indians of ours at this particular time.Now, then, Jerry and I will ride in looking for cattle and prepared to
charge these Indians with cattle-stealing.This will put them on the
defensive.You two will remain within sound
of whistle, but failing specific direction let each man act on his own
initiative."Before the
day was over he was to see him in an entirely new role.Nothing in life
afforded Jerry such keen delight as a bit of cool daring successfully
carried through.Hence with joyous heart he followed Cameron into the
Indian camp.The morning hour is the hour of coolest reason.The fires of emotion and
imagination have not yet begun to burn.The reactions from anything
like rash action previously committed under the stimulus of a heated
imagination are caution and timidity, and upon these reactions Cameron
counted when he rode boldly into the Indian camp.With one swift glance his eye swept the camp and lighted upon the Sioux
Chief in the center of a group of younger men, his tall commanding
figure and haughty carriage giving him an outstanding distinction over
those about him.At his side stood a young Piegan Chief, Eagle Feather
by name, whom Cameron knew of old as a restless, talkative Indian, an
ambitious aspirant for leadership without the qualities necessary to
such a position."Ah, good morning, Eagle
Feather!"Eagle Feather grunted an indistinct reply.Are you in command of this party, Eagle Feather?The Piegan turned and pointed to a short thick set man standing by
another fire, whose large well shaped head and penetrating eye indicated
both force and discretion.I
am glad to see you, for I wish to talk to a man of wisdom."Slowly and with dignified, almost unwilling step Running Stream
approached.As he began to move, but not before, Cameron went to meet
him."I wish to talk with you," said Cameron in a quiet firm tone."I have a matter of importance to speak to you about," continued
Cameron.Running Stream's keen glance searched his face somewhat anxiously."I find, Running Stream, that your young men are breaking faith with
their friends, the Police."Again the Chief searched Cameron's face with that keen swift glance, but
he said not a word, only waited."They are breaking the law as well, and I want to tell you they will be
punished.Where did they get the meat for these kettles?"A look of relief gleamed for one brief instant across the Indian's face,
not unnoticed, however, by Cameron.Sandra journeyed to the office."Why do your young men steal my cattle?""Dunno--deer--mebbe--sheep.""My brother speaks like a child," said Cameron quietly."Do deer and
sheep have steers' heads and hides with brands on?The Commissioner will ask you to explain these hides and
heads, and let me tell you, Running Stream, that the thieves will spend
some months in jail.They will then have plenty of time to think of
their folly and their wickedness."An ugly glance shot from the Chief's eyes."Dunno," he grunted again, then began speaking volubly in the Indian
tongue."I know you can
speak English well enough."But Running Stream shook his head and continued his speech in Indian,
pointing to a bluff near by.Cameron looked toward Jerry, who interpreted:

"He say young men tak' deer and sheep and bear."Come," said Running Stream, supplementing Jerry's interpretation and
making toward the bluff.Cameron followed him and came upon the skins of
three jumping deer, of two mountain sheep and of two bear."My young men no take cattle," said the Chief with haughty pride."Maybe so," said Cameron, "but some of your party have, Running Stream,
and the Commissioner will look to you.He will
give you a chance to clear yourself.""My brother is not doing well," continued Cameron."The Government feed
you if you are hungry.The Government protect you if you are wronged."A sudden cloud of anger
darkened the Indian's face."My children--my squaw and my people go hungry--go
cold in winter--no skin--no meat.""My brother knows--" replied Cameron with patient firmness--"You
translate this, Jerry"--and Jerry proceeded to translate with eloquence
and force--"the Government never refuse you meat.Last winter your
people would have starved but for the Government.""No," cried the Indian again in harsh quick reply, the rage in his
face growing deeper, "my children cry--Indian cannot sleep--my white
brother's ears are closed.He hear only the wind--the storm--he sound
sleep.For me no sleep--my children cry too loud.""My brother knows," replied Cameron, "that the Government is far away,
that it takes a long time for answer to come back to the Indian cry.But the answer came and the Indian received flour and bacon and tea and
sugar, and this winter will receive them again.But how can my brother
expect the Government to care for his people if the Indians break the
law?These Indians are bad Indians and the Police will
punish the thieves.A thief is a bad man and ought to be punished."Suddenly a new voice broke in abruptly upon the discourse."Who steal the Indian's hunting-ground?It was the voice of Onawata, the Sioux
Chief.Cameron paid no heed to the ringing voice.He kept his back turned upon
the Sioux."My brother knows," he continued, addressing himself to Running Stream,
"that the Indian's best friend is the Government, and the Police are the
Government's ears and eyes and hands and are ready always to help the
Indians, to protect them from fraud, to keep away the whisky-peddlers,
to be to them as friends and brothers.But my brother has been listening
to a snake that comes from another country and that speaks with a forked
tongue.Running Stream knows
this to be no lie, but the truth.Nor did the Government drive away the
buffalo from the Indians.The buffalo were driven away by the Sioux from
the country of the snake with the forked tongue.My brother remembers
that only a few years ago when the people to which this lying snake
belongs came over to this country and tried to drive away from their
hunting-grounds the Indians of this country, the Police protected the
Indians and drove back the hungry thieving Sioux to their own land.And
now a little bird has been telling me that this lying snake has been
speaking into the ears of our Indian brothers and trying to persuade
them to dig up the hatchet against their white brothers, their friends.The Police know all about this and laugh at it.The Police know about
the foolish man at Batoche, the traitor Louis Riel.They know he is
a liar and a coward.He leads brave men astray and then runs away and
leaves them to suffer.And Cameron
proceeded to give a brief sketch of the fantastic and futile rebellion
of 1870 and of the ignoble part played by the vain and empty-headed
Riel.The effect of Cameron's words upon the Indians was an amazement even to
himself.They forgot their breakfast and gathered close to the speaker,
their eager faces and gleaming eyes showing how deeply stirred were
their hearts.Cameron was putting into his story an intensity of emotion and passion
that not only surprised himself, but amazed his interpreter.Indeed so
amazed was the little half-breed at Cameron's quite unusual display of
oratorical power that his own imagination took fire and his own tongue
was loosened to such an extent that by voice, look, tone and gesture he
poured into his officer's harangue a force and fervor all his own."And now," continued Cameron, "this vain and foolish Frenchman seeks
again to lead you astray, to lead you into war that will bring ruin
to you and to your children; and this lying snake from your ancient
enemies, the Sioux, thinking you are foolish children, seeks to make
you fight against the great White Mother across the seas.He has been
talking like a babbling old man, from whom the years have taken wisdom,
when he says that the half-breeds and Indians can drive the white man
from these plains.Has he told you how many are the children of the
White Mother, how many are the soldiers in her army?Get me many branches from the trees," he commanded sharply to some
young Indians standing near.So completely were the Indians under the thrall of his speech that a
dozen of them sprang at once to get branches from the poplar trees near
by."I will show you," said Cameron, "how many are the White Mother's
soldiers.See,"--he held up both hands and then stuck up a small twig in
the sand to indicate the number ten.Ten of these small twigs he set in
a row and by a larger stick indicated a hundred, and so on till he had
set forth in the sandy soil a diagrammatic representation of a hundred
thousand men, the Indians following closely his every movement."And all
these men," he continued, "are armed with rifles and with great big guns
that speak like thunder.And these are only a few of the White Mother's
soldiers.How many Indians and half-breeds do you think there are with
rifles?"He set in a row sticks to represent a thousand men."See," he
cried, "so many.""Perhaps, if all
the Indians gathered, so many with rifles.Now look," he said,
"no big guns, only a few bullets, a little powder, a little food.My Indian brothers here will not listen to him, but
there are others whose hearts are like the hearts of little children who
may listen to his lying words.The Sioux snake must be caught and put in
a cage, and this I do now."As he uttered the words Cameron sprang for the Sioux, but quicker than
his leap the Sioux darted through the crowding Indians who, perceiving
Cameron's intent, thrust themselves in his path and enabled the Sioux to
get away into the brush behind."Head him off, Jerry," yelled Cameron, whistling sharply at the same
time for his men, while he darted for his horse and threw himself upon
it.The whole camp was in a seething uproar.The Indians fell away from him
like waves from a speeding vessel.On the other side of the little bluff
he caught sight of a mounted Indian flying toward the mountains and with
a cry he started in pursuit.It took only a few minutes for Cameron to
discover that he was gaining rapidly upon his man.But the rough rocky
country was not far away in front of them, and here was abundant chance
for hiding.Closer and closer he drew to his flying enemy--a hundred
yards--seventy-five yards--fifty yards only separated them.But the Indian, throwing himself on the far side of his pony, urged him
to his topmost speed.Cameron steadied himself for a moment, took careful aim and fired.The
flying pony stumbled, recovered himself, stumbled again and fell.But
even before he reached the earth his rider had leaped free, and, still
some thirty yards in advance, sped onward.Half a dozen strides and
Cameron's horse was upon him, and, giving him the shoulder, hurled the
Indian senseless to earth.In a flash Cameron was at his side, turned
him over and discovered not the Sioux Chief but another Indian quite
unknown to him.His rage and disappointment were almost beyond his control.For an
instant he held his gun poised as if to strike, but the blow did not
fall.He put up his gun, turned quickly
away from the prostrate Indian, flung himself upon his horse and set off
swiftly for the camp.It was but a mile distant, but in the brief
time consumed in reaching it he had made up his mind as to his line of
action.Unless his men had captured the Sioux it was almost certain that
he had made his escape to the canyon, and once in the canyon there was
little hope of his being taken.It was of the first importance that he
should not appear too deeply concerned over his failure to take his man.With this thought in his mind Cameron loped easily into the Indian camp.He found the young braves in a state of feverish excitement.Armed with
guns and clubs, they gathered about their Chiefs clamoring to be allowed
to wipe out these representatives of the Police who had dared to attempt
an arrest of this distinguished guest of theirs.As Cameron appeared
the uproar quieted somewhat and the Indians gathered about him, eagerly
waiting his next move.Cameron cantered up to Running Stream and, looking round upon the
crowding and excited braves, he said, with a smile of cool indifference:

"The Sioux snake has slid away in the grass.After he has eaten we will have
some quiet talk."So saying, he swung himself from his saddle, drew the reins over his
horse's ears and, throwing himself down beside a camp fire, he pulled
out his pipe and proceeded to light it as calmly as if sitting in a
council-lodge.Nothing appeals more strongly
to the Indian than an exhibition of steady nerve.For some moments they
stood regarding Cameron with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration
with a strong admixture of impatience, for they had thought of being
done out of their great powwow with its attendant joys of dance and
feast, and if this Policeman should choose to remain with them all day
there could certainly be neither dancing nor feasting for them.In the
meantime, however, there was nothing for it but to accept the situation
created for them.This cool-headed Mounted Policeman had planted himself
by their camp-fire.They could not very well drive him from their camp,
nor could they converse with him till he was ready.As they were thus standing about in uncertainty of mind and temper
Jerry, the interpreter, came in and, with a grunt of recognition, threw
himself down by Cameron beside the fire.After some further hesitation
the Indians began to busy themselves once more with their breakfast.In
the group about the campfire beside which Cameron had placed himself was
the Chief, Running Stream.The presence of the Policeman beside his fire
was most embarrassing to the Chief, for no man living has a keener sense
of the obligations of hospitality than has the Indian.But the Indian
hates to eat in the presence of a white man unless the white man shares
his meal.Hence Running Stream approached Cameron with a courteous
request that he would eat with them."Thanks, Running Stream, I have eaten, but I am sure Jerry here will
be glad of some breakfast," said Cameron cordially, who had no desire
whatever to dip out of the very doubtful mess in the pot which had been
set down on the ground in the midst of the group around the fire.Jerry, however, had no scruples in the matter and, like every Indian
and half-breed, was always ready for a meal.Having thus been offered
hospitality and having by proxy accepted it, Cameron was in position to
discuss with the Chief in a judicial if not friendly spirit the matter
he had in hand.Breakfast over, Cameron offered his tobacco-pouch to the Chief, who,
gravely helping himself to a pipeful, passed it on to his neighbor who,
having done likewise, passed it in turn to the man next him till the
tobacco was finished and the empty pouch returned with due gravity to
the owner.Relations of friendly diplomacy being thus established, the whole party
sat smoking in solemn silence until the pipes were smoked out.Then
Cameron, knocking the ashes from his pipe, opened up the matter in hand,
with Jerry interpreting."The Sioux snake," he began quietly, "will be hungry for his breakfast."Huh," grunted Running Stream, non-committal."The Police will get him in due time," continued Cameron in a tone of
quiet indifference."He will cease to trouble our Indian brothers with
foolish lies.The prison gates are strong and will soon close upon this
stranger with the forked tongue."Again the Chief grunted, still non-committal."It would be a pity if any of your young men should give heed to these
silly tales.In the Sioux country
there is frequent war between the soldiers and the Indians because bad
men wish to wrong the Indians and the Indians grow angry and fight, but
in this country white men are punished who do wrong to Indians."Huh," grunted Running Stream acquiescing."When Indians do wrong to white men it is just that the Indians should
be punished as well.The Police do justly between the white man and the
Indian."Huh," again grunted Running Stream with an uneasy look on his face."Therefore when young and foolish braves steal and kill cattle they must
be punished.Here Cameron's voice
grew gentle as a child's, but there was in its tone something that made
the Chief glance quickly at his face."Huh, my young men no steal cattle," he said sullenly.I believe that is true, and that is why I
smoke with my brother beside his camp fire.But some young men in this
band have stolen cattle, and I want my brother to find them that I might
take them with me to the Commissioner.""Not know any Indian take cattle," said Running Stream in surly
defiance."There are four skins and four heads lying in the bluff up yonder,
Running Stream.I am going to take those with me to the Commissioner and
I am sure he would like to see you about those skins."Cameron's manner
continued to be mild but there ran through his speech an undertone of
stern resolution that made the Indian squirm a bit."Not know any Indian take cattle," repeated Running Stream, but with
less defiance."Then it would be well for my brother to find out the thieves, for," and
here Cameron paused and looked the Chief steadily in the face for a few
moments, "for we are to take them back with us or we will ask the Chief
to come and explain to the Commissioner why he does not know what his
young men are doing.""No Blackfeet Indian take cattle," said the Chief once more."Then it must be the Bloods, or the Piegans or the
Stonies.He had determined to spend
the day if necessary in running down these thieves.At his suggestion
Running Stream called together the Chiefs of the various bands of
Indians represented.From his supplies Cameron drew forth some more
tobacco and, passing it round the circle of Chiefs, calmly waited until
all had smoked their pipes out, after which he proceeded to lay the case
before them.The Police believe them to be honest
men, but unfortunately among them there have crept in some who are not
honest.In the bluff yonder are four hides and four heads of steers, two
of them from my own herd.Some bad Indians have stolen and killed these
steers and they are here in this camp to-day, and I am going to take
them with me to the Commissioner.Running Stream is a great Chief and
speaks no lies and he tells me that none of his young men have taken
these cattle.Will the Chief of the Stonies, the Chief of the Bloods,
the Chief of the Piegans say the same for their young men?""The Stonies take no cattle," answered an Indian whom Cameron recognized
as the leading representative of that tribe present.What about the Bloods and the Piegans?""It is not for me," he continued, when there was no reply, "to discover
the cattle-thieves.It is for the Big Chief of this camp, it is for you,
Running Stream, and when you have found the thieves I shall arrest them
and bring them to the Commissioner, for I will not return without them.Meantime I go to bring here the skins."So saying, Cameron rode leisurely away, leaving Jerry to keep an eye
upon the camp.For more than an hour they talked among themselves, but
without result.Finally they came to Jerry, who, during his years
with the Police, had to a singular degree gained the confidence of the
Indians.There had been much stealing
of cattle by some of the tribes, not by all.The Police had been
patient, but they had become weary.They had their suspicions as to the
thieves.Eagle Feather was anxious to know what Indians were suspected."Not the Stonies and not the Blackfeet," replied Jerry quietly.It was
a pity, he continued, that innocent men should suffer for the guilty.He
knew Running Stream was no thief, but Running Stream must find out the
thieves in the band under his control.How would Running Stream like to
have the great Chief of the Blackfeet, Crowfoot, know that he could not
control the young men under his command and did not know what they were
doing?This suggestion of Jerry had a mighty effect upon the Blackfeet Chief,
for old Crowfoot was indeed a great Chief and a mighty power with his
band, and to fall into disfavor with him would be a serious matter for
any junior Chief in the tribe.Again they withdrew for further discussion and soon it became evident
that Jerry's cunning suggestions had sown seeds of discord among them.The dispute waxed hot and fierce, not as to the guilty parties, who were
apparently acknowledged to be the Piegans, but as to the course to be
pursued.Running Stream had no intention that his people and himself
should become involved in the consequences of the crimes of other
tribes whom the Blackfeet counted their inferiors.Eagle Feather and his
Piegans must bear the consequences of their own misdeeds.On the other
hand Eagle Feather pleaded hard that they should stand together in this
matter, that the guilty parties could not be disclosed.The Police could
not punish them all, and all the more necessary was it that they should
hold together because of the larger enterprise into which they were
about to enter.The absence of the Sioux Chief Onawata, however, weakened the bond of
unity which he more than any other had created and damped the ardor of
the less eager of the conspirators.It was likewise a serious blow to
their hopes of success that the Police knew all their plans.Running
Stream finally gave forth his decision, which was that the thieves
should be given up, and that they all should join in a humble petition
to the Police for leniency, pleading the necessity of hunger on their
hunting-trip, and, as for the larger enterprise, that they should
apparently abandon it until suspicion had been allayed and until the
plans of their brothers in the North were more nearly matured.The time
for striking had not yet come.In this decision all but the Piegans agreed.In vain Eagle Feather
contended that they should stand together and defy the Police to prove
any of them guilty.In vain he sought to point out that if in this
crisis they surrendered the Piegans to the Police never again could they
count upon the Piegans to support them in any enterprise.But Running
Stream and the others were resolved.At the very moment in which this decision had been reached Cameron rode
in, carrying with him the incriminating hides."You take charge of these and bring them to the
Commissioner.""All right," said Jerry, taking the hides from Cameron's horse.said Cameron in a low voice as the half-breed was
untying the bundle.Quietly Cameron walked over to the group of excited Indians.As he
approached they opened their circle to receive him."My brother has discovered the thief," he said."And after all a thief
is easily found among honest men."Slowly and deliberately his eye traveled round the circle of faces,
keenly scrutinizing each in turn.When he came to Eagle Feather he
paused, gazed fixedly at him, took a single step in his direction, and,
suddenly leveling an accusing finger at him, cried in a loud voice:

"I have found him.Slowly he walked up to the Indian, who remained stoically motionless,
laid his hand upon his wrist and said in a clear ringing voice heard
over the encampment:

"Eagle Feather, I arrest you in the name of the Queen!"And before
another word could be spoken or a movement made Eagle Feather stood
handcuffed, a prisoner.CHAPTER XIV

"GOOD MAN--GOOD SQUAW"


"That boy is worse, Mrs.Cameron, decidedly worse, and I wash my hands
of all responsibility."Mandy sat silent, weary with watching and weary with the conflict that
had gone on intermittently during the past three days.The doctor
was determined to have the gangrenous foot off.That was the simplest
solution of the problem before him and the foot would have come off days
ago if he had had his way.But the Indian boy had vehemently opposed
this proposal."One foot--me go die," was his ultimatum, and through
all the fever and delirium this was his continuous refrain.In this
determination his nurse supported him, for she could not bring herself
to the conviction that amputation was absolutely necessary, and,
besides, of all the melancholy and useless driftwood that drives hither
and thither with the ebb and flow of human life, she could imagine none
more melancholy and more useless than an Indian crippled of a foot.Hence she supported the boy in his ultimatum, "One foot--me go die.""That foot ought to come off," repeated the doctor, beginning the
controversy anew."But, doctor," said Mandy wearily, "just think how pitiable, how
helpless that boy will be.And, besides, I have not
quite given up hope that--"

The doctor snorted his contempt for her opinion; and only his respect
for her as Cameron's wife and for the truly extraordinary powers and
gifts in her profession which she had displayed during the past three
days held back the wrathful words that were at his lips.It was late in
the afternoon and the doctor had given many hours to this case, riding
back and forward from the fort every day, but all this he would not have
grudged could he have had his way with his patient."Well, I have done my best," he said, "and now I must go back to my
work.""I know, doctor, I know," pleaded Mandy."You have been most kind and
I thank you from my heart.""Don't
think me too awfully obstinate, and please forgive me if you do."The doctor took the outstretched hand grudgingly."Of all the obstinate creatures--"

"Oh, I am afraid I am.You see, the
boy is so splendidly plucky and such a fine chap.""He is a fine chap, doctor, and I can't bear to have him crippled,
and--" She paused abruptly, her lips beginning to quiver.She was near
the limit of her endurance."You would rather have him dead, eh?All right, if that suits you better
it makes no difference to me," said the doctor gruffly, picking up his
bag."Doctor, you will come back again to-morrow?"I can do no more--unless
you agree to amputation.There is no use coming back to-morrow.I can't give all my time to this Indian."The
contempt in the doctor's voice for a mere Indian stung her like a whip.On Mandy's cheek, pale with her long vigil, a red flush appeared and
in her eye a light that would have warned the doctor had he known her
better.But the doctor was very impatient and anxious to be gone.Yes, of course, a human being, but there are human
beings and human beings.But if you mean an Indian is as good as a white
man, frankly I don't agree with you.""You have given a great deal of your time, doctor," said Mandy with
quiet deliberation, "and I am most grateful.I can ask no more for THIS
INDIAN.I only regret that I have been forced to ask so much of your
time.There was a ring as of steel in her voice.The doctor
became at once apologetic."What--eh?--I beg your pardon," he stammered.I don't quite--"

"Good-by, doctor, and again thank you.""Well, you know quite well I can't do any more," said the old doctor
crossly."No, I don't think you can."And awkwardly the doctor walked away,
rather uncertain as to her meaning but with a feeling that he had been
dismissed.he muttered as he left the tent door,
indignant with himself that no fitting reply would come to his lips.And
not until he had mounted his horse and taken the trail was he able to
give full and adequate expression to his feelings, and even then it
took him some considerable time to do full justice to himself and to the
situation.Meantime the nurse had turned back to her watch, weary and despairing.In a way that she could not herself understand the Indian boy had
awakened her interest and even her affection.His fine stoical courage,
his warm and impulsive gratitude excited her admiration and touched her
heart.Again arose to her lips a cry that had been like a refrain in her
heart for the past three days, "Oh, if only Dr.Martin had made it only too apparent
that the old army surgeon was archaic in his practice and method.she said aloud, as she bent over her
patient.As if in answer to her cry there was outside a sound of galloping
horses.She ran to the tent door and before her astonished eyes there
drew up at her tent Dr.Martin, her sister-in-law and the ever-faithful
Smith.she cried, running to him with both hands
outstretched, and could say no more.Say, what the deuce have they been doing to you?""Oh, I am glad, that's all."Well, you show your joy in a mighty queer way.""She's done out, Doctor," cried Moira, springing from her horse and
running to her sister-in-law."I ought to have come before to relieve
her," she continued penitently, with her arms round Mandy, "but I knew
so little, and besides I thought the doctor was here.""He was here," said Mandy, recovering herself."He has just gone, and
oh, I am glad.How did you get here in all the world?""Your telegram came when I was away," said the doctor."I did not get it
for a day, then I came at once."I have it here--no, I've left it somewhere--but I
certainly got a telegram from you."Martin's presence, and--I ventured to send a wire in your name.I hope
you will forgive the liberty," said Smith, red to his hair-roots and
looking over his horse's neck with a most apologetic air.Smith, you are
my guardian angel," running to him and shaking him warmly by the hand."And he brought, us here, too," cried Moira."He has been awfully good
to me these days.I do not know what I should have done without him."Meantime Smith was standing first on one foot and then on the other in a
most unhappy state of mind."Guess I will be going back," he said in an agony of awkwardness and
confusion."I've got some chores to look after, and I guess none of you are coming
back now anyway.""Well, hold on a bit," said the doctor."Guess you don't need me any more," continued Smith.And he
climbed on to his horse.No one appeared to have any good reason why Smith should remain, and so
he rode away."You have really
saved my life, I assure you.Smith," cried Moira, waving her hand with a bright smile."You have saved me too from dying many a time these three days."With an awkward wave Smith answered these farewells and rode down the
trail."He is really a fine fellow," said Mandy."That is just it," cried Moira."He has spent his whole time these three
days doing things for me.""Ah, no wonder," said the doctor.But what's the
trouble here?Mandy gave him a detailed history of the case, the doctor meanwhile
making an examination of the patient's general condition."And the doctor would have his foot off, but I would not stand for
that," cried Mandy indignantly as she closed her history.Looks bad enough to come off, I should say.I wish I had been here
a couple of days ago."I don't know what the outcome may be, but it
looks as bad as it well can.""Oh, that's all right," cried Mandy cheerfully."I knew it would be all
right.""Well, whether it will or not I cannot say.But one thing I do know,
you've got to trot off to sleep.Show me the ropes and then off you go."Oh, the Chief does, Chief Trotting Wolf.And she ran from the tent
to find the Chief.But she is played right out I can see,"
replied the doctor."I must get comfortable quarters for you both."echoed the doctor, looking at her as she stood in the
glow of the westering sun shining through the canvas tent."Well, you can just bet that
is just what I do want."A slight flush appeared on the girl's face."I mean," she said hurriedly, "cannot I be of some help?""Most certainly, most certainly," said the doctor, noting the flush."Your help will be invaluable after a bit.She has been on this job, I understand, for three
days.I am quite ready to take my
sister-in-law's place, that is, as far as I can.And you will surely
need some one--to help you I mean."The doctor's eyes were upon her
face.The glow of the sunset through
the tent walls illumined her face with a wonderful radiance."Miss Moira," said the doctor with abrupt vehemence, "I wish I had the
nerve to tell you just how much--"

"Hush!"cried the girl, her glowing face suddenly pale, "they are
coming."Martin," cried Mandy, ushering in that stately
individual.The doctor saluted the Chief in due form and said:

"Could we have another tent, Chief, for these ladies?Just beside this
tent here, so that they can have a little sleep."The Chief grunted a doubtful acquiescence, but in due time a tent very
much dilapidated was pitched upon the clean dry ground close beside
that in which the sick boy lay.While this was being done the doctor was
making a further examination of his patient.With admiring eyes,
Moira followed the swift movements of his deft fingers.There was the sure indication
of accurate knowledge, the obvious self-confidence of experience in
everything he did.Even to her untutored eyes the doctor seemed to be
walking with a very firm tread.At length, after an hour's work, he turned to Mandy who was assisting
him and said:

"Now you can both go to sleep."You will be sure to call me if I can be of service," said Mandy.I shall look after
this end of the job.""He is very sure of himself, is he not?"said Moira in a low tone to her
sister-in-law as they passed out of the tent."He has a right to be," said Mandy proudly."He knows his work, and now
I feel as if I can sleep in peace.What a blessed thing sleep is," she
added, as, without undressing, she tumbled on to the couch prepared for
her.Well, rather--" Her voice was trailing off again into slumber.Knows his work if that's what you mean.Oh-h--but I'm
sleepy."That
is, he is a man all through right to his toe-tips.And gentle--more
gentle than any woman I ever saw.And before
Moira could make reply she was sound asleep.Before the night was over the opportunity was given the doctor to
prove his manhood, and in a truly spectacular manner.For shortly
after midnight Moira found herself sitting bolt upright, wide-awake and
clutching her sister-in-law in wild terror.Outside their tent the night
was hideous with discordant noises, yells, whoops, cries, mingled with
the beating of tom-toms.Terrified and trembling, the two girls sprang
to the door, and, lifting the flap, peered out.It was the party of
braves returning from the great powwow so rudely interrupted by Cameron.They were returning in an evil mood, too, for they were enraged at the
arrest of Eagle Feather and three accomplices in his crime, disappointed
in the interruption of their sun dance and its attendant joys of feast
and song, and furious at what appeared to them to be the overthrow of
the great adventure for which they had been preparing and planning for
the past two months.This was indeed the chief cause of their rage, for
it seemed as if all further attempts at united effort among the Western
tribes had been frustrated by the discovery of their plans, by the
flight of their leader, and by the treachery of the Blackfeet Chief,
Running Stream, in surrendering their fellow-tribesmen to the Police.To them that treachery rendered impossible any coalition between the
Piegans and the Blackfeet.Furthermore, before their powwow had been
broken up there had been distributed among them a few bottles of
whisky provided beforehand by the astute Sioux as a stimulus to their
enthusiasm against a moment of crisis when such stimulus should be
necessary.These bottles, in the absence of their great leader, were
distributed among the tribes by Running Stream as a peace-offering, but
for obvious reason not until the moment came for their parting from each
other.Filled with rage and disappointment, and maddened with the bad whisky
they had taken, they poured into the encampment with wild shouting
accompanied by the discharge of guns and the beating of drums.In terror
the girls clung to each other, gazing out upon the horrid scene.But her sister-in-law could give her little explanation.The moonlight,
glowing bright as day, revealed a truly terrifying spectacle.A band
of Indians, almost naked and hideously painted, were leaping, shouting,
beating drums and firing guns.Out from the tents poured the rest of the
band to meet them, eagerly inquiring into the cause of their excitement.Soon fires were lighted and kettles put on, for the Indian's happiness
is never complete unless associated with feasting, and the whole band
prepared itself for a time of revelry.As the girls stood peering out upon this terrible scene they became
aware of the doctor standing at their side."Say, they seem to be cutting up rather rough, don't they?""I think as a precautionary measure you had better step over
into the other tent."Hastily gathering their belongings, they ran across with the doctor to
his tent, from which they continued to gaze upon the weird spectacle
before them.About the largest fire in the center of the camp the crowd gathered,
Chief Trotting Wolf in the midst, and were harangued by one of
the returning braves who was evidently reciting the story of their
experiences and whose tale was received with the deepest interest and
was punctuated by mad cries and whoops.The one English word that could
be heard was the word "Police," and it needed no interpreter to
explain to the watchers that the chief object of fury to the crowding,
gesticulating Indians about the fire was the Policeman who had been the
cause of their humiliation and disappointment.In a pause of the uproar
a loud exclamation from an Indian arrested the attention of the band.Once more he uttered his exclamation and pointed to the tent lately
occupied by the ladies.Quickly the whole band about the fire appeared
to bunch together preparatory to rush in the direction indicated, but
before they could spring forward Trotting Wolf, speaking rapidly and
with violent gesticulation, stood in their path.He was thrust aside and the whole band came rushing madly
toward the tent lately occupied by the ladies."Get back from the door," said the doctor, speaking rapidly."These
chaps seem to be somewhat excited.I wish I had my gun," he continued,
looking about the tent for a weapon of some sort."This will do," he
said, picking up a stout poplar pole that had been used for driving the
tent pegs."But they will kill you," cried Moira, laying her hand upon his arm.I'll
knock some of their blocks off first."So saying, he lifted the flap of
the tent and passed out just as the rush of maddened Indians came.Upon the ladies' tent they fell, kicked the tent poles down, and,
seizing the canvas ripped it clear from its pegs.Some moments they
spent searching the empty bed, then turned with renewed cries toward the
other tent before which stood the doctor, waiting, grim, silent, savage.For a single moment they paused, arrested by the silent figure, then
with a whoop a drink-maddened brave sprang toward the tent, his rifle
clubbed to strike.Before he could deliver his blow the doctor, stepping
swiftly to one side, swung his poplar club hard upon the uplifted arms,
sent the rifle crashing to the ground and with a backward swing caught
the astonished brave on the exposed head and dropped him to the earth as
if dead.he
shouted, swinging his club as a player might a baseball bat.Before the next rush, however, help came in an unexpected form.The tent
flap was pushed back and at the doctor's side stood an apparition that
checked the Indians' advance and stilled their cries.It was the Indian
boy, clad in a white night robe of Mandy's providing, his rifle in his
hand, his face ghastly in the moonlight and his eyes burning like flames
of light.One cry he uttered, weird, fierce, unearthly, but it seemed
to pierce like a knife through the stillness that had fallen.Awed,
sobered, paralyzed, the Indians stood motionless.Then from their ranks
ran Chief Trotting Wolf, picked up the rifle of the Indian who still lay
insensible on the ground, and took his place beside the boy.A few words he spoke in a voice that rang out fiercely imperious.Again the Chief spoke in short, sharp
words of command, and, as they still hesitated, took one swift stride
toward the man that stood nearest, swinging his rifle over his head.Forward sprang the doctor to his side, his poplar club likewise swung up
to strike.Back fell the Indians a pace or two, the Chief following them
with a torrential flow of vehement invective.Slowly, sullenly the crowd
gave back, cowed but still wrathful, and beginning to mutter in angry
undertones.Once more the tent flap was pushed aside and there issued
two figures who ran to the side of the Indian boy, now swaying weakly
upon his rifle.cried Mandy, throwing her arms round about him, and,
steadying him as he let his rifle fall, let him sink slowly to the
ground.cried Moira, seizing the rifle that the boy had dropped
and springing to the doctor's side.She
turned and pointed indignantly to the swooning boy.With an exclamation of wrath the doctor stepped back to Mandy's aid,
forgetful of the threatening Indians and mindful only of his patient.Quickly he sprang into the tent, returning with a stimulating remedy,
bent over the boy and worked with him till he came back again to life.Once more the Chief, who with the Indians had been gazing upon this
scene, turned and spoke to his band, this time in tones of quiet
dignity, pointing to the little group behind him.Silent and subdued the
Indians listened, their quick impulses like those of children stirred
to sympathy for the lad and for those who would aid him.Gradually the
crowd drew off, separating into groups and gathering about the various
fires.Martin and the Chief carried the boy into the tent and
laid him on his bed."What sort of beasts have you got out there anyway?"said the doctor,
facing the Chief abruptly."Him drink bad whisky," answered the Chief, tipping up his hand."Him
crazee," touching his head with his forefinger.What they want is a few ounces of lead."The Chief made no reply, but stood with his eyes turned admiringly upon
Moira's face."Squaw--him good," he said, pointing to the girl."No 'fraid--much
brave--good.""You are right enough there, Chief," replied the doctor heartily.inquired the Chief, pointing to Moira.No, not exactly," replied the doctor, much confused, "that
is--not yet I mean--"

"Huh!Him good man," replied the Chief, pointing first
to Moira, then to the doctor.replied the Chief, moving out past her."Him drink, him
crazee--no drink, no crazee."At the door he paused, and, looking back,
said once more with increased emphasis, "Huh!Him good squaw," and
finally disappeared."The old boy is a
man of some discernment I can see.But the kid and you saved the day,
Miss Moira."It was truly awful, and how
splendidly you--you--"

"Well, I caught him rather a neat one, I confess.I wonder if the brute
is sleeping yet.But you did the trick finally, Miss Moira.""Huh," grunted Mandy derisively, "Good man--good squaw, eh?"CHAPTER XV

THE OUTLAW


The bitter weather following an autumn of unusual mildness had set in
with the New Year and had continued without a break for fifteen days.A
heavy fall of snow with a blizzard blowing sixty miles an hour had made
the trails almost impassable, indeed quite so to any but to those bent
on desperate business or to Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police.To
these gallant riders all trails stood open at all seasons of the year,
no matter what snow might fall or blizzard blow, so long as duty called
them forth.The trail from the fort to the Big Horn Ranch, however, was so
wind-swept that the snow was blown away, which made the going fairly
easy, and the Superintendent, Inspector Dickson and Jerry trotted along
freely enough in the face of a keen southwester that cut to the bone.It was surely some desperate business indeed that sent them out into
the face of that cutting wind which made even these hardy riders, burned
hard and dry by scorching suns and biting blizzards, wince and shelter
their faces with their gauntleted hands."It is the raw southwester that gets to the bone," replied Inspector
Dickson."This will blow up a chinook before night.""I wonder if he has got into shelter," said the Superintendent."This
has been an unusually hard fortnight, and I am afraid he went rather
light.""Oh, he's sure to be all right," replied the Inspector quickly."He was
riding, but he took his snowshoes with him for timber work.He's hardly
the man to get caught and he won't quit easily.""No, he won't quit, but there are times when human endurance fails.Not
that I fear anything like that for Cameron," added the Superintendent
hastily."Oh, he's not the man to fall down," replied the Inspector."He goes the
limit, but he keeps his head."Well, you ought to know him," said the Superintendent."You have been
through some things together, but this last week has been about the
worst that I have known.This fortnight will be remembered in the annals
of this country.What do you think about
it, Jerry?"continued the Superintendent, turning to the half-breed."He good man--cold ver' bad--ver' long.S'pose catch heem on
plains--ver' bad."The Inspector touched his horse to a canter.The vision that floated
before his mind's eye while the half-breed was speaking he hated to
contemplate.He has come through too many tight places to fail
here," said the Inspector in a tone almost of defiance, and refused to
talk further upon the subject.But he kept urging the pace till they
drew up at the stables of the Big Horn Ranch.The Inspector's first glance upon opening the stable door swept the
stall where Ginger was wont to conduct his melancholy ruminations.It
gave him a start to see the stall empty.he cried as that individual appeared with a bundle of
hay from the stack in the yard outside.inquired the Superintendent in the same
breath, and in spite of himself a note of anxiety had crept into his
voice.The three men stood waiting, their tense attitude expressing the
anxiety they would not put into words.The deliberate Smith, who had
transferred his services from old Thatcher to Cameron and who had taken
the ranch and all persons and things belonging to it into his immediate
charge, disposed of his bundle in a stall, and then facing them said
slowly:

"Guess he's all right."Gone to bed, I think," answered Smith with
maddening calmness.The Inspector cursed him between his teeth and turned away from the
others till his eyes should be clear again.Cameron for a few minutes," said the
Superintendent.Leaving Jerry to put up their horses, they went into the ranch-house and
found the ladies in a state of suppressed excitement.Mandy met them at
the door with an eager welcome, holding out to them trembling hands."Oh, I am so glad you have come!""It was all I could do
to hold him back from going to you even as he was.He was quite set on
going and only lay down on promise that I should wake him in an hour.An hour, mind you," she continued, talking
rapidly and under obvious excitement, "and him so blind and exhausted
that--" She paused abruptly, unable to command her voice."He ought to sleep twelve hours straight," said the Superintendent with
emphasis, "and twenty-four would be better, with suitable breaks for
refreshment," he added in a lighter tone, glancing at Mandy's face."Yes, indeed," she replied, "for he has had little enough to eat the
last three days.And that reminds me--" she hurried to the pantry and
returned with the teapot--"you must be cold, Superintendent.A hot cup of tea will be just the thing.It will take
only five minutes--and it is better than punch, though perhaps you men
do not think so."Cameron," said the Superintendent in a shocked, bantering
voice, "how can you imagine we should be guilty of such heresy--in this
prohibition country, too?""Oh, I know you men," replied Mandy."We keep some Scotch in the
house--beside the laudanum.Some people can't take tea, you know," she
added with an uncertain smile, struggling to regain control of herself."But all the same, I am a nurse, and I know that after exposure tea is
better.""Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I bow to your experience,"
making a brave attempt to meet her mood and declining to note her
unusual excitement.In the specified five minutes the tea was ready."I could quite accept your tea-drinking theory, Mrs.Cameron," said
Inspector Dickson, "if--if, mark you--I should always get such tea as
this.But I don't believe Jerry here would agree."Jerry, who had just entered, stood waiting explanation.Cameron has just been upholding the virtue of a good cup of tea,
Jerry, over a hot Scotch after a cold ride.A slight grin wrinkled the cracks in Jerry's leather-skin face."Hot whisky--good for fun--for cold no good.Whisky good for sleep--for
long trail no good.""Thank you, Jerry," cried Mandy enthusiastically."Oh, that's all right, Jerry," said the Inspector, joining in the
general laugh that followed, "but I don't think Miss Moira here would
agree with you in regard to the merits of her national beverage.""Oh, I am not so sure," cried the young lady, entering into the mood
of the others."Of course, I am Scotch and naturally stand up for my
country and for its customs, but, to be strictly honest, I remember
hearing my brother say that Scotch was bad training for football.""You see, when anything serious is on, the
wisest people cut out the Scotch, as the boys say."Cameron," said the Superintendent, becoming
grave."On the long trail and in the bitter cold we drop the Scotch and
bank on tea.As for whisky, the Lord knows it gives the Police enough
trouble in this country.If it were not for the whisky half our work
would be cut out.he added, as he
handed back his cup for another supply of tea."Done up, or more nearly done up than ever I have seen him, or than I
ever want to see him again."Mandy paused abruptly, handed him his
cup of tea, passed into the pantry and for some moments did not appear
again."Oh, it was terrible to see him," said Moira, clasping her hands and
speaking in an eager, excited voice."He came, poor boy, stumbling
toward the door.He had to leave his horse, you know, some miles away.Through the window we saw him coming along--and we did not know him--he
staggered as if--as if--actually as if he were drunk.""And he could not find the latch--and when we opened
the door his eyes were--oh!--so terrible!--wild--and bloodshot--and
blind!she exclaimed, her voice
breaking and her tears falling fast.We had to cut off his snow-shoes--and his gauntlets and his clothes
were like iron.He could not sit down--he just--just--lay on the
floor--till--my sister--" Here the girl's sobs interrupted her story.The Inspector had risen and came round to Moira's side."Don't try to tell me any more," he said in a husky voice, patting her
gently on the shoulder."He is here with us, safe, poor chap.he cried in an undertone, "what he must have gone through!"At this point Mandy returned and took her place again quietly by the
fire."It was this sudden spell of cold that nearly killed him," she said in a
quiet voice."He was not fully prepared for it, and it caught him at
the end of his trip, too, when he was nearly played out.You see, he was
five weeks away and he had only expected to be three.""I don't know what it was," replied Mandy."He could tell me little, but
he was determined to go on to the fort.""I know something about his plans," said the Inspector."He had proposed
a tour of the reserves, beginning with the Piegans and ending with the
Bloods.""And we know something of his work, too, Mrs."Superintendent Strong has sent us a very fine report
indeed of your husband's work.We do not talk about these things,
you know, in the Police, but we can appreciate them all the same.Superintendent Strong's letter is one you would like to keep.Knowing Superintendent Strong as I do--"

"I know him too," said Mandy with a little laugh."Well, then, you will be able to appreciate all the more any word of
commendation he would utter.He practically attributes the present state
of quiet and the apparent collapse of this conspiracy business to
your husband's efforts.This, of course, is no compensation for his
sufferings or yours, but I think it right that you should know the
facts."The Superintendent had risen to his feet and had delivered his
little speech in his very finest manner."We had expected him back a week ago," said the Inspector."We know he
must have had some serious cause for delay.""I do not know about that," replied Mandy, "but I do know he was most
anxious to go on to the fort.He had some information to give, he said,
which was of the first importance.He will
be saved that trip, which would really be dangerous in his present
condition.And I don't believe I could have stopped him, but I should
have gone with him."Don't think of waking him," said the Superintendent."We can wait two
hours, or three hours, or more if necessary."He would waken himself if he were not so fearfully done up.He has a
trick of waking at any hour he sets," said Mandy.A few minutes later Cameron justified her remarks by appearing from
the inner room.The men, accustomed as they were to the ravages of
the winter trail upon their comrades, started to their feet in horror.Blindly Cameron felt his way to them, shading his blood-shot eyes from
the light.His face was blistered and peeled as if he had come through a
fire, his lips swollen and distorted, his hands trembling and showing
on every finger the marks of frost bite, and his feet dragging as he
shuffled across the floor."My dear fellow, my dear fellow," cried the Inspector, springing up to
meet him and grasping him by both arms to lead him to a chair."You ran
it too close that time.Sit
down, old man, sit down right here."The Inspector deposited him in the
chair, and, striding hurriedly to the window, stood there looking out
upon the bleak winter snow."Hello, Cameron," said the Superintendent, shaking him by the hand with
hearty cheerfulness."Glad, awfully glad to see you.Fine bit of work,
very fine bit of work."I don't know what you refer to, sir," said Cameron, speaking thickly,
"but I am glad you are here, for I have an important communication to
make.""Oh, that's all right," said the Superintendent.Snow-blind, I see," he continued, critically examining him, "and
generally used up.""Rather knocked up," replied Cameron, his tongue refusing to move with
its accustomed ease."But shall be fit in a day or two.Beastly sleepy,
but cannot sleep somehow.Shall feel better when my mind is at rest."Superintendent Strong has sent us in a report, and a very creditable
report, too.""Well, the thing I want to say is
that though all looks quiet--there is less horse stealing this month,
and less moving about from the reserves--yet I believe a serious
outbreak is impending."The Inspector, who had come around and taken a seat beside him, touched
his knee at this point with an admonishing pressure.You
need not have any fear about them."A little smile distorted his face as
he laid his hand upon his wife's shoulder.He was as a man feeling his way through a maze."Oh, let it go," said the Inspector."Wait till you have had some
sleep.""No, I must--I must get this out.Well, anyway, the principal thing
is that Big Bear, Beardy, Poundmaker--though I am not sure about
Poundmaker--have runners on every reserve and they are arranging for
a big meeting in the spring, to which every tribe North and West is to
send representatives.That Frenchman--what's his name?--I'll forget my
own next--"

"Riel?"That Frenchman is planning a big coup in the spring.You
know they presented him with a house the other day, ready furnished, at
Batoche, to keep him in the country.Oh, the half-breeds are very keen
on this.And what is worse, I believe a lot of whites are in with them
too.A chap named Jackson, and another named Scott, and Isbister and
some others.These names are spoken of on every one of our reserves.I tell you, sir," he said, turning his blind eyes toward the
Superintendent, "I consider it very serious indeed.And worst of all,
the biggest villain of the lot, Little Pine, Cree Chief you know, our
bitterest enemy--except Little Thunder, who fortunately is cleared out
of the country--you remember, sir, that chap Raven saw about that.""Well--where was I?--Oh, yes, Little Pine, the biggest villain of them
all, is somewhere about here.I got word of him when I was at the
Blood Reserve on my way home some ten days ago.I heard he was with
the Blackfeet, but I found no sign of him there.But he is in the
neighborhood, and he is specially bound to see old Crowfoot.I
understand he is a particularly successful pleader, and unusually
cunning, and I am afraid of Crowfoot.He was very
cordial and is apparently loyal enough as yet, but you know, sir, how
much that may mean.I think that is all," said Cameron, putting his hand
up to his head."I have a great deal more to tell you, but it will not
come back to me now.Little Pine must be attended to, and for a day or
two I am sorry I am hardly fit--awfully sorry."His voice sank into a
kind of undertone.cried the Superintendent, deeply stirred at the sight of
his obvious collapse.You have
nothing to be sorry for, but everything to be proud of.You have done a
great service to your country, and we will not forget it.In a few days
you will be fit and we shall show our gratitude by calling upon you to
do something more.A horseman had ridden past the
window toward the stables.I would know his splendid horse
anywhere."said the Superintendent, a hard look
upon his face.But the laws of hospitality are nowhere so imperative as on the western
plains.Cameron rose from his chair muttering, "Must look after his
horse.""You sit down," said Mandy firmly."Here, Jerry, go and show him where
to get things, and--" He hesitated."Bring him in," cried Mandy heartily.The men stood silent, looking at
Cameron."Certainly, bring him in," he said firmly, "a day like this," he added,
as if in apology."Why, of course," cried Mandy, looking from one to the other in
surprise.replied Moira, her cheeks burning and her
eyes flashing."You remember," she cried, addressing the Inspector, "how
he saved my life the day I arrived at this ranch.""Oh, yes," replied the Inspector briefly, "I believe I did hear that.""Well, I think he is splendid," repeated Moira."Eh?--well--I can't say I know him very well.""Ah, yes, a most beautiful animal, quite remarkable horse, splendid
horse; in fact one of the finest, if not the very finest, in this whole
country.And that is saying a good deal, too, Miss Moira.You see, this
country breeds good horses."And the Inspector went on to discourse in
full detail and with elaborate illustration upon the various breeds of
horses the country could produce, and to classify the wonderful black
stallion ridden by Raven, and all with such diligence and enthusiasm
that no other of the party had an opportunity to take part in the
conversation till Raven, in the convoy of Jerry, was seen approaching
the house.Cameron, I fear we must take our departure.These are rather
crowded days with us."We can hardly allow
that, you know.Cameron wants to have a great deal more
talk with you."The Superintendent attempted to set forth various other reasons for a
hasty departure, but they all seemed to lack sincerity, and after a few
more ineffective trials he surrendered and sat down again in silence.The next moment the door opened and Raven, followed by Jerry, stepped
into the room.As his eye fell upon the Superintendent, instinctively he
dropped his hands to his hips and made an involuntary movement backward,
but only for an instant.Immediately he came forward and greeted Mandy
with fine, old-fashioned courtesy."So delighted to meet you again, Mrs.Cameron, and also to meet your
charming sister."He shook hands with both the ladies very warmly."Ah, Superintendent," he continued, "delighted to see you.And you,
Inspector," he said, giving them a nod as he laid off his outer leather
riding coat."Hope I see you flourishing," he continued.His debonair
manner had in it a quizzical touch of humor."Ah, Cameron, home again I
see.The men, who had risen to their feet upon his entrance, stood regarding
him stiffly and made no other sign of recognition than a curt nod and a
single word of greeting."You have had quite a trip," he continued, addressing himself to
Cameron, and taking the chair offered by Mandy."I followed you part
way, but you travel too fast for me.Much too strenuous work I found
it.Why," he continued, looking narrowly at Cameron, "you are badly
punished.Raven," said Mandy quickly, for her husband sat
gazing stupidly into the fire."Do you mean to say
that you have been traveling these last three days?""Why, my dear sir, not even the Indians face such cold.Only the Mounted
Police venture out in weather like this--and those who want to get away
from them.His gay, careless laugh rang
out in the most cheery fashion.Mandy could not understand their grim and gloomy silence.By her
cordiality she sought to cover up and atone for the studied and almost
insulting indifference of her husband and her other guests.In these
attempts she was loyally supported by her sister-in-law, whose anger was
roused by the all too obvious efforts on the part of her brother and
his friends to ignore this stranger, if not to treat him with contempt.There was nothing in Raven's manner to indicate that he observed
anything amiss in the bearing of the male members of the company about
the fire.He met the attempt of the ladies at conversation with a
brilliancy of effort that quite captivated them, and, in spite of
themselves, drew the Superintendent and the Inspector into the flow of
talk.As the hour of the midday meal approached Mandy rose from her place by
the fire and said:

"You will stay with us to dinner, Mr.It is
not often we have such a distinguished and interesting company.""I merely looked in to give your husband
a bit of interesting information.And, by the way, I have a bit of
information that might interest the Superintendent as well.""Well," said Mandy, "we are to have the pleasure of the Superintendent
and the Inspector to dinner with us to-day, and you can give them all
the information you think necessary while you are waiting."Raven hesitated while he glanced at the faces of the men beside him.What he read there drew from him a little hard smile of amused contempt."Please do not ask me again, Mrs."You know not how
you strain my powers of resistance when I really dare not--may not," he
corrected himself with a quick glance at the Superintendent, "stay in
this most interesting company and enjoy your most grateful hospitality
any longer.First of all for you,
Cameron--I shall not apologize to you, Mrs.Cameron, for delivering
it in your presence.I do you the honor to believe that you ought to
know--briefly my information is this.Little Pine, in whose movements
you are all interested, I understand, is at this present moment lodging
with the Sarcee Indians, and next week will move on to visit old
Crowfoot.The Sarcee visit amounts to little, but the visit to old
Crowfoot--well, I need say no more to you, Cameron.Probably you know
more about the inside workings of old Crowfoot's mind than I do.""That is his present intention, and I have no doubt the program will
be carried out," said Raven.Of
course," he continued, "I know you have run across the trail of the
North Cree and Salteaux runners from Big Bear and Beardy.But Little Pine is a different person from these
gentlemen.The big game is scheduled for the early spring, will probably
come off in about six weeks.And now," he said, rising from his chair,
"I must be off."At this point Smith came in and quietly took a seat beside Jerry near
the door."And what's your information for me, Mr."You are not going to deprive me of my bit of news?""Ah, yes--news," replied Raven, sitting down again.Little Thunder has yielded to some powerful pressure and has again
found it necessary to visit this country, I need hardly add, against my
desire."exclaimed the Superintendent, and his tone indicated
something more than surprise.And where does this--ah--this--ah--friend of yours propose to locate
himself?""This friend of mine," replied Raven, with a hard gleam in his eye and
a bitter smile curling his lips, "who would gladly adorn his person with
my scalp if he might, will not ask my opinion as to his location, and
probably not yours either, Mr.As Raven ceased speaking
he once more rose from his chair, put on his leather riding coat and
took up his cap and gauntlets.Cameron," he said,
offering her his hand."Believe me, it has been a rare treat to see you
and to sit by your fireside for one brief half-hour."Raven, you are not to think of leaving us before dinner."The trail I take," said Raven in a grave voice, "is full of pitfalls
and I must take it when I can.But his smile awoke no response in the Superintendent, who sat rigidly
silent."It's a mighty cold day outside," interjected Smith, "and blowing up
something I think."blurted out Cameron, who sat stupidly gazing into
the fire, "Stay and eat.This is no kind of day to go out hungry."Thanks, Cameron, it IS a cold day, too cold to stay."He turned swiftly and looked into her soft brown eyes now filled with
warm kindly light."Alas, Miss Cameron," he replied in a low voice, turning his back upon
the others, his voice and his attitude seeming to isolate the girl from
the rest of the company, "believe me, if I do not stay it is not because
I do not want to, but because I cannot."echoed Moira in an equally low tone.Then, raising his voice, "Ask the
Superintendent.said Moira, turning upon the Superintendent, "What does
he mean?""If he cannot remain here
he knows why without appealing to me.""Ah, my dear Superintendent, how unfeeling!You hardly do yourself
justice," said Raven, proceeding to draw on his gloves.His drawling
voice seemed to irritate the Superintendent beyond control."Justice is a word you should hesitate
to use.""You see, Miss Cameron," said Raven with an injured air, "why I cannot
remain.""I do not see," she
repeated, "and if the Superintendent does I think he should explain."It wakened her brother as if from a
daze."Do not interfere where you do not
understand.""Then why make insinuations that cannot be explained?"cried his sister,
standing up very straight and looking the Superintendent fair in the
face.echoed the Superintendent in a cool, almost contemptuous,
voice."There are certain things best not explained, but believe me if
Mr.Quickly Moira turned to Raven with a
gesture of appeal and a look of loyal confidence in her eyes.For a
moment the hard, cynical face was illumined with a smile of rare beauty,
but only for a moment.The gleam passed and the old, hard, cynical face
turned in challenge to the Superintendent.breathed Moira, a thrill of triumphant relief in her voice, "he
cannot explain."cried the little half-breed, quivering with rage.What for he can no h'explain?Dem horse he steal de
night-tam'--dat whiskee he trade on de Indian.He no good--he one
beeg tief.Me--I put him one sure place he no steal no more!"A few moments of tense silence held the group rigid.In the center stood
Raven, his face pale, hard, but smiling, before him Moira, waiting,
eager, with lips parted and eyes aglow with successive passions,
indignation, doubt, fear, horror, grief.Again that swift and subtle
change touched Raven's face as his eyes rested upon the face of the girl
before him."Now you know why I cannot stay," he said gently, almost sadly."It is not true," murmured Moira, piteous appeal in voice and eyes.A
spasm crossed the pale face upon which her eyes rested, then the old
cynical look returned.Cameron," he said with a bow to Mandy, "for
a happy half-hour by your fireside, and farewell.""Good-by," said Mandy sadly."Oh, good-by, good-by," cried the girl impulsively, reaching out her
hand."I shall not forget that you were kind to
me."He bent low before her, but did not touch her outstretched hand.As
he turned toward the door Jerry slipped in before him.he cried excitedly, looking at the Superintendent; but
before the latter could answer a hand caught him by the coat collar
and with a swift jerk landed him on the floor.It was Smith, his face
furiously red.Before Jerry could recover himself Raven had opened the
door and passed out.said Mandy in a hushed, broken voice.Moira stood for a moment as if dazed, then suddenly turned to Smith and
said:

"Thank you.And Smith, red to his hair roots, murmured, "You wanted him to go?""Yes," said Moira, "I wanted him to go."CHAPTER XVI

WAR


Commissioner Irvine sat in his office at headquarters in the little town
of Regina, the capital of the North West Territories of the Dominion.A
number of telegrams lay before him on the table.A look of grave anxiety
was on his face.The cause of his anxiety was to be found in the news
contained in the telegrams.In a few moments Inspector Sanders made his appearance, a tall,
soldierlike man, trim in appearance, prompt in movement and somewhat
formal in speech."Well, the thing has come," said the Commissioner, handing Inspector
Sanders one of the telegrams before him.Inspector Sanders took the
wire, read it and stood very erect."Looks like it, sir," he replied."It is just eight months since I first warned the government that
trouble would come.Superintendent Crozier knows the situation
thoroughly and would not have sent this wire if outbreak were not
imminent.Then here is one from Superintendent Gagnon at Carlton.Inspector Sanders gravely read the second telegram."We ought to have five hundred men on the spot this minute," he said."I have asked that a hundred men be sent up at once," said the
Commissioner, "but I am doubtful if we can get the Government to agree.It seems almost impossible to make the authorities feel the gravity
of the situation.They cannot realize, for one thing, the enormous
distances that separate points that look comparatively near together
upon the map.""And yet," he
continued, "they have these maps before them, and the figures, but
somehow the facts do not impress them.Look at this vast area lying
between these four posts that form an almost perfect quadrilateral.Here is the north line running from Edmonton at the northwest corner
to Prince Albert at the northeast, nearly four hundred miles away;
then here is the south line running from Macleod at the southwest four
hundred and fifty miles to Regina at the southeast; while the sides of
this quadrilateral are nearly three hundred miles long.Thus the four
posts forming our quadrilateral are four hundred miles apart one way by
three hundred another, and, if we run the lines down to the boundary and
to the limit of the territory which we patrol, the disturbed area may
come to be about five hundred miles by six hundred; and we have some
five hundred men available.""It is a good thing we have established the new post at Carlton,"
suggested Inspector Sanders.It is true we have strengthened up that
district recently with two hundred men distributed between Battleford,
Prince Albert, Fort Pitt and Fort Carlton.But Carlton is naturally a
very weak post and is practically of little use to us.True, it guards
us against those Willow Crees and acts as a check upon old Beardy.""A troublesome man, that Kah-me-yes-too-waegs--old Beardy, I mean.It
took me some time to master that one," said Inspector Sanders, "but then
I have studied German.He always has been a nuisance," continued the
Inspector."He was a groucher when the treaty was made in '76 and he has
been a groucher ever since.""If we only had the men, just another five hundred," replied the
Commissioner, tapping the map before him with his finger, "we should
hold this country safe.But what with these restless half-breeds led by
this crack-brained Riel, and these ten thousand Indians--"

"Not to speak of a couple of thousand non-treaty Indians roaming the
country and stirring up trouble," interjected the Inspector."True enough," replied the Commissioner, "but I would have no fear
of the Indians were it not for these half-breeds.They have real
grievances, remember, Sanders, real grievances, and that gives force to
their quarrel and cohesion to the movement.Men who have a conviction
that they are suffering injustice are not easily turned aside.They ride hard and shoot straight and are afraid of
nothing.I confess frankly it looks very serious to me.""For my part," said Inspector Sanders, "it is the Indians I fear most."Really,
one wonders at the docility of the Indians, and their response to fair
and decent treatment.Twenty years ago, no,
fifteen years ago, less than fifteen years ago, these Indians whom we
have been holding in our hand so quietly were roaming these plains,
living like lords on the buffalo and fighting like fiends with each
other, free from all control.Little wonder if, now feeling the pinch of
famine, fretting under the monotony of pastoral life, and being
incited to war by the hot-blooded half-breeds, they should break out
in rebellion.Just this, a feeling
that they have been justly treated, fairly and justly dealt with by the
Government, and a wholesome respect for Her Majesty's North West Mounted
Police, if I do say it myself.But the thing is on, and we must be
ready.""Well, thank God, there is not much to be done in the way of
preparation," replied the Commissioner.For the past six months we have been on the alert for this emergency,
but we must strike promptly.When I think of these settlers about Prince
Albert and Battleford at the mercy of Beardy and that restless and
treacherous Salteaux, Big Bear, I confess to a terrible anxiety.""Then there is the West, sir, as well," said Sanders, "the Blackfeet and
the Bloods."So do I. It is a great matter
that Crowfoot is well disposed toward us, that he has confidence in our
officers and that he is a shrewd old party as well.But Crowfoot is an
Indian and the head of a great tribe with warlike traditions and with
ambitions, and he will find it difficult to maintain his own loyalty,
and much more that of his young men, in the face of any conspicuous
successes by his Indian rivals, the Crees.But," added the Commissioner,
rolling up the map, "I called you in principally to say that I wish you
to have every available man and gun ready for a march at a day's notice.Further, I wish you to wire Superintendent Herchmer at Calgary to
send at the earliest possible moment twenty-five men at least, fully
equipped.We shall need every man we can spare from every post in the
West to send North."They will be ready," said Inspector Sanders, and,
saluting, he left the room.Two days later, on the 18th of March, long before the break of day, the
Commissioner set out on his famous march to Prince Albert, nearly three
hundred miles away.They were but a small
company of ninety men, but every man was thoroughly fit for the part
he was expected to play in the momentous struggle before him; brave, of
course, trained in prompt initiative, skilled in plaincraft, inured to
hardship, oblivious of danger, quick of eye, sure of hand and rejoicing
in fight.Commissioner Irvine knew he could depend upon them to see
through to a finish, to their last ounce of strength and their last
blood-drop, any bit of work given them to do.Past Pie-a-pot's Reserve
and down the Qu'Appelle Valley to Misquopetong's, through the Touchwood
Hills and across the great Salt Plain, where he had word by wire from
Crozier of the first blow being struck at the south branch of the
Saskatchewan where some of Beardy's men gave promise of their future
conduct by looting a store, Irvine pressed his march.Onward along the
Saskatchewan, he avoided the trap laid by four hundred half-breeds at
Batoche's Crossing, and, making the crossing at Agnew's, further down,
arrived at Prince Albert all fit and sound on the eve of the 24th,
completing his two hundred and ninety-one miles in just seven days; and
that in the teeth of the bitter weather of a rejuvenated winter, without
loss of man or horse, a feat worthy of the traditions of the Force of
which he was the head, and of the Empire whose most northern frontier it
was his task to guard.Twenty-four hours to sharpen their horses' calks and tighten up their
cinches, and Irvine was on the trail again en route for Fort Carlton,
where he learned serious disturbances were threatening.Arrived at Fort
Carlton in the afternoon of the same day, the Commissioner found there a
company of men, sad, grim and gloomy.In the fort a dozen of the gallant
volunteers from Prince Albert and Crozier's Mounted Police lay groaning,
some of them dying, with wounds.Others lay with their faces covered,
quiet enough; while far down on the Duck Lake trail still others lay
with the white snow red about them.The story was told the Commissioner
with soldierlike brevity by Superintendent Crozier.The previous day a
storekeeper from Duck Lake, Mitchell by name, had ridden in to report
that his stock of provisions and ammunition was about to be seized by
the rebels.Immediately early next morning a Sergeant of the Police with
some seventeen constables had driven off to prevent these provisions and
ammunition falling into the hands of the enemy.At ten o'clock a scout
came pounding down the trail with the announcement that Sergeant Stewart
was in trouble and that a hundred rebels had disputed his advance.Hard upon the heels of the scout came the Sergeant himself with his
constables to tell their tale to a body of men whose wrath grew as
they listened.More and more furious waxed their rage as they heard
the constables tell of the threats and insults heaped upon them by the
half-breeds and Indians.The Prince Albert volunteers more especially
were filled with indignant rage.To think that half-breeds and
Indians--Indians, mark you!--whom they had been accustomed to regard
with contempt, should have dared to turn back upon the open trail a
company of men wearing the Queen's uniform!The Police officers received the news with philosophic calm.It was
merely an incident in the day's work to them.Sooner or later they would
bring these bullying half-breeds and yelling Indians to task for their
temerity.But the volunteers were undisciplined in the business of receiving
insults.The Superintendent
pointed out that the Commissioner was within touch bringing
reinforcements.It might be wise to delay matters a few hours till his
arrival.But meantime the provisions and ammunition would be looted
and distributed among the enemy, and that was a serious matter.The
impetuous spirit of the volunteers prevailed.Within an hour a hundred
men with a seven-pr.gun, eager to exact punishment for the insults
they had suffered, took the Duck Lake trail.Ambushed by a foe who,
regardless of the conventions of war, made treacherous use of the white
flag, overwhelmed by more than twice their number, hampered in their
evolutions by the deep crusted snow, the little company, after a
half-hour's sharp engagement with the strongly posted enemy, were forced
to retire, bearing their wounded and some of their dead with them,
leaving others of their dead lying in the snow behind them.And now the question was what was to be done?The events of the day
had taught them their lesson, a lesson that experience has taught all
soldiers, the lesson, namely, that it is never safe to despise a foe.A few miles away from them were between three hundred and four hundred
half-breeds and Indians who, having tasted blood, were eager for more.The fort at Carlton was almost impossible of defense.The whole South
country was in the hands of rebels.Companies of half-breeds breathing
blood and fire, bands of Indians, marauding and terrorizing, were
roaming the country, wrecking homesteads, looting stores, threatening
destruction to all loyal settlers and direst vengeance upon all who
should dare to oppose them.The situation called for quick thought and
quick action.Every hour added to the number of the enemy.Whole tribes
of Indians were wavering in their allegiance.Another victory such as
Duck Lake and they would swing to the side of the rebels.The strategic
center of the English settlements in all this country was undoubtedly
Prince Albert.Fort Carlton stood close to the border of the half-breed
section and was difficult of defense.After a short council of war it was decided to abandon Fort Carlton.Thereupon Irvine led his troops, together with the gallant survivors of
the bloody fight at Duck Lake, bearing their dead and wounded with
them, to Prince Albert, there to hold that post with its hundreds of
defenseless women and children gathered in from the country round about,
against hostile half-breeds without and treacherous half-breeds within
the stockade, and against swarming bands of Indians hungry for loot and
thirsting for blood.And there Irvine, chafing against inactivity, eager
for the joyous privilege of attack, spent the weary anxious days of the
next six weeks, held at his post by the orders of his superior officer
and by the stern necessities of the case, and meantime finding some
slight satisfaction in scouting and scouring the country for miles on
every side, thus preventing any massing of the enemy's forces.The affair at Duck Lake put an end to all parley.Riel had been
clamoring for "blood!At Duck Lake he received his first
taste, but before many days were over he was to find that for every drop
of blood that reddened the crusted snow at Duck Lake a thousand Canadian
voices would indignantly demand vengeance.The rifle-shots that rang out
that winter day from the bluffs that lined the Duck Lake trail echoed
throughout Canada from ocean to ocean, and everywhere men sprang to
offer themselves in defense of their country.But echoes of these
rifle-shots rang, too, in the teepees on the Western plains where the
Piegans, the Bloods and the Blackfeet lay crouching and listening.By some mysterious system of telegraphy known only to themselves old
Crowfoot and his braves heard them almost as soon as the Superintendent
at Fort Macleod.Instantly every teepee was pulsing with the fever of
war.The young braves dug up their rifles from their bedding, gathered
together their ammunition, sharpened their knives and tomahawks in eager
anticipation of the call that would set them on the war-path against the
white man who had robbed them of their ancient patrimony and who held
them in such close leash.The great day had come, the day they had been
dreaming of in their hearts, talking over at their council-fires and
singing about in their sun dances during the past year, the day promised
by the many runners from their brother Crees of the North, the day
foretold by the great Sioux orator and leader, Onawata.The war of
extermination had begun and the first blood had gone to the Indian and
to his brother half-breed.Two days after Duck Lake came the word that Fort Carlton had been
abandoned and Battleford sacked.Five days later the news of the bloody
massacre of Frog Lake cast over every English settlement the shadow of
a horrible fear.From the Crow's Nest to the Blackfoot Crossing bands of
braves broke loose from the reserves and began to "drive cattle" for the
making of pemmican in preparation for the coming campaign.It was a day of testing for all Canadians, but especially a day of
testing for the gallant little force of six or seven hundred riders who,
distributed in small groups over a vast area of over two hundred and
fifty thousand square miles, were entrusted with the responsibility of
guarding the lives and property of Her Majesty's subjects scattered in
lonely and distant settlements over these wide plains.For while the Ottawa authorities with
late but frantic haste were hustling their regiments from all parts of
Canada to the scene of war, the Mounted Police had gripped the situation
with a grip so stern that the Indian allies of the half-breed rebels
paused in their leap, took a second thought and decided to wait till
events should indicate the path of discretion.And, to the blood-lusting Riel, Irvine's swift thrust Northward to
Prince Albert suggested caution, while his resolute stand at that
distant fort drove hard down in the North country a post of Empire that
stuck fast and sure while all else seemed to be sliding to destruction.Inspector Dickens, too, another of that fearless band of Police
officers, holding with his heroic little company of twenty-two
constables Fort Pitt in the far North, stayed the panic consequent upon
the Frog Lake massacre and furnished food for serious thought to the
cunning Chief, Little Pine, and his four hundred and fifty Crees, as
well as to the sullen Salteaux, Big Bear, with his three hundred braves.And to the lasting credit of Inspector Dickens it stands that he brought
his little company of twenty-two safe through a hostile country
overrun with excited Indians and half-breeds to the post of Battleford,
ninety-eight miles away.At Battleford, also, after the sacking of the town, Inspector Morris
with two hundred constables behind his hastily-constructed barricade
kept guard over four hundred women and children and held at bay a horde
of savages yelling for loot and blood.Griesbach, in like manner, with his little handful, at Fort
Saskatchewan, held the trail to Edmonton, and materially helped to bar
the way against Big Bear and his marauding band.And similarly at other points the promptness, resource, wisdom and
dauntless resolution of the gallant officers of the Mounted Police
and of the men they commanded saved Western Canada from the complete
subversion of law and order in the whole Northern part of the
territories and from the unspeakable horrors of a general Indian
uprising.But while in the Northern and Eastern part of the Territories the Police
officers rendered such signal service in the face of open rebellion, it
was in the foothill country in the far West that perhaps even greater
service was rendered to Canada and the Empire in this time of peril by
the officers and men of the Mounted Police.It was due to the influence of such men as the Superintendents and
Inspectors of the Police in charge of the various posts throughout
the foothill country more than to anything else that the Chiefs of
the "great, warlike, intelligent and untractable tribes" of Blackfeet,
Blood, Piegan, Sarcee and Stony Indians were prevented from breaking
their treaties and joining with the rebel Crees, Salteaux and
Assiniboines of the North and East.For fifteen years the Chiefs of
these tribes had lived under the firm and just rule of the Police, had
been protected from the rapacity of unscrupulous traders and saved from
the ravages of whisky-runners.It was the proud boast of a Blood Chief
that the Police never broke a promise to the Indian and never failed to
exact justice either for his punishment or for his protection.Hence when the reserves were being overrun by emissaries from the
turbulent Crees and from the plotting half-breeds, in the face of the
impetuous demands of their own young men and of their minor Chiefs to
join in the Great Adventure, the great Chiefs, Red Crow and Rainy Chief
of the Bloods, Bull's Head of the Sarcees, Trotting Wolf of the Piegans,
and more than all, Crowfoot, the able, astute, wise old head of
the entire Blackfeet confederacy, held these young braves back from
rebellion and thus gave time and opportunity to Her Majesty's Forces
operating in the East and North to deal with the rebels.And during those days of strain, strain beyond the estimate of all
not immediately involved, it was the record of such men as the
Superintendents and Inspectors in charge at Fort Macleod, at Fort
Calgary and on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction
in the mountains, and their steady bearing that more than anything else
weighed with the great Chiefs and determined for them their attitude.For with calm, cool courage the Police patrols rode in and out of the
reserves, quietly reasoning with the big Chiefs, smiling indulgently
upon the turbulent minor Chiefs, checking up with swift, firm, but
tactful justice the many outbreaks against law and order, presenting
even in their most desperate moments such a front of resolute
self-confidence to the Indians, and refusing to give any sign by look
or word or act of the terrific anxiety they carried beneath their gay
scarlet coats.And the big Chiefs, reading the faces of these cool,
careless, resolute, smiling men who had a trick of appearing at
unexpected times in their camps and refused to be hurried or worried,
finally decided to wait a little longer.And they waited till the fatal
moment of danger was past and the time for striking--and in the heart
of every Chief of them the desire to strike for larger freedom and
independence lay deep--was gone.To these guardians of Empire who fought
no fight, who endured no siege, who witnessed no massacre, the Dominion
and the Empire owe more than none but the most observing will ever know.Paralleling these prompt measures of the North West Mounted Police, the
Government dispatched from both East and West of Canada regiments of
militia to relieve the beleaguered posts held by the Police, to prevent
the spread of rebellion and to hold the great tribes of the Indians of
the far West true to their allegiance.Already on the 27th of March, before Irvine had decided to abandon Fort
Carlton and to make his stand at Prince Albert, General Middleton had
passed through Winnipeg on his way to take command of the Canadian
Forces operating in the West; and before two weeks more had gone the
General was in command of a considerable body of troops at Qu'Appelle,
his temporary headquarters.From all parts of Canada these men gathered,
from Quebec and Montreal, from the midland counties of Ontario, from
the city of Toronto and from the city of Winnipeg, till some five or six
thousand citizen-soldiers were under arms.They were needed, too, every
man, not so much because of the possible weight of numbers of the enemy
opposing them, nor because of the tactical skill of those leading the
hostile forces, but because of the enemy's advantage of position, owing
to the nature of the country which formed the scene of the Rebellion,
and because of the character of the warfare adopted by their cunning
foe.The record of the brief six weeks' campaign constitutes a creditable
page in Canadian history, a page which no Canadian need blush to read
aloud in the presence of any company of men who know how to estimate at
their highest value those qualities of courage and endurance that are
the characteristics of the British soldier the world over.Superintendent Strong was in a pleasant mood, and the reason was not far
to seek.The distracting period of inaction, of doubt, of hesitation was
past, and now at last something would be done.His term of service along
the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway construction had been far from
congenial to him.There had been too much of the work of the ordinary
patrol-officer about it.True, he did his duty faithfully and
thoroughly, so faithfully, indeed, as to move the great men of the
railway company to outspoken praise, a somewhat unusual circumstance.But now he was called back to the work that more properly belonged to an
officer of Her Majesty's North West Mounted Police and his soul glowed
with the satisfaction of those who, having been found faithful in
uncongenial duty, are rewarded with an opportunity to do a bit of work
which they particularly delight to do.With his twenty-five men, whom for the past year he had been polishing
to a high state of efficiency in the trying work of police-duty in the
railway construction-camp, he arrived in Calgary on the evening of the
tenth of April, to find that post throbbing with military ardor and
thrilling with rumors of massacres and sieges, of marching columns and
contending forces.Small wonder that Superintendent Strong's face took
on an appearance of grim pleasure.Straight to the Police headquarters
he went, but there was no Superintendent there to welcome him.That
gentleman had gone East to meet the troops and was by now under
appointment as Chief of Staff to that dashing soldier, Colonel Otter.But meantime, though the Calgary Police Post was bare of men, there were
other men as keen and as daring, if not so thoroughly disciplined for
war, thronging the streets of the little town and asking only a leader
whom they could follow.It was late evening, but Calgary was an "all night" town, and every
minute was precious, for minutes might mean lives of women and children.So down the street rode Superintendent Strong toward the Royal Hotel.At
the hitching post of that hostelry a sad-looking broncho was tied, whose
calm, absorbed and detached appearance struck a note of discord with his
environment; for everywhere about him men and horses seemed to be in
a turmoil of excitement.Everywhere men in cow-boy garb were careering
about the streets or grouped in small crowds about the saloon doors.There were few loud voices, but the words of those who were doing the
speaking came more rapidly than usual.Such a group was gathered in the rear of the sad-looking broncho before
the door of the Royal Hotel.As the Superintendent loped up upon his
big brown horse the group broke apart and, like birds disturbed at their
feeding, circled about and closed again."Hello, here's Superintendent Strong," said a voice.There were many voices, all eager, and in them just a touch of anxiety."Not a thing do I know," said Superintendent Strong somewhat gravely."I have been up in the mountains and have heard little.I know that the
Commissioner has gone north to Prince Albert.""Yes, I heard we had a reverse there, and I know that General Middleton
has arrived at Qu'Appelle and has either set out for the north or is
about to set out."For a moment there was silence, then a deep voice replied:

"A ghastly massacre, women and children and priests."murmured the Superintendent in a low voice."Yes, half-breeds and Indians," replied the deep voice.The Superintendent sat on his big horse looking at them quietly, then he
said sharply:

"Men, there are some five or six thousand Indians in this district.""I have twenty-five men with me.Superintendent Cotton at Macleod has less than a hundred."The men sat their horses in silence looking at him.One could hear their
deep breathing and see the quiver of the horses under the gripping knees
of their riders.Ever since the news
of the Frog Lake massacre had spread like a fire across the country
these men had been carrying in their minds--rather, in their
hearts--pictures that started them up in their beds at night broad awake
and all in a cold sweat.He had only a single word to say, a short sharp word it was--

"Who will join me?"It was as if his question had released a spring drawn to its limit.From
twenty different throats in twenty different tones, but with a single
throbbing impulse, came the response, swift, full-throated, savage,
"Me!"and in three
minutes Superintendent Strong had secured the nucleus of his famous
scouts."To-morrow at nine at the Barracks!"said this grim and laconic
Superintendent, and was about turning away when a man came out from the
door of the Royal Hotel, drawn forth by that sudden savage yell.said the Superintendent, as the man moved toward the
sad-appearing broncho, "I want you."I am with you," was the reply as Cameron swung on to
his horse.he said to his horse, touching him with
his heel.Ginger woke up with an indignant snort and forthwith fell into
line with the Superintendent's big brown horse.The Superintendent was silent till the Barracks were gained, then,
giving the horses into the care of an orderly, he led Cameron into the
office and after they had settled themselves before the fire he began
without preliminaries."Cameron, I am more anxious than I can say about the situation here in
this part of the country.I have been away from the center of things for
some months and I have lost touch.I want you to let me know just what
is doing from our side.""I do not know much, sir," replied Cameron."I, too, have just come in
from a long parley with Crowfoot and his Chiefs.""Ah, by the way, how is the old boy?""At present he is very loyal, sir,--too loyal almost," said Cameron in
a doubtful tone."Duck Lake sent some of his young men off their heads a
bit, and Frog Lake even more.The Sarcees went wild over Frog Lake, you
know.""Oh, I don't worry about the Sarcees so much."Well, he has managed to hold down his younger Chiefs so far.He made
light of the Frog Lake affair, but he was most anxious to get from
me the fullest particulars of the Duck Lake fight.He made careful
inquiries as to just how many Police were in the fight.I could see that
it gave him a shock to learn that the Police had to retire.He was intensely anxious to learn also--though
he would not allow himself to appear so--just what the Government was
doing.""And what are the last reports from headquarters?You see I have not
been kept fully in touch.I know that the Commissioner has gone north to
Prince Albert and that General Middleton has taken command of the forces
in the West and has gone North with them from Qu'Appelle, but what
troops he has I have not heard.""I understand," replied Cameron, "that he has three regiments of
infantry from Toronto and three from Winnipeg, with the Winnipeg Field
Battery.A regiment from Quebec has arrived and one from Montreal and
there are more to follow."Ah, well," replied the Superintendent, "I know something about the
plan, I believe.There are three objective points, Prince Albert and
Battleford, both of which are now closely besieged, and Edmonton,
which is threatened with a great body of rebel Crees and Salteaux under
leadership of Little Pine and Big Bear.The Police at these points can
hardly be expected to hold out long against the overwhelming numbers
that are besieging them, and I expect that relief columns will be
immediately dispatched.Now, in regard to this district here, do you
know what is being done?""Well, General Strange has come in from his ranch and has offered his
services in raising a local force.""Yes, I was glad to hear that his offer had been accepted and that he
has been appointed to lead an expeditionary force from here to Edmonton.He is an experienced officer and I am sure will do us fine service.Now, about the South," continued the
Superintendent, "what about Fort Macleod?""The Superintendent there has offered himself and his whole force for
service in the North, but General Middleton, I understand, has asked him
to remain where he is and keep guard in this part of the country."The
Crees I do not fear so much.They are more restless and uncertain, but
God help us if the Blackfeet and the Bloods rise!That is why I called
for volunteers to-night.We cannot afford to be without a strong force
here a single day.""I gathered that you got some volunteers to-night.I hope, sir," said
Cameron, "you will have a place for me in your troop?""My dear fellow, nothing would please me better, I assure you," said
the Superintendent cordially."And as proof of my confidence in you I am
going to send you through the South country to recruit men for my troop.But as for you, you cannot leave
your present beat.The Sun Dance Trail cannot be abandoned for one hour.From it you keep an eye upon the secret movements of all the tribes in
this whole region and you can do much to counteract if not to wholly
check any hostile movement that may arise.Indeed, you have already done
more than any one will ever know to hold this country safe during these
last months.Remember, Cameron," added
the Superintendent impressively, "your work lies along the Sun Dance
Trail.On no account and for no reason must you be persuaded to abandon
that post.I shall get into touch with General Strange to-morrow and
shall doubtless get something to do, but if possible I should like you
to give me a day or two for this recruiting business before you take up
again your patrol work along the Sun Dance.""Very well, sir," replied Cameron quietly, trying hard to keep the
disappointment out of his voice."By the way, what are the
Piegans doing?""The Piegans," replied Cameron, "are industriously stealing cattle and
horses.I cannot quite make out just how they can manage to get away
with them.Eagle Feather is apparently running the thing, but there is
someone bigger than Eagle Feather in the game.An additional month or
two in the guardroom would have done that gentleman no harm.""Ah, has he been in the guard-room?"Oh, I pulled him out of the Sun Dance, where I found he had been
killing cattle, and the Superintendent at Macleod gave him two months to
meditate upon his crimes.""But now he is at his old habits again," continued Cameron."But his
is not the brain planning these raids.They are cleverly done and are
getting serious.For instance, I must have lost a score or two of steers
within the last three months.""What are they doing
with them all?""That is what I find difficult to explain.Either they are running them
across the border--though the American Police know nothing of it--or
they are making pemmican."that looks serious," said the Superintendent gravely."It makes me think that some one bigger
than Eagle Feather is at the bottom of all this cattle-running.Sometimes I have thought that perhaps that chap Raven has a hand in it.""He has brain enough and nerve in
plenty for any dare-devil exploit.""But," continued Cameron in a hesitating voice, "I cannot bring myself
to lay this upon him.""He is a cool hand and
desperate."Yes, I know he is all that, and yet--well--in this rebellion, sir,
I believe he is with us and against them."In proof of this Cameron
proceeded to relate the story of Raven's visit to the Big Horn Ranch."So you see," he concluded, "he would not care to work in connection
with the Piegans just now.""I don't know about that--I don't know about that," replied the
Superintendent."Of course he would not work against us directly, but he
might work for himself in this crisis.It would furnish him with a good
opportunity, you see."Yes, that is true, but still--I somehow cannot help liking the chap.""He is a cold-blooded
villain and cattle-thief, a murderer, as you know.If ever I get my hand
on him in this rumpus--Why, he's an outlaw pure and simple!I have
no use for that kind of man at all.The
Superintendent was indignant at the suggestion that any but the severest
measures should be meted out to a man of Raven's type.It was the
instinct and training of the Police officer responsible for the
enforcement of law and order in the land moving within him."But,"
continued the Superintendent, "let us get back to our plans.There must
be a strong force raised in this district immediately.We have the kind
of men best suited for the work all about us in this ranching country,
and I know that if you ride south throughout the ranges you can bring me
back fifty men, and there would be no finer anywhere.""I shall do what I can, sir," replied Cameron, "but I am not sure about
the fifty men."Long they talked over the plans, till it was far past midnight, when
Cameron took his leave and returned to his hotel.He put up his own
horse, looking after his feeding and bedding."You have some work to do, Ginger, for your Queen and country to-morrow,
and you must be fit," he said as he finished rubbing the horse down.And Ginger had work to do, but not that planned for him by his master,
as it turned out.At the door of the Royal Hotel, Cameron found waiting
him in the shadow a tall slim Indian youth."Who are you and what do you want?"As the youth stepped into the light there came to Cameron a dim
suggestion of something familiar about the lad, not so much in his face
as in his figure and bearing.The young man pulled up his trouser leg and showed a scarred ankle."Not" said the youth, throwing back his head with a haughty movement.The young man stood silent, evidently finding speech difficult."Eagle Feather," at length he said, "Little Thunder--plenty Piegan--run
much cattle."He made a sweeping motion with his arm to indicate the
extent of the cattle raid proposed.He shared with all wild things the
fear of inclosed places.Together they walked down the street and came to a restaurant.It is all right," said Cameron, offering his hand.The Indian took the offered hand, laid it upon his heart, then for a
full five seconds with his fierce black eye he searched Cameron's face.Satisfied, he motioned Cameron to enter and followed close on his heel.Never before had the lad been within four walls."Eat," said Cameron when the ordered meal was placed before them.The
lad was obviously ravenous and needed no further urging."Good going," said Cameron, letting his eye run down the lines of the
Indian's lithe figure.The lad's eye gleamed, but he shook his head.Here, John,"
he said to the Chinese waiter, "bring me a pipe.There," said Cameron,
passing the Indian the pipe after filling it, "smoke away."After another swift and searching look the lad took the pipe from
Cameron's hand and with solemn gravity began to smoke.It was to him
far more than a mere luxurious addendum to his meal.It was a solemn
ceremonial sealing a compact of amity between them."Now, tell me," said Cameron, when the smoke had gone on for some time.Slowly and with painful difficulty the youth told his story in terse,
brief sentences."T'ree day," he began, holding up three fingers, "me hear Eagle
Feather--many Piegans--talk--talk--talk.Go fight--keel--keel--keel all
white man, squaw, papoose.""You mean they are waiting for a runner from the North?""If the Crees win the fight then the Piegans will rise?"Come Cree Indian--then Piegan fight.""They will not rise until the runner comes, eh?""This day Eagle Feather run much cattle--beeg--beeg run."The young man
again swept the room with his arm.He is an old squaw," said Cameron.said Cameron, controlling his voice with an
effort.The lad nodded, his piercing eye upon Cameron's face.With startling suddenness he shot out the question.Not a line of the Indian's face moved.He ignored the question, smoking
steadily and looking before him."Ah, it is a strange way for Onawata to repay the white man's kindness
to his son," said Cameron.The contemptuous voice pierced the Indian's
armor of impassivity.Cameron caught the swift quiver in the face
that told that his stab had reached the quick.There is nothing in the
Indian's catalogue of crimes so base as the sin of ingratitude."Onawata beeg Chief--beeg Chief," at length the boy said proudly."He do
beeg--beeg t'ing.""Yes, he steals my cattle," said Cameron with stinging scorn."Little Thunder--Eagle Feather steal
cattle--Onawata no steal.""I am glad to hear it, then," said Cameron."This is a big run of
cattle, eh?""Yes--beeg--beeg run.""What will they do with all those cattle?"But again the Indian ignored his question and remained silently smoking."Why does the son of Onawata come to me?"A soft and subtle change transformed the boy's face.He pulled up his
trouser leg and, pointing to the scarred ankle, said:

"You' squaw good--me two leg--me come tell you take squaw 'way far--no
keel."Me go
now," he said, and passed out.cried Cameron, following him out to the door."Where are you
going to sleep to-night?"The boy waved his hand toward the hills surrounding the little town."Here," said Cameron, emptying his tobacco pouch into the boy's hand."I will tell my squaw that Onawata's son is not ungrateful, that he
remembered her kindness and has paid it back to me."For the first time a smile broke on the grave face of the Indian.He
took Cameron's hand, laid it upon his own heart, and then on Cameron's."You' squaw good--good--much good."He appeared to struggle to find
other words, but failing, and with a smile still lingering upon his
handsome face, he turned abruptly away and glided silent as a shadow
into the starlit night."Not a bad sort," he said to himself as he walked toward the hotel."Pretty tough thing for him to come here and give away his dad's scheme
like that--and I bet you he is keen on it himself too."CHAPTER XVIII

AN OUTLAW, BUT A MAN


The news brought by the Indian lad changed for Cameron all his plans.This cattle-raid was evidently a part of and preparation for the bigger
thing, a general uprising and war of extermination on the part of the
Indians.From his recent visit to the reserves he was convinced that the
loyalty of even the great Chiefs was becoming somewhat brittle and would
not bear any sudden strain put upon it.A successful raid of cattle such
as was being proposed escaping the notice of the Police, or in the teeth
of the Police, would have a disastrous effect upon the prestige of the
whole Force, already shaken by the Duck Lake reverse.The effect of
that skirmish was beyond belief.The victory of the half-breeds was
exaggerated in the wildest degree.His home
and his family and those of his neighbors were in danger of the most
horrible fate that could befall any human being.If the cattle-raid were
carried through by the Piegan Indians its sweep would certainly include
the Big Horn Ranch, and there was every likelihood that his home might
be destroyed, for he was an object of special hate to Eagle Feather and
to Little Thunder; and if Copperhead were in the business he had even
greater cause for anxiety.The Indian boy had taken three days to bring
the news.It would take a day and a night of hard riding to reach his
home.He passed into the hotel, found the
room of Billy the hostler and roused him up."Billy," he said, "get my horse out quick and hitch him up to the
post where I can get him.And Billy, if you love me," he implored, "be
quick!""Don't know what's eatin' you, boss," he said, "but quick's the word."Sandra went back to the bedroom."Martin, old man," cried Cameron, gripping him hard by the shoulder.That Indian boy you and Mandy pulled through
has just come all the way from the Piegan Reserve to tell me of a
proposed cattle-raid and a possible uprising of the Piegans in that
South country.The cattle-raid is coming on at once.The uprising
depends upon news from the Crees.I have promised Superintendent
Strong to spend the next two days recruiting for his new troop.Explain
to him why I cannot do this.Then ride like blazes
to Macleod and tell the Inspector all that I have told you and get him
to send what men he can spare along with you.It will likely finish where the
old Porcupine Trail joins the Sun Dance.Ride by
the ranch and get some of them there to show you the shortest trail.Both Mandy and Moira know it well."Let me get this clear," cried the doctor, holding him
fast by the arm."Two things I have gathered," said the doctor, speaking
rapidly, "first, a cattle-raid, then a general uprising, the uprising
dependent upon the news from the North.You want to block the
cattle-raid?"Then you want me to settle with Superintendent Storm, ride to Macleod
for men, then by your ranch and have them show me the shortest trail to
the junction of the Porcupine and the Sun Dance?""You are right, Martin, old boy.It is a great thing to have a head like
yours.I have been thinking
this thing over and I believe they mean to make pemmican in preparation
for their uprising, and if so they will make it somewhere on the Sun
Dance Trail.Cameron found Billy waiting with Ginger at the door of the hotel."Thank you, Billy," he said, fumbling in his pocket."Hang it, I can't
find my purse.""All right, then," said Cameron, giving him his hand.He caught Ginger by the mane and threw himself on the
saddle."Now, then, Ginger, you must not fail me this trip, if it is your last.A hundred and twenty miles, old boy, and you are none too fresh either.But, Ginger, we must beat them this time.A hundred and twenty miles
to the Big Horn and twenty miles farther to the Sun Dance, that makes
a hundred and forty, Ginger, and you are just in from a hard two days'
ride.For Ginger was showing
signs of eagerness beyond his wont."At all costs this raid must be
stopped," continued Cameron, speaking, after his manner, to his horse,
"not for the sake of a few cattle--we could all stand that loss--but to
balk at its beginning this scheme of old Copperhead's, for I believe
in my soul he is at the bottom of it.We need every
minute, but we cannot afford to make any miscalculations.The last
quarter of an hour is likely to be the worst."So on they went through the starry night.Steadily Ginger pounded the
trail, knocking off the miles hour after hour.There was no pause for
rest or for food.A few mouthfuls of water in the fording of a running
stream, a pause to recover breath before plunging into an icy river, or
on the taking of a steep coulee side, but no more.Hour after hour they
pressed forward toward the Big Horn Ranch.The night passed into morning
and the morning into the day, but still they pressed the trail.Toward the close of the day Cameron found himself within an hour's ride
of his own ranch with Ginger showing every sign of leg weariness and
almost of collapse.cried Cameron, leaning over him and patting his neck.Stick to it, old boy, a
little longer."A little snort and a little extra spurt of speed was the gallant
Ginger's reply, but soon he was forced to sink back again into his
stumbling stride."One hour more, Ginger, that is all--one hour only."As he spoke he leapt from his saddle to ease his horse in climbing a
long and lofty hill.As he surmounted the hill he stopped and swiftly
backed his horse down the hill.Upon the distant skyline his eye had
detected what he judged to be a horseman.His horse safely disposed of,
he once more crawled to the top of the hill.Carefully his eye swept the intervening valley and the hillside beyond,
but only this solitary figure could he see.As his eye rested on him the
Indian began to move toward the west.Cameron lay watching him for some
minutes.From his movements it was evident that the Indian's pace was
being determined by some one on the other side of the hill, for he
advanced now swiftly, now slowly.At times he halted and turned back
upon his track, then went forward again.He was too late now to be of
any service at his ranch.He wrung
his hands in agony to think of what might have happened.He was torn
with anxiety for his family--and yet here was the raid passing onward
before his eyes.One hour would bring him to the ranch, but if this were
the outside edge of the big cattle raid the loss of an hour would mean
the loss of everything.With his eyes still upon the Indian he forced himself to think more
quietly.The secrecy with which the raid was planned made it altogether
likely that the homes of the settlers would not at this time be
interfered with.At all costs
he must do what he could to head off the raid or to break the herd
in some way.But that meant in the first place a ride of twenty or
twenty-five miles over rough country.He crawled back to his horse and found him with his head close to the
ground and trembling in every limb."If he goes this twenty miles," he said, "he will go no more.But it
looks like our only hope, old boy.We must make for our old beat, the
Sun Dance Trail."He mounted his horse and set off toward the west, taking care never to
appear above the skyline and riding as rapidly as the uncertain footing
of the untrodden prairie would allow.At short intervals he would
dismount and crawl to the top of the hill in order to keep in touch
with the Indian, who was heading in pretty much the same direction as
himself.A little further on his screening hill began to flatten
itself out and finally it ran down into a wide valley which crossed
his direction at right angles.He made his horse lie down, still in the
shelter of the hill, and with most painful care he crawled on hands and
knees out to the open and secured a point of vantage from which he could
command the valley which ran southward for some miles till it, in turn,
was shut in by a further range of hills.Far down before him at the
bottom of the valley a line of cattle was visible and hurrying them
along a couple of Indian horsemen.As he lay watching these Indians he
observed that a little farther on this line was augmented by a similar
line from the east driven by the Indian he had first observed, and by
two others who emerged from a cross valley still further on.Prone upon
his face he lay, with his eyes on that double line of cattle and its
hustling drivers.What could one man do to check
it?Similar lines of cattle were coming down the different valleys and
would all mass upon the old Porcupine Trail and finally pour into the
Sun Dance with its many caves and canyons.There was much that was
mysterious in this movement still to Cameron.What could these Indians
do with this herd of cattle?The mere killing of them was in itself a
vast undertaking.He was perfectly familiar with the Indian's method of
turning buffalo meat, and later beef, into pemmican, but the killing,
and the dressing, and the rendering of the fat, and the preparing of the
bags, all this was an elaborate and laborious process.But one thing
was clear to his mind.At all costs he must get around the head of these
converging lines.He waited there till the valley was clear of cattle and Indians, then,
mounting his horse, he pushed hard across the valley and struck a
parallel trail upon the farther side of the hills.Pursuing this trail
for some miles, he crossed still another range of hills farther to the
west and so proceeded till he came within touch of the broken country
that marks the division between the Foothills and the Mountains.He had
not many miles before him now, but his horse was failing fast and he
himself was half dazed with weariness and exhaustion.Night, too, was
falling and the going was rough and even dangerous; for now hillsides
suddenly broke off into sharp cut-banks, twenty, thirty, forty feet
high.It was one of these cut-banks that was his undoing, for in the dim
light he failed to note that the sheep track he was following ended thus
abruptly till it was too late.Had his horse been fresh he could easily
have recovered himself, but, spent as he was, Ginger stumbled, slid and
finally rolled headlong down the steep hillside and over the bank on
to the rocks below.Cameron had just strength to throw himself from the
saddle and, scrambling on his knees, to keep himself from following his
horse.Around the cut-bank he painfully made his way to where his horse
lay with his leg broken, groaning like a human being in his pain.Those lines of cattle were
swiftly and steadily converging upon the Sun Dance.He had before him an
almost impossible achievement.Well he knew that a man on foot could do
little with the wild range cattle.They would speedily trample him into
the ground.But first there was a task that it wrung his heart to perform.His
horse must be put out of pain.He took off his coat, rolled it over his
horse's head, inserted his gun under its folds to deaden the sound and
to hide those luminous eyes turned so entreatingly upon him."Old boy, you have done your duty, and so must I. Good-by, old chap!"He
pulled the fatal trigger and Ginger's work was done.He took up his coat and set off once more upon the winding sheep trail
that he guessed would bring him to the Sun Dance.Dazed, half asleep,
numbed with weariness and faint with hunger, he stumbled on, while the
stars came out overhead and with their mild radiance lit up his rugged
way.Diagonally across the face of
the hill in front of him, a few score yards away and moving nearer, a
horse came cantering.Quickly Cameron dropped behind a jutting rock.Easily, daintily, with never a slip or slide came the horse till he
became clearly visible in the starlight.There was no mistaking that
horse or that rider.No other horse in all the territories could take
that slippery, slithery hill with a tread so light and sure, and no
other rider in the Western country could handle his horse with such
easy, steady grace among the rugged rocks of that treacherous hillside.He
is a villain, a black-hearted villain too.So, HE is the brains behind
this thing.He pulled the
wool over my eyes all right."The rage that surged up through his heart stimulated his dormant
energies into new life.With a deep oath Cameron pulled out both his
guns and set off up the hill on the trail of the disappearing horseman.His weariness fell from him like a coat, the spring came back to his
muscles, clearness to his brain.He was ready for his best fight and he
knew it lay before him.Swiftly, lightly he ran up the hillside.Before him lay a large Indian encampment with rows
upon rows of tents and camp fires with kettles swinging, and everywhere
Indians and squaws moving about.Skirting the camp and still keeping
to the side of the hill, he came upon a stout new-built fence that ran
straight down an incline to a steep cut-bank with a sheer drop of thirty
feet or more.Like a flash the meaning of it came upon him.This was to
be the end of the drive.Here
it was that the pemmican was to be made.On the hillside opposite there
was doubtless a similar fence and these two would constitute the fatal
funnel down which the cattle were to be stampeded over the cut-bank to
their destruction.This was the nefarious scheme planned by Raven and
his treacherous allies.Swiftly Cameron turned and followed the fence up the incline some three
or four hundred yards from the cut-bank.At its upper end the fence
curved outward for some distance upon a wide upland valley, then ceased
altogether.Such was the <DW72> of the hill that no living man could turn
a herd of cattle once entered upon that steep incline.Down the hill, across the valley and up the other side ran Cameron,
keeping low and carefully picking his way among the loose stones till he
came to the other fence which, curving similarly outward, made with its
fellow a perfectly completed funnel.Once between the curving lips of
this funnel nothing could save the rushing, crowding cattle from the
deadly cut-bank below."Oh, if I only had my horse," groaned Cameron, "I might have a chance to
turn them off just here."At the point at which he stood the <DW72> of the hillside fell somewhat
toward the left and away slightly from the mouth of the funnel.A
skilled cowboy with sufficient nerve, on a first-class horse, might turn
the herd away from the cut-bank into the little coulee that led down
from the end of the fence, but for a man on foot the thing was quite
impossible.He determined, however, to make the effort.No man can
certainly tell how cattle will behave when excited and at night.As he stood there rapidly planning how to divert the rush of cattle from
that deadly funnel, there rose on the still night air a soft rumbling
sound like low and distant thunder.It was the pounding of two hundred steers upon the resounding
prairie.He rushed back again to the right side of the fenced runway,
and then forward to meet the coming herd.A half moon rising over the
round top of the hill revealed the black surging mass of steers, their
hoofs pounding like distant artillery, their horns rattling like a
continuous crash of riflery.Before them at a distance of a hundred
yards or more a mounted Indian rode toward the farther side of the
funnel and took his stand at the very spot at which there was some hope
of diverting the rushing herd from the cut-bank down the side coulee to
safety."That man has got to go," said Cameron to himself, drawing his gun.But
before he could level it there shot out from the dim light behind the
Indian a man on horseback.Like a lion on its prey the horse leaped with
a wicked scream at the Indian pony.Before that furious leap both man
and pony went down and rolled over and over in front of the pounding
herd.Over the prostrate pony leaped the horse and up the hillside fair
in the face of that rushing mass of maddened steers.Straight across
their face sped the horse and his rider, galloping lightly, with never
a swerve or hesitation, then swiftly wheeling as the steers drew almost
level with him he darted furiously on their flank and rode close at
their noses.rang the rider's revolver, and two steers
in the far flank dropped to the earth while over them surged the
following herd.Again the revolver rang out, once, twice, thrice, and
at each crack a leader on the flank farthest away plunged down and was
submerged by the rushing tide behind.For an instant the column faltered
on its left and slowly began to swerve in that direction.Then upon the
leaders of the right flank the black horse charged furiously, biting,
kicking, plunging like a thing possessed of ten thousand devils.Steadily, surely the line continued to swerve.cried Cameron, unable to believe his eyes.With wild cries and discharging his revolver fair in the face of the
leaders, Cameron rushed out into the open and crossed the mouth of the
funnel.Cameron's sudden appearance gave the final and
necessary touch to the swerving movement.Across the mouth of the funnel
with its yawning deadly cut-bank, and down the side coulee, carrying
part of the fence with them, the herd crashed onward, with the black
horse hanging on their flank still biting and kicking with a kind of
joyous fury.Thank God,
he is straight after all!"A great tide of gratitude and admiration
for the outlaw was welling up in his heart.But even as he ran there
thundered past him an Indian on horseback, the reins flying loose and a
rifle in his hands.As he flashed past a gleam of moonlight caught his
face, the face of a demon.cried Cameron, whipping out his gun and firing, but
with no apparent effect, at the flying figure.With his gun still in his hand, Cameron ran on down the coulee in the
wake of Little Thunder.Far away could be heard the roar of the rushing
herd, but nothing could be seen of Raven.Running as he had never run in
his life, Cameron followed hard upon the Indian's track, who was by this
time some hundred yards in advance.Suddenly in the moonlight, and far
down the coulee, Raven could be seen upon his black horse cantering
easily up the <DW72> and toward the swiftly approaching Indian.Raven heard, looked up and saw the Indian bearing down upon him.His
horse, too, saw the approaching foe and, gathering himself, in two short
leaps rushed like a whirlwind at him, but, swerving aside, the Indian
avoided the charging stallion.Cameron saw his rifle go up to his
shoulder, a shot reverberated through the coulee, Raven swayed in his
saddle.A second shot and the black horse was fair upon the Indian pony,
hurling him to the ground and falling himself upon him.As the Indian
sprang to his feet Raven was upon him.He gripped him by the throat and
shook him as a dog shakes a rat.Once, twice, his pistol fell upon the
snarling face and the Indian crumpled up and lay still, battered to
death.cried Cameron, as he came up, struggling with his sobbing
breath."Yes, I have got him," said Raven, with his hand to his side, "but I
guess he has got me too.His eye fell upon his horse
lying upon his side and feebly kicking--"ah, I fear he has got you as
well, Nighthawk, old boy."As he staggered over toward his horse the
sound of galloping hoofs was heard coming down the coulee."All right, Cameron, my boy, just back up here beside me," said Raven,
as he coolly loaded his empty revolver."We can send a few more of these
devils to hell.You are a good sport, old chap, and I want to go out in
no better company."Raven had sunk to his knees beside his horse.They gathered round him, a
Mounted Police patrol picked up on the way by Dr.Martin, Moira who had
come to show them the trail, and Smith."Nighthawk, old boy," they heard Raven say, his hand patting the
shoulder of the noble animal, "he has done for you, I fear."His voice
came in broken sobs.The great horse lifted his beautiful head and
looked round toward his master."Ah, my boy, we have done many a journey
together!"cried Raven as he threw his arm around the glossy neck, "and
on this last one too we shall not be far apart."The horse gave a slight
whinny, nosed into his master's hand and laid his head down again.A
slight quiver of the limbs and he was still for ever.cried Raven, "my best, my only friend.""No, no," cried Cameron, "you are with friends now, Raven, old man."You are a true man, if God ever made one, and
you have shown it to-night."said Raven, with a kind of sigh as he sank back and leaned up
against his horse.It is long since I have had a
friend."said the doctor, kneeling down beside him and tearing
open his coat and vest."He is--" The
doctor paused abruptly.Moira threw
herself on her knees beside the wounded man and caught his hand."Oh, it
is cold, cold," she cried through rushing tears.The doctor was silently and swiftly working with his syringe."Half an hour, perhaps less," said the doctor brokenly.Cameron," he said, his voice
beginning to fail, "I want you to send a letter which you will find in
my pocket addressed to my brother.And add this,
that I forgive him.It was really not worth while," he added wearily,
"to hate him so.And say to the Superintendent I was on the straight
with him, with you all, with my country in this rebellion business.I
heard about this raid; and I fancy I have rather spoiled their pemmican.I have run some cattle in my time, but you know, Cameron, a fellow who
has worn the uniform could not mix in with these beastly breeds against
the Queen, God bless her!"Martin," cried the girl piteously, shaking him by the arm, "do
not tell me you can do nothing.She began again to
chafe the cold hand, her tears falling upon it."You are weeping for me, Miss Moira?"he said, surprise and wonder in
his face.A horse-thief, an outlaw, for me?And
forgive me--may I kiss your hand?"He tried feebly to lift her hand to
his lips.and leaning over him she kissed
him on the brow."Thank you," he said feebly, a rare, beautiful smile lighting up the
white face."You make me believe in God's mercy."There was a quick movement in the group and Smith was kneeling beside
the dying man.Raven," he said in an eager voice, "is infinite."Oh, yes," he said with a quaintly humorous smile, "you are the chap
that chucked Jerry away from the door?"Smith nodded, then said earnestly:

"Mr.Raven, you must believe in God's mercy.""God's mercy," said the dying man slowly.'God--be--merciful--to me--a sinner.'"Once more he opened his
eyes and let them rest upon the face of the girl bending over him."Yes," he said, "you helped me to believe in God's mercy."With a sigh
as of content he settled himself quietly against the shoulders of his
dead horse."Good old comrade," he said, "good-by!"He closed his eyes and drew a
deep breath.They waited for another, but there was no more.Ochone, but he was the gallant gentleman!"she wailed, lapsing into her Highland speech."Oh, but he had the brave
heart and the true heart.She swayed back and forth
upon her knees with hands clasped and tears running down her cheeks,
bending over the white face that lay so still in the moonlight and
touched with the majesty of death.said her brother surprised at her unwonted
display of emotion.She is in a hard spot," said Dr.Martin
in a sharp voice in which grief and despair were mingled.It was the face of a haggard old
man."You are used up, old boy," he said kindly, putting his hand on the
doctor's arm.And you too, Miss
Moira," he added gently."Come," giving her his hand, "you must get
home."There was in his voice a tone of command that made the girl look
up quickly and obey."Smith, the constable and I will look after--him--and the horse.Without further word the brother and sister mounted their horses."Good-night," said the doctor shortly."Good-night," she said simply, her eyes full of a dumb pain."Good-by, Miss Moira," said the doctor, who held her hand for just a
moment as if to speak again, then abruptly he turned his back on her
without further word and so stood with never a glance more after her.It was for him a final farewell to hopes that had lived with him and had
warmed his heart for the past three years.Now they were dead, dead as
the dead man upon whose white still face he stood looking down."Thief, murderer, outlaw," he muttered to himself.And yet you could not help it, nor could she."But he was not
thinking of the dead man's record in the books of the Mounted Police.CHAPTER XIX

THE GREAT CHIEF


On the rampart of hills overlooking the Piegan encampment the sun
was shining pleasantly.The winter, after its final savage kick, had
vanished and summer, crowding hard upon spring, was wooing the bluffs
and hillsides on their southern exposures to don their summer robes of
green.Not yet had the bluffs and hillsides quite yielded to the wooing,
not yet had they donned the bright green apparel of summer, but there
was the promise of summer's color gleaming through the neutral browns
and grays of the poplar bluffs and the sunny hillsides.The crocuses
with reckless abandon had sprung forth at the first warm kiss of the
summer sun and stood bravely, gaily dancing in their purple and gray,
till whole hillsides blushed for them.And the poplars, hesitating with
dainty reserve, shivered in shy anticipation and waited for a surer
call, still wearing their neutral tints, except where they stood
sheltered by the thick spruces from the surly north wind.There they
had boldly cast aside all prudery and were flirting in all their gallant
trappings with the ardent summer.Seeing none of all this, but dimly conscious of the good of it, Cameron
and his faithful attendant Jerry lay grimly watching through the
poplars.Three days had passed since the raid, and as yet there was no
sign at the Piegan camp of the returning raiders.Not for one hour
had the camp remained unwatched.Just long enough to bury his new-made
friend, the dead outlaw, did Cameron himself quit the post, leaving
Jerry on guard meantime, and now he was back again, with his glasses
searching every corner of the Piegan camp and watching every movement.There was upon his face a look that filled with joy his watchful
companion, a look that proclaimed his set resolve that when Eagle
Feather and his young men should appear in camp there would speedily be
swift and decisive action.For three days his keen eyes had looked forth
through the delicate green-brown screen of poplar upon the doings of the
Piegans, the Mounted Police meantime ostentatiously beating up the Blood
Reserve with unwonted threats of vengeance for the raiders, the bruit of
which had spread through all the reserves."Don't do anything rash," the Superintendent had admonished, as Cameron
appeared demanding three troopers and Jerry, with whom to execute
vengeance upon those who had brought death to a gallant gentleman and
his gallant steed, for both of whom there had sprung up in Cameron's
heart a great and admiring affection."No, sir," Cameron had replied, "nothing rash; we will do a little
justice, that is all," but with so stern a face that the Superintendent
had watched him away with some anxiety and had privately ordered a
strong patrol to keep the Piegan camp under surveillance till Cameron
had done his work.But there was no call for aid from any patrol, as it
turned out; and before this bright summer morning had half passed away
Cameron shut up his glasses, ready for action."I think they are all in now, Jerry," he said.There is that devil Eagle Feather just riding in."Cameron's teeth went hard together on the name of the Chief, in whom
the leniency of Police administration of justice had bred only a deeper
treachery.Within half an hour Cameron with his three troopers and Jerry rode
jingling into the Piegan camp and disposed themselves at suitable
points of vantage.Straight to the Chief's tent Cameron rode, and found
Trotting Wolf standing at its door."I want that cattle-thief, Eagle Feather," he announced in a clear, firm
voice that rang through the encampment from end to end."Eagle Feather not here," was Trotting Wolf's sullen but disturbed
reply."Trotting Wolf, I will waste no time on you," said Cameron, drawing his
gun.There was in Cameron's voice a ring of such compelling command that
Trotting Wolf weakened visibly."I know not where Eagle Feather--"

"Halt there!"cried Cameron to an Indian who was seen to be slinking
away from the rear of the line of tents.Like a whirlwind Cameron was on his trail
and before he had gained the cover of the woods had overtaken him.cried Cameron again as he reached the Indian's side.The Indian
stopped and drew a knife.Leaning
down over his horse's neck Cameron struck the Indian with the butt of
his gun.Before he could rise the three constables in a converging rush
were upon him and had him handcuffed.cried Cameron in a furious voice,
riding his horse into the crowd that had gathered thick about him."Ah,
I see you," he cried, touching his horse with his heel as on the farther
edge of the crowd he caught sight of his man.With a single bound his
horse was within touch of the shrinking Indian.cried Cameron, springing from his horse and striding to the Chief.he
added, as Eagle Feather stood irresolute before him.Upon the uplifted
hands Cameron slipped the handcuffs."Come with me, you cattle-thief,"
he said, seizing him by the gaudy handkerchief that adorned his neck,
and giving him a quick jerk."Trotting Wolf," said Cameron in a terrible voice, wheeling furiously
upon the Chief, "this cattle-thieving of your band must stop.I want the
six men who were in that cattle-raid, or you come with me.said Jerry, hugging himself in his delight, to the trooper who
was in charge of the first Indian."Look lak' he tak' de whole camp.""By Jove, Jerry, it looks so to me, too!He has got the fear of death on
these chappies.Cameron's face was gray, with purple blotches, and
distorted with passion, his eyes were blazing with fury, his manner one
of reckless savage abandon.The rumors
of vengeance stored up for the raiders, the paralyzing effect of the
failure of the raid, the condemnation of a guilty conscience, but
above all else the overmastering rage of Cameron, made anything like
resistance simply impossible.In a very few minutes Cameron had his
prisoners in line and was riding to the Fort, where he handed them over
to the Superintendent for justice.That business done, he found his patrol-work pressing upon him with a
greater insistence than ever, for the runners from the half-breeds and
the Northern Indians were daily arriving at the reserves bearing
reports of rebel victories of startling magnitude.But even without
any exaggeration tales grave enough were being carried from lip to lip
throughout the Indian tribes.Small wonder that the irresponsible young
Chiefs, chafing under the rule of the white man and thirsting for the
mad rapture of fight, were straining almost to the breaking point the
authority of the cooler older heads, so that even that subtle redskin
statesman, Crowfoot, began to fear for his own position in the Blackfeet
confederacy.As the days went on the Superintendent at Macleod, whose duty it was to
hold in statu quo that difficult country running up into the mountains
and down to the American boundary-line, found his task one
