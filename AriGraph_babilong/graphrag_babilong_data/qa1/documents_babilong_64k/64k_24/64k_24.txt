Were the neutral nations only to do this, which it is their
direct interest to do, England, as a nation depending on the commerce of
neutral nations in time of war, dare not molest them, and France would
not But whilst, from want of a common system, they individually permit
England to do it, because individually they cannot resist it, they put
France under the necessity of doing the same thing.The supreme of all
laws, in all cases, is that of self-preservation."It is a notable illustration of the wayward course of political
evolution, that the English republic--for it is such--grew largely out
of the very parts of its constitution once so oppressive.The foreign
origin of the royal family helped to form its wholesome timidity about
meddling with politics, allowing thus a development of ministerial
government.The hereditary character of the throne, which George
III.'s half-insane condition associated with the recklessness of
irresponsibility, was by his complete insanity made to serve ministerial
independence.Regency is timid about claiming power, and childhood
cannot exercise it.The decline of royal and aristocratic authority in
England secured freedom to commerce, which necessarily gave hostages to
peace.The protection of neutral commerce at sea, concerning which Paine
wrote so much, ultimately resulted from English naval strength, which
formerly scourged the world.To Paine, England, at the close of 1797, could appear only as a
dragon-guarded prison of fair Humanity.The press was paralyzed,
thinkers and publishers were in prison, some of the old orators like
Erskine were bought up, and the forlorn hope of liberty rested only with
Fox and his fifty in Parliament, overborne by a majority made brutal by
strength.The groans of imprisoned thought in his native land reached
its outlawed representative in Paris.And at the same time the inhuman
decree went forth from that country that there should be no peace with
France.It had long been his conviction that the readiness of Great
Britain to go to war was due to an insular position that kept the
horrors at a distance.This conviction,
which we have several times met in these pages, returned to him with new
force when England now insisted on more bloodshed.He was convinced that
the right course of France would be to make a descent on England, ship
the royal family to Hanover, open the political prisons, and secure the
people freedom to make a Constitution.These views, freely expressed
to his friends of the Directory and Legislature, reached the ears of
Napoleon on his triumphal return from Italy.The great man called upon Paine in his little room, and invited him
to dinner.He made the eloquent professions of republicanism so
characteristic of Napoleons until they became pretenders.He told Paine
that he slept with the "Rights of Man" under his pillow, and that its
author ought to have a statue of gold.*

     * Rickman, p.He consulted Paine about a descent on England, and adopted the plan.He
invited the author to accompany the expedition, which was to consist of
a thousand gun-boats, with a hundred men each.Paine consented, "as
[so he wrote Jefferson] the intention of the expedition was to give the
people of England an opportunity of forming a government for themselves,
and thereby bring about peace."One of the points to be aimed at was
Norfolk, and no doubt Paine indulged a happy vision of standing once
more in Thetford and proclaiming liberty throughout the land!The following letter (December 29, 1797) from Paine to Barras is in the
archives of the Directory, with a French translation:

"Citizen President,--A very particular friend of mine, who had a
passport to go to London upon some family affairs and to return in three
months, and whom I had commissioned upon some affairs of my own (for
I find that the English government has seized upon a thousand pounds
sterling which I had in the hands of a friend), returned two days ago
and gave me the memorandum which I enclose:--the first part relates only
to my publication on the event of the 18 Fructidor, and to a letter to
Erskine (who had been counsel for the prosecution against a former
work of mine the 'Age of Reason') both of which I desired my friend to
publish in London.The other part of the memorandum respects the state
of affairs in that country, by which I see they have little or no idea
of a descent being made upon them; tant mieux--but they will be guarded
in Ireland, as they expect a descent there."I expect a printed copy of the letter to Erskine in a day or two.As
this is in English, and on a subject that will be amusing to the Citizen
Revelliere Le Peaux, I will send it to him.The friend of whom I speak
was a pupil of Dessault the surgeon, and whom I once introduced to
you at a public audience in company with Captain Cooper on his plan
respecting the Island of Bermuda.--Salut et Respect."{1798}

Thus once again did the great hope of a liberated, peaceful, and
republican Europe shine before simple-hearted Paine.He was rather poor
now, but gathered up all the money he had, and sent it to the Council of
Five Hundred.The accompanying letter was read by Coupe at the sitting
of January 28, 1798:

"Citizens Representatives,--Though it is not convenient to me, in the
present situation of my affairs, to subscribe to the loan towards the
descent upon England, my economy permits me to make a small patriotic
donation.I send a hundred livres, and with it all the wishes of my
heart for the success of the descent, and a voluntary offer of any
service I can render to promote it."There will be no lasting peace for France, nor for the world, until
the tyranny and corruption of the English government be abolished, and
England, like Italy, become a sister republic.As to those men, whether
in England, Scotland, or Ireland, who, like Robespierre in France, are
covered with crimes, they, like him, have no other resource than in
committing more.But the mass of the people are the friends of liberty:
tyranny and taxation oppress them, but they deserve to be free."Accept, Citizens Representatives, the congratulations of an old
colleague in the dangers we have passed, and on the happy prospect
before us.Coupe added: "The gift which Thomas Paine offers you appears very
trifling, when it is compared with the revolting injustice which this
faithful friend of liberty has experienced from the English government;
but compare it with the state of poverty in which our former colleague
finds himself, and you will then think it considerable."He moved that
the notice of this gift and Thomas Paine's letter be printed."Mention
honorable et impression," adds the Moniteur.The President of the Directory at this time was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, a
friend of the Theophilanthropic Society.To him Paine gave, in English,
which the president understood, a plan for the descent, which was
translated into French, and adopted by the Directory.Two hundred and
fifty gun-boats were built, and the expedition abandoned.To Jefferson,
Paine intimates his suspicion that it was all "only a feint to cover the
expedition to Egypt, which was then preparing."He also states that the
British descent on Ostend, where some two thousand of them were made
prisoners, "was in search of the gun-boats, and to cut the <DW18>s, to
prevent their being assembled."This he was told by Vanhuile, of Bruges,
who heard it from the British officers.After the failure of his attempt to return to America with the Monroes,
Paine was for a time the guest of Nicolas de Bonneville, in Paris,
and the visit ended in an arrangement for his abode with that family.Bonneville was an editor, thirty-seven years of age, and had been one of
the five members of Paine's Republican Club, which placarded Paris with
its manifesto after the king's flight in 1791.An enthusiastic
devotee of Paine's principles from youth, he had advocated them in
his successive journals, _Le Tribun du Peuple, Bouche de Fer, and
Bien Informe_.He had resisted Marat and Robespierre, and suffered
imprisonment during the Terror.He spoke English fluently, and was
well known in the world of letters by some striking poems, also by his
translation into French of German tales, and parts of Shakespeare.He
had set up a printing office at No.4 Rue du Theatre-Francais, where he
published liberal pamphlets, also his _Bien Informe_.Then, in 1794, he
printed in French the "Age of Reason."He also published, and probably
translated into French, Paine's letter to the now exiled Camille
Jordan,--"Lettre de Thomas Paine, sur les Cultes."Paine, unable to
converse in French, found with the Bonnevilles a home he needed.M. and
Madame Bonneville had been married three years, and their second child
had been named after Thomas Paine, who stood as his godfather.Paine,
as we learn from Rickman, who knew the Bonnevilles, paid board, but no
doubt he aided Bonneville more by his pen.With public affairs, either in France or America, Paine now mingled but
little.The election of John Adams to the presidency he heard of with
dismay.He wrote to Jefferson that since he was not president, he was
glad he had accepted the vice-presidency, "for John Adams has such a
talent for blundering and offending, it will be necessary to keep an eye
over him."Finding, by the abandonment of a descent on.England for
one on Egypt, that Napoleon was by no means his ideal missionary of
republicanism, he withdrew into his little study, and now remained so
quiet that some English papers announced his arrival and cool reception
in America.He was, however, fairly bored with visitors from all parts
of the world, curious to see the one international republican left.It became necessary for Madame Bonneville, armed with polite
prevarications, to defend him from such sight-seers.For what with
his visits to and from the Barlows, the Smiths, and his friends of the
Directory, Paine had too little time for the inventions in which he was
again absorbed,--his "Saints."Among his intimate friends at this time
was Robert Fulton, then residing in Paris.Paine's extensive studies
of the steam-engine, and his early discovery, of its adaptability to
navigation, had caused Rumsey to seek him in England, and Fitch to
consult him both in America and Paris.Paine's connection with the
invention of the steamboat was recognized by Fulton, as indeed by all of
his scientific contemporaries.* To Fulton he freely gave his ideas,
and may perhaps have had some hope that the steamboat might prove a
missionary of international republicanism, though Napoleon had failed.* Sir Richard Phillips says: "In 1778 Thomas Paine proposed,
     in America, this application of steam."("Million of Facts,"
     p.As Sir Richard assisted Fulton in his experiments
     on the Thames, he probably heard from him the fact about
     Paine, though, indeed, in the controversy between Rumsey and
     Fitch, Paine's priority to both was conceded.In America,
     however, the priority really belonged to the eminent
     mechanician William Henry, of Lancaster, Pa.When Fitch
     visited Henry, in 1785, he was told by him that he was not
     the first to devise steam-navigation; that he himself had
     thought of it in 1776, and mentioned it to Andrew Ellicott;
     and that Thomas Paine, while a guest at his house in 1778,
     had spoken to him on the subject I am indebted to Mr.John
     W. Jordan, of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, for
     notes from the papers of Henry, his ancestor, showing that
     Paine's scheme was formed without knowledge of others, and
     that it contemplated a turbine application of steam to a
     wheel.Both he and Henry, as they had not published their
     plans, agreed to leave Fitch the whole credit.Fitch
     publicly expressed his gratitude to Paine.Thurston adds
     that Paine, in 1788, proposed that Congress should adopt the
     whole matter for the national benefit.("History of the
     Growth of the Steam Engine," pp.It will not be forgotten that in the same year in which Paine startled
William Henry with a plan for steam-navigation, namely in 1778, he wrote
his sublime sentence about the "Religion of Humanity."The steamships,
which Emerson described as enormous shuttles weaving the races of
men into the woof of humanity, have at length rendered possible that
universal human religion which Paine foresaw.In that old Lancaster
mansion of the Henrys, which still stands, Paine left his spectacles,
now in our National Museum; they are strong and far-seeing; through them
looked eyes held by visions that the world is still steadily following.One cannot suppress some transcendental sentiment in view of
the mystical harmony of this man's inventions for human
welfare,--mechanical, political, religious.Of his gunpowder motor,
mention has already been made (i., p.On this he was engaged
about the time that he was answering Bishop Watson's book on the "Age of
Reason."He could not believe, he said,
that the qualities of gunpowder--the small and light grain with maximum
of force--were meant only for murder, and his faith in the divine
humanity is in the sentence.To supersede destroying gunpowder with
beneficent gunpowder, and to supersede the god of battles with the God
of Love, were kindred aims in Paine's heart Through the fiery furnaces
of his time he had come forth with every part of his being welded and
beaten and shaped together for this Human Service.Patriotism, in the
conventional sense, race-pride, sectarianism, partizanship, had been
burnt out of his nature.The universe could not have wrung from his
tongue approval of a wrong because it was done by his own country.It might be supposed that there were no heavier trials awaiting Paine's
political faith than those it had undergone.But it was becoming evident
that liberty had not the advantage he once ascribed to truth over
error,--"it cannot be unlearned."The United States had unlearned it as
far as to put into the President's hands a power of arbitrarily crushing
political opponents, such as even George III.The
British Treaty had begun to bear its natural fruits.Washington signed
the Treaty to avoid war, and rendered war inevitable with both France
and England.The affair with France was happily a transient squall, but
it was sufficient to again bring on Paine the offices of an American
Minister in France.Many an American in that country had occasion to
appreciate his powerful aid and unfailing kindness.Among these was
Captain Rowland Crocker of Massachusetts, who had sailed with a letter
of marque.'His vessel was captured by the French, and its wounded
commander brought to Paris, where he was more agreeably conquered by
kindness.Freeman's "History of Cape Cod" (of which region Crocker was a
native) has the following:

"His [Captain Crocker's] reminiscences of his residence in that country,
during the most extraordinary period of its history, were of a highly
interesting character.He had taken the great Napoleon by the hand; he
had familiarly known Paine, at a time when his society was sought for
and was valuable.Of this noted individual, we may in passing say, with
his uniform and characteristic kindness, he always spoke in terms which
sounded strange to the ears of a generation which has been taught, with
or without justice, to regard the author of 'The Age of Reason' with
loathing and abhorrence.He remembered Paine as a well-dressed and most
gentlemanly man, of sound and orthodox republican principles, of a good
heart, a strong intellect, and a fascinating address."{1799}

The _coup d'etat_ in America, which made President Adams virtual
emperor, pretended constitutionality, and was reversible.That which
Napoleon and Sieves--who had his way at last--effected in France
(November 9, 1799) was lawless and fatal.The peaceful Bonneville home
was broken up.Bonneville, in his _Bien Informe_ described Napoleon as
"a Cromwell," and was promptly imprisoned.Paine, either before or soon
after this catastrophe, went to Belgium, on a visit to his old friend
Vanhuile, who had shared his cell in the Luxembourg prison.Vanhuile
was now president of the municipality of Bruges, and Paine got from him
information about European affairs.On his return he found Bonneville
released from prison, but under severe surveillance, his journal being
suppressed.The family was thus reduced to penury and anxiety, but there
was all the more reason that Paine should stand by them.He continued
his abode in their house, now probably supported by drafts on his
resources in America, to which country they turned their thoughts.{1800}

The European Republic on land having become hopeless, Paine turned
his attention to the seas.He wrote a pamphlet on "Maritime Compact,"
including in it ten articles for the security of neutral commerce, to
be signed by the nations entering the "Unarmed Association," which he
proposed.This scheme was substantially the same as that already quoted
from his letter "To the People of France, and to the French Armies."It was translated by Bonneville, and widely circulated in Europe.Paine
sent it in manuscript to Jefferson, who at once had it printed.His
accompanying letter to Jefferson (October i, 1800) is of too much
biographical interest to be abridged.* Oliver Ellsworth, William V. Murray, and William R. Davie,
     were sent by President Adams to France to negotiate a
     treaty.There is little doubt that the famous letter of Joel
     Barlow to Washington, October 2, 1798, written in the
     interest of peace, was composed after consultation with
     Paine.Adams, on reading the letter, abused Barlow."Tom
     Paine," he said, "is not a more worthless fellow."But he
     obeyed the letter.The Commissioners he sent were associated
     with the anti-French and British party in America, but peace
     with America was of too much importance to the new despot of
     France for the opportunity to be missed of forming a Treaty."Dear Sir,--I wrote to you from Havre by the ship Dublin Packet in the
year 1797.It was then my intention to return to America; but there were
so many British frigates cruising in sight of the port, and which after
a few days knew that I was at Havre waiting to go to America, that I did
not think it best to trust myself to their discretion, and the more so,
as I had no confidence in the Captain of the Dublin Packet (Clay).I
mentioned to you in that letter, which I believe you received thro'
the hands of Colonel [Aaron] Burr, that I was glad since you were not
President that you had accepted the nomination of Vice President.have been here about eight months,
and three more useless mortals never came upon public business.Their
presence appears to me to have been rather an injury than a benefit They
set themselves up for a faction as soon as they arrived.Upon my return to Paris I learned they had made a point of not
returning the visits of Mr.Skipwith and Barlow, because, they said,
they had not the confidence of the executive.Every known republican was
treated in the same manner.Miller of Philadelphia,
who had occasion to see them upon business, that they did not intend to
return my visit, if I made one.This I supposed it was intended I should
know, that I might not make one.I told him, I did not come to see him as a
commissioner, nor to congratulate him upon his mission; that I came to
see him because I had formerly known him in Congress.I mean not, said
I, to press you with any questions, or to engage you in any conversation
upon the business you are come upon, but I will nevertheless candidly
say that I know not what expectations the Government or the people of
America may have of your mission, or what expectations you may have
yourselves, but I believe you will find you can do but little.The
treaty with England lies at the threshold of all your business.The
American Government never did two more foolish things than when it
signed that Treaty and recalled Mr.Monroe, who was the only man could
do them any service.Ellsworth put on the dull gravity of a Judge,
and was silent.I added, you may perhaps make a treaty like that you
have made with England, which is a surrender of the rights of the
American flag; for the principle that neutral ships make neutral
property must be general or not at all.I then changed the subject, for
I had all the talk to myself upon this topic, and enquired after Sam.Adams, (I asked nothing about John,) Mr.Monroe, and
others of my friends, and the melancholy case of the yellow fever,--of
which he gave me as circumstantial an account as if he had been summing
up a case to a Jury.Ellsworth been as
cunning as a statesman, or as wise as a Judge, he would have returned my
visit that he might appear insensible of the intention of mine."I now come to the affairs of this country and of Europe.You will, I
suppose, have heard before this arrives to you, of the battle of
Marengo in Italy, where the Austrians were defeated--of the armistice
in consequence thereof, and the surrender of Milan, Genoa, etc., to
the french--of the successes of the french army in Germany--and the
extension of the armistice in that quarter--of the preliminaries of
peace signed at Paris--of the refusal of the Emperor [of Austria] to
ratify these preliminaries--of the breaking of the armistice by the
french Government in consequence of that refusal--of the 'gallant'
expedition of the Emperor to put himself at the head of his Army--of his
pompous arrival there--of his having made his will--of prayers being put
in all his churches for the preservation of the life of this Hero--of
General Moreau announcing to him, immediately on his arrival at the
Army, that hostilities would commence the day after the next at sunrise,
unless he signed the treaty or gave security that he would sign within
45 days--of his surrendering up three of the principal keys of Germany
(Ulm, Philipsbourg, and Ingolstad), as security that he would sign them.This is the state things [they] are now in, at the time of writing this
letter; but it is proper to add that the refusal of the Emperor to sign
the preliminaries was motived upon a note from the King of England to be
admitted to the Congress for negociating Peace, which was consented to
by the french upon the condition of an armistice at Sea, which England,
before knowing of the surrender the Emperor had made, had refused.From
all which it appears to me, judging from circumstances, that the Emperor
is now so compleatly in the hands of the french, that he has no way of
getting out but by a peace.The Congress for the peace is to be held
at Luneville, a town in france.Since the affair of Rastadt the french
commissioners will not trust themselves within the Emperor's territory.I know not what the Commissioners have
done, but from a paper I enclose to you, which appears to have
some authority, it is not much.The paper as you will perceive is
considerably prior to this letter.I knew that the Commissioners before
this piece appeared intended setting off.It is therefore probable that
what they have done is conformable to what this paper mentions, which
certainly will not atone for the expence their mission has incurred,
neither are they, by all the accounts I hear of them, men fitted for the
business."But independently of these matters there appears to be a state of
circumstances rising, which if it goes on, will render all partial
treaties unnecessary.In the first place I doubt if any peace will be
made with England; and in the second place, I should not wonder to see a
coalition formed against her, to compel her to abandon her insolence on
the seas.This brings me to speak of the manuscripts I send you.1, without any title, was written in consequence of
a question put to me by Bonaparte.As he supposed I knew England
and English Politics he sent a person to me to ask, that in case of
negociating a Peace with Austria, whether it would be proper to include
England.Julian was in Paris, on the part of the
Emperor negociating the preliminaries:--which as I have before said the
Emperor refused to sign on the pretence of admitting England.2, entitled _On the Jacobinism of the English at
Sea_, was written when the English made their insolent and impolitic
expedition to Denmark, and is also an auxiliary to the politic of No.I shewed it to a friend [Bonneville] who had it translated into french,
and printed in the form of a Pamphlet, and distributed gratis among the
foreign Ministers, and persons in the Government.It was immediately
copied into several of the french Journals, and into the official Paper,
the Moniteur.It appeared in this paper one day before the last
dispatch arrived from Egypt; which agreed perfectly with what I had said
respecting Egypt.It hit the two cases of Denmark and Egypt in the exact
proper moment.3, entitled _Compact Maritime_, is the sequel of No.It is translating at the time I write this letter,
and I am to have a meeting with the Senator Garat upon the subject.The pieces 2 and 3 go off in manuscript to England, by a confidential
person, where they will be published."By all the news we get from the North there appears to be something
meditating against England.It is now given for certain that Paul has
embargoed all the English vessels and English property in Russia till
some principle be established for protecting the Rights of neutral
Nations, and securing the liberty of the Seas.The preparations in
Denmark continue, notwithstanding the convention that she has made with
England, which leaves the question with respect to the right set up by
England to stop and search Neutral vessels undecided.I send you the
paragraphs upon the subject."The tumults are great in all parts of England on account of the
excessive price of corn and bread, which has risen since the harvest.Daniel journeyed to the bedroom.I attribute it more to the abundant increase of paper, and the
non-circulation of cash, than to any other cause, People in trade
can push the paper off as fast as they receive it, as they did by
continental money in America; but as farmers have not this opportunity
they endeavor to secure themselves by going considerably in advance."I have now given you all the great articles of intelligence, for I
trouble not myself with little ones, and consequently not with the
Commissioners, nor any thing they are about, nor with John Adams,
otherwise than to wish him safe home, and a better and wiser man in his
place."In the present state of circumstances and the prospects arising from
them, it may be proper for America to consider whether it is worth her
while to enter into any treaty at this moment, or to wait the event of
those circumstances which, if they go on will render partial treaties
useless by deranging them.But if, in the mean time, she enters into
any treaty it ought to be with a condition to the following purpose:
Reserving to herself the right of joining in an association of Nations
for the protection of the Rights of Neutral Commerce and the security of
the liberty of the Seas."The pieces 2, 3, may go to the press.They will make a small pamphlet
and the printers are welcome to put my name to it.It is best it should
be put from thence; they will get into the newspapers.I know that the
faction of John Adams abuses me pretty heartily.It
does not disturb me, and they lose their labour; and in return for it I
am doing America more service, as a neutral nation, than their expensive
Commissioners can do, and she has that service from me for nothing.1 is only for your own amusement and that of your friends."I come now to speak confidentially to you on a private subject.Ellsworth and Davie return to America, Murray will return to
Holland, and in that case there will be nobody in Paris but Mr.Skipwith
that has been in the habit of transacting business with the french
Government since the revolution began.He is on a good standing with
them, and if the chance of the day should place you in the presidency
you cannot do better than appoint him for any purpose you may have
occasion for in France.He is an honest man and will do his country
Justice, and that with civility and good manners to the government he
is commissioned to act with; a faculty which that Northern Bear Timothy
Pickering wanted, and which the Bear of that Bear, John Adams, never
possessed.Murray, otherwise than of his unfriendliness to
every American who is not of his faction, but I am sure that Joel Barlow
is a much fitter man to be in Holland than Mr.It is upon
the fitness of the man to the place that I speak, for I have not
communicated a thought upon the subject to Barlow, neither does he
know, at the time of my writing this (for he is at Havre), that I have
intention to do it."I will now, by way of relief, amuse you with some account of the
progress of Iron Bridges.Burke's attack
upon it, drew me off from any pontifical Works.Since my coming from
England in '92, an Iron Bridge of a single arch 236 feet span versed
sine 34 feet, has been cast at the Iron Works of the Walkers where my
model was, and erected over the river Wear at Sunderland in the county
of Durham in England.The two members in Parliament for the County,
Mr.Milbank, were the principal subscribers; but the
direction was committed to Mr.A very sincere friend of mine,
Sir Robert Smyth, who lives in france, and whom Mr.Monroe well knows,
supposing they had taken their plan from my model wrote to Mr.Milbank answered the letter, which answer I have
by me and I give you word for word the part concerning the Bridge: 'With
respect to the Bridge over the river Wear at Sunderland it certainly is
a Work well deserving admiration both for its structure, durability
and utility, and I have good grounds for saying that the first Idea was
taken from Mr.Paine's bridge exhibited at Paddington.But with respect
to any compensation to Mr.Paine, however desirous of rewarding the
labours of an ingenious man, I see not how it is in my power, having had
nothing to do with his bridge after the payment of my subscription, Mr.But if you can point out
any mode by which I can be instrumental in procuring for Mr.P. any
compensation for the advantages which the public may have derived from
his ingenious model, from which certainly the outlines of the Bridge
at Sunderland was taken, be assured it will afford me very great
satisfaction.'"I have now made two other models, one is pasteboard, five feet span
and five inches of height from the cords.It is in the opinion of every
person who has seen it one of the most beautiful objects the eye can
behold.I then cast a model in Metal following the construction of that
in pasteboard and of the same dimensions.The whole was executed in my
own Chamber.It is far superior in strength, elegance, and readiness in
execution to the model I made in America, and which you saw in Paris.I
shall bring those Models with me when I come home, which will be as soon
as I can pass the seas in safety from the piratical John Bulls."I suppose you have seen, or have heard of the Bishop of Landaff's
answer to my second part of the Age of reason.As soon as I got a
copy of it I began a third part, which served also as an answer to the
Bishop; but as soon as the clerical Society for promoting _Christian
Knowledge_ knew of my intention to answer the Bishop, they prosecuted,
as a Society, the printer of the first and second parts, to prevent that
answer appearing.No other reason than this can be assigned for their
prosecuting at the time they did, because the first part had been in
circulation above three years and the second part more than one, and
they prosecuted immediately on knowing that I was taking up their
Champion.Burke's attack on the french
revolution; served me as a back-ground to bring forward other subjects
upon, with more advantage than if the background was not there.This is
the motive that induced me to answer him, otherwise I should have gone
on without taking any notice of him.I have made and am still making
additions to the manuscript, and shall continue to do so till an
opportunity arrive for publishing it."If any American frigate should come to france, and the direction of
it fall to you, I will be glad you would give me the opportunity of
returning.The abscess under which I suffered almost two years is
entirely healed of itself, and I enjoy exceeding good health.This is
the first of October, and Mr.Skipwith has just called to tell me the
Commissioners set off for Havre tomorrow.This will go by the frigate
but not with the knowledge of the Commissioners.Remember me with much
affection to my friends and accept the same to yourself."As the Commissioners did not leave when they expected, Paine added
several other letters to Jefferson, on public affairs.In one (October
1st) he says he has information of increasing aversion in the English
people to their government."It was the hope of conquest, and is now the
hope of peace that keeps it [Pitt's administration] up."When
suspicion wakes the credit vanishes as the dream would.""England has a
large Navy, and the expense of it leads to her ruin."The English nation
is tired of war, longs for peace, "and calculates upon defeat as
it would upon victory."On October 4th, after the Commissioners had
concluded a treaty, Paine alludes to an article said to be in it,
requiring certain expenditures in France, and says that if he,
Jefferson, be "in the chair, and not otherwise," he should offer himself
for this business, should an agent be required "It will serve to defray
my expenses until I can return, but I wish it may be with the condition
of returning.I am not tired of working for nothing, but I cannot afford
it.This appointment will aid me in promoting the object I am now upon
of a law of nations for the protection of neutral commerce."On October
6th he reports to Jefferson that at an entertainment given the American
envoys, Consul Le Brun gave the toast: "A l'union de l'Amerique avec les
puissances du Nord pour faire respecter la liberte des mers."On October
15th the last of his enclosures to Jefferson is written.He says that
Napoleon, when asked if there would be more war, replied: "Nous
n'aurions plus qu'une guerre d'ecritoire."In all of Paine's writing
about Napoleon, at this time, he seems as if watching a thundercloud,
and trying to make out meteorologically its drift, and where it will
strike.{1801}

On July 15, 1801, Napoleon concluded with Pius VII.Naturally, the first victim offered on the restored altar was
Theophilan-thropy.I have called Paine the founder of this Society,
because it arose amid the controversy excited by the publication of "Le
Siecle de la Raison," its manual and tracts reproducing his ideas and
language; and because he gave the inaugural discourse.Theism was little
known in France save as iconoclasm, and an assault on the Church: Paine
treated it as a Religion.But, as he did not speak French, the practical
organization and management of the Society were the work of others, and
mainly of a Russian named Hauey.There had been a good deal of odium
incurred at first by a society which satisfied neither the pious nor the
freethinkers, but it found a strong friend on the Directory.This
was Larevelliere-Lepeaux, whose secretary, Antoine Vallee, and young
daughter, had become interested in the movement.This statesman never
joined the Society, but he had attended one of its meetings, and, when
a distribution of religious edifices was made, Theophilanthropy was
assigned ten parish churches.It is said that when Larevelliere-Lepeaux
mentioned to Talleyrand his desire for the spread of this Society, the
diplomat said: "All you have to do is to get yourself hanged, and revive
the third day."Paine, who had pretty nearly fulfilled that requirement,
saw the Society spread rapidly, and he had great hopes of its future.also had an interested eye on it, and though the
Concordat did not go into legal operation until 1802, Theophilanthropy
was offered as a preliminary sacrifice in October, 1801.The description of Paine by Walter Savage Landor, and representations
of his talk, in the "Imaginary Conversations," so mix up persons, times,
and places, that I was at one time inclined to doubt whether the two had
met.J. M. Wheeler, a valued correspondent in London, writes
me: "Landor told my friend Mr.Birch of Florence that he particularly
admired Paine, and that he visited him, having first obtained an
interview at the house of General Dumouriez.Landor declared that Paine
was always called 'Tom,' not out of disrespect, but because he was a
jolly good fellow."An interview with Paine at the house of Dumouriez
could only have occurred when the General was in Paris, in 1793.This
would account for what Landor says of Paine taking refuge from trouble
in brandy.There had been, as, Rickman testifies, and as all the facts
show, nothing of this kind since that period.It would appear therefore
that Landor must have mixed up at least two interviews with Paine, one
in the time of Dumouriez, the other in that of Napoleon.Not even
such an artist as Landor could invent the language ascribed to Paine
concerning the French and Napoleon."The whole nation may be made as enthusiastic about a salad as about a
constitution; about the colour of a cockade as about a consul or a king.You will shortly see the real strength and figure of Bonaparte.He is
wilful, headstrong, proud, morose, presumptuous; he will be guided no
longer; he has pulled the pad from his forehead, and will break his nose
or bruise his cranium against every table, chair, and brick in the room,
until at last he must be sent to the hospital."Paine prophesies that Napoleon will make himself emperor, and that "by
his intemperate use of power and thirst of dominion" he will cause the
people to "wish for their old kings, forgetting what beasts they were."Normandy" Landor disguises Thomas Poole,
referred to on a preceding page.Normandy's sufferings on account of one
of Paine's books are not exaggerated.Sanford's work is printed
a letter from Paris, July 20, 1802, in which Poole says: "I called one
Morning on Thomas Paine.Striking,
strong physiognomy.Said a great many quaint things, and read us part of
a reply which he intends to publish to Watson's 'Apology.'"* "Thomas Poole and His Friends," ii., p.Paine seems to have had no relation with the ruling powers at this time,
though an Englishman who visited him is quoted by Rickman (p.198) as
remarking his manliness and fearlessness, and that he spoke as freely as
ever after Bonaparte's supremacy.One communication only to any member
of the government appears; this was to the Minister of the Interior
concerning a proposed iron bridge over the Seine.* Political France and
Paine had parted.Under date of March 18, 1801, President Jefferson informs Paine that he
had sent his manuscripts (Maritime Compact) to the printer to be made
into a pamphlet, and that the American people had returned from their
frenzy against France.He adds:

"You expressed a wish to get a passage to this country in a public
vessel.Dawson is charged with orders to the captain of the Maryland
to receive and accommodate you back if you can be ready to depart
at such short warning.R. Livingston is appointed minister
plenipotentiary to the republic of France, but will not leave this till
we receive the ratification of the convention by Mr.** I am in
hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments worthy of former
times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily labored, and with
as much effect as any man living.That you may long live to continue
your useful labors and to reap the reward in the thankfulness of
nations, is my sincere prayer.Accept assurances of my high esteem and
affectionate attachment."*  "The Minister of the Interior to Thomas Paine: I have
     received, Citizen, the observations that you have been so
     good as to address to me upon the construction of iron
     bridges.They will be of the greatest utility to us when the
     new kind of construction goes to be executed for the first
     time.With pleasure I assure you, Citizen, that you have
     rights of more than one kind to the gratitude of nations,
     and I give you, cordially, the expression of my particular
     esteem.--Chaptal."It is rather droll, considering the appropriation of his
     patent in England, and the confiscation of a thousand pounds
     belonging to him, to find Paine casually mentioning that at
     this time a person came from London with plans and drawings
     to consult with him about an iron arch of 600 feet, over the
     Thames, then under consideration by a committee of the House
     of Commons.**  "Beau Dawson," an eminent Virginia Congressman.The subjoined notes are from letters of Paine to Jefferson:

_Paris, June 9, 1801_.Dawson gave me
the real sensation of happy satisfaction, and what served to increase
it was that he brought it to me himself before I knew of his arrival.There has been no circumstance
with respect to America since the times of her revolution that excited
so much attention and expectation in France, England, Ireland, and
Scotland as the pending election for President of the United States, nor
any of which the event has given more general joy:

"I thank you for the opportunity you give me of returning by the
Maryland, but I shall wait the return of the vessel that brings Mr."The Parliamentaire, from America to Havre,
was taken in going out, and carried into England.The pretence, as the
papers say, was that a Swedish Minister was on board for America.If
I had happened to have been there, I suppose they would have made no
ceremony in conducting me on shore."*




{1802}

_Paris, March 17,1802_."As it is now Peace, though the definitive
Treaty is not yet signed, I shall set off by the first opportunity from
Havre or Dieppe, after the equinoctial gales are over.I continue in
excellent health, which I know your friendship will be glad to hear
of.--Wishing you and America every happiness, I remain your former
fellow-labourer and much obliged fellow-citizen."Paine's determination not to return to America in a national vessel was
owing to a paragraph he saw in a Baltimore paper, headed "Out at Last."It stated that Paine had written to the President, expressing a wish to
return by a national ship, and that "permission was given."There was
here an indication that Jefferson's invitation to Paine by the Hon.John
Dawson had become known to the President's enemies, and that Jefferson,
on being attacked, had apologized by making the matter appear an act
of charity.Paine would not believe that the President was personally
responsible for the apologetic paragraph, which seemed inconsistent with
the cordiality of the letter brought by Dawson; but, as he afterwards
wrote to Jefferson, "it determined me not to come by a national ship."*
His request had been made at a time when any other than a national
American ship was pretty certain to land him in an English prison.There
was evidently no thought of any _eclat_ in the matter, but no doubt a
regard for economy as well as safety.Jefferson had been charged
     with sending a national ship to France for the sole purpose
     of bringing Paine home, and Paine himself would have been
     the first to condemn such an assumption of power.Although
     the President's adherents thought it right to deny this,
     Jefferson wrote to Paine that he had nothing to do with the
     paragraph."With respect to the letter [offering the ship] I
     never hesitate to avow and justify it in conversation.In no
     other way do I trouble myself to contradict anything which
     is said.At that time, however, there were anomalies in the
     motions of some of our friends which events have at length
     reduced to regularity."The following to the eminent deist lecturer in New York, Elihu Palmer,
bears the date, "Paris, February 21, 1802, since the Fable of Christ":

"Dear Friend, I received, by Mr.Livingston, the letter you wrote me,
and the excellent work you have published ["The Principles of Nature"].I see you have thought deeply on the subject, and expressed your
thoughts in a strong and clear style.The hinting and intimating manner
of writing that was formerly used on subjects of this kind, produced
skepticism, but not conviction.Some people
can be reasoned into sense, and others must be shocked into it.Say a
bold thing that will stagger them, and they will begin to think."There is an intimate friend of mine, Colonel Joseph Kirk-bride of
Bordentown, New Jersey, to whom I would wish you to send your work.He
is an excellent man, and perfectly in our sentiments.You can send it by
the stage that goes partly by land and partly by water, between New York
and Philadelphia, and passes through Bordentown."I expect to arrive in America in May next.I have a third part of the
Age of Reason to publish when I arrive, which, if I mistake not, will
make a stronger impression than any thing I have yet published on the
subject."I write this by an ancient colleague of mine in the French Convention,
the citizen Lequinio, who is going [as] Consul to Rhode Island, and who
waits while I write.The following, dated July 8, 1802, to Consul Rotch, is the last letter I
find written by Paine from Paris:

"My Dear Friend,--The bearer of this is a young man that wishes to go
to America.He is willing to do anything on board a ship to lesson the
expense of his passage.If you know any captain to whom such a person
may be usefull I will be obliged to you to speak to him about it.Otte was to come to Paris in order to go to America, I wanted
to take a passage with him, but as he stays in England to negociate some
arrangements of Commerce, I have given up that idea.I wait now for the
arrival of a person from England whom I want to see,** after which, I
shall bid adieu to restless and wretched Europe.I am with affectionate
esteem to you and Mrs.Rotch,

"Yours,

"Thomas Paine."* J. M. Lequinio, author of "Prejudices Destroyed," and
     other rationalistic works, especially dealt with in
     Priestley's "Letters to the Philosophers of France."The President's cordial letter had raised a happy vision before the eyes
of one sitting amid the ruins of his republican world.As he said of
Job, he had "determined, in the midst of accumulating ills, to impose
upon himself the hard duty of contentment."Of the comrades with whom he
began the struggle for liberty in France but a small circle remained.As he wrote to Lady Smith,--from whom he must now part,--"I might almost
say like Job's servant, 'and I only am escaped.'"Of the American and
English friends who cared for him when he came out of prison few remain.The President's letter came to a poor man in a small room, furnished
only with manuscripts and models of inventions.Here he was found by
an old friend from England, Henry Redhead Yorke, who, in 1795, had been
tried in England for sedition.Yorke has left us a last glimpse of the
author in "wretched and restless Europe."The "rights of man" had become
so antiquated in Napoleon's France, that Yorke found Paine's name odious
on account of his antislavery writings, the people "ascribing to his
espousal of the rights of the <DW64>s of St.Domingo the resistance
which Leclercq had experienced from them."A "jolly-looking woman" (in whom we recognize
Madame Bonneville) scrutinized Yorke severely, but was smiling enough
on learning that he was Paine's old friend.He was ushered into a little
room heaped with boxes of documents, a chaos of pamphlets and journals.While Yorke was meditating on the contrast between this habitation of a
founder of two great republics and the mansions of their rulers, his old
friend entered, dressed in a long flannel gown."Time seemed to have made dreadful ravages over his whole frame, and a
settled melancholy was visible on his countenance.He desired me to be
seated, and although he did not recollect me for a considerable time,
he conversed with his usual affability.I confess I felt extremely
surprised that he should have forgotten me; but I resolved not to make
myself known to him, as long as it could be avoided with propriety.In
order to try his memory, I referred to a number of circumstances which
had occurred while we were in company, but carefully abstained from
hinting that we had ever lived together.He would frequently put his
hand to his forehead, and exclaim, 'Ah!I know that voice, but my
recollection fails!'At length I thought it time to remove his suspense,
and stated an incident which instantly recalled me to his mind.It
is impossible to describe the sudden change which this effected; his
countenance brightened, he pressed me by the hand, and a silent tear
stole down his cheek.For some
time we sat without a word escaping from our lips.'Thus are we met once
more, Mr.Paine,' I resumed, 'after a long separation of ten years,
and after having been both of us severely weather-beaten.''Aye,' he
replied, 'and who would have thought that we should meet in Paris?'He then enquired what motive had brought me here, and on my explaining
myself, he observed with a smile of contempt, 'They have shed blood
enough for liberty, and now they have it in perfection.This is not a
country for an honest man to live in; they do not understand any thing
at all of the principles of free government, and the best way is to
leave them to themselves.You see they have conquered all Europe, only
to make it more miserable than it was before.'Upon this, I remarked
that I was surprised to hear him speak in such desponding language of
the fortune of mankind, and that I thought much might yet be done for
the Republic.he exclaimed, 'do you call this a Republic?Why they are worse off than the slaves of Constantinople; for there,
they expect to be bashaws in heaven by submitting to be slaves below,
but here they believe neither in heaven nor hell, and yet are slaves by
choice.I know of no Republic in the world except America, which is the
only country for such men as you and I. It is my intention to get away
from this place as soon as possible, and I hope to be off in the autumn;
you are a young man and may see better times, but I have done with
Europe, and its slavish politics.'"I have often been in company with Mr.Paine, since my arrival here, and
I was not a little surprised to find him wholly indifferent about the
public spirit in England, or the remaining influence of his doctrines
among its people.Indeed he seemed to dislike the mention of the
subject; and when, one day, in order to provoke discussion, I told him
I had altered my opinions upon many of his principles, he answered, 'You
certainly have the right to do so; but you cannot alter the nature
of things; the French have alarmed all honest men; but still truth is
truth.Though you may not think that my principles are practicable in
England, without bringing on a great deal of misery and confusion, you
are, I am sure, convinced of their justice.'Here he took occasion to
speak in terms of the utmost severity of Mr------, who had obtained
a seat in parliament, and said that 'parsons were always mischievous
fellows when they turned politicians.'This gave rise to an observation
respecting his 'Age of Reason,' the publication of which I said had
lost him the good opinion of numbers of his English advocates.He
became uncommonly warm at this remark, and in a tone of singular energy
declared that he would not have published it if he had not thought it
calculated to 'inspire mankind with a more exalted idea of the Supreme
Architect of the Universe, and to put an end to villainous imposture.'He then broke out with the most violent invectives against our received
opinions, accompanying them at the same time with some of the most grand
and sublime conceptions of an Omnipotent Being, that I ever heard or
read of.In the support of his opinion, he avowed himself ready to
lay down his life, and said 'the Bishop of Llandaff may roast me in
Smithfield if he likes, but human torture cannot shake my conviction.'He reached down a copy of the Bishop's work, interleaved with remarks
upon it, which he read me; after which he admitted the liberality of
the Bishop, and regretted that in all controversies among men a similar
temper was not maintained.But in proportion as he appeared listless in
politics, he seemed quite a zealot in his religious creed; of which the
following is an instance.An English lady of our acquaintance, not less
remarkable for her talents than for elegance of manners, entreated me to
contrive that she might have an interview with Mr.In consequence
of this I invited him to dinner on a day when we were to be favoured
with her company.But as she is a very rigid Roman Catholic I cautioned
Mr.Paine, beforehand, against touching upon religious subjects,
assuring him at the same time that she felt much interested to make his
acquaintance.With much good nature he promised to be _discreet_.... For
above four hours he kept every one in astonishment and admiration of
his memory, his keen observation of men and manners, his numberless
anecdotes of the American Indians, of the American war, of Franklin,
Washington, and even of his Majesty, of whom he told several curious
facts of humour and benevolence.His remarks on genius and taste can
never be forgotten by those present.Thus far everything went on as I
could wish; the sparkling champagne gave a zest to his conversation,
and we were all delighted.an expression relating to his
'Age of Reason' having been mentioned by one of the company, he broke
out immediately.He began with Astronomy,--addressing himself to Mrs.Y.,--he declared that the least inspection of the motion of the stars
was a convincing proof that Moses was a liar.In
vain I attempted to change the subject, by employing every artifice in
my power, and even attacking with vehemence his political principles.He returned to the charge with unabated ardour.I called upon him for a
song though I never heard him sing in my life.He struck up one of
his own composition; but the instant he had finished it he resumed his
favourite topic.I felt extremely mortified, and remarked that he had
forgotten his promise, and that it was not fair to wound so deeply the
opinions of the ladies.said he, 'they 'll come again.What a pity
it is that people should be so prejudiced!'To which I retorted that
their prejudices might be virtues.'If so,' he replied, 'the blossoms
may be beautiful to the eye, but the root is weak.'One of the most
extraordinary properties belonging to Mr.Paine is his power of
retaining everything he has written in the course of his life.It is
a fact that he can repeat word for word every sentence in his 'Common
Sense,' 'Rights of Man,' etc., etc.The Bible is the only book which he
has studied, and there is not a verse in it that is not familiar to him.In shewing me one day the beautiful models of two bridges he had devised
he observed that Dr.Franklin once told him that 'books are written to
please, houses built for great men, churches for priests, but no bridges
for the people.'These models exhibit an extraordinary degree not only
of skill but of taste; and are wrought with extreme delicacy entirely
by his own hands.The largest is nearly four feet in length; the iron
works, the chains, and every other article belonging to it, were forged
and manufactured by himself.It is intended as the model of a bridge
which is to be constructed across the Delaware, extending 480 feet with
only one arch.The other is to be erected over a lesser river,
whose name I forget, and is likewise a single arch, and of his own
workmanship, excepting the chains, which, instead of iron, are cut out
of pasteboard, by the fair hand of his correspondent the 'Little Corner
of the World,' whose indefatigable perseverance is extraordinary.He was
offered L3000 for these models and refused it.The iron bars, which
I before mentioned that I noticed in a corner of his room, were also
forged by himself, as the model of a crane, of a new description.He put
them together, and exhibited the power of the lever to a most surprising
degree."'*"Letters from France," etc., London, 1804, 2 vols., 8vo.Thirty-three pages of the last letter are devoted to Paine.About this time Sir Robert Smith died, and another of the ties to Paris
was snapped.His beloved Bonnevilles promised to follow him to the New
World.His old friend Rickman has come over to see him off, and observed
that "he did not drink spirits, and wine he took moderately; he even
objected to any spirits being laid in as a part of his sea-stock."These
two friends journeyed together to Havre, where, on September 1st, the
way-worn man begins his homeward voyage.Poor Rickman, the perpetually
prosecuted, strains his eyes till the sail is lost, then sits on the
beach and writes his poetical tribute to Jefferson and America for
recalling Paine, and a touching farewell to his friend:

     "Thus smooth be thy waves, and thus gentle the breeze,
     As thou bearest my Paine far away;
     O waft him to comfort and regions of ease,
     Each blessing of freedom and friendship to seize,
     And bright be his setting sun's ray."Who can imagine the joy of those eyes when they once more beheld the
distant coast of the New World!Fifteen years have passed,--years
in which all nightmares became real, and liberty's sun had turned to
blood,--since he saw the happy land fading behind him.Oh, America,
thine old friend who first claimed thy republican independence, who laid
aside his Quaker coat and fought for thy cause, believing it sacred, is
returning to thy breast!This is the man of whom Washington wrote: "His
writings certainly had a powerful effect on the public mind,--ought they
not then to meet an adequate return?It is
not money he needs now, but tenderness, sympathy; for he comes back from
an old world that has plundered, outlawed, imprisoned him for his love
of mankind.He has seen his dear friends sent to the guillotine, and
others are pining in British prisons for publishing his "Rights of
Man,"--principles pronounced by President Jefferson and Secretary
Madison to be those of the United States.Heartsore, scarred,
white-haired, there remains to this veteran of many struggles for
humanity but one hope, a kindly welcome, a peaceful haven for his
tempest-tossed life.Never for an instant has his faith in the heart
of America been shaken.Already he sees his friend Jefferson's arms
extended; he sees his old comrades welcoming him to their hearths; he
sees his own house and sward at Bordentown, and the beautiful Kirk-bride
mansion beside the Delaware,--river of sacred memories, soon to be
spanned by his graceful arch.How the ladies he left girls,--Fanny.Kitty, Sally,--will come with their husbands to greet him!How will they
admire the latest bridge-model, with Lady Smith's delicate chain-work
for which (such is his estimate of friendship) he refused three thousand
pounds, though it would have made his mean room palatial!Ah, yes, poor
heart, America will soothe your wounds, and pillow your sinking head on
her breast!America, with Jefferson in power, is herself again.They do
not hate men in America for not believing in a celestial Robespierre.Thou stricken friend of man, who hast appealed from the god of wrath
to the God of Humanity, see in the distance that Maryland coast, which
early voyagers called Avalon, and sing again your song when first
stepping on that shore twenty-seven years ago:

      "I come to sing that summer is at hand,
      The summer time of wit, you 'll understand;
      Plants, fruits, and flowers, and all the smiling race
      That can the orchard or the garden grace;
      The Rose and Lily shall address the fair,
      And whisper sweetly out, 'My dears, take care:'
      With sterling worth the Plant of Sense shall rise,
      And teach the curious to philosophize.We 'll garnish out the scenes
      With stately rows of Evergreens,
      Trees that will bear the frost, and deck their tops
      With everlasting flowers, like diamond drops."* "The Snowdrop and Critic," Pennsylvania Magazine, 1775.THE AMERICAN INQUISITION

On October 30th Paine landed at Baltimore.More than two and a half
centuries had elapsed since the Catholic Lord Baltimore appointed a
Protestant Governor of Maryland, William Stone, who proclaimed in that
province (1648) religious freedom and equality.The Puritans, crowding
thither, from regions of oppression, grew strong enough to exterminate
the religion of Lord Baltimore who had given them shelter, and
imprisoned his Protestant Governor.So, in the New World, passed the
Inquisition from Catholic to Protestant hands.In Paine's first American pamphlet, he had repeated and extolled the
principle of that earliest proclamation of religious liberty."Diversity
of religious opinions affords a larger field for Christian kindness."The Christian kindness now consists in a cessation of sectarian strife
that they may unite in stretching the author of the "Age of Reason"
on their common rack, so far as was possible under a Constitution
acknowledging no deity.Soon after landing Paine wrote to President Jefferson:

"I arrived here on Saturday from Havre, after a passage of sixty days.I have several cases of models, wheels, etc., and as soon as I can get
them from the vessel and put them on board the packet for Georgetown
I shall set off to pay my respects to you.Your much obliged
fellow-citizen,--Thomas Paine."On reaching Washington City Paine found his dear friend Monroe starting
off to resume his ministry in Paris, and by him wrote to Mr.Este,
banker in Paris (Sir Robert Smith's son-in-law), enclosing a letter to
Rickman, in London."You can have no idea," he tells Rickman, "of the
agitation which my arrival occasioned."Every paper is "filled with
applause or abuse.""My property in this country has been taken care of by my friends, and
is now worth six thousand pounds sterling; which put in the funds will
bring me L400 sterling a year.Remember me in friendship and affection
to your wife and family, and in the circle of our friends.I am but just
arrived here, and the minister sails in a few hours, so that I have just
time to write you this.If he should not sail this tide I will write to
my good friend Col.Bosville, but in any case I request you to wait on
him for me.* Paine still had faith in Bosville.He was slow in
     suspecting any man who seemed enthusiastic for liberty.In
     this connection it may be mentioned that it is painful to
     find in the "Diary and Letters of Gouverneur Morris," (ii.,
     p.426) a confidential letter to Robert R. Livingston,
     Minister in France, which seems to assume that Minister's
     readiness to receive slanders of Jefferson, who appointed
     him, and of Paine whose friendship he seemed to value.Speaking of the President, Morris says: "The employment of
     and confidence in adventurers from abroad will sooner or
     later rouse the pride and indignation of this country."Morris' editor adds: "This was probably an allusion to
     Thomas Paine, who had recently returned to America and was
     supposed to be an intimate friend of Mr.Jefferson, who, it
     was said, received him warmly, dined him at the White House,
     and could be seen walking arm in arm with him on the street
     any fine afternoon."The allusion to "adventurers" was no
     doubt meant for Paine, but not to his reception by
     Jefferson, for Morris' letter was written on August 27th,
     some two months before Paine's arrival.It was probably
     meant by Morris to damage Paine in Paris, where it was known
     that he was intimate with Livingston, who had been
     introduced by him to influential men, among others to Sir
     Robert Smith and Este, bankers.It is to be hoped that
     Livingston resented Morris' assumption of his treacherous
     character.Morris, who had shortly before dined at the White
     House, tells Livingston that Jefferson is "descending to a
     condition which I find no decent word to designate."Surely
     Livingston's descendants should discover his reply to that
     letter.The defeated Federalists had already prepared their batteries to assail
the President for inviting Paine to return on a national ship, under
escort of a Congressman.It required some skill for these adherents of
John Adams, a Unitarian, to set the Inquisition in motion.It had to be
done, however, as there was no chance of breaking down Jefferson but
by getting preachers to sink political differences and hound the
President's favorite author.Out of the North, stronghold of the
"British Party," came this partisan crusade under a pious flag.In
Virginia and the South the "Age of Reason" was fairly discussed, its
influence being so great that Patrick Henry, as we have seen, wrote and
burnt a reply.In Virginia, Deism, though largely prevailing, had not
prevented its adherents from supporting the Church as an institution.It had become their habit to talk of such matters only in private.Jefferson had not ventured to express his views in public, and was
troubled at finding himself mixed up with the heresies of Paine.*

     * To the Rev.Waterhouse (Unitarian) who had asked
     permission to publish a letter of his, Jefferson, with a
     keen remembrance of Paine's fate, wrote (July 19, 1822):
     "No, my dear Sir, not for the world.Into what a hornet's
     nest would it thrust my head!--The genus irritabile vatmm,
     on whom argument is lost, and reason is by themselves
     disdained in matters of religion.Don Quixote undertook to
     redress the bodily wrongs of the world, but the redressaient
     of mental vagaries would be an enterprise more than Quixotic
     I should as soon undertake to bring the crazy skulls of
     Bedlam to sound understanding as to inculcate reason into
     that of an Athanasian.I am old, and tranquillity is now my
     summum bonum.Keep me therefore from the fire and <DW19> of
     Calvin and his victim Servetus.Happy in the prospect of a
     restoration of a primitive Christianity, I must leave to
     younger athletes to lop off the false branches which have
     been engrafted into it by the mycologists of the middle and
     modern ages."--MS.The author on reaching Lovell's Hotel, Washington, had made known
his arrival to the President, and was cordially received; but as the
newspapers came in with their abuse, Jefferson may have been somewhat
intimidated.Eager to disembarrass the
administration, Paine published a letter in the _National Intelligencer_
which had cordially welcomed him, in which he said that he should not
ask or accept any office.*

     * The National Intelligencer (Nov.3d), announcing Paine's
     arrival at Baltimore, said, among other things: "Be his
     religious sentiments what they may, it must be their [the
     American people's] wish that he may live in the undisturbed
     possession of our common blessings, and enjoy them the more
     from his active participation in their attainment."The same
     paper said, Nov.10th: "Thomas Paine has arrived in this
     city [Washington] and has received a cordial reception from
     the Whigs of Seventy-six, and the republicans of 1800, who
     have the independence to feel and avow a sentiment of
     gratitude for his eminent revolutionary services."He meant to continue writing and bring forward his mechanical projects.None the less did the "federalist" press use Paine's infidelity to
belabor the President, and the author had to write defensive letters
from the moment of his arrival.On October 29th, before Paine had
landed, the _National Intelligencer_ had printed (from a Lancaster,
Pa., journal) a vigorous letter, signed "A Republican," showing that the
denunciations of Paine were not religious, but political, as John Adams
was also unorthodox.The "federalists" must often have wished that they
had taken this warning, for Paine's pen was keener than ever, and the
opposition had no writer to meet him.His eight "Letters to the
Citizens of the United States" were scathing, eloquent, untrammelled by
partisanship, and made a profound impression on the country,--for even
the opposition press had to publish them as part of the news of the
day.*

     * They were published in the National Intelligencer of
     November 15th, 22d.29th, December 6th, January 25th, and
     February 2d, 1803.Of the others one appeared in the Aurora
     (Philadelphia), dated from Bordentown, N. J., March 12th,
     and the last in the Trenton True American % dated April
     21st.On Christmas Day Paine wrote the President a suggestion for the purchase
of Louisiana.The French, to whom Louisiana had been ceded by Spain,
closed New Orleans (November 26th) against foreign ships (including
American), and prohibited deposits there by way of the Mississippi.This
caused much excitement, and the "federalists" showed eagerness to push
the administration into a belligerent attitude toward France.Paines
"common sense" again came to the front, and he sent Jefferson the
following paper:

"OF LOUISIANA."Spain has ceded Louisiana to france, and france has excluded the
Americans from N. Orleans and the navigation of the Mississippi;
the people of the Western Territory have complained of it to their
Government, and the governt.is of consequence involved and interested
in the affair The question then is--What is the best step to be taken?"The one is to begin by memorial and remonstrance against an infraction
of a right.The other is by accommodation, still keeping the right in
view, but not making it a groundwork."Suppose then the Government begin by making a proposal to france to
repurchase the cession, made to her by Spain, of Louisiana, provided it
be with the consent of the people of Louisiana or a majority thereof."By beginning on this ground any thing can be said without carrying the
appearance of a threat,--the growing power of the western territory
can be stated as matter of information, and also the impossibility
of restraining them from seizing upon New Orleans, and the equal
impossibility of france to prevent it."Suppose the proposal attended to, the sum to be given comes next on the
carpet This, on the part of America, will be estimated between the
value of the Commerce, and the quantity of revenue that Louisiana will
produce."The french treasury is not only empty, but the Government has consumed
by anticipation a great part of the next year's revenue.A monied
proposal will, I believe, be attended to; if it should, the claims upon
france can be stipulated as part of the payment, and that sum can be
paid here to the claimants.

"------I congratulate you on the _birthday of the New Sun_, now called
christmas-day; and I make you a present of a thought on Louisiana."Jefferson next day told Paine, what was as yet a profound secret, that
he was already contemplating the purchase of Louisiana.*

     * "The idea occurred to me," Paine afterwards wrote to the
     President, "without knowing it had occurred to any other
     person, and I mentioned it to Dr.Leib who lived in the same
     house (Lovell's); and, as he appeared pleased with it, I
     wrote the note and showed it to him before I sent it.The
     next morning you said to me that measures were already taken
     in that business.When Leib returned from Congress I told
     him of it.'Why then,' said I, 'did
     you not tell me so, because in that case I would not have
     sent the note.''That is the very reason,' said he; 'I would
     not tell you, because two opinions concurring on a case
     strengthen it.'Leib's motion
     about Banks.Congress ought to be very cautious how it gives
     encouragement to this speculating project of banking, for it
     is now carried to an extreme.It is but another kind of
     striking paper money.Neither do I like the notion
     respecting the recession of the territory [District of
     Columbia.]."Michael Leib was a representative from
     Pennsylvania.{1803}

The "New Sun" was destined to bring his sunstrokes on Paine.The
pathetic story of his wrongs in England, his martyrdom in France,
was not generally known, and, in reply to attacks, he had to tell
it himself.He had returned for repose and found himself a sort of
battlefield.One of the most humiliating circumstances was the discovery
that in this conflict of parties the merits of his religion were of
least consideration.The outcry of the country against him, so far as
it was not merely political, was the mere ignorant echo of pulpit
vituperation.His well-considered theism, fruit of so much thought,
nursed amid glooms of the dungeon, was called infidelity or atheism.Even some from whom he might have expected discriminating criticism
accepted the vulgar version and wrote him in deprecation of a work
they had not read.Samuel Adams, his old friend, caught in this
_schwarmerei_, wrote him from Boston (November 30th) that he had "heard"
that he had "turned his mind to a defence of infidelity."Paine copied
for him his creed from the "Age of Reason," and asked, "My good friend,
do you call believing in God infidelity?"This letter to Samuel Adams (January 1, 1803) has indications that Paine
had developed farther his theistic ideal."We cannot serve the Deity in the manner we serve those who cannot do
without that service.We can add nothing to
eternity.But it is in our power to render a service acceptable to him,
and that is, not by praying, but by endeavoring to make his creatures
happy.A man does not serve God by praying, for it is himself he is
trying to serve; and as to hiring or paying men to pray, as if the Deity
needed instruction, it is in my opinion an abomination.I have been
exposed to and preserved through many dangers, but instead of buffeting
the Deity with prayers, as if I distrusted him, or must dictate to him,
I reposed myself on his protection; and you, my friend, will find, even
in your last moments, more consolation in the silence of resignation
than in the murmuring wish of a prayer."Paine must have been especially hurt by a sentence in the letter of
Samuel Adams in which he said: "Our friend, the president of the United
States, has been calumniated for his liberal sentiments, by men who have
attributed that liberality to a latent design to promote the cause of
infidelity."To this he did not reply, but it probably led him to feel a
deeper disappointment at the postponement of the interviews he had hoped
to enjoy with Jefferson after thirteen years of separation.A feeling
of this kind no doubt prompted the following note (January 12th) sent to
the President:

"I will be obliged to you to send back the Models, as I am packing up
to set off for Philadelphia and New York.My intention in bringing them
here in preference to sending them from Baltimore to Philadelphia, was
to have some conversation with you on those matters and others I have
not informed you of.But you have not only shown no disposition towards
it, but have, in some measure, by a sort of shyness, as if you stood in
fear of federal observation, precluded it.I am not the only one, who
makes observations of this kind."Jefferson at once took care that there should be no misunderstanding
as to his regard for Paine.The author was for some days a guest in the
President's family, where he again met Maria Jefferson (Mrs.Eppes) whom
he had known in Paris.Randall says the devout ladies of the family had
been shy of Paine, as was but natural, on account of the President's
reputation for rationalism, but "Paine's discourse was weighty, his
manners sober and inoffensive; and he left Mr.Jefferson's mansion the
subject of lighter prejudices than he entered it."*

     * "Life of Jefferson," ii., 642 sec.Randall is mistaken in
     some statements.Paine, as we have seen, did not return on
     the ship placed at his service by the President; nor did
     the President's letter appear until long after his return,
     when he and Jefferson felt it necessary in order to disabuse
     the public mind of the most absurd rumors on the subject.Paine's defamers have manifested an eagerness to ascribe his
maltreatment to personal faults.For some years
after his arrival in the country no one ventured to hint anything
disparaging to his personal habits or sobriety.On January 1, 1803, he
wrote to Samuel Adams: "I have a good state of health and a happy mind;
I take care of both by nourishing the first with temperance, and the
latter with abundance."Had not this been true the "federal" press would have noised it abroad.In all portraits, French and American, his
dress is in accordance with the fashion.There was not, so far as I can
discover, a suggestion while he was at Washington, that he was not a
suitable guest for any drawing-room in the capital On February 23,
1803, probably, was written the following which I find among the Cobbett
papers:

From Mr.Jefferson, on the occasion of a toast being given
at a federal dinner at Washington, of "May they

     NEVER KNOW PLEASURE WHO LOVE PAINE.""I send you, Sir, a tale about some Feds,
     Who, in their wisdom, got to loggerheads.The case was this, they felt so flat and sunk,
     They took a glass together and got drunk.Such things, you know, are neither new nor rare,
     For some will hary themselves when in despair.It was the natal day of Washington,
     And that they thought a famous day for fun;
     For with the learned world it is agreed,
     The better day the better deed.They talked away, and as the glass went round
     They grew, in point of wisdom, more profound;
     For at the bottom of the bottle lies
     That kind of sense we overlook when wise.Come, here's a toast, cried one, with roar immense,
     May none know pleasure who love Common Sense.some others cried,
     But left it to the waiter to decide.I think, said he, the case would be more plain,
     To leave out Common Sense, and put in Paine.On this a mighty noise arose among
     This drunken, bawling, senseless throng.Some said that Common Sense was all a curse,
     That making people wiser made them worse;
     It learned them to be careful of their purse,
     And not be laid about like babes at nurse,
     Nor yet believe in stories upon trust,
     Which all mankind, to be well governed must;
     And that the toast was better at the first,
     And he that didn't think so might be cursed.So on they went, till such a fray arose
     As all who know what Feds are may suppose."On his way northward, to his old home in Bor-dentown, Paine passed many
a remembered spot, but found little or no greeting on his journey.In
Baltimore a "New Jerusalemite," as the Sweden-borgian was then called,
the Rev.Hargrove, accosted him with the information that the key to
scripture was found, after being lost 4,000 years."Then it must be very rusty," answered Paine."His principles," wrote
Rush to Cheetham, "avowed in his 'Age of Reason,' were so offensive to
me that I did not wish to renew my intercourse with him."Paine made
arrangements for the reception of his bridge models at Peale's Museum,
but if he met any old friend there no mention of it appears.Most
of those who had made up the old circle--Franklin, Rittenhouse,
Muhlenberg--were dead, some were away in Congress; but no doubt Paine
saw George Clymer.However, he did not stay long in Philadelphia, for he
was eager to reach the spot he always regarded as his home, Bordentown.And there, indeed, his hope, for a time, seemed to be fulfilled It need
hardly be said that his old friend Colonel Kirkbride gave him hearty
welcome.John Hall, Paine's bridge mechanician, "never saw him jollier,"
and he was full of mechanical "whims and schemes" they were to pursue
together.Jefferson was candidate for the presidency, and Paine entered
heartily into the canvass; which was not prudent, but he knew nothing of
prudence.The issue not only concerned an old friend, but was turning on
the question of peace with France.On March 12th he writes against the
"federalist" scheme for violently seizing New Orleans.At a meeting in
April, over which Colonel Kirkbride presides, Paine drafts a reply to an
attack on Jefferson's administration, circulated in New York.On April
21 st he writes the refutation of an attack on Jefferson, _apropos_ of
the national vessel offered for his return, which had been coupled
with a charge that Paine had proposed to the Directory an invasion of
America!In June he writes about his bridge models (then at Peale's
Museum, Philadelphia), and his hope to span the Delaware and the
Schuylkill with iron arches.Here is a letter written to Jefferson from Bordentown

(August 2d) containing suggestions concerning the beginning of
government in Louisiana, from which it would appear that Paine's faith
in the natural inspiration of _vox populi_ was still imperfect:

"I take it for granted that the present inhabitants know little or
nothing of election and representation as constituting government.They
are therefore not in an immediate condition to exercise those powers,
and besides this they are perhaps too much under the influence of their
priests to be sufficiently free."I should suppose that a Government _provisoire_ formed by Congress for
three, five, or seven years would be the best mode of beginning.In
the meantime they may be initiated into the practice by electing their
Municipal government, and after some experience they will be in train to
elect their State government.I think it would not only be good policy
but right to say, that the people shall have the right of electing their
Church Ministers, otherwise their Ministers will hold by authority from
the Pope.I do not make it a compulsive article, but to put it in their
power to use it when they please.It will serve to hold the priests in a
stile of good behavior, and also to give the people an idea of elective
rights.Anything, they say, will do to learn upon, and therefore they
may as well begin upon priests."The present prevailing language is french and Spanish, but it will be
necessary to establish schools to teach english as the laws ought to be
in the language of the Union."As soon as you have formed any plan for settling the Lands I shall be
glad to know it.My motive for this is because there are thousands and
tens of thousands in England and Ireland and also in Scotland who are
friends of mine by principle, and who would gladly change their present
country and condition.Many among them, for I have friends in all ranks
of life in those countries, are capable of becoming monied purchasers to
any amount."If you can give me any hints respecting Louisiana, the quantity in
square miles, the population, and amount of the present Revenue I will
find an opportunity of making some use of it.When the formalities of
the cession are compleated, the next thing will be to take possession,
and I think it would be very consistent for the President of the United
States to do this in person."What is Dayton gone to New Orleans for?Is he there as an Agent for the
British as Blount was said to be?"Of the same date is a letter to Senator Breck-enridge, of Kentucky,
forwarded through Jefferson:

"My Dear Friend,--Not knowing your place of Residence in Kentucky I send
this under cover to the President desiring him to fill up the direction."I see by the public papers and the Proclamation for calling Congress,
that the cession of Louisiana has been obtained.The papers state the
purchase to be 11,250,000 dollars in the six per cents and 3,750,000
dollars to be paid to American claimants who have furnished supplies to
France and the french Colonies and are yet unpaid, making on the whole
15,000,000 dollars."I observe that the faction of the Feds who last Winter were for going
to war to obtain possession of that country and who attached so much
importance to it that no expense or risk ought be spared to obtain it,
have now altered their tone and say it is not worth having, and that
we are better without it than with it."The second section of the 2d article of the constitution says, The
'President shall have Power by and with the consent of the senate to
make Treaties provided two thirds of the senators present concur.'"A question may be supposed to arise on the present case, which is,
under what character is the cession to be considered and taken up in
congress, whether as a treaty, or in some other shape?"Though the word, Treaty, as a Word, is unlimited in its meaning
and application, it must be supposed to have a denned meaning in the
constitution.It there means Treaties of alliance or of navigation and
commerce--Things which require a more profound deliberation than
common acts do, because they entail on the parties a future reciprocal
responsibility and become afterwards a supreme law on each of the
contracting countries which neither can annull.But the cession of
Louisiana to the United States has none of these features in it It is a
sale and purchase.A sole act which when finished, the parties have no
more to do with each other than other buyers and sellers have.It has no
future reciprocal consequences (which is one of the marked characters of
a Treaty) annexed to it; and the idea of its becoming a supreme law
to the parties reciprocally (which is another of the characters of a
Treaty) is inapplicable in the present case.There remains nothing for
such a law to act upon."I love the restriction in the constitution which takes from the
Executive the power of making treaties of his own will: and also the
clause which requires the consent of two thirds of the Senators, because
we cannot be too cautious in involving and entangling ourselves with
foreign powers; but I have an equal objection against extending the
same power to the senate in cases to which it is not strictly and
constitutionally applicable, because it is giving a nullifying power
to a minority.Treaties, as already observed, are to have future
consequences and whilst they remain, remain always in execution
externally as well as internally, and therefore it is better to run the
risk of losing a good treaty for the want of two thirds of the senate
than be exposed to the danger of ratifying a bad one by a small
majority.But in the present case no operation is to follow but what
acts itself within our own Territory and under our own laws.We are the
sole power concerned after the cession is accepted and the money paid,
and therefore the cession is not a Treaty in the constitutional meaning
of the word subject to be rejected by a minority in the senate."The question whether the cession shall be accepted and the bargain
closed by a grant of money for the purpose, (which I take to be the
sole question) is a case equally open to both houses of congress, and
if there is any distinction of _formal right_, it ought according to
the constitution, as a money transaction, to begin in the house of
Representatives."I suggest these matters that the senate may not be taken unawares, for
I think it not improbable that some Fed, who intends to negative the
cession, will move to take it up as if it were a Treaty of Alliance or
of Navigation and Commerce."The object here is an increase of territory for a valuable
consideration.It is altogether a home concern--a matter of domestic
policy.The only real ratification is the payment of the money, and as
all verbal ratification without this goes for nothing, it would be a
waste of time and expense to debate on the verbal ratification distinct
from the money ratification.The shortest way, as it appears to me,
would be to appoint a committee to bring in a report on the President's
Message, and for that committee to report a bill for the payment of the
money.The french Government, as the seller of the property, will not
consider anything ratification but the payment of the money contracted
for."There is also another point, necessary to be aware of, which is, to
accept it in toto.Any alteration or modification in it, or annexed as
a condition is so far fatal, that it puts it in the power of the other
party to reject the whole and propose new Terms.There can be no such
thing as ratifying in part, or with a condition annexed to it and
the ratification to be binding.It is still a continuance of the
negociation."It ought to be presumed that the American ministers have done to the
best of their power and procured the best possible terms, and that being
immediately on the spot with the other party they were better Judges of
the whole, and of what could, or could not be done, than any person at
this distance, and unacquainted with many of the circumstances of the
case, can possibly be."If a treaty, a contract, or a cession be good upon the whole, it is ill
policy to hazard the whole, by an experiment to get some trifle in it
altered.The right way of proceeding in such case is to make sure of
the whole by ratifying it, and then instruct the minister to propose
a clause to be added to the Instrument to obtain the amendment or
alteration wished for.This was the method Congress took with respect to
the Treaty of Commerce with France in 1778.Congress ratified the whole
and proposed two new articles which were agreed to by France and added
to the Treaty."There is according to newspaper account an article which admits french
and Spanish vessels on the same terms as American vessels.But this
does not make it a commercial Treaty.It is only one of the Items in the
payment: and it has this advantage, that it joins Spain with France in
making the cession and is an encouragement to commerce and new settlers."With respect to the purchase, admitting it to be 15 millions dollars,
it is an advantageous purchase.The revenue alone purchased as an
annuity or rent roll is worth more--at present I suppose the revenue
will pay five per cent for the purchase money."I know not if these observations will be of any use to you.I am in
a retired village and out of the way of hearing the talk of the great
world.But I see that the Feds, at least some of them, are changing
their tone and now reprobating the acquisition of Louisiana; and the
only way they can take to lose the affair will be to take it up as they
would a Treaty of Commerce and annull it by a Minority; or entangle it
with some condition that will render the ratification of no effect."I believe in this state (Jersey) we shall have a majority at the next
election.I have half a
disposition to visit the Western World next spring and go on to New
Orleans.They are a new people and unacquainted with the principles of
representative government and I think I could do some good among them."As the stage-boat which was to take this letter to the Post-office does
not depart till to-morrow, I amuse myself with continuing the subject
after I had intended to close it."I know little and can learn but little of the extent and present
population of Louisiana.After the cession be com-pleated and the
territory annexed to the United States it will, I suppose, be formed
into states, one, at least, to begin with."The people, as I have said, are new to us and we to them and a great
deal will depend on a right beginning.As they have been transferred
backward and forward several times from one European Government to
another it is natural to conclude they have no fixed prejudices with
respect to foreign attachments, and this puts them in a fit disposition
for their new condition.The established religion is roman; but in
what state it is as to exterior ceremonies (such as processions and
celebrations), I know not.Had the cession to france continued with her,
religion I suppose would have been put on the same footing as it is
in that country, and there no ceremonial of religion can appear on the
streets or highways; and the same regulation is particularly necessary
now or there will soon be quarrels and tumults between the old settlers
and the new.The Yankees will not move out of the road for a little
wooden Jesus stuck on a stick and carried in procession nor kneel in
the dirt to a wooden Virgin Mary.As we do not govern the territory as
provinces but incorporated as states, religion there must be on the same
footing it is here, and Catholics have the same rights as Catholics have
with us and no others.As to political condition the Idea proper to be
held out is, that we have neither conquered them, nor bought them, but
formed a Union with them and they become in consequence of that union a
part of the national sovereignty."The present Inhabitants and their descendants will be a majority for
some time, but new emigrations from the old states and from Europe, and
intermarriages, will soon change the first face of things, and it is
necessary to have this in mind when the first measures shall be taken.Everything done as an expedient grows worse every day, for in proportion
as the mind grows up to the full standard of sight it disclaims the
expedient.America had nearly been ruined by expedients in the first
stages of the revolution, and perhaps would have been so, had not
'Common Sense' broken the charm and the Declaration of Independence sent
it into banishment."Yours in friendship

"Thomas Paine.*

"remember me in the circle of your friends."William F.
     Havermeyer, Jr.E. M. Woodward, in his account of Bordentown, mentions among the
"traditions" of the place, that Paine used to meet a large number of
gentlemen at the "Washington House," kept by Debora Applegate, where he
conversed freely "with any proper person who approached him."Paine was too much occupied in literary pursuits and writing to
spend a great deal of his time here, but he generally paid several
visits during the day.In walking he
was generally absorbed in deep thought, seldom noticed any one as he
passed, unless spoken to, and in going from his home to the tavern was
frequently observed to cross the street several times.It is stated that
several members of the church were turned from their faith by him, and
on this account, and the general feeling of the community against him
for his opinions on religious subjects, he was by the mass of the
people held in odium, which feeling to some extent was extended to Col.These "traditions" were recorded in 1876.Paine's "great power of
conversation" was remembered.But among the traditions, even of the
religious, there is none of any excess in drinking.Possibly the turning of several church-members from their faith may
not have been so much due to Paine as to the parsons, in showing their
"religion" as a gorgon turning hearts to stone against a benefactor
of mankind.One day Paine went with Colonel Kirkbride to visit Samuel
Rogers, the Colonels brother-in-law, at Bellevue, across the river.As
he entered the door Rogers turned his back, refusing his old friend's
hand, because it had written the "Age of Reason."Presently Borden-town
was placarded with pictures of the Devil flying away with Paine.The
pulpits set up a chorus of vituperation.Why should the victim spare the
altar on which he is sacrificed, and justice also?Dogma had chosen to
grapple with the old man in its own way.That it was able to break a
driven leaf Paine could admit as truly as Job; but he could as bravely
say: Withdraw thy hand from me, and I will answer thee, or thou shalt
answer me!In Paine too it will be proved that such outrages on truth
and friendship, on the rights of thought, proceed from no God, but from
the destructive forces once personified as the adversary of man.Early in March Paine visited New York, to see Monroe before his
departure for France.He drove with Kirkbride to Trenton; but so furious
was the pious mob, he was refused a seat in the Trenton stage.They
dined at Government House, but when starting for Brunswick were hooted
These were the people for whose liberties Paine had marched that same
road on foot, musket in hand.At Trenton insults were heaped on the
man who by camp-fires had written the _Crisis_, which animated the
conquerors of the Hessians at that place, in "the times that tried men's
souls."These people he helped to make free,--free to cry _Crucify!_

Paine had just written to Jefferson that the Louisianians were "perhaps
too much under the influence of their priests to be sufficiently free."Probably the same thought occurred to him about people nearer home,
when he presently heard of Colonel Kirkbride's sudden unpopularity, and
death.On October 3d Paine lost this faithful friend.*

     * It should be stated that Burlington County, in which
     Bordentown is situated, was preponderantly Federalist, and
     that Trenton was in the hands of a Federalist mob of young
     well-to-do rowdies.The editor of the _True American_, a
     Republican paper to which Paine had contributed, having
     commented on a Fourth of July orgie of those rowdies in a
     house associated with the revolution, was set upon with
     bludgeons on July 12th, and suffered serious injuries.The
     Grand Jury refused to present the Federalist ruffians,
     though the evidence was clear, and the mob had free course.The facts of the Paine mob are these: after dining at Government House,
Trenton, Kirkbride applied for a seat on the New York stage for Paine.The owner, Voorhis, cursed Paine as "a deist," and said, "I 'll be
damned if he shall go in my stage."Another stage-owner also refused,
saying, "My stage and horses were once struck by lightning, and I don't
want them to suffer again."When Paine and Kirkbride had entered their
carriage a mob surrounded them with a drum, playing the "rogue's march."The local reporter (_True American_) says, "Mr.Paine discovered not the
least emotion of fear or anger, but calmly observed that such conduct
had no tendency to hurt his feelings or injure his fame."The mob then
tried to frighten the horse with the drum, and succeeded, but the two
gentlemen reached a friend's house in Brunswick in safety.A letter
from Trenton had been written to the stage-master there also, to prevent
Paine from securing a seat, whether with success does not appear.NEW ROCHELLE AND THE BONNEVILLES

The Bonnevilles, with whom Paine had resided in Paris, were completely
impoverished after his departure.They resolved to follow Paine to
America, depending on his promise of aid should they do so.Foreseeing
perils in France, Nicolas, unable himself to leave at once, hurried off
his wife and children--Benjamin, Thomas, and Louis.Madame Bonneville
would appear to have arrived in August, 1803.I infer this because Paine
writes, September 23d, to Jefferson from Stonington, Connecticut; and
later letters show that he had been in New York, and afterwards placed
Thomas Paine Bonneville with the Rev.Foster (Universalist) of
Stonington for education.Madame Bonneville was placed in his house at
Bordentown, where she was to teach French.At New York, Paine found both religious and political parties sharply
divided over him.At Lovett's Hotel, where he stopped, a large dinner
was given him, March 18th, seventy being present One of the active
promoters of this dinner was James Cheetham, editor of the _American
Citizen_, who, after seriously injuring Paine by his patronage, became
his malignant enemy.In the summer of 1803 the political atmosphere was in a tempestuous
condition, owing to the widespread accusation that Aaron Burr had
intrigued with the Federalists against Jefferson to gain the presidency.There was a Society in New York called "Republican Greens," who, on
Independence Day, had for a toast "Thomas Paine, the Man of the People,"
and who seem to have had a piece of music called the "Rights of Man."Paine was also apparently the hero of that day at White Plains, where
a vast crowd assembled, "over 1,000," among the toasts being: "Thomas
Paine--the bold advocate of rational liberty--the People's friend."He
probably reached New York again in August A letter for "Thomas Payne"
is in the advertised Letter-list of August 6th, and in the _American
Citizen_ (August 9th) are printed (and misprinted) "Lines, extempore, by
Thomas Paine, July, 1803."*

     * On July 12th the _Evening Post _(edited by William
     Coleman) tries to unite republicanism and infidelity by
     stating that Part I. of the "Age of Reason" was sent in MS.Fellows of New York, and in the following year Part
     II.was gratuitously distributed "from what is now the
     office of the Aurora."On September 24th that paper
     publishes a poem about Paine, ending:


     "Quick as the lightning's vivid flash
     The poet's eye o'er Europe rolls;
     Sees battles rage, hears tempests crash,
     And dims at horror's threatening scowls."Mark ambition's ruthless king,
     With crimsoned banners scathe the globe;
     While trailing after conquest's wing,
     Man's festering wounds his demons probe."Palled with streams of reeking gore
     That stain the proud imperial day,
     He turns to view the western shore,
     Where freedom holds her boundless sway."'T is here her sage triumphant sways
     An empire in the people's love;
     'T is here the sovereign will obeys
     No king but Him who rules above."The verses, crudely expressing the contrast between President Jefferson
and King George--or Napoleon, it is not clear which,--sufficiently show
that Paine's genius was not extempore.His reputation as a patriotic
minstrel was high; his "Hail, great Republic," to the tune of "Rule
Britannia," was the established Fourth-of-July song, and it was even
sung at the dinner of the American consul in London (Erving) March 4,
1803, the anniversary of Jefferson's election.Possibly the extempore
lines were sung on some Fourth-of-July occasion.I find "Thomas Paine"
and the "Rights of Man" favorite toasts at republican celebrations in
Virginia also at this time.In New York we may discover Paine's coming
and going by rancorous paragraphs concerning him in the _Evening Post_.*

     "And having spent a lengthy life in evil,
     Return again unto thy parent Devil!"Perhaps the most malignant wrong done Paine in this paper was the
adoption of his signature, "Common Sense," by one of its contributors!Another paragraph says that Franklin hired Paine in London to come to
America and write in favor of the Revolution,--a remarkable example of
federalist heredity from "Toryism."On September 27th the paper prints a
letter purporting to have been found by a waiter in Lovett's Hotel after
Paine's departure,--a long letter to Paine, by some red-revolutionary
friend, of course gloating over the exquisite horrors filling Europe in
consequence of the "Rights of Man."12, 1803," and signed "J.The paper's correspondent pretends
to have found out Oldney, and conversed with him.No doubt many simple
people believed the whole thing genuine.The most learned physician in New York, Dr.Nicholas Romayne, invited
Paine to dinner, where he was met by John Pintard, and other eminent
citizens.Pintard said to Paine: "I have read and re-read your 'Age
of Reason,' and any doubts which I before entertained of the truth
of revelation have been removed by your logic.Yes, sir, your very
arguments against Christianity have convinced me of its truth.""Well
then," answered Paine, "I may return to my couch to-night with the
consolation that I have made at least one Christian."* This authentic
anecdote is significant John Pintard, thus outdone by Paine in
politeness, founded the Tammany Society, and organized the democratic
party.When the "Rights of Man" appeared, the book and its author were
the main toasts of the Tammany celebrations; but it was not so after
the "Age of Reason" had appeared.For John Pintard was all his life
a devotee of Dutch Reformed orthodoxy.Tammany, having begun with the
populace, had by this time got up somewhat in society.As a rule the
"gentry" were Federalists, though they kept a mob in their back yard to
fly at the democrats on occasion.But with Jefferson in the presidential
chair, and Clinton vice-president, Tammany was in power.To hold this
power Tammany had to court the clergy.So there was no toast to Paine in
the Wigwam of 1803.Francis' "Old New York," p.** The New York Daily Advertiser published the whole of Part
     I. of the "Rights of Man" in 1791 (May 6-27), the editor
     being then John Pintard.At the end of the publication a
     poetical tribute to Paine was printed.Four of the lines run:

     "Rous'd by the reason of his manly page,
     Once more shall Paine a listening world engage;
     From reason's source a bold reform he brings,
     By raising up mankind he pulls down kings."President Jefferson was very anxious about the constitutional points
involved in his purchase of Louisiana, and solicited Paine's views on
the whole subject.Paine wrote to him extended communications, among
which was the letter of September 23d, from Stonington.The interest of
the subject is now hardly sufficient to warrant publication of the whole
of this letter, which, however, possesses much interest.At the great celebration (October 12, 1792) of the third Centenary of
the discovery of America, by the sons of St Tammany, New York, the first
man toasted after Columbus was Paine, and next to Paine "The Rights of
Man."They were also extolled in an ode composed for the occasion, and
sung."Your two favours of the 10 and 18 ult.reached me at this place on the
14th inst.I do not suppose that the framers
of the Constitution thought anything about the acquisition of new
territory, and even if they did it was prudent to say nothing about
it, as it might have suggested to foreign Nations the idea that we
contemplated foreign conquest.It appears to me to be one of those cases
with which the Constitution had nothing to do, and which can be judged
of only by the circumstances of the times when such a case shall occur.The Constitution could not foresee that Spain would cede Louisiana to
France or to England, and therefore it could not determine what our
conduct should be in consequence of such an event.The cession makes
no alteration in the Constitution; it only extends the principles of it
over a larger territory, and this certainly is within the morality of
the Constitution, and not contrary to, nor beyond, the expression or
intention of any of its articles... Were a question to arise it would
apply, not to the Cession, because it violates no article of the
Constitution, but to Ross and Morris's motion.The Constitution empowers
Congress to declare war, but to make war without declaring it is
anti-constitutional.It is like attacking an unarmed man in the dark.There is also another reason why no such question should arise.The
english Government is but in a tottering condition and if Bonaparte
succeeds, that Government will break up.In that case it is not
improbable we may obtain Canada, and I think that Bermuda ought to
belong to the United States.In its present condition it is a nest for
piratical privateers.This is not a subject to be spoken of, but it may
be proper to have it in mind."The latest news we have from Europe in this place is the insurrection
in Dublin.It is a disheartening circumstance to the english Government,
as they are now putting arms into the hands of people who but a few
weeks before they would have hung had they found a pike in their
possession.I think the probability is in favour of the descent [on
England by Bonaparte]...

"I shall be employed the ensuing Winter in cutting two or three thousand
Cords of Wood on my farm at New Rochelle for the New York market distant
twenty miles by water.The Wood is worth 3 1/2 dollars per load as it
stands.This will furnish me with ready money, and I shall then be ready
for whatever may present itself of most importance next spring.I had
intended to build myself a house to my own taste, and a workshop for
my mechanical operations, and make a collection, as authors say, of
my works, which with what I have in manuscript will make four, or five
octavo volumes, and publish them by subscription, but the prospects that
are now opening with respect to England hold me in suspence."It has been customary in a President's discourse to say something about
religion.The word, religion,
used as a word _en masse_ has no application to a country like America.In catholic countries it would mean exclusively the religion of the
romish church; with the Jews, the Jewish religion; in England,
the protestant religion or in the sense of the english church, the
established religion; with the Deists it would mean Deism; with the
Turks, Mahometism &c, &c, As well as I recollect it is _Lego, Religo,
Relegio, Religion_, that is say, tied or bound by an oath or obligation.The french use the word properly; when a woman enters a convent, she is
called a novitiate; when she takes the oath, she is a _religieuse_, that
is, she is bound by an oath.Now all that we have to do, as a Government
with the word religion, in this country, is with the civil rights of it,
and not at all with its _creeds_.Instead therefore of using the word
religion, as a word en masse, as if it meant a creed, it would be better
to speak only of its civil rights; _that all denominations of religion
are equally protected, that none are dominant, none inferior, that
the rights of conscience are equal to every denomination and to every
individual and that it is the duty of Government to preserve this
equality of conscientious rights_.A man cannot be called a hypocrite
for defending the civil rights of religion, but he may be suspected of
insincerity in defending its creeds."I suppose you will find it proper to take notice of the impressment of
American seamen by the Captains of British vessels, and procure a list
of such captains and report them to their government.This pretence
of searching for british seamen is a new pretence for visiting and
searching American vessels....

"I am passing some time at this place at the house of a friend till the
wood cutting time comes on, and I shall engage some cutters here and
then return to New Rochelle.Madison concerning the
report that the british Government had cautioned ours not to pay
the purchase money for Louisiana, as they intended to take it for
themselves.I have received his [negative] answer, and I pray you make
him my compliments."We are still afflicted with the yellow fever, and the Doctors are
disputing whether it is an imported or a domestic disease.Would it not
be a good measure to prohibit the arrival of all vessels from the West
Indies from the last of June to the middle of October.If this was
done this session of Congress, and we escaped the fever next summer, we
should always know how to escape it.I question if performing quarantine
is a sufficient guard.The disease may be in the cargo, especially that
part which is barrelled up, and not in the persons on board, and when
that cargo is opened on our wharfs, the hot steaming air in contact with
the ground imbibes the infection.I can conceive that infected air can
be barrelled up, not in a hogshead of rum, nor perhaps sucre, but in
a barrel of coffee.I am badly off in this place for pen and Ink, and
short of paper.I heard yesterday from Boston that our old friend S.
Adams was at the point of death.When Madame Bonneville left France it was understood that her husband
would soon follow, but he did not come, nor was any letter received from
him.This was probably the most important allusion in a letter of Paine,
dated New York, March 1, 1804, to "Citizen Skipwith, Agent Commercial
d'Amerique, Paris.""Dear Friend--I have just a moment to write you a line by a friend who
is on the point of sailing for Bordeaux.The Republican interest is now
compleatly triumphant.The change within this last year has been great.We have now 14 States out of 17,--N. Hampshire, Mass.I much question if any person will be started against Mr.Burr is rejected for the vice-presidency; he is now putting
up for Governor of N. York.Morgan Lewis, Chief Justice of the State of N. Y. is the Republican
candidate for Governor of that State."I have not received a line from Paris, except a letter from Este, since
I left it.We have now been nearly 80 days without news from Europe.I have not heard anything from him except that
he is _always_ coming.Not a line has been
received from aim.Madame Bonneville, unable to speak English, found Bordentown dull,
and soon turned up in New York.She ordered rooms in Wilburn's
boarding-house, where Paine was lodging, and the author found the
situation rather complicated The family was absolutely without means
of their own, and Paine, who had given them a comfortable home at
Bordentown, was annoyed by their coming on to New York.Anxiety is shown
in the following letter written at 16 Gold St., New York, March 24th, to
"Mr."Dear Sir,--I received your letter by Mr.Nixon, and also a former
letter, but I have been so unwell this winter with a fit of gout, tho'
not so bad as I had at Bordenton about twenty years ago, that I could
not write, and after I got better I got a fall on the ice in the garden
where I lodge that threw me back for above a month.I was obliged to get
a person to copy off the letter to the people of England, published
in the Aurora, March 7, as I dictated it verbally, for all the time my
complaint continued.My health and spirits were as good as ever.It
was my intention to have cut a large quantity of wood for the New York
market, and in that case you would have had the money directly, but this
accident and the gout prevented my doing anything.I shall now have to
take up some money upon it, which I shall do by the first of May to put
Mrs.Bonneville into business, and I shall then discharge her bill.In
the mean time I wish you to receive a quarter's rent due on the 1st of
April from Mrs Richardson, at $25 per ann., and to call on Mrs.Read for
40 or 50 dollars, or what you can get, and to give a receipt in my name.Kirkbride should have discharged your bill, it was what he engaged
to do.Wharton owes for the rent of the house while she lived in
it, unless Col.Kirkbride has taken it into his accounts.Samuel Hileyar
owes me 84 dollars lent him in hard money.Nixon spake to me about
hiring my house, but as I did not know if Mrs.Richardson intended to
stay in it or quit it I could give no positive answer, but said I would
write to you about it.Israel Butler also writes me about taking at the
same rent as Richardson pays.I will be obliged to you to let the house
as you may judge best.I shall make a visit to Bordenton in the spring,
and I shall call at your house first."There have been several arrivals here in short passages from England.P. Porcupine, I see, is become the panegyrist of Bonaparte.You will see
it in the Aurora of March 19, and also the message of Bonaparte to the
french legislature.She would have wrote, but she
cannot yet venture to write in English.I congratulate you on your new
appointment."*

     * I am indebted for this letter to the N. Y. Hist.Society,
     which owns the original ought to be fulfilled."The
     following passages may be quoted:

     "In casting my eye over England and America, and comparing
     them together, the difference is very striking.The two
     countries were created by the same power, and peopled from
     the same stock.Have
     those who emigrated to America improved, or those whom they
     left behind degenerated?...We see America flourishing
     in peace, cultivating friendship with all nations, and
     reducing her public debt and taxes, incurred by the
     revolution.On the contrary we see England almost
     perpetually in war, or warlike disputes, and her debt and
     taxes continually increasing.Could we suppose a stranger,
     who knew nothing of the origin of the two nations, he would
     from observation conclude that America was the old country,
     experienced and sage, and England the new, eccentric and
     wild.Scarcely had England drawn home her troops from
     America, after the revolutionary war, than she was on the
     point of plunging herself into a war with Holland, on
     account of the Stadtholder; then with Russia; then with
     Spain on account of the Nootka cat-skins; and actually with
     France to prevent her revolution.Scarcely had she made
     peace with France, and before she had fulfilled her own part
     of the Treaty, than she declared war again, to avoid
     fulfilling the Treaty.In her Treaty of peace with America,
     she engaged to evacuate the western posts within six months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to fulfil the
     conditions, and kept possession of the posts, and embroiled
     herself in an Indian war.* In her Treaty of peace with
     France, she engaged to evacuate Malta within three months;
     but, having obtained peace, she refused to evacuate Malta,
     and began a new war."* Paine's case is not quite sound at this point.The
     Americans had not, on their side, fulfilled the condition of
     paying their English debts.(1804)

Paine's letter alluded to was printed in the _Aurora_ with the following
note:

"To the Editor.--As the good sense of the people in their elections has
now put the affairs of America in a prosperous condition at home and
abroad, there is nothing immediately important for the subject of a
letter.I therefore send you a piece on another subject."The piece presently appeared as a pamphlet of sixteen pages with the
following title: "Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion
of England.Philadelphia: Printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch
Street.Once more the hope had risen in Paine's breast that
Napoleon was to turn liberator, and that England was to be set free."If
the invasion succeed I hope Bonaparte will remember that this war
has not been provoked by the people.It is altogether the act of the
government without their consent or knowledge; and though the late
peace appears to have been insidious from the first, on the part of the
government, it was received by the people with a sincerity of joy."He still hopes that the English people may be able to end the trouble
peacefully, by compelling Parliament to fulfil the Treaty of Amiens.Paine points out that the failure of the French Revolution was due to
"the provocative interference of foreign powers, of which Pitt was
the principal and vindictive agent," and affirms the success of
representative government in the United States after thirty years'
trial."The people of England have now two revolutions before them,--the
one as an example, the other as a warning.Their own wisdom will direct
them what to choose and what to avoid; and in everything which regards
their happiness, combined with the common good of mankind, I wish them
honor and success."During this summer, Paine wrote a brilliant paper on a memorial sent
to Congress from the French inhabitants of Louisiana.They demanded
immediate admission to equal Statehood, also the right to continue
the importation of <DW64> slaves.Paine reminds the memorialists of
the "mischief caused in France by the possession of power before they
understood principles."After explaining their position, and the
freedom they have acquired by the merits of others, he points out their
ignorance of human "rights" as shown in their guilty notion that to
enslave others is among them."Dare you put up a petition to Heaven
for such a power, without fearing to be struck from the earth by its
justice?Why, then, do you ask it of man against man?Do you want to
renew in Louisiana the horrors of Domingo?"This article (dated September 22d) produced great effect.John Randolph
of Roanoke, in a letter to Albert Gallatin (October 14th), advises
"the printing of... thousand copies of Tom Paine's answer to their
remonstrance, and transmitting them by as many thousand troops, who
can speak a language perfectly intelligible to the people of Louisiana,
whatever that of their governor may be."Nicolas Bonneville still giving no sign, and Madame being uneconomical
in her notions of money, Paine thought it necessary--morally and
financially--to let it be known that he was not responsible for her
debts.When, therefore, Wilburn applied to him for her board ($35),
Paine declined to pay, and was sued.Paine pleaded _non assumpsit_, and,
after gaining the case, paid Wilburn the money.It presently turned out that the surveillance of Nicolas Bonneville did
not permit him to leave France, and, as he was not permitted to resume
his journal or publications, he could neither join his family nor assist
them.Paine now resolved to reside on his farm.It is dated at New Rochelle, July 9th:

"Fellow Citizen,--As the weather is now getting hot at New York, and the
people begin to get out of town, you may as well come up here and help
me settle my accounts with the man who lives on the place.You will be
able to do this better than I shall, and in the mean time I can go on
with my literary works, without having my mind taken off by affairs of
a different kind.I have received a packet from Governor Clinton,
enclosing what I wrote for.If you come up by the stage you will stop
at the post-office, and they will direct you the way to the farm.I send a price for the Prospect; if the plan
mentioned in it is pursued, it will open a way to enlarge and give
establishment to the deistical church; but of this and some other things
we will talk when you come up, and the sooner the better.Paine was presently enjoying himself on his farm at New Rochelle, and
Madame Bonneville began to keep house for him."It is a pleasant and healthy situation [he wrote to Jefferson somewhat
later], commanding a prospect always green and peaceable, as New
Rochelle produces a great deal of grass and hay.The farm contains three
hundred acres, about one hundred of which is meadow land, one hundred
grazing and village land, and the remainder woodland.It is an oblong
about a mile and a half in length.I have sold off sixty-one acres and
a half for four thousand and twenty dollars.With this money I shall
improve the other part, and build an addition 34 feet by 32 to the
present dwelling."He goes on into an architectural description, with drawings, of
the arched roof he intends to build, the present form of roof being
"unpleasing to the eye."He also draws an oak floor such as they make in
Paris, which he means to imitate.With a black cook, Rachel Gidney, the family seemed to be getting on
with fair comfort; but on Christmas Eve an event occurred which came
near bringing Paine's plans to an abrupt conclusion.This is related
in a letter to William Carver, New York, dated January 16th, at New
Rochelle."Esteemed Friend,--I have recd, two letters from you, one giving an
account of your taking Thomas to Mr.Foster*--the other dated Jany.12--I did not answer the first because I hoped to see you the next
Saturday or the Saturday after.* Thomas Bonneville, Paine's godson, at school in Stonington.What you heard of a gun being fired into the room is true--Robert and
Rachel were both gone out to keep Christmas Eve and about eight o'clock
at Night the gun were fired.Dean's
boys with me, but the person that had done it was gone.I directly
suspected who it was, and I halloed to him by name, that _he was
discovered_.I did this that the party who fired might know I was on the
watch.I cannot find any ball, but whatever the gun was charged with
passed through about three or four inches below the window making a hole
large enough to a finger to go through--the muzzle must have been very
near as the place is black with the powder, and the glass of the window
is shattered to pieces.Mr Shute after examining the place and getting
what information could be had, issued a warrant to take up Derrick, and
after examination committed him."He is now on bail (five hundred dollars) to take his trial at the
supreme Court in May next.Derrick owes me forty-eight dollars for which
I have his note, and he was to work it out in making stone fence which
he has not even begun and besides this I have had to pay forty-two
pounds eleven shillings for which I had passed my word for him at Mr.Derrick borrowed the Gun under pretence of giving Mrs.He was with Purdy about two hours before the
attack on the house was made and he came from thence to Dean's half
drunk and brought with him a bottle of Rum, and Purdy was with him when
he was taken up."I am exceedingly well in health and shall always be glad to see you.Hubbs tells me that your horse is getting better.Shute sent for
the horse and took him when the first snow came but he leaped the fences
and came back.If this be the case I
suppose he has broke or cracked it in leaping a fence when he was lame
on the other hind leg, and hung with his hind legs in the fence.I am
glad to hear what you tell me of Thomas.He shall not want for anything
that is necessary if he be a good boy for he has no friend but me.You
have not given me any account about the meeting house.The window of the room said to have been Paine's study is close to the
ground, and it is marvellous that he was not murdered.**

     * I am indebted for this letter to Dr.Clair J. Grece, of
     England, whose uncle, Daniel Constable, probably got it from
     Carver.** Derrick (or Dederick) appears by the records at White
     Plains to have been brought up for trial May 19, 1806, and
     to have been recognized in the sum of $500 for his
     appearance at the next Court of Oyer and Terminer and
     General Gaol Delivery, and in the meantime to keep the peace
     towards the

People, and especially towards Thomas Payne (sic).Paine, Christopher
Hubbs, and Andrew A. Dean were recognized in $50 to appear and give
evidence against Derrick.Nothing further appears in the records
(examined for me by Mr.B. D. Washburn up to 1810).It is pretty certain
that Paine did not press the charges.The most momentous change which had come over America during Paine's
absence was the pro-slavery reaction.This had set in with the first
Congress.An effort was made by the Virginia representatives to check
the slave traffic by imposing a duty of $10 on each <DW64> imported, but
was defeated by an alliance of members from more Southern States and
professedly antislavery men of the North.The Southern leader in this
first victory of slavery in Congress was Major Jackson of Georgia, who
defended the institution as scriptural and civilizing.Franklin published (Federal Gazette, March 25, 1790) a parody of
Jackson's speech, purporting to be a speech uttered in 1687 by a Divan
of Algiers in defence of piracy and slavery, against a sect of Erika,
or Purists, who had petitioned for their suppression.Franklin was now
president of the American Antislavery Society, founded in Philadelphia
in 1775 five weeks after the appearance of Paine's scheme of
emancipation (March 8, 1775).Rush was also active in the cause, and
to him Paine wrote (March 16, 1790) the letter on the subject elsewhere
quoted (L, p.This letter was published by Rush (Columbian
Magazine, vol.318) while the country was still agitated by the
debate which was going on in Congress at the time when it was written,
on a petition of the Antislavery Society, signed by Franklin,--his
last public act.Franklin died April 17, 1790, twenty-five days after the close of the
debate, in which he was bitterly denounced by the proslavery party.Washington had pronounced the petition "inopportune,"--his presidential
mansion in New York was a few steps from the slave-market,--Jefferson
(now Secretary of State) had no word to say for it, Madison had smoothed
over the matter by a compromise.Thenceforth slavery had become a
suppressed subject, and the slave trade, whenever broached in Congress,
had maintained its immunity.In 1803, even under Jefferson's
administration, the <DW64>s fleeing from oppression in Domingo were
forbidden asylum in America, because it was feared that they would
incite servile insurrections.That the United States, under presidency
of Jefferson, should stand aloof from the struggle of the <DW64>s in
Domingo for liberty, cut Paine to the heart.Unperturbed by the attempt
made on his own life a few days before, he wrote to Jefferson on New
Year's Day, 1805, (from New Rochelle,) what may be regarded as an
appeal:




{1805}

"Dear Sir,--I have some thoughts of coming to Washington this winter, as
I may as well spend a part of it there as elsewhere.But lest bad roads
or any other circumstance should prevent me I suggest a thought for
your consideration, and I shall be glad if in this case, as in that of
Louisiana, we may happen to think alike without knowing what each other
had thought of."The affair of Domingo will cause some trouble in either of the cases
in which it now stands.If armed merchantmen force their way through the
blockading fleet it will embarrass us with the french Government;
and, on the other hand, if the people of Domingo think that we show a
partiality to the french injurious to them there is danger they will
turn Pirates upon us, and become more injurious on account of vicinity
than the barbary powers, and England will encourage it, as she
encourages the Indians.Domingo is lost to France either as to the
Government or the possession of it, But if a way could be found out to
bring about a peace between france and Domingo through the mediation,
and under the guarantee of the United States, it would be beneficial to
all parties, and give us a great commercial and political standing,
not only with the present people of Domingo but with the West Indies
generally.And when we have gained their confidence by acts of
justice and friendship, they will listen to our advice in matters of
Civilization and Government, and prevent the danger of their becoming
pirates, which I think they will be, if driven to desperation."The United States is the only power that can undertake a measure of
this kind.She is now the Parent of the Western world, and her knowledge
of the local circumstances of it gives her an advantage in a matter of
this kind superior to any European Nation.She is enabled by situation,
and grow[ing] importance to become a guarantee, and to see, as far as
her advice and influence can operate, that the conditions on the part
of Domingo be fulfilled.It is also a measure that accords with
the humanity of her principles, with her policy, and her commercial
interest."All that Domingo wants of France, is, that France agree to let her
alone, and withdraw her forces by sea and land; and in return for
this Domingo to give her a monopoly of her commerce for a term of
years,--that is, to import from France all the utensils and manufactures
she may have occasion to use or consume (except such as she can more
conveniently procure from the manufactories of the United States), and
to pay for them in produce.France will gain more by this than she can
expect to do even by a conquest of the Island, and the advantage to
America will be that she will become the carrier of both, at least
during the present war."There was considerable dislike in Paris against the Expedition to
Domingo; and the events that have since taken place were then often
predicted.The opinion that generally prevailed at that time was that
the commerce of the Island was better than the conquest of it,--that the
conquest could not be accomplished without destroying the <DW64>s, and
in that case the Island would be of no value."I think it might be signified to the french Government, yourself is
the best judge of the means, that the United States are disposed to
undertake an accommodation so as to put an end to this otherwise endless
slaughter on both sides, and to procure to France the best advantages in
point of commerce that the state of things will admit of.Such an offer,
whether accepted or not, cannot but be well received, and may lead to a
good end."There is now a fine snow, and if it continues I intend to set off
for Philadelphia in about eight days, and from thence to Washington.I congratulate your constituents on the success of the election for
President and Vice-President."Yours in friendship,

"Thomas Paine."The journey to Washington was given up, and Paine had to content himself
with his pen.He took in several newspapers, and was as keenly alive
as ever to the movements of the world.His chief anxiety was lest some
concession might be made to the Louisianians about the slave trade, that
region being an emporium of the traffic which grew more enterprising and
brutal as its term was at hand.Much was said of the great need of the
newly acquired region for more laborers, and it was known that Jefferson
was by no means so severe in his opposition to slavery as he was once
supposed to be.The President repeatedly invited Paine's views, and they
were given fully and freely.The following extracts are from a letter
dated New York, January 25, 1805:

"Mr.Wingate called on me at N. York, where I
happened to be when they arrived on their Journey from Washington to
the Eastward: I find by Mr.Lincoln that the Louisiana Memorialists will
have to return as they came and the more decisively Congress put an
end to this business the better.The Cession of Louisiana is a great
acquisition; but great as it is it would be an incumbrance on the Union
were the prayer of the petitioners to be granted, nor would the lauds be
worth settling if the settlers are to be under a french jurisdiction....
When the emigrations from the United States into Louisiana become equal
to the number of french inhabitants it may then be proper and right to
erect such part where such equality exists into a constitutional state;
but to do it now would be sending the american settlers into exile....
For my own part, I wish the name of Louisiana to be lost, and this may
in a great measure be done by giving names to the new states that will
serve as descriptive of their situation or condition.France lost the
names and almost the remembrance of provinces by dividing them into
departments with appropriate names."Next to the acquisition of the territory and the Government of it
is that of settling it.The people of the Eastern States are the
best settlers of a new country, and of people from abroad the German
Peasantry are the best.The Irish in general are generous and dissolute.The Scotch turn their attention to traffic, and the English to
manufactures.These people are more fitted to live in cities than to
be cultivators of new lands.I know not if in Virginia they are much
acquainted with the importation of German redemptioners, that is,
servants indented for a term of years.The best farmers in Pennsylvania
are those who came over in this manner or the descendants of them.The
price before the war used to be twenty pounds Pennsylvania currency for
an indented servant for four years, that is, the ship owner, got twenty
pounds per head passage money, so that upon two hundred persons he would
receive after their arrival four thousand pounds paid by the persons who
purchased the time of their indentures which was generally four
years.These would be the best people, of foreigners, to bring into
Louisiana--because they would grow to be citizens.Whereas bringing poor
<DW64>s to work the lands in a state of slavery and wretchedness, is,
besides the immorality of it, the certain way of preventing population
and consequently of preventing revenue.I question if the revenue
arising from ten <DW64>s in the consumption of imported articles is
equal to that of one white citizen.In the articles of dress and of the
table it is almost impossible to make a comparison."These matters though they do not belong to the class of principles are
proper subjects for the consideration of Government; and it is always
fortunate when the interests of Government and that of humanity act
unitedly.But I much doubt if the Germans would come to be under a
french Jurisdiction.Congress must frame the laws under which they are
to serve out their time; after which Congress might give them a few
acres of land to begin with for themselves and they would soon be able
to buy more.I am inclined to believe that by adopting this method the
Country will be more peopled in about twenty years from the present time
than it has been in all the times of the french and Spaniards.Spain,
I believe, held it chiefly as a barrier to her dominions in Mexico, and
the less it was improved the better it agreed with that policy; and
as to france she never shewed any great disposition or gave any great
encouragement to colonizing.It is chiefly small countries, that are
straitened for room at home, like Holland and England, that go in quest
of foreign settlements....

"I have again seen and talked with the gentleman from Hamburg.He tells
me that some Vessels under pretence of shipping persons to America
carried them to England to serve as soldiers and sailors.He tells me
he has the Edict or Proclamation of the Senate of Hamburg forbidding
persons shipping themselves without the consent of the Senate, and that
he will give me a copy of it, which if he does soon enough I will send
with this letter.He says that the American Consul has been spoken to
respecting this kidnapping business under American pretences, but
that he says he has no authority to interfere.The German members of
Congress, or the Philadelphia merchants or ship-owners who have been
in the practice of importing German redemptioners, can give you better
information respecting the business of importation than I can.But the
redemptioners thus imported must be at the charge of the Captain or
ship owner till their time is sold.Some of the quaker Merchants of
Philadelphia went a great deal into the importation of German servants
or redemptioners.It agreed with the morality of their principles that
of bettering people's condition, and to put an end to the practice of
importing slaves.I think it not an unreasonable estimation to suppose
that the population of Louisiana may be increased ten thousand souls
every year.What <DW44>s the settlement of it is the want of labourers,
and until labourers can be had the sale of the lands will be slow.Were
I twenty years younger, and my name and reputation as well known in
European countries as it is now, I would contract for a quantity of land
in Louisiana and go to Europe and bring over settlers....

"It is probable that towards the close of the session I may make an
excursion to Washington.The piece on Gouverneur Morris's Oration
on Hamilton and that on the Louisiana Memorial are the last I have
published; and as every thing of public affairs is now on a good ground
I shall do as I did after the War, remain a quiet spectator and attend
now to my own affairs."I intend making a collection of all the pieces I have published,
beginning with Common Sense, and of what I have by me in manuscript,
and publish them by subscription.I have deferred doing this till the
presidential election should be over, but I believe there was not much
occasion for that caution.There is more hypocrisy than bigotry in
America.When I was in Connecticut the summer before last, I fell
in company with some Baptists among whom were three Ministers.The
conversation turned on the election for President, and one of them who
appeared to be a leading man said 'They cry out against Mr.Jefferson
because, they say he is a Deist.Well, a Deist may be a good man, and if
he think it right, it is right to him.For my own part, said he, 'I had
rather vote for a Deist than for a blue-skin presbyterian.''You judge
right,' said I, 'for a man that is not of any of the sectaries will hold
the balance even between all; but give power to a bigot of any sectary
and he will use it to the oppression of the rest, as the blue-skins
do in connection,' They all agree in this sentiment, and I have always
found it assented to in any company I have had occasion to use it."I judge the collection I speak of will make five volumes octavo of four
hundred pages each at two dollars a volume to be paid on delivery; and
as they will be delivered separately, as fast as they can be printed and
bound the subscribers may stop when they please.The three first volumes
will be political and each piece will be accompanied with an account
of the state of affairs at the time it was written, whether in America,
france, or England, which will also shew the occasion of writing it.of the Crisis published the 19th
December '76 is '_These are the times that try men's souls,_' It is
therefore necessary as explanatory to the expression in all future times
to shew what those times were.The two last volumes will be theological
and those who do not chuse to take them may let them alone.They will
have the right to do so, by the conditions of the subscription.I shall
also make a miscellaneous Volume of correspondence, Essays, and
some pieces of Poetry, which I believe will have some claim to
originality....

"I find by the Captain [from New Orleans] above mentioned that several
Liverpool ships have been at New Orleans.It is chiefly the people
of Liverpool that employ themselves in the slave trade and they bring
cargoes of those unfortunate <DW64>s to take back in return the hard
money and the produce of the country.Had I the command of the elements
I would blast Liverpool with fire and brimstone.It is the Sodom and
Gomorrah of brutality....

"I recollect when in France that you spoke of a plan of making the
<DW64>s tenants on a plantation, that is, allotting each Negroe family
a quantity of land for which they were to pay to the owner a certain
quantity of produce.I think that numbers of our free <DW64>s might be
provided for in this manner in Louisiana.The best way that occurs to me
is for Congress to give them their passage to New Orleans, then for them
to hire themselves out to the planters for one or two years; they would
by this means learn plantation business, after which to place them on a
tract of land as before mentioned.A great many good things may now be
done; and I please myself with the idea of suggesting my thoughts to
you."Old Captain Landais who lives at Brooklyn on Long Island opposite
New York calls sometimes to see me.He is a very
respectable old man.I wish something had been done for him in Congress
on his petition; for I think something is due to him, nor do I see how
the Statute of limitation can consistently apply to him.The law in John
Adams's administration, which cut off all commerce and communication
with france, cut him off from the chance of coming to America to put
in his claim.I suppose that the claims of some of our merchants on
England, france and Spain is more than 6 or 7 years standing yet no
law of limitation, that I know of take place between nations or between
individuals of different nations.I consider a statute of limitation to
be a domestic law, and can only have a domestic operation.Miller,
one of the New York Senators in Congress, knows Landais and can give you
an account of him."Concerning my former letter, on Domingo, I intended had I come to
Washington to have talked with Pichon about it--if you had approved that
method, for it can only be brought forward in an indirect way.The two
Emperors are at too great a distance in objects and in colour to have
any intercourse but by Fire and Sword, yet something I think might be
done.It is time I should close this long epistle.Paine made but a brief stay in New York (where he boarded with William
Carver).His next letter (April 22d) is from New Rochelle, written to
John Fellows, an auctioneer in New York City, one of his most faithful
friends."Citizen: I send this by the N. Rochelle boat and have desired the
boatman to call on you with it.He is to bring up Bebia and Thomas and I
will be obliged to you to see them safe on board.The boat will leave N.
Y. on friday."I have left my pen knife at Carver's.It is, I believe, in the writing
desk.It is a small french pen knife that slides into the handle.I wish
Carver would look behind the chest in the bed room.I miss some papers
that I suppose are fallen down there.The boys will bring up with them
one pair of the blankets Mrs.Bonneville took down and also my best
blanket which is at Carver's.--I send enclosed three dollars for a ream
of writing paper and one dollar for some letter paper, and porterage to
the boat.I wish you to give the boys some good advice when you go with
them, and tell them that the better they behave the better it will be
for them.I am now their only dependance, and they ought to know it.of the Prospect, while I was at Carver's, are left there.since I came to New
Rochelle."'The Thomas mentioned in this letter was Paine's godson, and "Bebia" was
Benjamin,--the late Brigadier-General Bonneville, U. S. A. The third
son, Louis, had been sent to his father in France.The _Prospect_ was
Elihu Palmer's rationalistic paper.Early in this year a series of charges affecting Jefferson's public and
private character were published by one Hulbert, on the authority of
Thomas Turner of Virginia.Beginning with an old charge of cowardice,
while Governor (of which Jefferson had been acquitted by the Legislature
of Virginia), the accusation proceeded to instances of immorality,
persons and places being named.The following letter from New Rochelle,
July 19th, to John Fellows enclosed Paine's reply, which appeared in the
_American Citizen_, July 23d and 24th:

     * This letter is in the possession of Mr.Grenville Kane,
     Tuxedo, N. Y."Citizen--I inclose you two pieces for Cheetham's paper, which I wish
you to give to him yourself.in one daily paper,
and the other number in the next daily paper, and then both in his
country paper.There has been a great deal of anonimous (sic) abuse
thrown out in the federal papers against Mr.Jefferson, but until some
names could be got hold of it was fighting the air to take any notice
of them.We have now got hold of two names, your townsman Hulbert, the
hypocritical Infidel of Sheffield, and Thomas Turner of Virginia, his
correspondent.I have already given Hulbert a basting with my name
to it, because he made use of my name in his speech in the Mass.Turner has not given me the same cause in the letter he
wrote (and evidently) to Hulbert, and which Hulbert, (for it could be
no other person) has published in the Repertory to vindicate himself.Jefferson, and I have taken
them up one by one, which is the first time the opportunity has offered
for doing it; for before this it was promiscuous abuse.I have not
signed it either with my name or signature (Common Sense) because I
found myself obliged, in order to made such scoundrels feel a little
smart, to go somewhat out of my usual manner of writing, but there are
some sentiments and some expressions that will be supposed to be in my
stile, and I have no objection to that supposition, but I do not wish
Mr.Jefferson to be _obliged_ to know it is from me."Since receiving your letter, which contained no direct information of
any thing I wrote to you about, I have written myself to Mr.Barrett
accompanied with a piece for the editor of the Baltimore Evening Post,
who is an acquaintance of his, but I have received no answer from Mr.B., neither has the piece been published in the Evening Post.I will be
obliged to you to call on him & to inform me about it.You did not
tell me if you called upon Foster; but at any rate do not delay the
enclosed.--I do not trouble you with any messages or compliments, for
you never deliver any.* I am indebted for this letter to Mr.editor of the National Reformer,  London.By a minute comparison of the two alleged specifications of immorality,
Paine proved that one was intrinsically absurd, and the other without
trustworthy testimony.As for the charge of cowardice, Paine contended
that it was the duty of a civil magistrate to move out of danger, as
Congress had done in the Revolution.The article was signed "A Spark
from the Altar of '76," but the writer was easily recognized.The
service thus done Jefferson was greater than can now be easily realized.Another paper by Paine was on "Constitutions, Governments and
Charters."It was an argument to prove the unconstitutionality in New
York of the power assumed by the legislature to grant charters.This
defeated the object of annual elections, by placing the act of one
legislature beyond the reach of its successor.He proposes that all
matters of "extraordinary legislation," such as those involving grants
of land and incorporations of companies, "shall be passed only by a
legislature succeeding the one in which it was proposed."Had such an
article been originally in the Constitution [of New York] the bribery
and corruption employed to seduce and manage the members of the late
legislature, in the affair of the Merchants' Bank, could not have taken
place.It would not have been worth while to bribe men to do what they
had no power of doing.Madame Bonneville hated country life, and insisted on going to New
York.Paine was not sorry to have her leave, as she could not yet talk
English, and did not appreciate Paine's idea of plain living and high
thinking.She apparently had a notion that Paine had a mint of money,
and, like so many others, might have attributed to parsimony efforts
the unpaid author was making to save enough to give her children,
practically fatherless, some start in life.The philosophic solitude in
which he was left at New Rochelle is described in a letter (July 31st)
to John Fellows, in New York.Bonneville go into some family as
a teacher, for she has not the least talent of managing affairs for
herself.I will take care of him for his
own sake and his father's, but that is all I have to say.... I am
master of an empty house, or nearly so.I have six chairs and a table, a
straw-bed, a featherbed, and a bag of straw for Thomas, a tea kettle, an
iron pot, an iron baking pan, a frying pan, a gridiron, cups, saucers,
plates and dishes, knives and forks, two candlesticks and a pair of
snuffers.I have a pair of fine oxen and an ox-cart, a good horse, a
Chair, and a one-horse cart; a cow, and a sow and 9 pigs.When you come
you must take such fare as you meet with, for I live upon tea, milk,
fruit-pies, plain dumplins, and a piece of meat when I get it; but I
live with that retirement and quiet that suit me.Bonneville was
an encumbrance upon me all the while she was here, for she would not do
anything, not even make an apple dumplin for her own children.If you
cannot make yourself up a straw bed, I can let you have blankets, and
you will have no occasion to go over to the tavern to sleep."As I do not see any federal papers, except by accident, I know not if
they have attempted any remarks or criticisms on my Eighth Letter, [or]
the piece on Constitutional Governments and Charters, the two numbers
on Turner's letter, and also the piece on Hulbert.As to anonymous
paragraphs, it is not worth noticing them.I consider the generality of
such editors only as a part of their press, and let them pass.--I want
to come to Morrisania, and it is probable I may come on to N. Y., but I
wish you to answer this letter first.--Yours in friendship."* I am indebted for an exact copy of the letter from which
     this is extracted to-Dr.Garnett of the British Museum,
     though it is not in that institution.It must not be supposed from what Paine says of Madame Bonneville that
there was anything acrimonious in their relations.She was thirty-one
years younger than Paine, fond of the world, handsome.The old
gentleman, all day occupied with writing, could give her little
companionship, even if he could have conversed in French, But he
indulged her in every way, gave her more money than he could afford,
devoted his ever decreasing means to her family.She had boundless
reverence for him, but, as we have seen, had no taste for country life.Probably, too, after Dederick's attempt on Paine's life she became
nervous in the lonely house.So she had gone to New York, where she
presently found good occupation as a teacher of French in several
families.Her sons, however, were fond of New Rochelle, and of Paine,
who had a knack of amusing children, and never failed to win their
affection.*

     * In the Tarrytown Argus, October 18, 1890, appeared an
     interesting notice of the Rev.Alexander Davis (Methodist),
     by C. K. B[uchanan] in which it is stated that Davis, a
     native of New Rochelle, remembered the affection of Paine,
     who "would bring him round-hearts and hold him on his knee."Many such recollections of his little neighbors have been
     reported.The spring of 1805 at New Rochelle was a pleasant one for Paine.Mary travelled to the bedroom.He wrote his last political pamphlet, which was printed by Duane,
Philadelphia, with the title: "Thomas Paine to the Citizens of
Pennsylvania, on the Proposal for Calling a Convention."It opens with a
reference to his former life and work in Philadelphia."Removed as I
now am from the place, and detached from everything of personal party, I
address this token to you on the ground of principle, and in remembrance
of former times and friendships."He gives an historical account of the
negative or veto-power, finding it the English Parliament's badge of
disgrace under William of Normandy, a defence of personal prerogative
that ought to find no place in a republic.He advises that in the new
Constitution the principle of arbitration, outside of courts, should
be established.The governor should possess no power of patronage; he
should make one in a Council of Appointments.The Senate is an imitation
of the House of Lords.The Representatives should be divided by lot into
two equal parts, sitting in different chambers.One half, by not
being entangled in the debate of the other on the issue submitted, nor
committed by voting, would become silently possessed of the arguments,
and be in a calm position to review the whole.The votes of the two
houses should be added together, and the majority decide.Judges should
be removable by some constitutional mode, without the formality of
impeachment at "stated periods."Mary went to the office.(In 1807 Paine wrote to Senator
Mitchell of New York suggesting an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States by which judges of the Supreme Court might be removed by
the President for reasonable cause, though insufficient for impeachment,
on the address of a majority of both Houses of Congress.)In this pamphlet was included the paper already mentioned (on Charters,
etc.The two essays prove that
there was no abatement in Paine's intellect, and that despite occasional
"flings" at the "Feds,"--retorts on their perpetual naggings,--he was
still occupied with the principles of political philosophy.At this time Paine had put the two young Bon-nevilles at a school in
New Rochelle, where they also boarded.He had too much solitude in the
house, and too little nourishment for so much work.So the house was let
and he was taken in as a boarder by Mrs.Bayeaux, in the old Bayeaux
House, which is still standing,*--but Paine's pecuniary situation now
gave him anxiety.He was earning nothing, his means were found to be
far less than he supposed, the needs of the Bonnevilles increasing.Considering the important defensive articles he had written for the
President, and their long friendship, he ventured (September 30th) to
allude to his situation and to remind him that his State, Virginia,
had once proposed to give him a tract of land, but had not done so.He
suggests that Congress should remember his services.Bayeaux is mentioned in Paine's letter about
     Dederick's attempt on his life."But I wish you to be assured that whatever event this proposal may take
it will make no alteration in my principles or my conduct I have been
a volunteer to the world for thirty years without taking profits from
anything I have published in America or Europe.Sandra travelled to the kitchen.I have relinquished all
profits that those publications might come cheap among the people for
whom they were intended--Yours in friendship."This was followed by another note (November 14th) asking if it had been
received.What answer came from the President does not appear.About this time Paine published an essay on "The cause of the Yellow
Fever, and the means of preventing it in places not yet infected with
it Addressed to the Board of Health in America."The treatise, which he
dates June 27th, is noticed by Dr.Paine points out
that the epidemic which almost annually afflicted New York, had been
unknown to the Indians; that it began around the wharves, and did not
reach the higher parts of the city.He does not believe the disease
certainly imported from the West Indies, since it is not carried from
New York to other places.He thinks that similar filthy conditions of
the wharves and the water about them generate the miasma alike in the
West Indies and in New York.It would probably be escaped if the wharves
were built on stone or iron arches, permitting the tides to cleanse the
shore and carry away the accumulations of vegetable and animal matter
decaying around every ship and dock.He particularly proposes the use of
arches for wharves about to be constructed at Corlder's Hook and on the
North River.Francis justly remarks, in his "Old New York," that Paine's writings
were usually suggested by some occasion.Besides this instance of the
essay on the yellow fever, he mentions one on the origin of Freemasonry,
there being an agitation in New York concerning that fraternity.But this essay---in which Paine, with ingenuity and learning, traces
Freemasonry to the ancient solar mythology also identified with
Christian mythology--was not published during his life.It was published
by Madame Bonneville with the passages affecting Christianity omitted.The original manuscript was obtained, however, and published with an
extended preface, criticizing Paine's theory, the preface being in
turn criticized by Paine's editor.The preface was probably written by
Colonel Fellows, author of a large work on Freemasonry.A NEW YORK PROMETHEUS

When Paine left Bordentown, on March 1st 1803, driving past placards of
the devil flying away with him, and hooted by a pious mob at Trenton,
it was with hope of a happy reunion with old friends in more enlightened
New York.Few, formerly senator from Georgia, his friend of many
years, married Paine's correspondent, Kitty Nicholson, to whom was
written the beautiful letter from London (L, p.Few had
become a leading man in New York, and his home, and that of the
Nicholsons, were of highest social distinction.Paine's arrival at
Lovett's Hotel was well known, but not one of those former friends came
near him."They were actively as well as passively religious," says
Henry Adams, "and their relations with Paine after his return to America
in 1802 were those of compassion only, for his intemperate and offensive
habits, and intimacy was impossible.Adams will vainly search
his materials for any intimation at that time of the intemperate or
offensive habits.Gallatin continued to risk
     Paine.360

The "compassion" is due to those devotees of an idol requiring sacrifice
of friendship, loyalty, and intelligence.The
old author was as a grand organ from which a cunning hand might bring
music to be remembered through the generations.In that brain were
stored memories of the great Americans, Frenchmen, Englishmen who acted
in the revolutionary dramas, and of whom he loved to talk.What would a
diary of interviews with Paine, written by his friend Kitty Few, be now
worth?To intolerance, the least pardonable form of ignorance, must be
credited the failure of those former friends, who supposed themselves
educated, to make more of Thomas Paine than a scarred monument of an Age
of Unreason.But the ostracism of Paine by the society which, as Henry Adams states,
had once courted him "as the greatest literary genius of his day,"
was not due merely to his religious views, which were those of various
statesmen who had incurred no such odium.There was at work a lingering
dislike and distrust of the common people.From the scholastic study, where heresies once
written only in Latin were daintily wrapped up in metaphysics, from
drawing-rooms where cynical smiles went round at Methodism, and other
forms of "Christianity in earnest," Paine carried heresy to the people.And he brought it as a religion,--as fire from the fervid heaven
that orthodoxy had monopolized.The popularity of his writing, the
revivalistic earnestness of his protest against dogmas common to all
sects, were revolutionary; and while the vulgar bigots were binding him
on their rock of ages, and tearing his vitals, most of the educated, the
social leaders, were too prudent to manifest any sympathy they may have
felt.**

     * When Paine first reached New York, 1803, he was (March
     5th) entertained at supper by John Crauford.For being
     present Eliakira Ford, a Baptist elder, was furiously
     denounced, as were others of the company.** An exception was the leading Presbyterian, John Mason,
     who lived to denounce Channing as "the devil's disciple."Grant Thorbura was psalm-singer in this Scotch preacher's
     church.Curiosity to see the lion led Thorburn to visit
     Paine, for which he was "suspended."Thorburn afterwards
     made amends by fathering Cheetham's slanders of Paine after
     Cheetham had become too infamous to quote.It were unjust to suppose that Paine met with nothing but abuse and
maltreatment from ministers of serious orthodoxy in New York.They had
warmly opposed his views, even denounced them, but the controversy seems
to have died away until he took part in the deistic propaganda of Elihu
Palmer.'Fellows (July 31st) shows Paine much
interested in the "cause":

"I am glad that Palmer and Foster have got together.I enclose a letter I received a few days since from
Groton, in Connecticut The letter is well written, and with a good deal
of sincere enthusiasm.The publication of it would do good, but there is
an impropriety in publishing a man's name to a private letter.You
may show the letter to Palmer and Foster.... Remember me to my much
respected friend Carver and tell him I am sure we shall succeed if we
hold on.We have already silenced the clamor of the priests.They act
now as if they would say, let us alone and we will let you alone.You do
not tell me if the Prospect goes on.As Carver will want pay he may have
it from me, and pay when it suits him; but I expect he will take a ride
up some Saturday, and then he can chuse for himself."The result of this was that Paine passed the winter in New York,
where he threw himself warmly into the theistic movement, and no doubt
occasionally spoke from Elihu Palmer's platform.The rationalists who gathered around Elihu Palmer in New York were
called the "Columbian Illuminati."The pompous epithet looks like an
effort to connect them with the Columbian Order (Tammany) which was
supposed to represent Jacobinism and French ideas generally.Their
numbers were considerable, but they did not belong to fashionable
society.Their lecturer, Elihu Palmer, was a scholarly gentleman of the
highest character.A native of Canterbury, Connecticut, (born 1754) he
had graduated at Dartmouth.Watt to
a widow, Mary Powell, in New York (1803), at the time when he was
lecturing in the Temple of Reason (Snow's Rooms, Broadway).This
suggests that he had not broken with the clergy altogether.Somewhat
later he lectured at the Union Hotel, William Street He had studied
divinity, and turned against the creeds what was taught him for their
support."I have more than once [says Dr.Francis] listened to Palmer; none could
be weary within the sound of his voice; his diction was classical; and
much of his natural theology attractive by variety of illustration.But admiration of him sank into despondency at his assumption, and his
sarcastic assaults on things most holy.His boldest phillippic was his
discourse on the title-page of the Bible, in which, with the double
shield of jacobinism and infidelity, he warned rising America against
confidence in a book authorised by the monarchy of England.Palmer
delivered his sermons in the Union Hotel in William Street."Francis does not appear to have known Paine personally, but had seen
him.Palmer's chief friends in New York were, he says, John Fellows;
Rose, an unfortunate lawyer; Taylor, a philanthropist; and Charles
Christian.John Foster, another rationalist lecturer, Dr.Francis says he had a noble presence and great eloquence.Foster's
exordium was an invocation to the goddess of Liberty.John Fellows, always the devoted friend of Paine, was an
auctioneer, but in later life was a constable in the city courts.He
has left three volumes which show considerable literary ability, and
industrious research; but these were unfortunately bestowed on such
extinct subjects as Freemasonry, the secret of Junius, and controversies
concerning General Putnam.It is much to be regretted that Colonel
Fellows should not have left a volume concerning Paine, with whom he was
in especial intimacy, during his last years.Other friends of Paine were Thomas Addis Emmet, Walter Morton, a lawyer,
and Judge Hertell, a man of wealth, and a distinguished member of the
State Assembly.Fulton also was much in New York, and often called on
Paine.Paine was induced to board at the house of William Carver (36
Cedar Street), which proved a grievous mistake.Carver had introduced
himself to Paine, saying that he remembered him when he was an exciseman
at Lewes, England, he (Carver) being a young farrier there.He made loud
professions of deism, and of devotion to Paine.The farrier of Lewes
had become a veterinary practitioner and shopkeeper in New York.Paine supposed that he would be cared for in the house of this active
rationalist, but the man and his family were illiterate and vulgar.His sojourn at Carver's probably shortened Paine's life.Carver, to
anticipate the narrative a little, turned out to be a bad-hearted man
and a traitor.Paine had accumulated a mass of fragmentary writings on religious
subjects, and had begun publishing them in a journal started in 1804
by Elihu Palmer,--_The Prospect; or View of the Moral World_.This
succeeded the paper called _The Temple of Reason_.One of Paine's
objects was to help the new journal, which attracted a good deal of
attention.His first communication (February 18, 1804), was on a sermon
by Robert Hall, on "Modern Infidelity," sent him by a gentleman in New
York.The following are some of its trenchant paragraphs:

"Is it a fact that Jesus Christ died for the sins of the world, and
how is it proved?If a God he could not die, and as a man he could not
redeem: how then is this redemption proved to be fact?It is said that
Adam eat of the forbidden fruit, commonly called an apple, and thereby
subjected himself and all his posterity forever to eternal damnation.This is worse than visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generations.But how was the death of Jesus
Christ to affect or alter the case?If so,
would it not have been better to have crucified Adam upon the forbidden
tree, and made a new man?""Why do not the Christians, to be consistent, make Saints of Judas and
Pontius Pilate, for they were the persons who accomplished the act of
salvation.The merit of a sacrifice, if there can be any merit in it,
was never in the thing sacrificed, but in the persons offering up the
sacrifice--and therefore Judas and Pilate ought to stand first in the
calendar of Saints."Other contributions to the _Prospect_ were: "Of the word Religion";
"Cain and Abel"; "The Tower of Babel"; "Of the religion of Deism
compared with the Christian Religion"; "Of the Sabbath Day in
Connecticut"; "Of the Old and New Testaments"; "Hints towards forming a
Society for inquiring into the truth or falsehood of ancient history,
so far as history is connected with systems of religion ancient and
modern"; "To the members of the Society styling itself the Missionary
Society"; "On Deism, and the writings of Thomas Paine"; "Of the Books
of the New Testament" There were several communications without any
heading.Passages and sentences from these little essays have long been
a familiar currency among freethinkers."We admire the wisdom of the ancients, yet they had no bibles, nor
books, called revelation.They cultivated the reason that God gave them,
studied him in his works, and rose to eminence.""The Cain and Abel of Genesis appear to be no other than the ancient
Egyptian story of Typhon and Osiris, the darkness and the light, which
answered very well as allegory without being believed as fact.""Those who most believe the Bible are those who know least about it.""Another observation upon the story of Babel is the inconsistence of it
with respect to the opinion that the bible is the word of God given for
the information of mankind; for nothing could so effectually prevent
such a word being known by mankind as confounding their language.""God has not given us reason for the purpose of confounding us.""Jesus never speaks of Adam, of the Garden of Eden, nor of what is
called the fall of man.""Is not the Bible warfare the same kind of warfare as the Indians
themselves carry on?"[On the presentation of a Bible to some Osage
chiefs in New York.]"The remark of the Emperor Julian is worth observing.'If, said he,
'there ever had been or could be a Tree of Knowledge, instead of God
forbidding man to eat thereof, it would be that of which he would order
him to eat the most.'""Do Christians not see that their own religion is founded on a human
sacrifice?Many thousands of human sacrifices have since been offered on
the altar of the Christian Religion.""For several centuries past the dispute has been about doctrines."The Bible has been received by Protestants on the authority of the
Church of Rome.""The same degree of hearsay evidence, and that at third and fourth hand,
would not, in a court of justice, give a man title to a cottage, and
yet the priests of this profession presumptuously promise their deluded
followers the kingdom of Heaven.""Nobody fears for the safety of a mountain, but a hillock of sand may
be washed away.Blow then, O ye priests, 'the Trumpet in Zion,' for the
Hillock is in danger."The force of Paine's negations was not broken by any weakness for
speculations of his own.He constructed no system to invite the missiles
of antagonists.It is, indeed, impossible to deny without affirming;
denial that two and two make five affirms that they make four.The basis
of Paine's denials being the divine wisdom and benevolence, there was in
his use of such expressions an implication of limitation in the divine
nature.Wisdom implies the necessity of dealing with difficulties, and
benevolence the effort to make all sentient creatures happy.Neither
quality is predicable of an omniscient and omnipotent being, for whom
there could be no difficulties or evils to overcome.confuse the world with his doubts or with his mere opinions.He stuck to
his certainties, that the scriptural deity was not the true one, nor
the dogmas called Christian reasonable.But he felt some of the moral
difficulties surrounding theism, and these were indicated in his reply
to the Bishop of Llandaff."The Book of Job belongs either to the ancient Persians, the Chaldeans,
or the Egyptians; because the structure of it is consistent with the
dogma they held, that of a good and evil spirit, called in Job God
and Satan, existing as distinct and separate beings, and it is not
consistent with any dogma of the Jews.... The God of the Jews was the
God of everything.According to Exodus
it was God, and not the Devil, that hardened Pharaoh's heart.According
to the Book of Samuel it was an evil spirit from God that troubled
Saul.And Ezekiel makes God say, in speaking of the Jews, 'I gave them
statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they should not
live.'...As to the precepts, principles, and maxims in the Book of Job,
they show that the people abusively called the heathen, in the books
of the Jews, had the most sublime ideas of the Creator, and the most
exalted devotional morality.It was
the Gentiles who glorified him."Several passages in Paine's works show that he did not believe in a
personal devil; just what he did believe was no doubt written in a part
of his reply to the Bishop, which, unfortunately, he did not live to
carry through the press.In the part that we have he expresses
the opinion that the Serpent of Genesis is an allegory of winter,
necessitating the "coats of skins" to keep Adam and Eve warm, and adds:
"Of these things I shall speak fully when I come in another part to
speak of the ancient religion of the Persians, and compare it with the
modern religion of the New Testament" But this part was never published.The part published was transcribed by Paine and given, not long before
his death, to the widow of Elihu Palmer, who published it in the
_Theophilanthropist_ in 1810.Paine had kept the other part, no doubt
for revision, and it passed with his effects into the hands of Madame
Bonneville, who eventually became a devotee.She either suppressed it or
sold it to some one who destroyed it.We can therefore only infer from
the above extract the author's belief on this momentous point.It seems
clear that he did not attribute any evil to the divine Being.In the
last article Paine published he rebukes the "Predestinarians" for
dwelling mainly on God's "physical attribute" of power."The Deists, in
addition to this, believe in his moral attributes, those of justice and
goodness."Among Paine's papers was found one entitled "My private thoughts of a
Future State," from which his editors have dropped important sentences."I have said in the first part of the Age of Reason that 'I hope for
happiness after this life,' This hope is comfortable to me, and I
presume not to go beyond the comfortable idea of hope, with respect to a
future state.I consider myself in the hands of my Creator, and that he
will dispose of me after this life, consistently with his justice and
goodness.I leave all these matters to him as my Creator and friend,
and I hold it to be presumption in man to make an article of faith as to
what the Creator will do with us hereafter.I do not believe, because
a man and a woman make a child, that it imposes on the Creator the
unavoidable obligation of keeping the being so made in eternal existence
hereafter.It is in his power to do so, or not to do so, and it is not
in our power to decide which he will do."[After quoting from Matthew
25th the figure of the sheep and goats he continues:] "The world cannot
be thus divided.The moral world, like the physical world, is composed
of numerous degrees of character, running imperceptibly one into the
other, in such a manner that no fixed point can be found in either.That
point is nowhere, or is everywhere.The whole world might be divided
into two parts numerically, but not as to moral character; and therefore
the metaphor of dividing them, as sheep and goats can be divided, whose
difference is marked by their external figure, is absurd.All sheep are
still sheep; all goats are still goats; it is their physical nature to
be so.But one part of the world are not all good alike, nor the
other part all wicked alike.There are some exceedingly good, others
exceedingly wicked.There is another description of men who cannot be
ranked with either the one or the other--they belong neither to the
sheep nor the goats.And there is still another description of them who
are so very insignificant, both in character and conduct, as not to be
worth the trouble of damning or saving, or of raising from the dead.My
own opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good,
and endeavouring to make their fellow mortals happy, for this is the
only way in which we can serve God, will be happy hereafter; and that
the very wicked will meet with some punishment.But those who are
neither good nor bad, or are too insignificant for notice, will be dropt
entirely.It is consistent with my idea of God's
justice, and with the reason that God has given me, and I gratefully
know that he has given me a large share of that divine gift."The closing tribute to his own reason, written in privacy, was, perhaps
pardonably, suppressed by the modern editor, and also the reference to
the insignificant who "will be dropt entirely."This sentiment is not
indeed democratic, but it is significant.It seems plain that Paine's
conception of the universe was dualistic.Though he discards the notion
of a devil, I do not find that he ever ridicules it.No doubt he would,
were he now living, incline to a division of nature into organic and
inorganic, and find his deity, as Zoroaster did, in the living as
distinguished from, and sometimes in antagonism with, the "not-living".In this belief he would now find himself in harmony with some of the
ablest modern philosophers.*

     * John Stuart Mill, for instance.Abbott's "Kernel and Husk" (London), and the great work of
     Samuel Laing, "A Modern Zoroastrian."{1806}

The opening year 1806 found Paine in New Rochelle.By insufficient
nourishment in Carver's house his health was impaired.His means were
getting low, insomuch that to support the Bonnevilles he had to sell the
Bordentown house and property.*

     * It was bought for $300 by his friend John Oliver, whose
     daughter, still residing in the house, told me that her
     father to the end of his life "thought everything of Paine."John Oliver, in his old age, visited Colonel Ingersoll in
     order to testify against the aspersions on Paine's character
     and habits.Elihu Palmer had gone off to Philadelphia for a time; he died there of
yellow fever in 1806.The few intelligent people whom Paine knew were
much occupied, and he was almost without congenial society.His hint to
Jefferson of his impending poverty, and his reminder that Virginia had
not yet given him the honorarium he and Madison approved, had brought
no result.With all this, and the loss of early friendships, and the
theological hornet-nest he had found in New York, Paine began to feel
that his return to America was a mistake.The air-castle that had allured him to his beloved land had faded.His
little room with the Bonnevilles in Paris, with its chaos of papers, was
preferable; for there at least he could enjoy the society of educated
persons, free from bigotry.He dwelt a stranger in his Land of Promise.So he resolved to try and free himself from his depressing environment.Jefferson had offered him a ship to
return in, perhaps he would now help him to get back.30th) a letter to the President, pointing out the probabilities of a
crisis in Europe which must result in either a descent on England by
Bonaparte, or in a treaty.In the case that the people of England should
be thus liberated from tyranny, he (Paine) desired to share with his
friends there the task of framing a republic.Should there be, on the
other hand, a treaty of peace, it would be of paramount interest to
American shipping that such treaty should include that maritime compact,
or safety of the seas for neutral ships, of which Paine had written
so much, and which Jefferson himself had caused to be printed in a
pamphlet.Both of these were, therefore, Paine's subjects."I think," he
says, "you will find it proper, perhaps necessary, to send a person to
France in the event of either a treaty or a descent, and I make you an
offer of my services on that occasion to join Mr.Monroe.... As I think
that the letters of a friend to a friend have some claim to an answer,
it will be agreeable to me to receive an answer to this, but without any
wish that you should commit yourself, neither can you be a judge of what
is proper or necessary to be done till about the month of April or May."Paine must face the fact that his
career is ended.It is probable that Elihu Palmer's visit to Philadelphia was connected
with some theistic movement in that city.How it was met, and what
annoyances Paine had to suffer, are partly intimated in the following
letter, printed in the Philadelphia _Commercial Advertiser_, February
10, 1806."To John Inskeep, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia."I saw in the Aurora of January the 30th a piece addressed to you and
signed Isaac Hall.It contains a statement of your malevolent conduct in
refusing to let him have Vine-st.Wharf after he had bid fifty
dollars more rent for it than another person had offered, and had been
unanimously approved of by the Commissioners appointed by law for that
purpose.Among the reasons given by you for this refusal, one was, that
'_Mr Hall was one of Paine's disciples_.'If those whom you may chuse to
call my disciples follow my example in doing good to mankind, they will
pass the confines of this world with a happy mind, while the hope of the
hypocrite shall perish and delusion sink into despair.Inskeep is, for I do not remember the name of
Inskeep at Philadelphia in '_the time that tried men's souls._* He must
be some mushroom of modern growth that has started up on the soil which
the generous services of Thomas Paine contributed to bless with freedom;
neither do I know what profession of religion he is of, nor do I care,
for if he is a man malevolent and unjust, it signifies not to what class
or sectary he may hypocritically belong."As I set too much value on my time to waste it on a man of so little
consequence as yourself, I will close this short address with a
declaration that puts hypocrisy and malevolence to defiance.Here it is:
My motive and object in all my political works, beginning with Common
Sense, the first work I ever published, have been to rescue man from
tyranny and false systems and false principles of government, and enable
him to be free, and establish government for himself; and I have borne
my share of danger in Europe and in America in every attempt I have made
for this purpose.And my motive and object in all my publications on
religious subjects, beginning with the first part of the Age of Reason,
have been to bring man to a right reason that God has given him; to
impress on him the great principles of divine morality, justice, mercy,
and a benevolent disposition to all men and to all creatures; and to
excite in him a spirit of trust, confidence and consolation in his
creator, unshackled by the fable and fiction of books, by whatever
invented name they may be called.I am happy in the continual
contemplation of what I have done, and I thank God that he gave
me talents for the purpose and fortitude to do it It will make the
continual consolation of my departing hours, whenever they finally
arrive."'_These are the times that try men's souls_.'1, written
while on the retreat with the army from fort Lee to the Delaware and
published in Philadelphia in the dark days of 1776 December the 19th,
six days before the taking of the Hessians at Trenton."But the year 1806 had a heavier blow yet to inflict on Paine, and
it naturally came, though in a roundabout way, from his old enemy
Gouverneur Morris.While at New Rochelle, Paine offered his vote at the
election, and it was refused, on the ground that he was not an American
citizen!The supervisor declared that the former American Minister,
Gouverneur Morris, had refused to reclaim him from a French prison
because he was not an American, and that Washington had also refused to
reclaim him.Gouverneur Morris had just lost his seat in Congress,
and was politically defunct, but his ghost thus rose on poor Paine's
pathway.The supervisor who disfranchised the author of "Common Sense"
had been a "Tory" in the Revolution; the man he disfranchised was one to
whom the President of the United States had written, five years before:
"I am in hopes you will find us returned generally to sentiments
worthy of former times.In these it will be your glory to have steadily
labored, and with as much effect as any man living."There was not any
question of Paine's qualification as a voter on other grounds than the
supervisor (Elisha Ward) raised.More must presently be said concerning
this incident.Paine announced his intention of suing the inspectors,
but meanwhile he had to leave the polls in humiliation.It was the fate
of this founder of republics to be a monument of their ingratitude.And
now Paine's health began to fail.An intimation of this appears in a
letter to Andrew A. Dean, to whom his farm at New Rochelle was let,
dated from New York, August, 1806.It is in reply to a letter from Dean
on a manuscript which Paine had lent him.*

     * "I have read," says Dean,  "with good attention your
     manuscript on dreams, and Examination of the Prophecies in
     the Bible.I am now searching the old prophecies, and
     comparing the same to those said to be quoted in the New
     Testament.I confess the comparison is a matter worthy of
     our serious attention; I know not the result till I finish;
     then, if you be living, I shall communicate the same to
     you.Paine was now living with
     Jarvis, the artist.One evening he fell as if by apoplexy,
     and, as he lay, his first word was (to Jarvis): "My
     corporeal functions have ceased; my intellect is clear;
     this is a proof of immortality.""Respected Friend: I received your friendly letter, for which I am
obliged to you.It is three weeks ago to day (Sunday, Aug.15,) that I
was struck with a fit of an apoplexy, that deprived me of all sense
and motion.I had neither pulse nor breathing, and the people about me
supposed me dead.I had felt exceedingly well that day, and had just
taken a slice of bread and butter for supper, and was going to bed.The
fit took me on the stairs, as suddenly as if I had been shot through the
head; and I got so very much hurt by the fall, that I have not been able
to get in and out of bed since that day, otherwise than being lifted
out in a blanket, by two persons; yet all this while my mental faculties
have remained as perfect as I ever enjoyed them.I consider the scene I
have passed through as an experiment on dying, and I find death has
no terrors for me.As to the people called Christians, they have no
evidence that their religion is true.There is no more proof that the
Bible is the word of God, than that the Koran of Mahomet is the word of
God.Man, before he begins to
think for himself, is as much the child of habit in Creeds as he is in
ploughing and sowing.Yet creeds, like opinions, prove nothing.Where is
the evidence that the person called Jesus Christ is the begotten Son of
God?The case admits not of evidence either to our senses or our mental
faculties: neither has God given to man any talent by which such a thing
is comprehensible.It cannot therefore be an object for faith to
act upon, for faith is nothing more than an assent the mind gives to
something it sees cause to believe is fact.But priests, preachers, and
fanatics, put imagination in the place of faith, and it is the nature
of the imagination to believe without evidence.If Joseph the carpenter
dreamed (as the book of Matthew, chapter 1st, says he did,) that his
betrothed wife, Mary, was with child by the Holy Ghost, and that an
angel told him so, I am not obliged to put faith in his dream; nor do I
put any, for I put no faith in my own dreams, and I should be weak and
foolish indeed to put faith in the dreams of others.--The Christian
religion is derogatory to the Creator in all its articles.It puts the
Creator in an inferior point of view, and places the Christian Devil
above him.It is he, according to the absurd story in Genesis, that
outwits the Creator, in the garden of Eden, and steals from him his
favorite creature, man; and, at last, obliges him to beget a son, and
put that son to death, to get man back again.And this the priests of
the Christian religion, call redemption."Christian authors exclaim against the practice of offering human
sacrifices, which, they say, is done in some countries; and those
authors make those exclamations without ever reflecting that their own
doctrine of salvation is founded on a human sacrifice.They are saved,
they say, by the blood of Christ.The Christian religion begins with a
dream and ends with a murder."As I am well enough to sit up some hours in the day, though not well
enough to get up without help, I employ myself as I have always done,
in endeavoring to bring man to the right use of the reason that God has
given him, and to direct his mind immediately to his Creator, and not to
fanciful secondary beings called mediators, as if God was superannuated
or ferocious."As to the book called the Bible, it is blasphemy to call it the word of
God.It is a book of lies and contradictions, and a history of bad times
and bad men.There are but a few good characters in the whole book.The
fable of Christ and his twelve apostles, which is a parody on the sun
and the twelve signs of the Zodiac, copied from the ancient religions of
the eastern world, is the least hurtful part.Every thing told of Christ
has reference to the sun.His reported resurrection is at sunrise,
and that on the first day of the week; that is, on the day anciently
dedicated to the sun, and from thence called Sunday; in latin Dies
Solis, the day of the sun; as the next day, Monday, is Moon day.But
there is no room in a letter to explain these things.While man keeps
to the belief of one God, his reason unites with his creed.He is not
shocked with contradictions and horrid stories.His bible is the heavens
and the earth.He beholds his Creator in all his works, and every thing
he beholds inspires him with reverence and gratitude.From the goodness
of God to all, he learns his duty to his fellow-man, and stands
self-reproved when he transgresses it.But
when he multiplies his creed with imaginary things, of which he can have
neither evidence nor conception, such as the tale of the garden of
Eden, the talking serpent, the fall of man, the dreams of Joseph the
carpenter, the pretended resurrection and ascension, of which there is
even no historical relation, for no historian of those times mentions
such a thing, he gets into the pathless region of confusion, and turns
either frantic or hypocrite.He forces his mind, and pretends to
believe what he does not believe.This is in general the case with the
Methodists."I have now my friend given you a fac-simile of my mind on the subject
of religion and creeds, and my wish is, that you may make this letter as
publicly known as you find opportunities of doing.{1807}

The "Essay on Dream" was written early in 1806 and printed in May,
1807.It was the last work of importance written by Paine.In the same
pamphlet was included a part of his reply to the Bishop of Llandaff,
which was written in France: "An Examination of the Passages in the New
Testament, quoted from the Old, and called Prophecies of the Coming
of Jesus Christ" The Examination is widely known and is among Paine's
characteristic works,--a continuation of the "Age of Reason."The "Essay
on Dream" is a fine specimen of the author's literary art.Dream is the
imagination awake while the judgment is asleep."Every person is mad
once in twenty-four hours; for were he to act in the day as he dreams
in the night, he would be confined for a lunatic."Nathaniel Hawthorne
thought spiritualism "a sort of dreaming awake."Paine explained in the
same way some of the stories on which popular religion is founded.The
incarnation itself rests on what an angel told Joseph in a dream, and
others are referred to."This story of dreams has thrown Europe into
a dream for more than a thousand years.All the efforts that nature,
reason, and conscience have made to awaken man from it have been
ascribed by priestcraft and superstition to the workings of the devil,
and had it not been for the American revolution, which by establishing
the universal right of conscience, first opened the way to free
discussion, and for the French revolution which followed, this religion
of dreams had continued to be preached, and that after it had ceased to
be believed."But Paine was to be reminded that the revolution had not made conscience
free enough in America to challenge waking dreams without penalties.The
following account of his disfranchisement at New Rochelle, was written
from Broome St., New York, May 4, 1807, to Vice-President Clinton."Respected Friend,--Elisha Ward and three or four other Tories who
lived within the british lines in the revolutionary war, got in to
be inspectors of the election last year at New Rochelle.These men refused my vote at the election, saying to me:
'You are not an American; our minister at Paris, Gouverneur Morris,
would not reclaim you when you were emprisoned in the Luxembourg prison
at Paris, and General Washington refused to do it.'Upon my telling
him that the two cases he stated were falsehoods, and that if he did me
injustice I would prosecute him, he got up, and calling for a constable,
said to me, 'I will commit you to prison.'He chose, however, to sit
down and go no farther with it.Monro's
letter to the then Secretary of State Randolph, in which Mr.Monro gives
the government an account of his reclaiming me and my liberation in
consequence of it; and also for an attested copy of Mr.Randolph's
answer, in which he says: 'The President approves what you have done in
the case of Mr.The matter I believe is, that, as I had not
been guillotined, Washington thought best to say what he did.As
to Gouverneur Morris, the case is that he did reclaim me; but his
reclamation did me no good, and the probability is, he did not intend it
should.Joel Barlow and other Americans in Paris had been in a body to
reclaim me, but their application, being unofficial, was not regarded.I shall subpoena Morris, and if I get attested
copies from the Secretary of State's office it will prove the lie on the
inspectors."As it is a new generation that has risen up since the declaration
of independence, they know nothing of what the political state of
the country was at the time the pamphlet 'Common Sense' appeared; and
besides this there are but few of the old standers left, and none that I
know of in this city."It may be proper at the trial to bring the mind of the court and the
jury back to the times I am speaking of, and if you see no objection in
your way, I wish you would write a letter to some person, stating, from
your own knowledge, what the condition of those times were, and the
effect which the work 'Common Sense,' and the several members (numbers)
of the 'Crisis' had upon the country.It would, I think, be best that
the letter should begin directly on the subject in this manner: Being
informed that Thomas Paine has been denied his rights of citizenship by
certain persons acting as inspectors at an election at New Rochelle, &c."I have put the prosecution into the hands of Mr.Riker, district
attorney, who can make use of the letter in his address to the Court and
Jury.Your handwriting can be sworn to by persons here, if necessary.Had you been on the spot I should have subpoenaed you, unless it had
been too inconvenient to you to have attended.To this Clinton replied from Washington, 12th May, 1807:

"Dear Sir,--I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 4th
instant, yesterday; agreeably to your request I have this day written a
letter to Richard Riker, Esquire, which he will show you.I doubt much,
however, whether the Court will admit it to be read as evidence."I am indebted to you for a former letter.I can make no other apology
for not acknowledging it before than inability to give you such an
answer as I could wish.I constantly keep the subject in mind, and
should any favorable change take place in the sentiments of the
Legislature, I will apprize you of it."I am, with great esteem, your sincere friend."In the letter to Madison, Paine tells the same story.At the end he says
that Morris' reclamation was not out of any good will to him."I know
not what he wrote to the french minister; whatever it was he concealed
it from me."He also says Morris could hardly keep himself out of
prison.*

     * The letter is in Mr.Frederick McGuire's collection of
     Madison papers.A letter was also written to Joel Barlow, at Washington, dated Broome
Street, New York, May 4th.He says in this:

"I have prosecuted the Board of Inspectors for disfranchising me.You
and other Americans in Paris went in a body to the Convention to reclaim
me, and I want a certificate from you, properly attested, of this fact.Clinton he will in friendship inform you who to
address it to."Having now done with business I come to meums and tuums.You sometimes hear of me but I never hear of you.It seems as if
I had got to be master of the feds and the priests.The former do not
attack my political publications; they rather try to keep them out of
sight by silence.And as to the priests, they act as if they would say,
let us alone and we will let you alone.My Examination of the passages
called prophecies is printed, and will be published next week.I have
prepared it with the Essay on Dream.I do not believe that the priests
will attack it, for it is not a book of opinions but of facts.Had the
Christian Religion done any good in the world I would not have exposed
it, however fabulous I might believe it to be.But the delusive idea of
having a friend at court whom they call a redeemer, who pays all their
scores, is an encouragement to wickedness.Is he taming a whale to draw his submarine
boat?Smith to send me his country National
Intelligencer.I
am somewhat at a loss for want of authentic intelligence.It will be seen that Paine was still in ignorance of the conspiracy
which had thrown him in prison, nor did he suspect that Washington
had been deceived by Gouverneur Morris, and that his private letter to
Washington might have been given over to Pickering.*

     * In Chapter X. of this volume, as originally printed, there
     were certain passages erroneously suggesting that Pickering
     might have even intercepted this important letter of
     September 20, 1795.I had not then observed a reference to
     that letter by Madison, in writing to Monroe (April 7,
     1796), which proves that Paine's communication to Washington
     had been read by Pickering.Monroe was anxious lest some
     attack on the President should be written by Paine while
     under his roof,--an impropriety avoided by Paine as we have
     seen,--and had written to Madison on the subject.Madison
     answers: "I have given the explanation you desired to F. A.
     M[uhlenberg], who has not received any letter as yet, and
     has promised to pay due regard to your request.It is proper
     you should know that Thomas Paine wrote some time ago a
     severe letter to the President which Pickering mentioned to
     me in harsh terms when I delivered a note from Thomas Paine
     to the Secretary of State, inclosed by T. P. in a letter to
     me.Nothing passed, however, that betrayed the least
     association of your patronage or attention to Thomas Paine
     with the circumstance; nor am I apprehensive that any real
     suspicion can exist of your countenancing or even knowing
     the steps taken by T. P. under the influence of his personal
     feelings or political principles.At the same time the
     caution you observe is by no means to be disapproved.Be so
     good as to let T. P. know that I have received his letter
     and handed his note to the Secretary of State, which
     requested copies of such letters as might have been written
     hence in his behalf.The note did not require any answer
     either to me or through me, and I have heard nothing of it
     since I handed it to Pickering."At this time the Secretary
     of State's office contained the President's official
     recognition of Paine's citizenship; but this application
     for the papers relating to his imprisonment by a foreign
     power received no reply, though it was evidently couched in
     respectful terms; as the letter was open for the eye of
     Madison, who would not have conveyed it otherwise.It is
     incredible that Washington could have sanctioned such an
     outrage on one he had recognized as an American citizen,
     unless under pressure of misrepresentations.Possibly
     Paine's Quaker and republican direction of his letter to
     "George Washington, President of the United States," was
     interpreted by his federalist ministers as an insult.It will be seen, by Madame Bonneville's and Jarvis' statements
elsewhere, that Paine lost his case against Elisha Ward, on what ground
it is difficult to imagine.The records of the Supreme Court, at Albany,
and the Clerk's office at White Plains, have been vainly searched for
any trace of this trial.John H. Riker, son of Paine's counsel, has
examined the remaining papers of Richard Riker (many were accidentally
destroyed) without finding anything related to the matter.It is so
terrible to think that with Jefferson, Clinton, and Madison at the head
of the government, and the facts so clear, the federalist Elisha Ward
could vindicate his insult to Thomas Paine, that it may be hoped the
publication of these facts will bring others to light that may put a
better face on the matter.*

     * Gilbert Vale relates an anecdote which suggests that a
     reaction may have occurred in Elisha Ward's family: "At the
     time of Mr.Paine's residence at his farm, Mr.Ward, now a
     coffee-roaster in Gold Street, New York, and an assistant
     alderman, was then a little boy and residing at New
     Rochelle.He remembers the impressions his mother and some
     religious people made on him by speaking of Tom Paine, so
     that he concluded that Tom Paine must be a very bad and
     brutal man.Some of his elder companions proposed going into
     Mr.Paine's orchard to obtain some fruit, and he, out of
     fear, kept at a distance behind, till he beheld, with
     surprise, Mr.Paine come out and assist the boys in getting
     apples, patting one on the head and caressing another, and
     directing them where to get the best.He then advanced and
     received his share of encouragement, and the impression this
     kindness made on him determined him at a very early period
     to examine his writings.His mother at first took the books
     from him, but at a later period restored them to him,
     observing that he was then of an age to judge for himself;
     perhaps she had herself been gradually undeceived, both as
     to his character and writings."Madame Bonneville may have misunderstood the procedure for which she
had to pay costs, as Paine's legatee.Whether an ultimate decision was
reached or not, the sufficiently shameful fact remains that Thomas Paine
was practically disfranchised in the country to which he had rendered
services pronounced pre-eminent by Congress, by Washington, and by every
soldier and statesman of the Revolution.Paine had in New York the most formidable of enemies,--an enemy with a
newspaper.This was James Cheetham, of whom something has been said in
the preface to this work (p.In addition to what is there stated,
it may be mentioned that Paine had observed, soon after he came to New
York, the shifty course of this man's paper, _The American Citizen_.But it was the only republican paper in New York, supported Governor
Clinton, for which it had reason, since it had the State printing,--and
Colonel Fellows advised that Cheetham should not be attacked.Cheetham
had been an attendant on Elihu Palmer's lectures, and after his
participation in the dinner to Paine, his federalist opponent, the
_Evening Post_, alluded to his being at Palmer's.Thereupon Cheetham
declared that he had not heard Palmer for two years.In the winter
of 1804 he casually spoke of Paine's "mischievous doctrines."In the
following year, when Paine wrote the defence of Jefferson's personal
character already alluded to, Cheetham omitted a reference in it
to Alexander Hamilton's pamphlet, by which he escaped accusation of
official defalcation by confessing an amorous intrigue.*

     *  "I see that Cheetham has left out the part respecting
     Hamilton and Mrs.Reynolds, but for my own part I wish it
     had been in.Had the story never been publicly told I
     would not have been the first to tell it; but Hamilton had
     told it himself, and therefore it was no secret; but my
     motive in introducing it was because it was applicable to
     the subject I was upon, and to show the revilers of Mr.Jefferson that while they are affecting a morality of horror
     at an unproved and unfounded story about Mr.Jefferson, they
     had better look at home and give vent to their horror, if
     they had any, at a real case of their own Dagon (sic) and
     his Delilah."--Paine to Colonel Fellows, July 31, 1805.Cheetham having been wont to write of Hamilton as "the gallant of Mrs.Reynolds," Paine did not give much credit to the pretext of respect for
the dead, on which the suppression was justified.He was prepared to
admit that his allusion might be fairly suppressed, but perceived that
the omission was made merely to give Cheetham a chance for vaunting his
superior delicacy, and casting a suspicion on Paine."Cheetham," wrote
Paine, "might as well have put the part in, as put in the reasons for
which he left it out.Those reasons leave people to suspect that the
part suppressed related to some new discovered immorality in Hamilton
worse than the old story."About the same time with Paine, an Irishman came to America, and, after
travelling about the country a good deal, established a paper in New
York called _The People's Friend_.This paper began a furious onslaught
on the French, professed to have advices that Napoleon meant to retake
New Orleans, and urged an offensive alliance of the United States with
England against France and Spain.These articles appeared in the early
autumn of 1806, when, as we have seen, Paine was especially beset by
personal worries.His denunciations, merited as
they were, of this assailant of France reveal the unstrung condition of
the old author's nerves.Duane, of the Philadelphia _Aurora_, recognized
in Carpenter a man he had seen in Calcutta, where he bore the name of
Cullen.It was then found that he had on his arrival in America borne
the _alias_ of Mac-cullen.Paine declared that he was an "emissary"
sent to this country by Windham, and indeed most persons were at length
satisfied that such was the case.Paine insisted that loyalty to our
French alliance demanded Cullen's expulsion.His exposures of "the
emissary Cullen" (who disappeared) were printed in a new republican
paper in New York, _The Public Advertiser_, edited by Mr.The
combat drew public attention to the new paper, and Cheetham was probably
enraged by Paines transfer of his pen to Frank.In 1807, Paine had a
large following in New York, his friends being none the less influential
among the masses because not in the fashionable world Moreover, the
very popular Mayor of New York, De Witt Clinton, was a hearty admirer
of Paine.So Cheetham's paper suffered sadly, and he opened his guns
on Paine, declaring that in the Revolution he (Paine) "had stuck very
correctly to his pen in a safe retreat," that his "Rights of Man" merely
repeated Locke, and so forth.He also began to denounce France and
applaud England, which led to the belief that, having lost republican
patronage, Cheetham was aiming to get that of England.In a "Reply to Cheetham" (August 21st), Paine met personalities in kind.Cheetham, in his rage for attacking everybody and everything that
is not his own (for he is an ugly-tempered man, and he carries
the evidence of it in the vulgarity and forbiddingness of his
countenance--God has set a mark upon Cain), has attacked me, etc."In
reply to further attacks, Paine printed a piece headed "Cheetham and his
Tory Paper."He said that Cheetham was discovering symptoms of being
the successor of Cullen, _alias_ Carpenter."Like him he is seeking to
involve the United States in a quarrel with France for the benefit of
England."This article caused a duel between the rival editors, Cheetham
and Frank, which seems to have been harmless.Paine wrote a letter
to the _Evening Post_, saying that he had entreated Frank to answer
Cheetham's challenge by declaring that he (Paine) had written the
article and was the man to be called to account.In company Paine
mentioned an opinion expressed by the President in a letter just
received.This got into the papers, and Cheetham declared that the
President could not have so written, and that Paine was intoxicated
when he said so.For this Paine instituted a suit against Cheetham for
slander, but died before any trial.Paine had prevailed with his pen, but a terrible revenge was plotted
against his good name.The farrier William Carver, in whose house he
had lived, turned Judas, and concocted with Cheetham the libels against
Paine that have passed as history.PERSONAL TRAITS

On July 1, 1806, two young English gentlemen, Daniel and William
Constable, arrived in New York, and for some years travelled about the
country.The Diary kept by Daniel Constable has been shown me by his
nephew, Clair J. Grece, LL.D.It contains interesting allusions to
Paine, to whom they brought an introduction from Rickman.To the Globe, in Maiden Lane, to dine.Segar at the Globe
offered to send for Mr.Paine, who lived only a few doors off: He seemed
a true Painite.William and I went to see Thomas Paine.When we first called he was
taking a nap.... Back to Mr.Paine's about 5 o'clock, sat about an
hour with him.... I meant to have had T. Paine in a carriage with me
to-morrow, and went to inquire for one.The price was $1 per hour, but
when I proposed it to T. P. he declined it on account of his health.We
were up by five o'clock, and on the battery saw the cannons fired, in
commemoration of liberty, which had been employed by the English against
the sacred cause.The people seemed to enter into the spirit of the day:
stores &c were generally shut.... In the fore part of the day I had the
honour of walking with T. Paine along the Broadway.The day finished
peaceably, and we saw no scenes of quarreling or drunkenness.Evening, met T. Paine in the Broadway and walked
with him to his house.Called to see T. Paine, who was
walking about Carver's shop."Changed snuff-boxes with T. Paine at his lodgings.* The old
philosopher, in bed at 4 o'clock afternoon, seems as talkative and well
as when we saw him in the summer."Grece showed me Paine's papier-mache snuff-box, which
     his uncle had fitted with silver plate, inscription,
     decorative eagle, and banner of "Liberty, Equality."It is
     kept in a jewel-box with an engraving of Paine on the lid.In a letter written jointly by the brothers to their parents, dated July
5th, they say that Paine "begins to feel the effects of age.The print
I left at Horley is a very strong likeness.He lives with a small family
who came from Lewes [Carvers] quite retired, and but little known or
noticed."They here also speak of "the honour of walking with our old
friend T. Paine in the midst of the bustle on Independence Day."There
is no suggestion, either here or in the Diary, that these gentlemen of
culture and position observed anything in the appearance or habits of
Paine that diminished the pleasure of meeting him.In November they
travelled down the Mississippi, and on their return to New York, nine
months later, they heard (July 20, 1807) foul charges against Paine
from Carver."Paine has left his house, and they have had a violent
disagreement.Carver charges Paine with many foul vices, as debauchery,
lying, ingratitude, and a total want of common honour in all his
actions, says that he drinks regularly a quart of brandy per day."But
next day they call on Paine, in "the Bowery road," and William Constable
writes:

"He looks better than last year.He read us an essay on national
defence, comparing the different expenses and powers of gunboats and
ships of war and, batteries in protecting a sea coast; and gave D. C.[Daniel Constable] a copy of his Examination of the texts of scriptures
called prophecies, etc.He says
that this work is of too high a cut for the priests and that they will
not touch it."These brothers Constable met Fulton, a friend of Paine's just then
experimenting with his steam-boat on the Hudson.They also found that a
scandal had been caused by a report brought to the British Consul that
thirty passengers on the ship by which they (the Constables) came, had
"the Bible bound up with the 'Age of Reason,' and that they spoke in
very disrespectful terms of the mother country."Paine had left his
farm at New Rochelle, at which place the travellers heard stories of
his slovenliness, also that he was penurious, though nothing was said of
intemperance.Inquiry among aged residents of New Rochelle has been made from time to
time for a great many years.J. B. Stallo, late U. S. Minister
to Italy, told me that in early life he visited the place and saw
persons who had known Paine, and declared that Paine resided there
without fault.Staple, brother of the
influential Captain Pelton, and the adoption of Paine's religious views
by some of these persons caused the odium.* Paine sometimes preached at
New Rochelle.Burger, Pelton's clerk, used to drive Paine about
     daily.Vale says:

     "He [Burger] describes Mr.Paine as really abstemious, and
     when pressed to drink by those on whom he called during his
     rides, he usually refused with great firmness, but politely.In one of these rides he was met by De Witt Clinton, and
     their mutual greetings were extremely hearty.Paine
     at this time was the reverse of morose, and though careless
     of his dress and prodigal of his snuff, he was always clean
     and well clothed.Burger describes him as familiar with
     children and humane to animals, playing with the neighboring
     children, and communicating a friendly pat even to a passing
     dog."Our frontispiece shows Paine's dress in 1803.Cheetham publishes a correspondence purporting to have passed between
Paine and Carver, in November, 1806, in which the former repudiates
the latter's bill for board (though paying it), saying he was badly
and dishonestly treated in Carver's house, and had taken him out of his
Will.To this a reply is printed, signed by Carver, which he certainly
never wrote; specimens of his composition, now before me, prove him
hardly able to spell a word correctly or to frame a sentence.*

     * In the Concord (Mass.)Public Library there is a copy of
     Cheetham's book, which belonged to Carver, by whom it was
     filled with notes.He says: "Cheetham was a hypocrate turned
     Tory," "Paine was not Drunk when he wrote the thre pedlars
     for me, I sold them to a gentleman, a Jew for a dollar--
     Cheetham knew that he told a lie saying Paine was drunk--any
     person reading Cheetham's life of Paine that [sic] his pen
     was guided by prejudice that was brought on by Cheetham's
     altering a peice that Paine had writen as an answer to a
     peice that had apeared in his paper, I had careyd the peice
     to Cheetham, the next Day the answer was printed with the
     alteration, Paine was angry, sent me to call Cheetham I then
     asked how he undertook to mutilate the peice, if aney thing
     was rong he knew ware to find him & sad he never permitted a
     printer to alter what he had wrote, that the sence of the
     peice was spoiled--by this means their freind ship was
     broken up through life------"   (The marginalia in this
     volume have been copied for me with exactness by Miss E. G.
     Crowell, of Concord.)The letter in Cheetham shows a practised hand, and was evidently written
for Carver by the "biographer."This ungenuineness of Carver's
letter, and expressions not characteristic in that of Paine render the
correspondence mythical.Although Carver passed many penitential years
hanging about Paine celebrations, deploring the wrong he had done Paine,
he could not squarely repudiate the correspondence, to which Cheetham
had compelled him to swear in court.He used to declare that Cheetham
had obtained under false pretences and printed without authority letters
written in anger.But thrice in his letter to Paine Carver says he means
to publish it.Its closing words are: "There may be many grammatical
errours in this letter.To you I have no apologies to make; but I hope a
candid and impartial public will not view them 'with a critick's eye.'"This is artful; besides the fling at Paine's faulty grammar, which
Carver could not discover, there is a pretence to faults in his own
letter which do not exist, but certainly would have existed had he
written it The style throughout is transparently Cheethan's.* "A Bone to Gnaw for Grant Thorburn."By W. Carver
     (1836).In the book at Concord the unassisted Carver writes: "The libel for
wich [sic] he [Cheetham] was sued was contained in the letter I wrote to
Paine."This was the libel on Madame Bonneville, Carver's antipathy
to whom arose from his hopes of Paine's property.In reply to Paine's
information, that he was excluded from his Will, Carver says: "I
likewise have to inform you, that I totally disregard the power of your
mind and pen; for should you, by your conduct, permit this letter to
appear in public, in vain may you attempt to print or publish any thing
afterwards."Carver's letter
is dated December 2, 1806.It was not published during Paine's life,
for the farrier hoped to get back into the Will by frightening Madame
Bonneville and other friends of Paine with the stories he meant to tell.About a year before Paine's death he made another blackmailing attempt.He raked up the scandalous stories published by "Oldys" concerning
Paine's domestic troubles in Lewes, pretending that he knew the facts
personally.Carver has offered me an affidavit,"
says Cheetham."He stated them all to Paine in a private letter which he
wrote to him a year before his death; to which no answer was returned.Carver showed me the letter soon after it was written."On this
plain evidence of long conspiracy with Cheetham, and attempt to
blackmail Paine when he was sinking in mortal illness, Carver never
made any comment.When Paine was known to be near his end Carver made
an effort at conciliation."I think it a pity," he wrote, "that you
or myself should depart this life with envy in our hearts against each
other--and I firmly believe that no difference would have taken place
between us, had not some of your pretended friends endeavored to have
caused a separation of friendship between us."But abjectness was not
more effectual than blackmail.The property went to the Bonnevilles,
and Carver, who had flattered Paine's "great mind," in the letter
just quoted, proceeded to write a mean one about the dead author for
Cheetham's projected biography.He did not, however, expect Cheetham to
publish his slanderous letter about Paine and Madame Bonneville, which
he meant merely for extortion; nor could Cheetham have got the letter
had he not written it.All of Cheetham's libels on Paine's life in New
York are amplifications of Carver's insinuations.In describing Cheetham
as "an abominable liar," Carver passes sentence on himself.On this
blackmailer, this confessed libeller, rest originally and fundamentally
the charges relating to Paine's last years.It has already been stated that Paine boarded for a time in the Bayeaux
mansion.In 1891 I
visited, at New Rochelle, Mr.Albert Badeau, son of the lady last named,
finding him, as I hope he still is, in good health and memory.Seated
in the arm-chair given him by his mother, as that in which Paine used
to sit by their fireside, I took down for publication some words of
his."My mother would never tolerate the aspersions on Mr.She declared steadfastly to the end of her life that he was a
perfect gentleman, and a most faithful friend, amiable, gentle,
never intemperate in eating or drinking.My mother declared that my
grandmother equally pronounced the disparaging reports about Mr.I never remember to have seen my mother angry except when she
heard such calumnies of Mr.Paine, when she would almost insult those
who uttered them.My mother and grandmother were very religious, members
of the Episcopal Church."Albert Badeau's religious opinions
are I do not know, but no one acquainted with that venerable gentleman
could for an instant doubt his exactness and truthfulness.It
certainly was not until some years after his return to America that any
slovenliness could be observed about Paine, and the contrary was often
remarked in former times.* After he had come to New York, and was
neglected by the pious ladies and gentlemen with whom he had once
associated, he neglected his personal appearance."Let those dress who
need it," he said to a friend.* "He dined at my table," said Aaron Burr."I always
     considered Mr.Paine a gentleman, a pleasant companion, and
     a good-natured and intelligent man; decidedly temperate,
     with a proper regard for his personal appearance, whenever I
     have seen him."says Joel Barlow, "he was generally very
     cleanly, though careless, and wore his hair queued with side
     curls, and powdered, like a gentleman of the old French
     School.His manners were easy and gracious, his knowledge
     universal."Paine was prodigal of snuff, but used tobacco in no other form.He had
aversion to profanity, and never told or listened to indecent anecdotes.With regard to the charges of excessive drinking made against Paine, I
have sifted a vast mass of contrarious testimonies, and arrived at the
following conclusions.In earlier life Paine drank spirits, as was the
custom in England and America; and he unfortunately selected brandy,
which causes alcoholic indigestion, and may have partly produced the
oft-quoted witness against him--his somewhat red nose.His nose was
prominent, and began to be red when he was fifty-five.That was just
after he had been dining a good deal with rich people in England, and
at public dinners.During his early life in England (1737--1774) no
instance of excess was known, and Paine expressly pointed the Excise
Office to his record."No complaint of the least dishonesty or
intemperance has ever appeared against me."His career in America
(1774-1787) was free from any suspicion of intemperance.John Hall's
daily diary while working with Paine for months is minute, mentioning
everything, but in no case is a word said of Paine's drinking.Paine's enemy, Chalmers ("Oldys"), raked up in 1791 every
charge he could against Paine, but intemperance is not included.Paine
told Rickman that in Paris, when borne down by public and private
affliction, he had been driven to excess.That period I have identified
on a former page (ii., p.59) as a few weeks in 1793, when his dearest
friends were on their way to the guillotine, whither he daily expected
to follow them.After that Paine abstained altogether from spirits, and
drank wine in moderation.Lovett, who kept the City Hotel, New York,
where Paine stopped in 1803 and 1804 for some weeks, wrote a note to
Caleb Bingham, of Boston, in which he says that Paine drank less
than any of his boarders.Gilbert Vale, in preparing his biography,
questioned D. Burger, the clerk of Pelton's store at New Rochelle, and
found that Paine's liquor supply while there was one quart of rum per
week.He also questioned Jarvis, the
artist, in whose house Paine resided in New York (Church Street) five
months, who declared that what Cheetham had reported about Paine and
himself was entirely false.Paine, he said, "did not and could not drink
much."In July, 1809, just after Paine's death, Cheetham wrote
Barlow for information concerning Paine, "useful in illustrating his
character," and said: "He was a great drunkard here, and Mr.M., a
merchant of this city, who lived with him when he was arrested by order
of Robespierre, tells me he was intoxicated when that event happened."Barlow, recently returned from Europe, was living just out of
Washington; he could know nothing of Cheetham's treachery, and fell into
his trap; he refuted the story of "Mr.M.," of course, but took it for
granted that a supposed republican editor would tell the truth about
Paine in New York, and wrote of the dead author as having "a mind,
though strong enough to bear him up and to rise elastic under the
heaviest hand of oppression, yet unable to endure the contempt of his
former friends and fellow-laborers, the rulers of the country that had
received his first and greatest services; a mind incapable of looking
down with serene compassion, as it ought, on the rude scoffs of their
imitators, a new generation that knows him not; a mind that shrinks from
their society, and unhappily seeks refuge in low company, or looks for
consolation in the sordid, solitary bottle, etc."!Barlow, misled as he
was, well knew Paine's nature, and that if he drank to excess it was not
from appetite, but because of ingratitude and wrong.The man was not a
stock or a stone.If any can find satisfaction in the belief that Paine
found no Christian in America so merciful as rum, they may perhaps
discover some grounds for it in a brief period of his sixty-ninth year.While living in the house of Carver, Paine was seized with an illness
that threatened to be mortal, and from which he never fully recovered.It is probable that he was kept alive for a time by spirits during the
terrible time, but this ceased when in the latter part of 1806 he left
Carver's to live with Jarvis.In the spring of 1808 he resided in the
house of Mr.Hitt, a baker, in Broome Street, and there remained
ten months.Hitt reports that Paine's weekly supply then--his
seventy-second year, and his last--was three quarts of rum per week.* Todd's "Joel Barlow," p.was one
     Murray, an English speculator in France, where he never
     resided with Paine at all.After Paine had left Carver's he became acquainted with more people.The late Judge Tabor's recollections have been sent me by his son, Mr."I was an associate editor of the _New York Beacon_ with Col.John
Fellows, then (1836) advanced in years, but retaining all the vigor and
fire of his manhood.He was a ripe scholar, a most agreeable companion,
and had been the correspondent and friend of Jefferson, Madison, Monroe
and John Quincy Adams, under all of whom he held a responsible office.One of his productions was dedicated, by permission, to [J.Adams,
and was republished and favorably received in England.Fellows
was the soul of honor and inflexible in his adherence to truth.He was
intimate with Paine during the whole time he lived after returning to
this country, and boarded for a year in the same house with him."I also was acquainted with Judge Hertell, of New York City, a man of
wealth and position, being a member of the New York Legislature, both
in the Senate and Assembly, and serving likewise on the judicial bench.Fellows, he was an author, and a man of unblemished life and
irreproachable character."These men assured me of their own knowledge derived from constant
personal intercourse during the last seven years of Paine's life, that
he never kept any company but what was entirely respectable, and that
all accusations of drunkenness were grossly untrue.They saw him under
all circumstances and _knew_ that he was never intoxicated.Nay, more,
they said, for that day, he was even abstemious.That was a drinking age
and Paine, like Jefferson, could 'bear but little spirit,' so that he
was constitutionally temperate."Cheetham refers to William Carver and the portrait painter Jarvis.I
visited Carver, in company with Col.Fellows, and naturally conversed
with the old man about Paine.He said that the allegation that Paine was
a drunkard was altogether without foundation.In speaking of his letter
to Paine which Cheetham published, Carver said that he was angry when
he wrote it and that he wrote unwisely, as angry men generally do;
that Cheetham obtained the letter under false pretenses and printed it
without authority.Fellows and Judge Hertell visited Paine throughout the whole
course of his last illness.They repeatedly conversed with him
on religious topics and they declared that he died serenely,
philosophically and resignedly.This information I had directly from
their own lips, and their characters were so spotless, and their
integrity so unquestioned, that more reliable testimony it would be
impossible to give."During Paine's life the world heard no hint of sexual immorality
connected with him, but after his death Cheetham published the
following: "Paine brought with him from Paris, and from her husband in
whose house he had lived, Margaret Brazier Bonneville, and her three
sons._Thomas_ has the features, countenance, and temper of Paine,"
Madame Bonneville promptly sued Cheetham for slander.Cheetham had
betrayed his "pal," Carver, by printing the letter concocted to
blackmail Paine, for whose composition the farrier no doubt supposed
he had paid the editor with stories borrowed from "Oldys," or not
actionable.Cheetham probably recognized, when he saw Madame Bonneville
in court, that he too had been deceived, and that any illicit relation
between the accused lady and Paine, thirty years her senior, was
preposterous.Cheetham's lawyer (Griffin) insinuated terrible things
that his witnesses were to prove, but they all dissolved into Carver.Ryder, with whom Paine had boarded, admitted trying to make Paine
smile by saying Thomas was like him, but vehemently repudiated the
slander.She never saw but
decency with Mrs.She never staid there but one night, when
Paine was very sick."Dean was summoned to support one of Carver's
lies that Madame Bonneville tried to cheat Paine, but denied the whole
story (which has unfortunately been credited by Vale and other writers).Foster, who had a claim against Paine's estate for tuition
of the Bonnevilles, was summoned.Bonneville," he testified,
"might possibly have said as much as that but for Paine she would not
have come here, and that he was under special obligations to provide for
her children."A Westchester witness, Peter Underbill, testified that
"he one day told Mrs.Bonneville that her child resembled Paine,
and Mrs.Bonneville said it was Paine's child."But, apart from the
intrinsic incredibility of this statement (unless she meant "god-son"),
Underbill's character broke down under the testimony of his neighbors,
Judge Sommerville and Captain Pelton.Cheetham had thus no dependence
but Carver, who actually tried to support his slanders from the dead
lips of Paine!But in doing so he ruined Cheetham's case by saying that
Paine told him Madame Bonneville was never the wife of M. Bonneville;
the charge being that she was seduced from her husband.It was extorted
from Carver that Madame Bonneville, having seen his scurrilous letter to
Paine, threatened to prosecute him; also that he had taken his wife to
visit Madame Bonneville.Then it became plain to Carver that Cheetham's
case was lost, and he deserted it on the witness-stand; declaring that
"he had never seen the slightest indication of any meretricious or
illicit commerce between Paine and Mrs.Bonneville, that they never were
alone together, and that all the three children were alike the objects
of Paine's care."Counsellor Sampson (no friend to Paine) perceived that
Paine's Will was at the bottom of the business."That is the key to this
mysterious league of apostolic slanderers, mortified expectants and
disappointed speculators."Sampson's invective was terrific; Cheetham
rose and claimed protection of the court, hinting at a duel.Sampson
took a pinch of snuff, and pointing his finger at the defendant, said:

"If he complains of personalities, he who is hardened in every gross
abuse, he who lives reviling and reviled, who might construct himself
a monument with no other materials but those records to which he is a
party, and in which he stands enrolled as an offender*: if he cannot sit
still to hear his accusation, but calls for the protection of the court
against a counsel whose duty it is to make his crimes appear, how does
she deserve protection, whom he has driven to the sad necessity of
coming here to vindicate her honor, from those personalities he has
lavished on her?"* Cheetham was at the moment a defendant in  nine or ten
     cases for libel.The editor of Counsellor Sampson's speech says that the jury "although
composed of men of different political sentiments, returned in a few
minutes a verdict of guilty."It is added:

"The court, however, when the libeller came up the next day to receive
his sentence, highly commended the book which contained the libellous
publication, declared that it tended to serve the cause of religion, and
imposed no other punishment on the libeller than the payment of $150,
with a direction that the costs be taken out of it.It is fit to remark,
lest foreigners who are unacquainted with our political condition should
receive erroneous impressions, that Mr.Recorder Hoffman does not belong
to the Republican party in America, but has been elevated to office
by men in hostility to it, who obtained a temporary ascendency in the
councils of state."*

     the Trial of James Cheetham, Esq., for a libel on Margaret
     Brazier Bonneville, in his Memoirs of Thomas Paine.Philadelphia: Printed by John Sweeny, No-357 Arch Street,
     1810."I am indebted for the use of this rare pamphlet and
     for other information, to the industrious collector of
     causes celebres, Mr.E. B. Wynn, of Watertown, N. Y.

Madame Bonneville had in court eminent witnesses to her
character,--Thomas Addis Emmet, Fulton, Jarvis, and ladies whose
children she had taught French.Yet the scandal was too tempting an
illustration of the "Age of Reason" to disappear with Cheetham's defeat.Americans in their peaceful habitations were easily made suspicious of a
French woman who had left her husband in Paris and followed Paine; they
could little realize the complications into which ten tempestuous years
had thrown thousands of families in France, and how such poor radicals
as the Bonnevilles had to live as they could.The scandal branched into
variants.Twenty-five years later pious Grant Thorburn promulgated that
Paine had run off from Paris with the wife of a tailor named Palmer."Paine made no scruples of living with this woman openly."Elihu
Palmer, in her penury, was employed by Paine to attend to his rooms,
etc, during a few months of illness.)As to Madame Bonneville, whose
name Grant Thorburn seems not to have heard, she was turned into a
romantic figure.Thorburn says that Paine escaped the guillotine by the
execution of another man in his place."The man who suffered death for Paine, left a widow, with two young
children in poor circumstances.Paine brought them all to this country,
supported them while he lived, and, it is said, left most of his
property to them when he died.The widow and children lived in
apartments up town by themselves.I believe
his conduct was disinterested and honorable to the widow.She appeared
to be about thirty years of age, and was far from being handsome."*

     * "Forty Years' Residence in America."Grant Thorburn was afterwards led to doubt whether this woman was
the widow of the man guillotined, but declares that when "Paine first
brought her out, he and his friends passed her off as such."As a myth
of the time (1834), and an indication that Paine's generosity to
the Bonneville family was well known in New York, the story is worth
quoting.But the Bonnevilles never escaped from the scandal.Long years
afterward, when the late Gen.Louis, it
was whispered about that he was the natural son of Thomas Paine, though
he was born before Paine ever met Madame Bonneville.Of course it
has gone into the religious encyclopaedias.The best of them, that of
McClintock and Strong, says: "One of the women he supported [in France]
followed him to this country."After the fall of Napoleon, Nicholas
Bonneville, relieved of his surveillance, hastened to New York, where
he and his family were reunited, and enjoyed the happiness provided by
Paine's self-sacrificing economy.The present writer, having perused some thou-sands of documents
concerning Paine, is convinced that no charge of sensuality could have
been brought against him by any one acquainted with the facts, except
out of malice.Had Paine held, or practised, any latitudinarian theory
of sexual liberty, it would be recorded here, and his reasons for
the same given.And as to his sacrificing the happiness of
a home to his own pleasure, nothing could be more inconceivable.Above all, Paine was a profoundly religious man,--one of the few in our
revolutionary era of whom it can be said that his delight was in the law
of his Lord, and in that law did he meditate day and night Consequently,
he could not escape the immemorial fate of the great believers, to be
persecuted for unbelief--by unbelievers.DEATH AND RESURRECTION

The blow that Paine received by the refusal of his vote at New Rochelle
was heavy.Elisha Ward, a Tory in the Revolution, had dexterously
gained power enough to give his old patrons a good revenge on the first
advocate of independence.The blow came at a time when his means were
low, and Paine resolved to apply to Congress for payment of an old debt.The response would at once relieve him, and overwhelm those who were
insulting him in New York.This led to a further humiliation, and one or
two letters to Congress, of which Paine's enemies did not fail to make
the most.* Paine had always felt that Congress was in his debt for
     his voyage to France for supplies with Col.20, 1782) to Robert Morris, Paine
     mentions that when Col.Laurens proposed that he should
     accompany him, as secretary, he was on the point of
     establishing a newspaper.He had purchased twenty reams of
     paper, and Mr.Eustatia for seventy
     more.This scheme, which could hardly fail of success, was
     relinquished for the voyage.It was undertaken at the urgent
     solicitation of Laurens, and Paine certainly regarded it as
     official.He had ninety dollars when he started, in bills of
     exchange; when Col.Laurens left him, after their return,
     he had but two louis d'or.The Memorial sent by Paine to
     Congress (Jan.21, 1808) recapitulated facts known to my
     reader.George Clinton, Jr.,
     February 4, and referred to the Committee of Claims.On
     February 14th Paine wroth a statement concerning the $3,000
     given him (1785) by Congress, which he maintained was an
     indemnity for injustice done him in the Deane case.The Committee consulted the
     President, whose reply I know not.Vice-President Clinton
     wrote (Mardi 23, 1808) that  from the information I received
     at the time I have reason to believe that Mr.Paine
     accompanied Col.Laurens on his mission to France in the
     course of our revolutionary war, for the purpose of
     negotiating a loan, and that he acted as his secretary on
     that occasion; but although I have no doubt of the truth of
     this fact, I cannot assert it from my own actual knowledge."There was nothing found on the journals of Congress to show
     Paine's connection with the mission.The old author was
     completely upset by his longing to hear the fate of his
     memorial, and he Wrote two complaints of the delay, showing
     that his nerves were shattered.he says, March 7th,
     "my memorial was referred to the Committee of Claims for the
     purpose of losing it, it is unmanly policy.After so many
     years of service my heart grows cold towards America."The letters are those of a broken-hearted man, and it seems marvellous
that Jefferson, Madison, and the Clintons did not intervene and see that
some recognition of Paine's former services, by those who should not
have forgotten them, was made without the ill-judged memorial.While
they were enjoying their grandeur the man who, as Jefferson wrote,
"steadily laboured, and with as much effect as any man living," to
secure America freedom, was living--or rather dying--in a miserable
lodging-house, 63 Partition Street.He had gone there for economy; for
he was exhibiting that morbid apprehension about his means which is
a well-known symptom of decline in those who have suffered poverty in
early life.Washington, with 40,000 acres, wrote in his last year as if
facing ruin.Paine had only a little farm at New Rochelle.He had for
some time suffered from want of income, and at last had to sell the farm
he meant for the Bonnevilles for $10,000; but the purchaser died, and at
his widow's appeal the contract was cancelled.It was at this time that
he appealed to Congress.It appears, however, that Paine was not anxious
for himself, but for the family of Madame Bonneville, whose statement on
this point is important.The last letter that I can find of Paine's was: written to Jefferson,
July 8, 1808:

"The british Ministry have out-schemed themselves.It is not difficult
to see what the motive and object of that Ministry: were in issuing
the orders of Council.They expected those orders would force all the
commerce of the United States to England, and then, by giving permission
to such cargoes as they did not want for themselves to depart for the
Continent of Europe, to raise a revenue out of those countries and
America.'But instead of this they have lost revenue; that is, they
have-lost the revenue they used to receive from American imports, and
instead of gaining all the commerce they have lost it all."This being the case with the british Ministry it is natural to suppose
they would be glad to tread back their steps, if they could do it
without too much exposing their ignorance and obstinacy.The Embargo
law empowers the President to suspend its operation whenever he shall be
satisfied that our ships can pass in safety.It therefore includes the
idea of empowering him to use means for arriving at that event.Suppose
the President were to authorise Mr.Pinckney to propose to the british
Ministry that the United States would negociate with France for
rescinding the Milan Decree, on condition the English Ministry would
rescind their orders of Council; and in that case the United States
would recall their Embargo.France and England stand now at such a
distance that neither can propose any thing to the other, neither are
there any neutral powers to act as mediators.The U. S. is the only
power that can act."Perhaps the british Ministry if they listen to the proposal will want
to add to it the Berlin decree, which excludes english commerce from the
continent of Europe; but this we have nothing to do with, neither has it
any thing to do with the Embargo.The british Orders of Council and the
Milan decree are parallel cases, and the cause of the Embargo.Paines last letters to the President are characteristic.One pleads for
American intervention to stay the hand of French oppression among the
<DW64>s in St.Domingo; for the colonization of Louisiana with free
<DW64> laborers; and his very last letter is an appeal for mediation
between France and England for the sake of peace.Nothing came of these pleadings of Paine; but perhaps on his last stroll
along the Hudson, with his friend Fulton, to watch the little steamer,
he may have recognized the real mediator beginning its labors for the
federation of the world.Early in July, 1808, Paine removed to a comfortable abode, that of Mrs.Ryder, near which Madame Bonneville and her two sons resided.The house
was on Herring Street (afterwards 293 Bleecker), and not far, he might
be pleased to find, from "Reason Street."Here he made one more attempt
to wield his pen,--the result being a brief letter "To the Federal
Faction," which he warns that they are endangering American commerce by
abusing France and Bonaparte, provoking them to establish a navigation
act that will exclude American ships from Europe."The United States
have flourished, unrivalled in commerce, fifteen or sixteen years.But
it is not a permanent state of things.It arose from the circumstances
of the war, and most probably will change at the close of the present
war.The Federalists give provocation enough to promote it."Apparently this is the last letter Paine ever sent to the printer.The
year passed peacefully away; indeed there is reason to believe that
from the middle of July, 1808, to the end of January, 1809, he fairly
enjoyed existence.During this time he made acquaintance with the worthy
Willett Hicks, watchmaker, who was a Quaker preacher.His conversations
with Willett Hicks--whose cousin, Elias Hicks, became such an
important figure in the Quaker Society twenty years later--were
fruitful.Towards the latter part of
January, 1809, Paine was very feeble.On the 18th he wrote and signed
his Will, in which he reaffirms his theistic faith.On February 1st
the Committee of Claims reported unfavorably on his memorial, while
recording, "That Mr.Paine rendered great and eminent services to the
United States during their struggle for liberty and independence cannot
be doubted by any person acquainted with his labours in the cause, and
attached to the principles of the contest."On February 25th he had some
fever, and a doctor was sent for.Ryder attributed the attack
to Paine's having stopped taking stimulants, and their resumption was
prescribed.About a fortnight later symptoms of dropsy appeared.Towards
the end of April Paine was removed to a house on the spot now occupied
by No.59 Grove Street, Madame Bonneville taking up her abode under
the same roof.The owner was William A. Thompson, once a law partner
of Aaron Burr, whose wife, _nee_ Maria Holdron, was a niece of Elihu
Palmer.The whole of the back part of the house (which was in a lot, no
street being then cut) was given up to Paine.*

     * The topographical facts were investigated by John Randel,
     Jr., Civil Engineer, at the request of David C. Valentine,
     Clerk of the Common Council, New York, his report being
     rendered April 6, 1864."Uncle Randolph, I don't believe this man," he said briefly."The
story he tells is too unnatural.""I think so myself, Dick; but still--"

"Why didn't this man come straight to the house to tell us this?"Randolph Rover put the question to Captain Villaire.The
Frenchman scowled deeply and shrugged his shoulders."I had my
reason," he said briefly.Before Randolph Rover could answer there came a shout from behind
several trees.repeated Dick, when of a sudden a half dozen men rushed
at him and Randolph Rover and surrounded the pair.In a twinkle,
before either could use his pistol, he was hurled flat and made a
prisoner."Bind them, men," ordered Villaire sternly."And bind them well,
so that escape is impossible."yelled, out Dick, before those on top
of him could choke him off.And off he sped at top
speed, with three or four of Captain Villaire's party after him.Cujo also went to the house, bewildered by what was going on and
hardly knowing how to turn.Randolph Rover fought desperately and so did Dick.But the two
were no match for the six men who had attacked them, and ere they
knew it the Rovers were close prisoners, with their hands bound
behind them and each with a dirty gag of grass stuffed in his
mouth."Now march, or you will be shot," came in bad English from one of
the Villaire party.And as there seemed nothing better to do they
marched, wondering why they had been attacked and where they were
to be taken.Their arms had been confiscated, so further
resistance was useless.When Dick lagged behind he received a
cruel blow on the back which nearly sent him headlong.A journey of several hours brought the party to a small clearing
overlooking the Congo at a point where the bank was fully fifty
feet above the surface of the stream.Here, in years gone by, a
rough log hut had been built, which the African International
Association had once used as a fort during a war with the natives.The log hut was in a state of decay, but still fit for use and
almost hidden from view by the dense growth of vines which covered
it.The men who had brought Randolph Rover and Dick hither evidently
knew all about the hut, for they proceeded to make themselves at
home without delay.Taking the Rovers into one of the apartments
of the dilapidated building they tied each to the logs of the
walls, one several yards from the other."Now you must wait until Captain Villaire returns," said the
leader of the party in French."He will tell you what it means," grinned the brigand, and walked
away to another part of the hut, which was built in a long,
rambling fashion, and contained a dozen or more divisions."We are in a pickle," remarked Dick dismally."This is hunting
up father with a vengeance."But I would like to know what this
means.""It probably means robbery, for one thing, Uncle Randolph."If I am not mistaken I saw some of these rascals hanging around
the hotel in Boma."They have been watching their chance
to attack us ever since we left the town."Slowly the hours wore away until morning dawned.The positions of
both Dick and his uncle were most uncomfortable ones, and the
youth was ready to groan aloud at the strain put upon his
shoulders through having his arms tied behind him.At last they heard footsteps approaching from the opposite end of
the rambling building.He had scarcely spoken when Captain Villaire appeared, followed
by--Dan Baxter!CHAPTER XVIII

A DEMAND OF IMPORTANCE


Dick could scarcely believe the evidence of his own eyesight as he
gazed at the former bully of Putnam Hall and the Frenchman who
stood beside him."Well, that's a good one, I must
say."He is in with these rascals who have captured us," came quickly
from Dick."This is how you repay our kindness, Baxter?"Didn't I refuse your
offer, made just before you went away?""But you didn't refuse the first money we gave you, Baxter.""We won't talk about that, Dick
Rover.Do you realize that you are absolutely in my power?"It was not you who captured us, Baxter.""Well, it amounts to the same thing, eh, Capitan Villaire?"and
the big boy turned to the French brigand, who nodded."Ve will not speak of zem udders," broke in Captain Villaire."Did Baxter put up this plot against us?"To be sure I did," answered Baxter, who loved to brag just as
much as ever."And before I let you go I'm going to make you pay up dearly for
all that I have suffered.Captain Villaire, have you had them
searched?""Yees, Baxter, but za had not mooch monish wid zem.""Then they left it behind at Binoto's place," was the quick
answer."Now if those others aren't captured--"

"Hush, ve vill not speak of zat," put in the brigand hastily."Tell zeni what I haf tole you."Dan Baxter turned once more to the
prisoners."Do you know why you were brought here?""To be robbed, I presume," answered Randolph Rover."Or that and worse," said Dick significantly,

"I reckon I have a right to all of your money, Dick Rover.""I don't see how you make that out, Baxter.""Years ago your father robbed mine out of the rights to a rich
gold mine in the United States."I claim, and so did my father,
that the mine was ours."The mine was discovered by my fattier, and if
everything had gone right he would have had the income from it."What do you
intend to do with us?""We intend to make money out of you," was the answer, given with a
rude laugh."First you will have to answer a few questions.""Zat ees it," put in Captain Villaire."How mooch morlish you
bring wid you from America?""We didn't bring much," answered Randolph Rover, who began to
smell a mouse."You leave zat in Boma, wid ze bankers, eh?""But you haf von big lettair of credit, not so?""Yes, we have a letter of credit," answered Randolph Rover."But
that won't do you any good, nor the money at the banker's
neither.""Ve see about zat, monsieur.Proceed," and Captain Villaire waved
his hand toward Dan Baxter."This is the situation in a nutshell, to come right down to
business," said the former bully of Putnam Hall coolly."You are
our prisoners, and you can't get away, no matter how hard you try.Captain Villaire and his men, as well as myself, are in this
affair to make money.The question is, what is your liberty worth
to you?""So you intend to work such a game?""Well, I shan't pay you a cent.""Don't be a fool, Dick Rover."Well, I haven't any money, and that ends it."Then you will have to foot the bill," continued Dan Baxter,
turning to Randolph Rover."If you value your liberty you will pay us what we demand.""We demand twenty thousand dollars--ten thousand for the liberty
of each."This demand nearly took away Randolph Rover's breath.You are worth a good deal more than that, Mr.And
I am demanding only what is fair.""Perhaps you'll sing a different tune in a few, days--after your
stomachs get empty," responded Dan Baxter, with a malicious gleam
in his fishy eyes."So you mean to starve us into acceding to your
demands," said Dick."Baxter, I always did put you down as a
first-class rascal.If you keep, on, you'll be more of a one than
your father."In high rage the former bully of Putnam Hall strode forward and
without warning struck the defenseless Dick a heavy blow on the
cheek."That, for your impudence," he snarled."You keep a civil tongue
in your head.If you don't--"  He finished with a shake of his
fist."You had bettair make up your mind to pay ze monish," said Captain
Villaire, after a painful pause."It will be ze easiest way out
of ze situation for you.""Don't you pay a cent, Uncle Randolph," interrupted Dick quickly.Then Baxter hit him again, such a stinging blow that he almost
lost consciousness."He is tied up, otherwise you
would never have the courage to attack him.Baxter, have you no
spirit of fairness at all in your composition?""Don't preach--I won't listen to it!""You
have got to pay that money.If you don't--well, I don't believe
you'll ever reach America alive, that's all."With these words Dan Baxter withdrew, followed by Captain
Villaire.They value their lives too much to
refuse.Just wait until they have suffered the pangs of hunger
and thirst, and you'll see how they change their tune.""You are certain za have ze monish?"It will only be a question of waiting for
the money after they send for it.""Neither will I--if we are safe here.You don't think anybody
will follow us?""Not unless za find ze way up from ze rivair.Za cannot come here
by land, because of ze swamps," answered the Frenchman."And ze
way from ze rivair shall be well guarded from now on," he added.CHAPTER XIX

WHAT HAPPENED TO TOM AND SAM


Let us return to Tom and Sam, at the time they were left alone at
Binoto's hostelry."I wish we had gone with Dick and Uncle Randolph," said Tom, as he
slipped into his coat and shoes."I don't like this thing at
all.""Oh, don't get scared before you are hurt, Tom!""These people out here may be peculiar, but--"

Sam did not finish.A loud call from the woods had reached his
ears, and in alarm he too began to dress, at the same time
reaching for his pistol and the money belt which Randolph Rover
had left behind."I--I guess something is wrong," he went on, after a pause."If
we--"

"Tom!came from Aleck, and in a
second more the <DW64>, burst on their view."Come, if yo' is
dressed!"And
Aleck almost dragged the boy along.The Rover boys could readily surmise that Aleck would not act in
this highly excited manner unless there was good cause for it.Consequently, as Sam said afterward, "They didn't stand on the
order of their going, but just flew."Pell-mell out of the
hostelry they tumbled, and ran up the highway as rapidly as their
nimble limbs would permit.They heard several men coming after them, and heard the command
"Halt!"yelled after them in both French and bad English.But
they did not halt until a sudden tumble on Tom's part made the
others pause in dismay.groaned the fun-loving Rover, and tried to
stand up."We ain't got no time ter lose!"panted Aleck, who was almost
winded."If we stay here we'll be gobbled up--in no time, dat's
shuah!""Let us try to carry Tom," said Sam, and attempted to lift his
brother up."De trees--let us dun hide in, de trees!"went on the <DW64>,
struck by a certain idea.groaned Tom, and then shut his teeth hard
to keep himself from screaming with pain.Together they carried the suffering youth away from the highway to
where there was a thick jungle of trees and tropical vines.The
vines, made convenient ladders by which to get up into the trees,
and soon Sam and Aleck were up and pulling poor Tom after them."Now we must be still," said Aleck, when they were safe for the
time being."Hear dem a-conun' dis way."The three listened and soon made out the footsteps of the
approaching party."But, oh, Aleck, what does it all mean?""It means dat yo' uncle an' Dick am prisoners--took by a lot of
rascals under a tall, Frenchman.""Yes, but I don't understand--"

"No more do I, Massah Sam, but it war best to git out, dat's as
shuah as yo' is born," added the <DW52> man solemnly.Poor Torn was having a wretched time of it with his ankle, which
hurt as badly as ever and had begun to swell.As he steadied
himself on one of the limbs of the tree Sam removed his shoe,
which gave him a little relief.From a distance came a shouting, and they made out through the
trees the gleam of a torch.But soon the sounds died out and the
light disappeared."One thing is certain, I can't walk just yet," said Tom."When I
put my foot down it's like a thousand needles darting through my
leg.""Let us go below and hunt up some water," said Sam; and after
waiting a while longer they descended into the small brush.Aleck
soon found a pool not far distant, and to this they carried Tom,
and after all had had a drink, the swollen ankle was bathed, much
to the sufferer's relief.As soon as the sun was
up Aleck announced that he was going back to the hostelry to see
how the land lay."But don't expose yourself," said Tom."I am certain now that is
a regular robbers' resort, or worse."Aleck was gone the best part of three hours.When he returned he
was accompanied by Cujo.The latter announced that all of the
other natives had fled for parts unknown."The inn is deserted," announced Aleck.Even that <DW52> wife of
the proprietor is gone."And did you find any trace of Dick and my uncle?""We found out where dat struggle took place,"
